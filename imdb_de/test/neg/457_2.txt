A bad second-string movie by Universal Pictures about a mom-and-pop movie actor doing criminal investigative work for the military and fending off the push of the brazen young woman he assigned to romance. Robert Montgomery has directed and starred in this adaptation of the short story "Come Be My Love," and his acting achievements of that era are uncomfortably lazy. The plot is sappy, predictable stuff, and author Robert Carson (as usual with movies of that time) has given all the really funny lines to the wild black girl. It's always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl in support, but they can not do much with this hokey material. * from ****
