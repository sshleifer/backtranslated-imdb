I can not say if "The Cavern" is a rip off of "The Cave" because I did not see that. I've seen "The Descent" and that's not so bad, but it's very hard to watch and so it is. Difficult to observe as there is very little light and plenty of time lapse, so you can barely say what you are seeing. There are times when I think you should be scared when you judge the music, but what are you afraid of? Bad camera work? Bad light? If so, this should be the scariest movie. The story is that a few speleologists go to a cave in Kazakhstan (home of Borat) and make their descent, but of course there is something here. And what is that? One says it's a Wolf / Bear hybrid just before it's torn apart, but whatever it is, you can not see it. And just when you think (or hope) that the movie is going to end, as the screen goes dark for a while, you see the two remaining speleologists (the two women), who are dressed somewhere in Betty and Wilma, trying theirs To find a way from wherever they are. They drink some water and begin to eat until they find out what it is and begin to puke ... and then the mystery of what is in the cave appears and you will be amazed. Maybe, maybe not. Stupid, stupid, stupid ... I think I'm pretty good at caving films at this point, 2 out of 10.
