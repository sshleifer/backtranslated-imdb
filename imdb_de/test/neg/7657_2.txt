This movie has more stupidities than any other movie I've seen in my life. The special effects are damn terrible. In the end, when the Concorde falls after the cargo door is torn off, the thing turns like a toy. The special effects of Airport (1970) are much better than this crap. In addition, the power of a Concorde, which opens in height and speed, would essentially turn things around. (That is, if it opens at all at all) But the movie has its good sides. Mostly when it ends. This is also cheesy. For example, The thing lands on a loose snowy shore. If that were the case, it would splinter into millions of pieces. Overall 2 out of 10 points. Immediate flop. Great laugh movie.
