I was wondering when someone would try to turn the entire Matamoros mess into a Goreporn photo. Anyway, here I learned a few things about Mexico when I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> ~ All Mexican women are super hot - Do you remember this little desert town in Unearthed? Yes, that must be the Mexican sister city. Do not bother about the hookers, but give the hot bartender a few gentle moves. She will be as hot as the prostitutes and probably has no children! <br /> <br /> ~ Half of Mexico is controlled by insane, Satan-worshiped Palo Mayombe cultists. Yes, Caramba! As everyone here in the US knows, the other half is run by drug dealers. Fortunately, this does not bother sex-tourism trading and our extremely low-wage factories there. <br /> <br /> ~ Mexican policemen are useless. Do not go to them Go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot chick behind the counter what happened to your missing friend. She is much more than the police. <br /> <br /> ~ If cruelly tortured by the bloodthirsty cultists mentioned above, you're not really reciting the psalms or any part of the Bible. You just mess up the mojo.
