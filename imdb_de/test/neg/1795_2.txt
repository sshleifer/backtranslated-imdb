Heart of Darkness, a short novel written by Joseph Conrad on Greed, Corruption and Traveling Through Africa, was a boring read to say the least. The narrator follows Marlow, a sailor who travels to the depths of Africa to rescue Kurtz, a prodigy who was an Ivory dealer who had allegedly gone insane. This conclusion came when the Ivory stopped coming to the main port. The basis of the story is that Conrad writes the environment lavishly, he sets the scene wonderful, but maybe a bit too extensive. The story seemed more like a watercolor painting, as if it was the slow-moving, mild action story that Conrad might want to swerve. It may happen that after reading a book, the feature may be viewed. Film might help to give some thoughts to those in the book, or vice versa. Not so with Heart of Darkness, although the lead actor John Malkovich played a supporting role, the movie only confused me more, there did not seem to be any real main characters in the film, no one stood apart from the others except for the full-fledged symbolism. It was pretty boring and grumpy, to say the least. <br /> <br /> In terms of the author, The Heart of Darkness is a true short masterpiece. It touches on some very strict themes, the lies of Marlow and the greed of Kurtz. It is not a book that is taken lightly and will put you in a rather gloomy mood. A book like this is too heavy for many people. However, I would recommend this book to those who want a sad pseudo-action story without a happy end to a textbook.
