4 Academy Award Winners, Karl Malden, Sally Field, Shirley Jones, Michael Caine. Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour and 54 minutes of pure boredom, melodrama and terrible drama, a jumble of script and a sinking feeling of GOD LORD, WHAT WERE YOU ?, Irwin Allen thought of the original classic disaster movie's popularity with a Grade D minus script, was the Obviously, the actors are only there for the paycheck, ... the horror, the horror! <br /> <br /> How crazy are the characters Caine, Savalas, Malden and Field playing? Go into a potentially deadly sinking ship that is 1. on fire 2. Hot from steam 3. Smooth water and oil, 4. Boilers exploding every 5 minutes, all for the love of money? Greed? 5. You have very little equipment, not even a pair of gloves or work boots in sight, even less a hook, a rope, etc. <br /> <br /> Stupidity! <br /> <br /> What was there? they think? <br /> <br /> Peter Boyle played so much that I just wanted to beat him! Stop it! And what is the deal with the bad toupee? One can not believe that his character was a veteran of the Second World War. Caine, Field and Malden find everything they need to do with gold and money, and they're happy - whoopee! Goods rich! (We do not live to spend it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And yes, it's the great character actor Slim Pickens! <br /> <br /> Survivors galore! Jack Warden and Shirley Knight too! <br /> <br /> The last dramatic negotiation on this fearsome plutonium had never really gone anywhere, it's as if they were forgotten, somehow? Many holes in the script. <br /> <br /> This film has a condition that can not cure the strongest pill. I am surprised that Alan J. Smithee's name was not in the script. I would be embarrassed to have written this one! Oh, the madness, Oh, humanity! Oy Vey! <br /> <br /> The horror, the horror! <br /> <br /> It's like a bad two-hour TV movie. <br /> <br /> At least the sets were made from recycled material material from the first movie. <br /> <br /> The script had to be on the compost heap ...
