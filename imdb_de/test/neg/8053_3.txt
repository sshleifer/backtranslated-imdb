Director Todd Verow's unexpected turn into a sentimental coming-out drama leads to a predictable outcome: Nothing new to see here. Attractive but Unconvincing Evidence - These 20-Year-Olds Should Be in High School? - The disappearance of banalities for confused, youthful sexuality does not seem to me the best way to explore the promise of Anonymous, which was equally self-responsible, but also honest, raw, and not so maudlin by comparison. I have no idea what to make of this shabby and uninspired film, except to hope that Verow finds another career. Sure, it's unpretentious, but so is Mike Huckabee. <br /> <br /> However, not a single attribute is as dreadful as Jim Dwyer's chintzy, electronic score that continuously rubs wall to wall for the entire length of this movie. If I had seen that and heard it in a theater, I would have gone out. Luckily I was able to scrub and mute on my laptop.
