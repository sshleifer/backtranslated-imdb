That this movie was pinned to the wall of a chapel as proof that God is really dead. Am I the only one who really saw this "movie"? This is the only movie I have ever seen in the theater, and I regret that I did not reclaim my money and reclaim it - it was just so boring. I even saw "Highlander 2: The Quickening" at the local cinema. From beginning to end, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry as two improbabilities that are thrown together by circumstances and ultimately work together as best friends. The action (which is little there) is stupid and as boring as the writer's skull. Thank the goddess who insults us while observing our "movie theater" that "Air America 2" has no chance.
