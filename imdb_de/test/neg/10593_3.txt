I was not old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew that everyone thought it was cool. I have some of the "books" written based on the series in my Screen-to-Print collection, and they're pretty light, so I did not expect much from the movie. That's good, because this movie was bad on a long leash. <br /> <br /> I admire the risk of creating a movie that is so completely in tune with the hit of the 1960s. The film audience, however, has evolved over 30 years. At least that's what I believe. I'm certainly expecting just over an hour and a half of the original Mod Squad concept, with (now old) car chases, (now considered bad) camera work, (low-sounding) soundtrack and (bad) script and all that big is screen. In the 1960s, we did not care so much because we had minimal expectations. An integrated police team of young people wearing suits other than suits was enough. It was that, another exciting episode of "Ironsides" or "Password." <br /> <br /> If you rate this "episode" against the usual theatrical releases, the story was ... well, I'm not sure if I should do that at all, because I'm not sure if there was one. Drugs are bad? What ever. The script was stupid. If the characters exchange dialogues and the plot has lines like "I overheard, as he says on the phone" and "I think I've got a plan," we're really having trouble. No wonder the acting was terrible: no one knew how to pronounce such idiotic lines. <br /> <br /> If I were Claire Danes, I would now go after my agent with a flamethrower. (Actually, I think everyone watching the movie has a right to retribution.) And where was the mod in this squad? I notice that these kids just came from the youth area, but nobody had a velvet suit? "Mod" meant only young and integrated? What happened to white go-go boots? Maybe the costume department was a bit coarse, but all they got was dirty and grubby. <br /> <br /> Since the film was completely faithful to the original series, the actors, cameramen, stuntmen required special behavior. etc. we should appreciate it more. Unfortunately I still do not like it. If I wanted to see the crime drama of the 60s, I would buy DVDs. No thanks.
