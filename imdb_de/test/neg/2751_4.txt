I've read a lot of reviews about the IMDb (well, all five of those written at the time I write this) and I'm surprised at the amount of praise piled up on The Brideless Groom is undoubtedly one of the smaller ones Comedies of the Stooges. I prefer the older ones being Larry, Curly, and Moe, though Shemp is far superior to Brideless Groom for most of the fun scenes in Sing a Song of Six Pants, another Stooges shorts that is moderately amusing , Deserves recognition. In fact, there is one single, somewhat amusing scene in the film, the "Don't-Hit-A-Lady" scene, which is hardly amusing and is 15 minutes before the movie. In a 17-minute comedy not very promising. <br /> <br /> Shemp is a language trainer whose uncle has passed away and left him a legacy of $ 500,000, assuming he marries within 48 hours, which is short enough, but as Shemp learns of it he only 7 hours left. This is a premise that was made and repeated before, but at the time the movie was made, it was not a huge stereotype. There are a number of gags throughout the film, none of which even approaches the level of comedy that the Three Stooges are so familiar with. It seems that the Stooges have come into the same problems that plagued so many Shirley Temple films? There is too little faith in the content and too much trust just to be there. <br /> <br /> The standard features of the Stooges are here, Moe is the mean, whose vulgarity is certainly not being used sparingly in this movie, and the slapstick sound effects (though with more exceptions than usual) are quite amusing, but will plugged into their standard slots in this movie. The line "Hold hands, you love birds" is immortal. The rest of the movie is not. <br /> <br /> Among the other people who rated this movie for this site, there is a lot of talk about this being one of the best Stooges shorts you will not find. A faint moment about it like this best since the early 1930's. It's just not true. I certainly can understand a degree of automatic respect for milestone classics and the giants of early comedy, which the Three Stooges are undoubtedly, but that respect is damaged when worse films are praised more than they should. The Brideless Groom deserves respect because it's a Stooges movie, but for exactly the same reason it should have been better. The Three Stooges were just better.
