I have read a lot of Jane Austen in my time and I agree with several movie / TV adaptations, but we just do not need them here. <br /> <br /> Rating is a 2 because I would not say it's awful. So boring you'll feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life. Stupid script that is matched by even duller acting. I heard that Billie Piper was with Dr. OK is fine. Who (no fan can not confirm that), but in this case she is stupid. There is absolutely no chemistry between the pipes. This is Austen, it should be a romance! <br /> <br /> Please do not be put off by Austen or historical dramas. There are many better programs to watch.
