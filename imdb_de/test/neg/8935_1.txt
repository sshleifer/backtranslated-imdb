At the Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, the two good moods must show that the Lucky Ducks cheerleading team needs to get in touch with The Demons' "tough" evil cheerleading team to beat the insidious Falcon team that has always been at this camp seems to win, I think. This is a typical clich√© sex comedy of the 80s that you will win? But what the film lacks in originality is more than made up for by bloody horrors. Oh and awesome bad dance numbers and the obligatory Japanese businessmen who want to buy the camp (on the condition that the male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, of course stays at the camp). Simply terrible, unforgettable and unfortunately has a surprising lack of nudity. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: HBO-Comedy <br /> <br /> My degree: F (yup I actually gave them)
