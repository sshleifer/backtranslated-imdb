"Clubbed" is yet another "Will-this-do?" Entering the British fistfighting genre will surely entertain players who do not expect to entertain too moderately for ninety minutes after a few beers. However, for anyone looking for intelligent, high-quality entertainment, this is best avoided. <br /> <br /> The frightening script contains so much misstatement that even an actor of the caliber of Colin Salmon remains stupid. The action takes place in the '80s, but it's never clear why, especially if they did not make a compelling impression in this decade - it takes more than a few soul plates of the' 80s on the soundtrack, the occasional zoot suit and a handful 30-year-old cars. Then we see key characters studying Sun Tzu's lyrics like "The Art Of War" and talking about how violence should be used as a last resort, while the same characters are just too willing to start with all the testosterone impulses of one Heap of chavs fighting for a bag of chips. <br /> <br /> Character development does not exist in "Clubbed". Irony, subtlety or pathos either. This is a movie reminiscent of Guy Richie's early gangster films, which despite their shortcomings, certainly had a lot more joke, better cuts, snappier dialogues and more emotional pressure than this slack little saga. You're already a decade old anyway - is not it time we mimick her?
