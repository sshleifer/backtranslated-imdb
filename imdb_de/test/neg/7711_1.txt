I'll keep it on bullet points, so it goes here: 1. Very poorly written. 2. Try to be like Resident Evil. 3. Zombies are slow and docile one minute the next minute. Raging madman. 4. Never saw blood so easy to clean up! 5. Special effects not as good as the original "Day of the Living Dead". 6. Not as good as the "brave and beautiful". 7. It looks like it was written in a week and created the next week. <br /> <br /> The Basicaly Med Team plus Special Forces go to a zombie-displaced university to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague. All die with the exception of the two major stars, which are so predictable, although they are unarmed and are flooded with hundreds of zombies that survived them. Special forces (trained on scouts at the kindergarten school), however, only brought one zombie to kill them, even though they had weapons. Also the obligatory jerk at hand to fill in gaps. Total amount of garbage.
