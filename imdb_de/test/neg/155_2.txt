I'm still waiting for Peter Fonda to start acting. For someone who comes from such a talented family, it's a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play someone else. And that's the good news in this disappointing dog of The Tempest. A series of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship to the Bard's great play is what we are served with. The scene is the Civil War, and Prospero's (here Guideon's) bad brother looks like a melodrama rogue from the 1890s, complete with Snidely Whiplash's mustache. I always waited for him to go "Uh ha hah!" That would have been a highlight in this bleak presentation. None of the supporting performers was memorable, and Peter Fonda's lack of expressiveness and woodwork kept the lackadaisical story going on and on. <br /> <br /> The Tempest is the bard's statement about the rage of man's unfair treatment of man. The only believable character was the Gator man, the Caliban counterpart. The transfer to the swamp had opportunities, but the civil war just could not make it. All in all a very disappointing production. I've seen it on video and would advise you if you want to have a Willy Shakespeare fix, save your money. Rent something else like Branagh's Much Ado with Nothing or Kevin Kline in Midsummer's Night Dream.
