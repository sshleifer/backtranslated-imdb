Some huge scorpions are on a submarine and kill everyone. Two months later, some Marines and the Scorpion Project scientists go to the submarine to pick up their cargo. After finding 200 bodies, the naval commander tells the doctor, "I need to know if there's anything down here that could pose a threat to my men." Um, well ... do you think? She refuses to tell him what is down there with the note "Must know". Yes, that fits pretty well. One of the scientists seems to be a kind of idiot savant - really hard for the idiot, light for the savant. His job is to fix the lights. He finds the control panel for the lights, cuts a wire and screams like a banshee. Then he does it again. Then he picks up a hammer and shatters the control panel, causing all lights on the submarine to start working. <br /> <br /> And so it goes. Apparently this was done in Sweden; I am not sure if the Swedes have a really funny sense of humor or if they are really horrible filmmakers. I tend to think that they are terrible filmmakers. If you suspect there is a huge explosion at the end of this, well, I'm sorry, but that's a necessity I need to know, so I can not tell you. <br /> <br /> If you know I've absolutely seen a huge scorpion movie. Let me suggest Tail Sting, a kitschy and funny movie about scorpions in an airplane, or bugs, a pretty declining B-movie about scorpions in a tunnel. Consider this movie as an absolute last resort. Oh, it's visible, it's hard to turn it out of sheer madness, but that's all it's about.
