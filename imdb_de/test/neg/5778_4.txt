(There are spoilers) A common Slasher movie where the story in and around this godforsaken mine plays in front of the almost deserted city of Sutterille. After receiving a letter card and a gold nugget from her brother Jared, Shadrach Smith, Clair and her husband Nick Breman, Carrie Bradac and Sean Hines, they drove along with four other friends and gold seekers Alx & Tori, Steve Wastell & amp; Sangie and Hayden & Rox Ann, Rick Majeske & Elina to claim their claim. <br /> <br /> Later, it turns out that the fact that Jared disturbed the long-forgotten gold mine brings to life the spirit of the infamous Jeremiah Stone, Vernon Wells, reviving his reign of terror. Stone or 49er is about the most ridiculous slasher / killer in movie history. Stone looks like he's been buried under a ton of coal for years with this hook that cuts people in half. Aunt Nelly (Karen Black), whose daughter Eve (Alexandra Ford) was also one of the victims of Stone, tells the still living natives Aunt Nelly (Karen Black) that the crazy miners, when they bring the gold back to the Stone Mine to do this will never rest until he kills all who still have him. <br /> <br /> Aunt Nelly has just enough time to tell her story before she turns Stone into a human torch and jumps into a nearby creek. The movie goes on and on. The Rampage miner looks like he's about as scary as burnt toast and just as dark. Even those in the movie did not seem to be really scared of him. In a scene in which he had broken into Aunt Nelly's house, all attacked instead of running away, and let the ghost miner lose his right arm. Stone spent the rest of the film on his "stump" with a miner's pick. <br /> <br /> In addition to actress Karen Black, the movie "Miners Massacre" also features veteran actors John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch as Sheriff Murphy and Old Man Prichard. Passable stuff, but nothing special, the film has a predictable ending, as the entire gold mine will go up in flames. The audience was given an indication by the creators of "Miners Massacre" that the end of this insane madness is nowhere in sight and will very likely resurface in a possible sequence in the near future. God help us all!
