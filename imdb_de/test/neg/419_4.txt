I saw this movie tonight and tried to stay open-minded. I was hoping to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book. There were considerable differences from the book, similar to the changes in the DiVinci Code. I visited the DiVinci code with the same train of thought and was able to enjoy the movie despite the changes from the book. It was still enjoyable and full of action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level. Throughout the film, symbols are quickly found and found without the viewer being interested. They blow so fast past the various Immuminati symbols that we did not have a chance to look at them and appreciate how they work. The last Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative in the book, was replaced by the crossed key symbol. In my opinion, this was a missed opportunity to focus on the symbols and spend a little more time, and that's what Langdon is all about. Overall, this film is a very poor interpretation of the book and fails when trying to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10
