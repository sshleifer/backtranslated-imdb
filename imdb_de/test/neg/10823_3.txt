I borrowed this movie because of the cover and title of Blockbust! Sound fascinating !! This film suffered from writing, he needed more tension. The "monsters" needed more time for the face. We needed them to have a special power and definitely more "Oh Sh--" moments. Photography did not bother me, except for the scene where a pause for breath breaks out. There were too many close-ups. Besides, the movie seemed to be pulling and the heroes were not really working for their freedom. All in all, I would say that everyone, even the authors, has invested a lot of time. But this movie is definitely a below average rent. <br /> <br /> There are definitely better picks. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 about this selection.
