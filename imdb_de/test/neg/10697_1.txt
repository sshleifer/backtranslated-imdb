This piece of crap is actually the BOMB, as in Bottom of the Barrel. I can not figure out what's worst. Norris' boring portrayal of anonymity (not a big feature on an action protagonist) or Christopher Neame's hysterical overacting. This film does not provide anything at all. The action sequences are tame, the plot is as thin as paper and the scenes that are supposed to be horrible seem like a clich√© from the fifties. You can not just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber clothes and expect the audience to scream in fear. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie does not do anything for me. It actually looks like an unfortunate mix of a cheap porn movie and a Miami Vice rip-off with a little hell-spawning. No wait. That would have to scream like hell.
