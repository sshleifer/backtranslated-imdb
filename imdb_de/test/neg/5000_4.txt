Zombie movies are hot, I love them. I just can not get enough. Why I would buy a movie of this caliber is unexplained, I just love zombies. Surprise, that's really not a big zombie movie; Low budget that I can handle, just irritates me. <br /> <br /> A group of horror film clich√©s stick in a warehouse / lab / who knows what to escape from a firestorm outside. Panic, shouting, low-light and (eventually) zombies are the result. <br /> <br /> I feel kind of bad for the filmmakers because it's obvious they really thought they were putting together something good; a serious, scary horror movie. It's not far from it, it's a boring jumble of wooden games, gaudy FX, low light, excessive dialogue, and excessive editing. <br /> <br /> Things just go awry when it takes a good 10 minutes for the characters to ever sit down and find out what's going on. It gets worse when another 20 minutes pass and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what's going on. All of this is littered with non-theatrical action and bad dialogues. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone is attached (not a zombie) and hope flickers just a touch before the characters whine again (the only emotion everyone generates) about how much it bugs. Me too guys, me too. <br /> <br /> Zombies are finally in the mix, but no one cares anymore. I think there was some blood and blood in the blood, but I was too busy to pray so the credits would not be noticed. And when the screen finally went black, I felt even more cheated by the senseless end of the 'Cube' inspired ending. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that I have made a great effort, even if it failed miserably. That and the punk chick was very hot when it was not used at all. <br /> <br /> Can not really recommend it to anyone, except for movie students looking for "no-no" pointers. <br /> <br /> 4/10
