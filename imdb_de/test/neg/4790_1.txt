Aside from Cop Rock and the show where the child dies because he ate a rotten hamburger he found under the bed, this was always the worst and dumbest show that survived the main time. Without the unjustifiable film success of Jason Lee, this show would never have been out of concept if it had played with a relatively unknown lead role. <br /> <br /> The concept is terrible. Moron redneck hick spends his lottery winnings to save himself with the white trash of his past. Is that funny? periodic, but not consistent. Is that stupid? Every single episode. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of great shows that were released before their time, but this mistake has lasted longer than I could have imagined. The dialogue is incredibly listless, as are the episodic themes. Every episode for someone with an IQ over 100 is an absolute fight. And the icing on the cake? Jason Lee's annoying voice telling each episode. If there were not the southern culture of the state and the rednecks of the south, this show would have no audience. <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot and need a show that's not humorous and yet overcrowded, tastes, bad dialogue and fools fail ... well then you're probably an actor on this show.
