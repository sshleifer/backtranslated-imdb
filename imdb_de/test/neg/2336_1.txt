How does David Lynch do that? Unlike the legions of black-frame glasses and handsome movie critics who praise his name, I just do not see how this guy is paid to make such a trip. How can Lynch sloppily combine the leftover footage of a failed TV pilot into a nonsensical, ill-functioning mess and make critics rave about it and actually put him on the Best Year lists? <br /> <br /> I am amazed. If you are looking for a good movie Noir, rent "Bound" instead. If you are looking for a good "puzzle" movie, try "Memento". But beware of this over-hyped stinker, unless your idea of ​​a fun night throws away 2 1/2 hours of your life and $ 3.50 of your hard-earned cash.
