No wonder many of us hate classical music. and what should the children think? With "educational" PR like this, serious music will soon be advised by the life coach in the morgue. Kids know when to talk to them, and this is no exception. Why can not you make a good movie about classical music for kids? I have to admit, I really enjoyed the actor who played Beethoven. He accepted the role with enthusiasm and a sharp balance of poignant and humorous aspects of Beethoven's character; he has obviously researched. Otherwise, it's a third installment of the old ABC Afterschool Special format, without the occasional charm of these short films. I'm sorry about the gossip, but this is an important topic young people should know about, and it could have been done well. I wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible? Either way, the kids are hipper than you think, folks ... <br /> <br /> Medtner
