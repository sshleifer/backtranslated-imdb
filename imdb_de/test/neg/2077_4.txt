Carmen is a prostitute who lives and seduced and stole soldiers of the Spanish army. She is without a doubt the best femme fatale at the moment. When a man resists her charming attention, she decides to do anything to destroy him. In the end he falls into her net and he will be forced to do all the things he has ever hated just because he is with Carmen. Although Paz Vega is very beautiful, she does not seem to be a Gypsy (like Carmen) and neither her acting nor Sbaraglias are good. The story is very boring and in most moments she is very absurd, while she intends to act sincerely. In the same way are the scenarios and the special effects, although they are not, but they are unacceptable and too artificial for a historical film. In summary, boring and bad, with a very absurd development, there is much better to observe.
