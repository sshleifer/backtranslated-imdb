I do not understand why you would give this movie anything over 4 ... Well enough, I'm coming back to the '80s and to the "good old days of the horror comedy," but this genre has not improved since then, still so' LAME Low budget - low tech - bad drama - bad story - not scary at all and not funny enough ... in fact, there is not much that I could say about it. The so-called monsters are just terribly bad! I mean, we went back in time when they made the monsters out of plasticine and made the scenes with the frame famous ... I really do not understand why someone invests money to turn that script into a movie - but I think it would have been almost OK if it had been a bigger budget movie. <br /> <br /> Recommendation would be - please do not make the mistake of wasting your time with it, unless you want to get tips on making a bad Halloween Make Up! Personally, I enjoy independent films and everything outside the box, but that just did not happen to me.
