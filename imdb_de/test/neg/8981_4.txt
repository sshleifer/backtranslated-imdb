This is due to the conspiracy of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Although he is quite mature, it is partly the story of a wealthy boy shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo ship, becoming a man. Moran of the title is a young woman who grew up on a ship owned by her father. When the cargo burns, she and crew members are evacuated to our boy's ship. The captain, however, has smuggling in his head and his intentions are not honorable with regard to Moran. The inevitable follows - our lad falls in love with the manly Moran and she falls in love with him. In the end, the evil is defeated and the lovers united. Some interesting dialogues indicate that Moran belongs to no man - "and no woman". (An allusion to Sappho here). Dorothy Dalton is appropriately sexless and not too attractive as a Moran. Valentino is doing well in a romantic action role. His sexy physique and sexy physique are beneficial, and the role is pretty masculine. He is very attractive. This is not a great movie, but time flies. What it really shows is Valentino's beauty and sexiness.
