Convinced of the 7.0 points in IMDb, which is pretty good, I decided to watch this movie. However, I found this movie pretty boring (about 2 hours) and full of clichés. A little girl who gets many different personalities after a childhood trauma. Tamer KAradagli is pretty funny in this movie, dialogues, movements, etc., you have to see it, he's kind of the tough cop that you see in American movies, maybe too much copied. I would call this movie a common American thriller with a bit of Turkish touch. Unfortunately, once again I am convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth seeing in clichés in Turkish cinema
