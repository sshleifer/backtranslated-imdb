I bought this movie one day for a few dollars in a "warehouse sale" when I just looked around. The cover looked pretty good (in color), but the movie is B & W (I wish they would not try to catch us with colored covers for B & W movies, but it's a common thing to look at must pay attention!). <Br /> <br /> When I saw it, I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out to be better than I expected. I was disappointed that it was a B & W, but the effects are pretty good, certainly better than about "Invaders from Mars," which has shitty effects, and it's great to see John Banner in something other than Hogan's Heroes. All in all, this film is not too bad for a B-grade and is undoubtedly worth the two dollars from a nostalgic point of view. It's not my favorite sci-fi, but it's not my worst. It's okay.
