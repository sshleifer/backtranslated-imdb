I have to admit that among the many thriller movies I've seen, this has to be one of the worst. I was shocked to find out that this work had a budget of $ 1.5 million. When it started, I thought the opening sequence was pretty good, pretty normal for this type of movie, but still pretty good. As the film progressed, however, I felt uncomfortable with the lack of tempo that I saw. Each sequence seemed to take hours. The reason might be that the movie has bored me to tears now, except for the endless accusations peppered with confusing flashbacks and occasionally bad temper. Now, after moving through the lifelong sense of these scenes, we finally reached the grand finale ... an all-singing, all-dancing demonstration of how a lack of imagination can completely ruin a good movie. <BR>> Overall, I found this movie predictable and boring, and I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than the ones I personally dislike, but if you have a few hours and want to see a thriller, that is That does not scare the case even remotely, this is the movie for you.
