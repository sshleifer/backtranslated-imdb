If you want to see someone who inadvertently eats another man's testicles, or watch a bunch of falsely spurious hard-ons at a wedding, or hear a man listen to how good it feels to have sex with a girl, that's it the movie for you. Tomcats changes, in a breakneck way, between romantic and eccentric comedy. The lovely Jaime Pressly plays the wife of Horatio Sanz (tell me another one), which in many situations is outlined with other women, but surprisingly there is no nudity. Jake Busey is outrageously outraged as a hound you do not want as a friend. Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell are both good at making a compelling pair, but the movie is too busy finding disgust to be good.
