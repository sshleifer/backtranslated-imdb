I have to say, Krasinski is the only reason why I've ever seen this movie. He is good. Everything else about this movie, however, is so far below average that it's not worth the time and effort to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of technical / aesthetic issues: namely the selection of images, the framing, camera movements within monologue sequences, extremely poor editing (probably due to the complete lack of fluidity in and between the recordings) and horrible drama (except for Krasinski) and presentation) to create an exciting moment in this movie ... which is surprising, because it's about a bank robbery that should be at least a little bit exciting. <br /> <br /> How does a movie work so bad? made, then published and then distributed? <br /> <br /> Reminds me somehow of a C-movie student project, probably not so good.
