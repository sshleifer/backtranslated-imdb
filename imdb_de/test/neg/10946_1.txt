This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen in my life! I waste my time with it. I completely saw this movie when I accepted a punishment for myself. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie. it has no continuity. It feels like he just shoots scenes and then join in an editing software !!! Of course, music is good, but the movie does not need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks spotty and I wonder what role Celina Jaietly plays in the movie? Bobby Deol is good. At least he can act! Upen Patel has to take acting classes in some scenes instead of taking off his shirts! The end was the most miserable! <br /> <br /> I saw Shakalaka Boom Boom after watching "300" (the movie). You can really imagine what I felt about this Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect Bollywood, but please directors and producers, become real, not everything is fantasy!
