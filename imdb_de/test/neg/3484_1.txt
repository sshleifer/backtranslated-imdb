One of the worse surf movies I've ever seen. This movie is so bad that I do not know where to start- Okay, let's start with the premise. A guy from the mainland, who barely knows how to surf, travels to Hawaii and participates in a big wave contest, which he more or less expects to win. A good analogy for those who are not surfing is that of a heavily overweight chain smoker who knocks on a pair of running shoes and enters the LA Marathon with expectations of a win. Under no circumstance! The contest takes place at The North Shore, which conjures up images of more than 15 feet of waves, but on the day of the contest, the waves may be 6 feet tall. The acting? What to do If you need to watch this stuff on TV, do not waste your money by renting it. If you want to see a pretty good surf movie - assuming it's flawed, but that's another story - rent the Big Wednesday.
