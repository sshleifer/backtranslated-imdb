No bad services. Whoopi plays the wise / warm role pretty well. However, the plot and the situations can not be believed (forced stereotypes of the PC). Sometimes they are good Jews and blacks against the evil white Christians (ho-hum). A typical Hollywood fantasy. The movie has its moments, but I would not recommend keeping your eyes open.
