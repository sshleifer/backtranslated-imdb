This film is really bad, there is nothing appealing or valuable comment than the beautiful settings: the Chilean landscape. I know, I have to give four lines as a comment for this movie, but the thing is that it's such a bad movie that all I can say is that it's really bad. Michael Ironside is the only one who saves the money in the movie.
