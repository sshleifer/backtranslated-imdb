Dead Man's Bounty (the American title of the film) has the look and feel of a classic Italian western. The cinematography, costumes and sets look great. The cast is robust and not a pretty face. In the beginning I was preparing for a pretty cool movie, but what I finally witnessed was an absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The script was absolutely awful. There was no tension and very little action or a worthwhile drama. Despite the good looks, the cast (English) spoke with strong European accents, which were often incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The final nail in his coffin was the broad stripe of pretentiousness that makes up most of the image and focuses heavily on the character of the barmaid who appears in some very clumsy sex scenes. Also her speech towards the end was pretty detestable! <br /> <br /> The only innovation comes from the stunt casting of Val Kilmer in the role of the dead who continues his recent DOA appearances!
