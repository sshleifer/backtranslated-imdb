We have all seen bad movies. Well, this one takes the cake. I've seen Junior's movie box often fade from my many trips to the horror department of the local video store, and I was a little bit interested. It looks like it's going to be a tribute to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I'd understand it Mistake! Junior sucks hard, long and with commitment. In other words, it's really bad. Although it wins my award for the most creative use of a bikini top. AVOID!!
