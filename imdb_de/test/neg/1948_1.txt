It's just for a movie that's trying to be exciting, just to be uninteresting. This happens quite often. Dark Harbor is not only uninteresting, but also very bad. Scene after scene is tied to an otherwise exaggerated premise. A restless couple picks up a troubled stranger just to find more trouble. <br /> <br /> Some films are building up suspense by building the story. Dark Harbor adds more and more to its history but never builds on it. I had hoped that the tension would finally explode like other films. It never does. The characters also have no continuity from scene to scene. They can behave like that in one scene, but in a different scene they can behave completely differently. At first you think that they are just out of character, but in the end you realize that they are not characters at all. They are just props for the last twist. The last ten minutes are shocking. Instead, it is rather lame and uninteresting. The only thing that shocked me was that the movie was finally coming to an end. In less than ninety minutes, the movie still feels way too long. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those low budget gems. It's more like a fake clock that breaks as soon as you take it home.
