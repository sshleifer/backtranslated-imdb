Is it possible that a movie is getting worse? There are a lot of monkeys that frolic, mumble, pretend to be stupid and laugh? There is no action here to keep you going. Even when the women finally turn up, there is no sign of improvement. The most anticipated things happen and when the movie is over, you may not be asleep yet. Attention: This is not a trashy cult movie, it's garbage time! I can not believe that there is even a sequel to it! <br /> <br /> 1
