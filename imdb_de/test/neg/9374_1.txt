After a few good OK action films like Lek and Van God Los Gerrard Verhage wants to make a film about the life of a Dutch gangster. Well, gangster is a big word for Klaas Bruinsma. He's not really an international guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He is just an Amsterdam lowlife who has made some money selling softdrugs. Things are often blown up in the Netherlands, and this movie is just another example. But even then, the movie could be very nice if the story were told in order. Now there are big leaps in the time: one day KLaas is just an ordinary drug boy, and on the next shot he seems to be a big player in the drug scene. Nobody knows how it works (except for those who read the book). Acting is really bad, the non-Dutch film observers see one of the worst actresses in the Netherlands: Chantal Janzen. If you think she is finally undressing, you will see a stall in the model. So: bad acting + bad assembly + bitch story = De Dominee. <br /> <br /> Please do not look at it, even if other people say it's good because it's not. I warned you.
