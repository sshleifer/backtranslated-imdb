Wow, where should I start? Well, if you enjoy laughing at the filmmakers' complete mistakes, then this one is here for you. I bought this movie for $ 5 because I never missed the opportunity to laugh at B-Movie God Casper Van Dien's mistakes and this boy was one of them. It may have sufficed that this film contains the only, lameest movie monster of all time. This thing that is supposed to be an Indian ghost looks more like a plastic skeleton made of plastic bowls that you attach to the porch on Halloween. He puts on a cloak, which is clearly a garbage bag, with a seemingly bucket-shaped cap over his head. In some places this is a man in costume, on others it is clearly a plastic support that is placed on a horse. This monster has the uncanny ability to spot "predator," a clear rip off, and may miraculously appear after casting its spear. Sometimes the spear cuts people, sometimes not. This thing also succeeds in shooting down a helicopter with a single arrow. Wow, that makes a lot of sense, as if the child blows up a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of Critters. This creature is insensitive to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the movie. At the end of his murder rush we never really figure out why he is running, he gets blown up. This is an incredible achievement, as we had blown this thing up three times in the movie. But I think the last time was the charm. <br /> <br /> And do not even let me start with the lameness of the other characters. First of all, which Delta Force unit employs women? Most recently, I've verified that the military still bans women in combat situations. This unit is also "hidden". Why? What possible reason should they be obscured? And they're not even good at it, I think nobody would realize it was a military if they did not have uniforms, but they were all armed with machine guns (which happen to change the sound effects during the movie and in some places sound like Air rifles BB cannons, and other guns). There is one part where the Skeleton Man throws some construction workers off a catwalk, and you can clearly see the pad on which they fall. At another point. Michael Rooker falls down a hill, which is clearly level ground. They tipped the camera slightly to give the appearance of a tilt, but he clearly insists in this looooooonnnngggggg scene. Then, when he is helped to climb the hill, the rope is flat, and when the woman points to the "hilltop" of the "hill," the rope rises from its grip, not what it would look like if it were somebody Rooker actually has a line saying "I'm not going after him, I'm going". What? This is probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and I look at these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest thing about this quote is that it can be said that everyone involved in creating / producing this film felt like it was shit. Believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialogue, this is good. <br /> <br /> The acting, bad. The make-up, really bad. These characters had either scars or wounds that liked to change the sides of their faces. Maybe those are alien scars that like to run around your face. Yeah, I think I'll make a movie about it, "Attacking the alien scars that move on your face." That scoundrel would be more intimidating than the skeleton man, and the movie would probably be more frightening.
