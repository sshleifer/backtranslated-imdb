I'm really not sure why people feel so comfortable with this weird movie. After saying that, I actually sat through the whole 2 hours and can not say that it was not completely unsupportive. I think the main problem is that Frank Marshall is not a real director. That's clear in the movie - he's an experienced producer, so I've often seen a movie and I'll understand what's going on in the process. But I think that's a different story than being able to direct a movie - the direction was competent, but somehow flat and directionless. Marshall has more experience as a unit or second director, and that was in my opinion in the finished product - it seemed to be a set of sets that had no continuity in their feel or character. <br /> Fun, observable, but Well? No.
