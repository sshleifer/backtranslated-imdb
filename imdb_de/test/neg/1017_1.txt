Director Fabio Barreto received a curious Academy Nominea for his latest film O Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna, Barreto has filmed one of the worst films of All Time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think me, how poor Brazilian fishermen speak perfect English? In the movie they do it. There is no script, it is just a very long video clip with beautiful locations and many sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.
