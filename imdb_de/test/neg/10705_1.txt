The conspiracy - in the future, when almost all men were killed by a Y-chromosome targeting virus - a (hot) female genetic engineer "creates" a man in a chemistry lab - is fascinating. Despite the promising premise, the film is flat in almost every respect. The dialogue is ridiculous. The signs are as thin as paper. The exploration of a same-sex world is flat. The worst part of the whole movie is the Asian detective who delivers lines that are so cheesy and ingenious that you have to throw up. I can not imagine how this garbage was produced. Most of the movie is male. "All men are violent." "All men rape women." "Men are just animals." All women - even the "closet heterosexual cases" - seem to be angry at showing fear and hatred of men. If you want to see a sci-fi movie that suits the principles of this movie, you should look elsewhere.
