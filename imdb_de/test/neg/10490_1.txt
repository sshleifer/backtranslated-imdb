This is not even alive enough to have fun. Something is out there tearing people off-screen after an off-screen crash, while government officials investigate (off-screen) and bad actors say stupid lines (on-screen), including a man, who looks like Jim Carrey with a hangover The "monster" looks like an addition to "Robot Monster" when it's finally shown, but there's not enough monster foot anyway. <br /> <br /> Luckily, it's pretty short. Skip it, unless you want to be bored
