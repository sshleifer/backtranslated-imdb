This is another movie that I can remember when I was a kid and I recently managed to get it on eBay - 20 years later, it's not nearly as good as I remember. <br /> <br /> The story "vague" kick is triggered by a "cosmic event" (there is another additional member of the film crew for "weak story development"), which makes collective ants extremely smart. Ant species that used to be at war with each other have stopped their rivalry and are now working together. The thing I always wanted to know was WHAT TO DO EXACTLY? They never find out what they want. Nigel Davenport and his buddy travel to the desert, where bizarre ant activity was observed, and begin to study the ants from an impregnable laboratory in igloo form. The most daunting scene, in my opinion, was when the two scientists visited the huge square in the crops (like a square version of a crop circle), a result of the ants sneaking away. This movie was not the case Very scary, simply because you do not know if you fear or like the ants. All you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can move on with their hijinks - but you can not figure out if they're really bad guys. It is not science fiction because the explanation of the "cosmic event" is too vague to be properly considered. It is deffo rather a cooler. TBH the flares, stupid hairstyles, tight shirts with big collars and Nigel Davenport's unnaturally large facial hair made me more than the ants! Did you notice that only six actors are listed in the credits? Yes, that's right - SIX, and in this movie you will not see any other people. Not even in the distance! This is an obviously obvious low budget movie that can be viewed a bit because you probably have not seen such a movie. I can not think of anything anyway. The shooting of the ants is pretty good, they must have shot months and months before they had the footage they needed for the movie. You can say well: "How the hell do you get the ants?" over and over, but it's all very simple. You'll also notice that the filmmakers sacrificed millions of innocent, lousy ants to make the movie. Animal rights are laughing! Good for the novelty value, but you can only look at it once.
