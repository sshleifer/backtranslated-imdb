After the failure of "Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth", the chapter that served as a kind of "deathblow" to the franchise was not another surprise billiard of billiards. An abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of Pinhead and the puzzle box that covers literally centuries of history in a movie that runs UNDER 90 minutes ... See inferior drama, comparable to pathetic B-movie special effects and a ridiculous and insulting attempt at dark humor, while STILL tries to keep the entire project completely serious. I wonder how many crazy directors had this thing? Poor Pinhead has so much on-screen time that every puzzle and threat that this iconic character possessed is completely lost. After listening to lengthy speeches and dramatic attitudes for an hour, we simply want to tell the man to shut up. A little entertaining, especially in the first section, after a while this chaos feels like a cheap, ugly TV splatter movie and ends in the most ridiculous way you can imagine: Pinhead with his Cenobite dog. kill some idiots ... in space! I'm sorry, but any real fan of the first two films in the series, who gave this abortion of a movie more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. By the way, the movie that follows; "Hellraiser: Inferno" is actually a surprisingly intelligent and stylishly made film noir piece that brilliantly recreates Pinhead as the master of illusion and cruelty, bringing back the concept of inherent evil in the human nature at the heart of the original film and the whole meaning of the film History. For any serious horror fan find Hellraiser I & II, skip the lousy III and this and continue with "Inferno". You will not miss anything if you skip this garbage ...
