Not for the first time, with the majority thing I am out of balance. Oz is a terrible, overbearing, voyeuristic series. The makers have their cake and eat it. Oz, Em City, etc. are used as ultra-high signals that the apparent sleaze is perfect imagination. This allows viewers the weakest intellectual excuses to spice up soap operas with anything bad for humans. When you look at an episode, please remember that the evil mouth, violent and absurd thing has thrown together, unconvincing, sick, imaginary drama unfolds before your appreciative eyes, several hundred infants in poorer areas of the world are in bad eating or water died. <br /> <br /> Oz is exploitative drama in the worst case. She speaks the least instincts, but pretends to be serious and meaningful. It blows hot and cold and changes more frequently from fortissimo to pianissimo than a Mahler symphony. Dialogue is relentlessly ugly and useful. The freedoms taken with realities are stupid. Here's a dandy nightclub that arrives in its glitzy glow at Oz and carries in one eye a ridiculously murky contact lens that floats a drug supply that no one has discovered. Here is a murderous pennant that blurts on the hot death of the universe and begs to be killed, but of course it is rejected by the vermin it approaches, and a little improbable cut that cuts itself. <br /> <br /> The action keeps racing at a pace so fast that the voyeuristic, moronic, observer always has to think about what happens next, rather than the garbage that has just been shown. Do not worry, a betrayal, a murder, a sex scene will come in a minute or two. <br /> <br /> Finally, Oz is obviously overbearing. You do not have to be ashamed because they are carried away by their flow. You can look at it and tell yourself that the producers, writers and actors do everything to the audience with a huge wink (or the same word, but only to a vowel change). <br /> <br /> Yes, you can be a vicious onlooker and apologize for the wisdom, postmodern art, etc. of the Oz production team. They appeal to the lowest common denominator, pretending to operate at a higher level. <br /> <br /> A despicable series. And every hour it shows, rewards its creators and actors, and generates advertising revenue for the channels that show people who can do no better than see something so ugly and unnecessary. Another hundred children die, whose lives could have been saved by the dollar that this terrible, successful and much praised series spends.
