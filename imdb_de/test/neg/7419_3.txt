One minute in THE UNTOLD and already techniques from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR have been demolished. Does that mean that we will see many trees? We will certainly do it. Will we see an Austrian bodybuilder blown up? Well, this movie has the budget of a TVM, so the answer is a clear no. Does anyone have these soft porn shows like BEDTIME STORIES? Well, because there is a scene in this kind of shows. Unfortunately, you only see cellulite. Do you like it when the screen goes black during a TVM? Great, because this happens between every scene in THE UNTOLD. In fact, it also happens in every scene. Did you play MILLIONAIRE - AN IMPORTANT FRAUD? Fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded Major Charles Ingram, the candidate who tried to cheat the show out of a million pounds. Seriously, one of the characters looks like Major Ingram. I always expected him to say "It's bear." It could be a bear, but it could be a big foot. "Cough, cough." Yes, it's a big foot. "Cough," it's definitely a big foot > Yeah I'll shoot it last answer Chris "<br /> <br /> Oh, and did I mention that all the above points are good? <br /> <br /> THE UNTOLD is not the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen this award go to NIGHT OF THE DEMON, which I saw over twenty years ago, and I think I have less seen as a dozen films that are worse all the time. Nevertheless, THE UNTOLD is a very bad movie in almost all areas, especially on average. As some other critics have pointed out, it feels like whole parts of the movie are missing while other parts are put together in the wrong order. This is a really bad movie that earns far less than its rating of 5.1. I give 3 out of 10 points and am very nice
