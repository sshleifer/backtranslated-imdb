Low budget. A shot rattles out of the darkness and a woman runs from that direction. A young architect Jimmy McMillan (Chick Chandler) discovers a body that has disappeared. Hurrying Mrs. Mary (June Clyde) is connected to the death scene; But it is McMillan who must try to solve the case to avoid serious suspicion. Suspects are six shopkeepers near the crime scene. The whole atmosphere of Film Noir; but not quite right. This strip is just enough to be a decent low-budget puzzle / drama and is a nice little hideaway. Other players include George Meeker, Michael Raffetto, Milton Wallace and Rebel Randall.
