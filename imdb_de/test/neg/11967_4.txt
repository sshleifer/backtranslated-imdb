I assume that 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is a dull Slasher movie. Yes, it has a good point, but it is a repeat of another movie. The file is so horrible still the plot. <br /> <br /> The story starts from a legend about a living scarecrow on the cornfield. When a prank becomes a joke and the life of a boy is endangered, the scarecrow comes to life, creating a deadly frenzy. Sound familiar, right? It's from Scream, Friday the 13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Children of the Corn, you name it! <br /> <br /> 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is so below average. Hardly a scary moment. Even the last scene is ridiculous! Unfortunately we still could enjoy it as our time killer. But I prefer that you see something else instead. Unless you are a big fan of bad and cheesy movies, of course. <br /> <br /> 4/10
