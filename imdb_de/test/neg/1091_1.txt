Well, I noticed that IMDB does not provide plot information. That's because it's not possible to do this without sounding disgusting and disgusting ... because this is the movie ... VILE AND disgusting !! I saw it because I'm a huge fan of Chris Noth, whom I met in person and he's a great guy. But if I ever met him again, I have no qualms about asking him for something that has made him play something so horrible. He plays a former prodigy who is now a brilliant physician spending his spare time, Run over small children with their car to mutilate and cripple them. This is not a "spoiler" because all of this is done from the very beginning ... sick enough? Oh, it's getting better ... he's manipulated by his incestuous sister, who threatens to hold back sexual favors from him if her latest victim does not die ... even Clive Barker could not write anything so ugly. If you want to see Chris Noth in something worthy of his talent, hire "Teddy Roosevelt and The Roughriders".
