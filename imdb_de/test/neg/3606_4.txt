The cast of EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE returns for Disney Pictures, but this time stands Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), who is no longer Yzma's (Eartha Kitt) stooge. Kronk has started a new life and is very happy with his role as a chef in his own restaurant. It goes on happily until Kronk learns that his dad (John Mahoney) comes to visit. Kronk is worried because he knows his life will not impress his daddy. One thing he always wanted and never got is a "thumbs up" from his dad. A variety of blunders and a gigantic cheese explosion in the restaurant let our sympathetic hero deep in trouble and concern. To save the day, some help from his friends. <br /> <br /> Other voices: Tracey Ullman, David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, April Winchell and Gatlin Green.
