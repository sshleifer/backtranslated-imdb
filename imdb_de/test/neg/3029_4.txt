Does anyone remember the docudrama THREADS? It is a drama documentary that shocked the United Kingdom in September 1984. Although Mick Jackson's nuclear holocaust horror movie was not exactly entertaining, I could respect it. Unfortunately, I can not respect this docudrama broadcast, which deals 20 years later with terrorists dropping a radioactive, dirty bomb in central London. The problem I have with it is that Daniel Percival's production values ​​are far too good if it actually benefited from more favorable production values. Cinematography is outstanding, but in this kind of speculative drama we need an excellent and well-lit Oscar standard cinematography? What we certainly do not need is a music score, as the survivors of the explosion slowly stagger out of the smoke. We do not need well known actors either. Anyone else wondering and wondering, "Hey, what was he, I know I did it and it's very distracting. <br /> <br /> The biggest production error at DIRTY WAR might be that Somebody decided to make it into a docudrama that emphasizes the drama too stylistically.In THREADS, the action cuts countless times from the action in Sheffield and becomes an issue of HORIZON on the effects of nuclear war before moving back to the fictional THREADS is therefore very effective, and here the information provided smothers the drama that drowns in expository and totally unconvincing dialogues.The characters in the telefilm are not really characters, just numbers to let the audience know what's going on when radioactive material explodes, it would have been better if the action were cropped on captions to that kind of information to mediate THREADS among others. The worst part is that director Daniel Percival used the same technique as was seen in THREADS a few years ago with his docudrama on smallpox. He should have used the same style with DIRTY WAR. <br /> <br /> I should also put my cards on the table and say that most Muslims are not terrorists, but I'm a bit fed up with TV productions THE HAMBURGER CELL, THE GRID AND DIRTY WAR had to wake me up Point out this fact by knocking over my head what is typical of patronizing PC settings in TV companies these days. I missed the studio debate that Bob mentions here, but I also heard that it was discussed elsewhere, and I can not help thinking that she's better to look at than DIRTY WAR herself, with her heated arguments between different factions of the political spectrum. If DIRTY WAR is remembered in twenty years' time (very unlikely I know), it's a good idea to remember the discussion that caused it
