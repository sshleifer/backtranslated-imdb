A great cast, a fantastic CGI monster and a brilliant script. If this movie had such a thing, it might not have been one of the worst movies I've ever spent an hour and a half. Infinite chimpanzees with infinite typewriters have not yet written the complete works of Shakespeare, but on the way, as it appeared in their trash, it somehow became a movie. You can tell the actors the regret of contract signing with every word they murmur directly into the camera. The CGI is extremely amateurish and they might have created more suspense than attacking the cast with the Sinclair Spectrum on which it was created. I wanted to like this movie, he has nice cameo appearances from Gil Gerard and Walter Koenig, so I was expecting a funny horror movie that does not take too seriously. It actually tries to take itself seriously, but it's about as much fun as a trip to the dentist. Do yourself a favor. Do not look at this movie, you will only be asked to do more.
