For "Illuminata," it is partly a misfortune that it appears after "Shakespeare in Love," since it is practically about the same themes of life as art, art and life and the magic of the theater and the same archetypal foibles of theater Folk much more difficult. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that come to life when a play develops and is reinterpreted by a writer's life, but there is a lot of Orson Welles-ish ego in that direction of / lead acted by John Torturro as a vehicle for his wife Katharine Borowitz (with a delightful cameo from her son). <br /> <br /> Every actor literally gets his moment in the limelight, but there are so many "masks" or set pieces that look like 19th century parlor games. Bill Irwin speaks. Susan Sarandon becomes a diva. Christopher Walken becomes another rogue - a gay critic. The women have to undress unnecessarily, because this is an art film. <br /> <br /> The art and the direction are wonderful, if quite dark. This should receive an award for best use of a Jersey City Theater set that has ever been used in a movie. (originally written on 21.08.1999)
