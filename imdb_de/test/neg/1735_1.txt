What really struck me about this movie was how little the story made sense. So many characters were randomly introduced, it was as if I imagined that Tommy Wiseau's "THE ROOM" would be rethought for the Disney Channel set. We had a smart elderly couple who always hung around where "Jane" worked, telling the same story of how "soda" brought them together, or Jane's mom / stepmom / randomly crying woman, all of whom came by accident /> <br /> Aaron Carter's acting is definitely the highlight of this film: I really looked forward to every scene in which he performed. The cut is painfully bad and the scene cuts make no sense. The "Jane" character is really irritating, wanders around and thinks about "J.D. McQueen". The scenes with the "Music Awards" are more depressing than anything else. And the end of this movie is unreal.
