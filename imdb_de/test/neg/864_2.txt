This movie was produced by the biggest producer in Costa Rica. Although their authors denounce as the largest movie ever made in Costa Rica, and their actors even dare to say that they have not received an Oscar nomination because they are politically relevant to oil (-hehe, right) .. Well, that's all a lie. The film is reportedly based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera about a love triangle (super-cliché-soap opera-like theme), and is a secondary story about an oil problem on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica with an American oil company doing so wanted exploration of oil resources in the area, but in the end it was never approved by the government. Now there may be some nice shots on the beaches, but that's about it. nothing bigger than that ... it's all in the camera. Most actors are lousy, except for two or three. The rest has no sense of what acting means: they exaggerate most of the time. The story is quite common and clichéd, deserving a cheap Mexican soap opera, as I said ... because the crew has been promoting it as a protest movie about oil, but 80% of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle. The script is not impressive, it is very simple and the dialogues are not very thoughtful. There were also some editing issues with some scene changes ... but other than that, it's pretty decent. The director did a good job, I mean, he's not like an Oliver Stone, but he did his job with the resources he had at his disposal. I would like to ask him why, instead of the Costa Rican actor, he spent most of the money on foreigners. After all, I mean, they boasted about being a 100% Costa Rican production ... at least that's what you expect. Finally, the end is not well done, there are shortcomings and details that do not match or are useless. Apart from being the most elaborate film in the entire history of the Costa Ricans, I think he is mediocre. You can make much more interesting and better pictures with less money. Never heard of "Pi"? If you're curious about Costa Rican or Central American movies, this movie will work, but you're definitely not missing anything.
