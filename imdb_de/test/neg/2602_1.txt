You know what? Family Guy started out as something fresh, fun and original. The random humor was made fun of. I always thought that it was the best animated sitcom next to the Simpsons. After watching the new episodes aired in recent weeks; I was tired of putting the show too much on random humor to be funny. South Park was right that FG was dead when they brought up the Manatees and Idea Balls. <br /> <br /> And when I see the show myself, I do not understand why my parents like it that way. There is nothing great about that. The "Intellegent" humor is funny and would have been funnier if the show did not depend on coincidence.
