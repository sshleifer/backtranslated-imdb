Tim Taylor is an abusive acholo drug addict. He is a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or a person. The only movie with him that is fun is "Galaxy Quest" and the fact that his character - a worn-out actor from a previous TV series - was so close to real life for him. The rest of the cast is just as bad. I hate the mother and the actress she played Patricia Richardson, she's shit! Every cliche is there, the stupid woman who is fat and likes the opera and cares only about her children, while in real life she announces family values ​​and divorces for twins. And the children actors were about as interesting as a root canal.
