(Spoiler) "Cash Crop" goes something like this. Farmers are expanding their fortune to make ends meet. The DEA agent blows into the city. Farmers hide the pot. DEA agent leaves the city. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This film features solid performances by second-level actors, mediocre direction and a script ... but it has no history. And since story is the foundation of any drama, "cash crop" is an absolute failure. Too boring to recommend.
