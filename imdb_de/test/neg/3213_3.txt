The clever Marketeer he is, of course, Jess Franco also has the temporary success of psychedelic spy films like Mario Bavas ultimately sensational "Danger: Diabolik!" Used. Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film, as he can arbitrarily insert as many sloppy, cheesy landscapes and absurdly grotesque action moves as he likes. And he partly understood that very well, because "The Girl from Rio" revolves around an organization with man-hate, led by a funky-dressed Lesbo who plans to make all men obedient slaves! Unfortunately, at least for them, the devilish plans are in conflict with the daily business of a dreaded crime syndicate played by George Sanders. All the right ingredients are well presented, but this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfactory adventure movie. The plot is rich in fantasy, but apparently only on paper, since the plot is pretty tame. The movie is also very colorful ... but not too bright and above all shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. Sure, there is a bit of nudity, but too few according to the usual Franco standards. All the characters are sick in the head, so few of the expected ones were (or hoped for) more perverse undertones or wild themes. Franco obviously had a bigger budget than usual, and I have to say he spends that money on more convincing set pieces and talented performers. In particular, the veteran actor George Sanders ("Village of the Damned", "Psychomania") is one of the best players ever to perform in a Franco production. Too bad he can not save "The Girl from Rio" from a big flop. A legendary Euro-Smut filmmaker like Jess Franco would have and could have achieved more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
