I just want to add the chorus of people who think this is "unsolvable". I will say the following without repeating the obvious FLAWS clearly stated by other commentators: do not know), but the cameraman had AUTOFOCUS (!) All the time, so any slight movement will cause him to and focussed. In many scenes, the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes. This alone screams "amateur." <br /> <br /> I also noticed that outside in the "middle of the cornfield" you can hear the sound of the petrol generator that drives the lights ... loud. <BR /> <br /> Also, what about this single source of light that follows (and often guides) the actors as they walk around. It looks like a news station with the "on-camera light" that follows people like a spotlight. There was no "credit" for lighting design / DP and I know why. The "filmmakers" saw no need to have someone who actually knew what he was doing to illuminate this image (Note: I did not say "movie"). So be prepared for most of the movie on a SINGLE headlight as the only source for "movie lighting". Uhhh !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably the most technically incapable production I've ever seen commercially. I "bought" this title because I like bad cinema. It's usually so bad that you can laugh about it. This is just so bad that it is no longer possible. Plan Nine from outer space is "Citizen Kane" compared to this title.
