"Happy Days" was produced and aired from the mid-70s to early 80s and seems to become more ridiculous as we get older. By the time of broadcast, most viewers who grew up in the 1950s were middle-aged with families, and the scenes in Mel's Diner probably brought them artificial nostalgia. The Fonz was of course the coolest of the cool guys (although the actor Henry Wrinkler has never learned to ride a motorcycle until now). Richie Cunningham was a pure American blond boy who was probably elected president of the student body. Potsie was Richie's best friend - the star of the show must have a best friend, I think. And Ralph Malph was the limping buddy of the Fonz, if not the whole group. I loved it when the Fonz beat poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, the middle-aged engraver who ran Mel's Diner. And who could forget Mork, of course? Was that really the 50s? Ironically, films produced in the '50s, such as "Rebel Without A Cause" and "The Wild One," have improved with age and represented time more honestly than this show, which produced 20 years after the period it offered has been. <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Happy Days TV series is not in the same league as Rebel Without a Cause or American Graffitti. "Happy Days" may have captured some aspects of the '50s with a burger-diner, jukeboxes, cool cars, and sticky plaid shirts, but it's more of a nostalgic idealism meant solely for laughter than honest expression. "American Graffitti" had something to say about young Americans in the fifties, whereas "Happy Days" seemed more like the middle-aged people of the seventies wishing the 1950s had been like that. The result was a watered-down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the fifties. "Happy Days" is at best a comedy fantasy with a background of the artificial culture of the 50s. As another reviewer pointed out, American boy Richie Cunningham would probably have been punished for making friends with a drop-out like Fonzie. And Mel would probably forbid Fonzie from entering his diner. <br /> <br /> A short story: "Happy Days" was originally a pilot named "Love in the Happy Days" who was turned down for the show. Comedy pilots who had sex and romance issues that did not make it to the pilot airs sometimes appeared on the rarely-broadcast "Love American Style," which often featured baseball games that were raining or other unexpected program cancellations and / or or was broadcast changes. In short, "Love American Style" was a throwaway show that included all those one-piece comedy pilots who never made it to a slotting debut. "Love in the Happy Days" appeared sometime in the early '70s as a "Love American Style" show, but at that time television executives could not predict how a show would be popular with young people from the' 50s, especially during the daytime comedy Shows that focus on middle-aged people, such as the Mary Tyler Moore Show (and their later spin-offs like Rhoda), The Bob Newhart Show, and All in the Family. (As things have changed since most TV sitcoms, most TV sitcoms are young people, and the industry avoids most shows about middle-aged people like the plague!). Afterwards one of the young stars of "Love in the Happy Days", a child actor from the "Andy Griffith Show" named Ron Howard, got the chance, in a film about young people, which took place in 1959 under the name "American Graffitti" The lead role of the relatively unknown George Lucas, whose previous "THX 1138" was to play ", had miserably bombarded at the box office, and even when the film premiered in front of movie actors, the studios could not recognize again, like a film about young people in the fifties became popular because it did not fit what had been popular in the past, even though they did not notice it In the fifties, a large part of the audience was young, as everyone knows, the film was a huge hit and the studio managers realized that they had completely misjudged their audience, and during the drama of "American Graffitti," TV executives recognized that they were a comedy pilot n had in the vault, the "American Graffitti" very similar. They returned it with the original cast and Henry Wrinkler as "The Fonz", called it "Happy Days" again and the rest is television history when it became one of the most popular shows of the 70's. <br /> <br /> "Happy Days" now seems ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, never more or less than what they are superficial. The topics they are dealing with are insignificant. And her reactions seem unthinkable and even stupid. Nowadays the character of the Fonz seems to be a caricature of the Fonz. Was the idea to be a kind of parody of Marlon Brando's character in "The Wild One"? When I look at the show with new eyes, I feel that the producers have really missed a great opportunity to present the 1950s with depth and realism that can still be fun and entertaining. Instead, the producers opted for cheap laugh for quick money. This is definitely a show that has not passed the test of time. "American Graffitti" has many of the outward appearances of "Happy Days", but had an advantage. It had an honesty about the characters and their problems. "Happy Days" looked like "American Graffitti", but he did not hit his heart.
