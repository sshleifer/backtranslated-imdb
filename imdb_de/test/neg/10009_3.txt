Cage plays drunk and is highly praised by critics. Elizabeth Shue actually has a love that has been seen with the most unattractive and overvalued piece of manure in Hollywood. I literally vomited while watching the movie. Of course I had the flu, but that does not mean that this movie did not contribute to vomiting in the Kamode. <br /> <br /> Why can not Nick Cage play something he can really do like a bad actor? Nick Cage, who is brilliant in a role as a bad actor. Heck could make no one better. <br /> <br /> The search begins after Nick's contract with Lucifer or it was Lou Cipher from "Night Train To Terror."
