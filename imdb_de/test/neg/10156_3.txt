well ... it's funny. It should have been a sadistic comedy, many horror movies lack common sense, but I think a backward caveman would move well in this situation. Do not really expect Hitchcock or anything near it. This is a good movie for friends, but I would not recommend it for anything else. This film lacks all the content of a real horror movie, the excitement, the shock and the good characters. The killer was not the unstoppable force I expected, and he seemed to be the average angry "D" student who could only outsmart stupid people. and the really funny thing is the terrible spectacle and the lack of emotions of the so-called "victims". <br/> <br/> 3/10 simply expect this in the everyday tricks.
