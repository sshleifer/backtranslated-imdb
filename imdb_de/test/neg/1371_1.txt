I'm sorry, but this guy is not funny. I swear, I've heard that 4-year-olds made better jokes than some of his. "Dee dee dee", for example, is the worst slogan I've ever heard. There is a lack of creativity, and making fun of mentally challenged people once you reach the level of your own show is incredibly bleak for Mencia. <br /> <br /> Although everyone compares this fool to Chappelle, it's not a contest. At first they had very different shows. I think Menica's show had on average only about 2 short 5-minute sketches between his 10-minute raids on God knows what. The show by Chappelles was more than sketch comedy with 2-4 skits that occupied the whole show. Everything Chappelle did was a brief summary of every sketch before and after each one. Here Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia think of having a show that consists of the same stand-up comedy that he talks about in his stand-up specials would be an advantageous idea? Does anyone really want to hear a bit about how George Lopez pioneered Mencia, but unimaginably pulled himself to the point where he died? Snowflake Chance in Hell. <br /> <br /> My point is, although most people hate this guy for his racism, I just can not believe him to be incompetent. Comedy Central was looking for a minority that could brand it as "controversial" and then let it go the way from Chappelles. The problem is that this guy has made it very clear that he does not want to be Chappelle. Instead, he leads his crappy show like a burning railroad wreck directly into the ground. If someone wants to see a weekly standup about the same stuff every Thursday, I know the hell that I do not do that. <br /> <br /> But I can not express my gratitude to Comedy Central. The show of this idiot is ready. Personally, after seeing his standup, I do not know how he ever got his own show. There are so many meritorious comics like Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis, etc. In fact, everyone is better than this fool.
