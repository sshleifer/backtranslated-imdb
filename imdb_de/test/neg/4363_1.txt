<br /> <br /> This movie is shit! The first one was much better. No-one from the beginning has returned to this stupid sequel, and in a sense, that's a good thing because of the bad acting. Killjoy in the woods? Come on! Give me a break! I am surprised that the friend of killjoy, the Blair Witch, did not come to a cameo. Bad drama, bad story and just stupid and boring. Do not waste your time!
