This is without a doubt the worst-conceived film in history. The invention gags of Carrot Top are some of the most terrifying attempts to be funny in recorded history. I do not know his other work, but if it's half as bad as this, I'll just cry. I give this movie one of 30 billion stars and may God have mercy on the souls of those responsible.
