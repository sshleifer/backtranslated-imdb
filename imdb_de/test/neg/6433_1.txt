"War is in your blood," says Rambo at the beginning of the film: "Do not fight it". Say what? Does the scriptwriter get the Mickey out of Sly? It is impossible for anyone with a primary education to miss the joke here. Stallone, however, expresses himself without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> The same lack of humor applies to the movie. Rambo IV is an exaggerated idiotic actor who would have been joking if he was not violently violent. A redneck fantasy of the simplest kind, where villains are so spiteful, is not it just enough to kill them? You have to dismember them with pleasure. Stallone does not stop at a clich√© to explain his point of view. It is not enough for the chief villain to feed them to the pigs and throw babies into the kind of sadist. He is also a pedophile homosexual. <br /> <br /> What happens to IMDb? Will it be taken over by the Rifle Society? How can this abhorrent reason for such a high gross profit rate be? I like a good action movie as much as the next man, but that's not a conversation. this is violent pornography that trivializes and ultimately vilifies the true tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly does not take off his shirt. For that I will give him a star ...
