The Hindi remake of Mrs. Doubtfire, which Kamal Hassan plays and directs, is a bit modest and not as good as expected. <br /> <br /> Kamal Hassan clearly fights with Hindi dialogue, even after all these years, and can not handle even a scene effortlessly. The guy has aged and should rest. Hassan brings nothing new in the character or in the character, such as Dustin Hoffman with Tootsie or Marathi actor Macchindranath Kambli with Mavshis (aunt) in "Moruchi Mavshi" (Morus aunt, comedy) /> <br /> What the child has played with crackers when it was not Diwali? Most of Chachi's romantic "cross-connections" - Vs Amrish, Paresh and then Johny Walker - seem superfluous to the main plot. Taboo bath scene was not necessary. The family is North Indian, but must be remembered by a Maharashtrian Chachi at Karva Chauth Night. Yeah right. <br /> <br /> The subtle acting skills of not one but four actors, namely Tabu, Om Puri, the late Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal, have been wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> Check out the original Mrs. Doubtfire - clean, crisp and fun, unlike Chachi 420.
