I'll never get back the three hours of life this movie stole from me. <br /> <br /> The film is basically a psychedelic drug trip that is disguised as an important creative process. I'd like to know what they were when this movie was made. <br /> <br /> It is also the most historically inexact film there is; The year 2001 came and went without the events or predictions. <br /> <br /> Characters are unlikely, the design is simple and everything goes on without meaning and logic. <br /> <br /> And the end is probably the worst: it's supposed to be thought-provoking, but the only thought that came to my mind is, "What's the F $ * K?" <br /> <br /> I would say that anyone looking for serious entertainment needs to AVOID this movie at all costs and choose a science fiction movie that does NOT have its own @ $$.
