I gave this movie 2 just because I'm polite. This movie made me relax for 90 minutes of my life, when I could have done something useful for people or just for myself. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is bad, the actors never look scared! Even if it should be a horror movie. For example, the scene in which Kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. He should be scared, but he looks quite normal. The chick of the film is such a clich√©. The only thing I liked about her was the dress she was wearing in the last scene. Incidentally, the end was extremely predictable as the cocoon in the box flashed pink. Actually, I was thinking more of an ant running around in the backseat of the car. But it did not surprise me anyway.
