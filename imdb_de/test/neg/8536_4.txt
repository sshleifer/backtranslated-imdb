After problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start over, but their attempts to create an idyllic peasant life are interrupted when their daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her three-year-old brother Ben begin to see and to be attacked by supernatural beings who do not allow them to live in peace. <br /> <br /> The Messengers begins decently, though it eventually becomes a generic horror movie that is much more humorous than frightening. After reading the premise, I thought this could be a decent movie because it sounds scary and has potential. Unfortunately the movie did not live up to its potential, although I had to expect it because the trailer was awful. The script was probably the worst part of it. It was full of stupid sequences and a bland dialogue. The characters were not developed at all and most of them behaved like a bunch of idiots, so it was hard to feel sympathy for them. <br /> <br /> The directors did a terrible job of building up tension. They relied mainly on cheap horrors such as loud noises and random jumps. The music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the audience to telegraph the next "scary" moment. I also did not like the fact that they only used one place for the whole movie. The house was at the heart of the story and most of the shooting was done here, so after a while it became boring to see the same area. I also did not like the close-ups of the actors. During a conversation, the camera constantly jerked from one character to another within five seconds, and it really got annoying. The directors have created a decent atmosphere and get some points to make their film stylish. However, as we have come a long way in terms of style and effects, it is not really that difficult to make your movie look good, especially if you're working on a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was abominable and if this film had been released in December, he would surely have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed talent in the Panic Room, but you would not say she has talent watching her performance at The Messengers. She was okay if she was scared and that was it. The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was just terrible when it came to everything. It sounded like she was reading her lines and had some of the worst facial expressions I've ever seen. Dylan McDermott was made of wood and showed almost no emotion. John Corbett showed the best performance and had some good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to play many of the adult actors. Overall, this lame horror movie is not worth seeing, because he is so modest and lazy. Rating 4/10
