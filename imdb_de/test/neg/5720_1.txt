I remember the trailer for this incredibly weak spin off of Conan. I saw the movie years later and laughed at myself. Unintentionally! Poor Briggite Nielson. Her career did not stand a chance thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. The plot of the film is as follows: Sonja (Brigitte Nielson) comes from a tribe of female warriors who were killed by the evil Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the bullet that protected the female warriors, destroying any city she passes by. Sonja hunts for Queen Gedren and later learns that Gedren has killed her parents. In her quest, she reluctantly joins Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his hobbling idiot servant Falkon (Paul L. Smith). Together they go hunting for Queen Gedren and the bullet. The acting is below average and the action scenes are simple. I mean, Briggite Neilson looks so emotionally distant. For someone who has lost both the whole family and the comrades, Sonja does not look at all. Arnold plays his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr .... what an annoying snot-nose brat he was in this movie! The stupid servant Falkon had more personality than these guys. The action scenes are the film's only redeeming moments, though sometimes they fall flat. The scene of fighting the mechanical sea animal made me laugh until my ribs ached. The dialogue is also a scream. It's as if the scriptwriter thought that nobody would take the movie seriously, so he gave everyone stupid lines to work with. I can only recommend this movie if you like your epic movies extra campy. Everyone else does not care.
