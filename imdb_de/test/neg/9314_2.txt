What can be said about this independent effort beyond the fact that it was shot with television cameras, and whether this was through imagination or budget constraints, makes looking at this variant of a Romero theme no easier. I've been constantly reminded that I've looked at a person's school project, the most distracted, worst. <br /> <br /> The author / director Georg Koszulinski (who also appears in the movie) does some interesting stuff with stock footage, but that says more about his cut style than his directorial style, which comes from in-your-face close-ups TV cameras, which gave me the impression that I see publicly available television rather than a genuine, honest-good movie. <br /> <br /> The story copies and adds parts from various sources, including the aforementioned Romero DEAD trilogy, THE ROAD WARRIOR (dig the footage of a "future" that looks like the past) and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. <br /> <br /> What gives an hour and nothing when zombies seek and eat people. (Okay, the "humans" are clones in this case, but that does not change anything.) It's the same menu.) The year is 2031 and the first batch of people who were cloned nineteen Years ago, especially in the dietetic field, came it malfunction. When clones go bad, the first thing they have a taste for is, of course, human flesh (or in this case, cloned human flesh). It is not safe to be inside, it is not safe to be outside. It's only a matter of time before the carnivorous ghouls devour our heroes. Have you ever seen this before? <br /> <br /> I do not mind people ripping Romero off if it's done well, but this movie is not about breaking new ground. It is the Night of the Living dead meeting with the project BLAIR WITCH, which was taken with television cameras. Especially disappointing is that the DVD cover looks like it was at least taken with 8mm film. That would not have been a problem for me if the story had not been just as cheap. The film offers a bleak vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the point that cloning is possible. Do we still have to clone our favorite movies?
