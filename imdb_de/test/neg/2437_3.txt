It's hard to tell who this movie is for. The characterization and style smell like a "Children's ITV" series crossed with an Aussie soap, but the theme, nudity and language are addressed to an older audience. For the first half hour heroine Justine has philosophized about the loss of her virginity and is embarrassingly embarrassed for anyone over the age of 18. A complete rip-off of "Ferris Bueller", from talking on the camera to the graphics on the screen. <br /> <Her nerdy friend Chas takes her to a computer fair where an explosion while using virtual reality machines turns her into a man. Or, in fact, she creates a male alter ego named Jake. Do not look at me like that; I only tell it as it was shown. <br /> <br /> After that, the movie is mildly amusing for a while; Only Rupert Penry-Jones gives his wife, who is trapped in a man, a real comedy. There are some funny scenes in which Jake deals with his new body and new feelings. Nothing that you have not seen yet, but in this movie you access everything that is entertaining. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Justine and Jake meet, and funny antics follow (I wish) that the owners involve the virtual machine Jake wants to kidnap to have sex with him or to investigate him or something. Anyway, it's just an excuse to fill half an hour with some explosions and chases. For such a cheap looking movie, the explosions are often and loud, suggesting that the money was spent in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> In the end, the heroine realizes that she can not fall in love with herself. erases her alter ego and lands in a one-night stand with the nerd to lose her virginity (this is probably what should be considered a happy ending in the 90s). But only after he has taken off his glasses and put on some hair gel and a leather jacket; God forbids that she actually has sex with someone who looks like a nerd. Of course, this is a bit subversive - in these days of PC movies that invite you to love and be yourself, and that each one is special in its own way, it's refreshing to have a movie that "CONFORM! " Screams. on you and treats virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve. <br /> <br /> The characterization is just bleak; The nerd is very nerdy (room full of computer, thick glasses, social retard, virginity, no leather jacket), there is a slut, she is very slutty (blonde, tight clothes, orange tan, Vampy accompaniment music), there is a jock very much ... well, you get the picture. This characterization can be found in a wide comedy, but "Virtual Sexuality" is not very funny. It is only partially amusing and tormenting in others. It costs a woman as sweet as Justine (played by Laura Fraser) to annoy me, but she manages. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title. There's absolutely nothing erotic about the movie, and it's not about how new communication technologies are changing the way we look at relationships (if you do not really believe there's a chance your PlayStation will explode and yours Gender changed). <br /> <br />
