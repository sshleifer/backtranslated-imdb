Rating: * 1/2 of **** <br /> <br /> "The Net" is one of the movies that will not stay in your head until the next lesson. Well ... only if you keep thinking how bad it is. It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, ridiculous and predictable garbage. One of those adjectives I just used above is why I would add a half star to the star I gave. So is it a case of "so bad that it is good"? No, it's a case of "so bad it's ridiculous". <br /> <br /> Bullock in a (surprisingly!) very bad performance is played by Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is constantly at home. She works at home, has no friends and her neighbors do not know her. Suddenly she finds herself in dangerous situations after her colleague dies and almost the same thing happens to her. Her identity, bank accounts, etc., etc. are deleted and she is now Ruth Marx. The conspiracy even affects the government and ... wait! Have not we seen this already? Yes, thousands of times. "The Net" wants to be modern, to be the portrait of the 90s and to show the computer as a villain. Big thing! It's a movie about nothing, just an excuse to show ridiculous action scenes. Take the scene of the boat accident. I just laughed when the camera got slow ... <br /> <br /> What makes things worse here is Sandra Bullock. How terrible is she! Has she already done a decent movie? "A time to kill", okay. But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robot-controlled facial features in each of her pictures. <br /> <br /> The advantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in "2001: A Space Odyssey" the most intelligent and complex movie ever made. There's no need to compare "The Net" with it, or ...? <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "The Net" is, as I said, laughing and seeing what it's trying to be. The results are a shame. <br /> <br /> DELETE this movie out of your thoughts!
