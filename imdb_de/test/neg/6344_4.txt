Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps Colonel who brings a handful of private Vietnamese veterinarians to Laos to rescue some Americans who have been reported missing. Hackman suspects that the half-dozen MIAs of Laotians are secretly being held in a remote camp to be tormented and do more hard work. Hackman is paid by the wealthy Robert Stack, whose son belongs to the MIAs like Hackman's son. However, the circumstances are such that Hackman can only buy old and outdated weapons, though he manages to claim the help of a passionate anti-communist Loatian and his two daughters along the way. <br /> <br /> I do not think the film was purposely put together to support the myth that the Vietnamese still consider our MIAs to be propaganda. The myth was real enough. If anyone remembers, there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983, BRING BACK THE MIAs. Instead, I think the movie was partly made to benefit from the myth. It was absurd at first sight. Why did our former enemy refuse to return MIAs? Propaganda? Where is the propaganda value in something that is kept secret? Add a job offer? You need a hundred extra workers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives behind this film - with its triumphant music and high body count - were quirky. <br /> <br /> But what about the movie itself? Without saving the subject of rescuing mythically abused MIAs, it's a routine paramilitary actioner, no better and no worse than dozens of others that surfaced in the '80s. The power of Gene Hackman is the only one who can keep his head above water. He is almost always reliable. <br /> <br /> Of the others, this was a formal conspiracy, among others, derived from "The Dirty Dozen". I tried again and again to guess which of the gangs would sacrifice themselves for the mission. Of the three anti-communist Asians, I thought one or more were dead flesh. That is why Asian helpers appear in such films. (I had two out of three rights.) I also thought that Patrick Swayzie was the rookie ex-officer, the youngest of the group who had never earned the respect of others because he had never seen a fight in one go heroic mode. Not correct. He truly becomes a hero, but survives unharmed. I thought that there would be a fifty to fifty chance that Hackman would have to go too, but he's making everything clear. The formula does not really stretch to originality. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic POW fugitive from "The Great Escape" is here in Fred Ward's ex-tunnel rat, a claustrophobic who is forced to crawl through a drainpipe with a snake so he can perform a demonstration in the Lao POW camp. <br /> <br /> The title "Uncommon Valor" comes from a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to the men on Iwo Jima - "Uncommon's courage was common on that day." Nimitz was certainly right. Whether the men who fought in Vietnam were equally brave or not is far from that point. Anyone who saw a fight, or even came near it, and put their lives aside for the boys in the series, was heroic enough. This film and the way it exploits our bitterness about the Vietnam War does not really do them justice.
