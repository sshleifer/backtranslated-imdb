I discovered "The Patriot" in a DVD store and thought it might be a real action thriller. No, it's a low-budget movie with a ridiculous story instead. It's undoubtedly a cable movie and not one for the theater. Fortunately, the film is stopped after 90 minutes, otherwise the audience would have been given an antivirus to sleep. One thing was over: it was the beautiful country where the movie was filmed. You can really feel the American air, but that's all. I hope for Steven Seagal that he finally has a great success. It's not a must, because me and my wife averaged 4/10.
