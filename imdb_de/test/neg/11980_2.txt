I'm a big fan of the Farcry Game, HUGE fans. It still has a place in my top 10 game list ever! The story was new and fresh. A really brilliant foundation to start a movie ... or so I thought ... <br /> <br /> Farcry the Movie is no less than another director's attempt to make money on a successful game franchise (See Doom: The Movie and many more ...). <br /> <br /> The video game begins when the player (Jack Carver) wakes up in a cave by the sea after he was shot down by him. Boot of a role-playing game of an unknown soldier. Then Jack finds a communication device that leads him (Harlan Doyle) over islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and VOLCANOES to find his (girlfriend?) (Valerie Constantine) who fights all the brave supersoldiers, and genetically enhanced animals. <br /> <br /> The Movie is very, very different: 1: There is an unnecessary 30 minutes (1/3 of the movie) "background story" before we even get into the scene "boat blasting". 2: Jack then goes to the beach, kills some idiots and then leaves ... Nothing like the game ... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle at the other end ... 4: The 'Modified Soldiers' look like albinos with singlets on ... And there were no mutant "monkey-like" creatures jumping out of the bushes. Part of the Farcry game I enjoyed ... 5: There are no sun-filled beach scenes, no aircraft carrier, no communication stations on huge cliffs, SMALL reference to any in-game content (characters / objects / vehicles) in fact, no attempt to follow the story at all. 6: The climatic scene of the game's volcano is replaced by an old industrial building. 7: There is a final scene ... where everyone (except warriors) lives happily ... WHAT THE! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie at any price! If you are a player, you will HATE that this movie will become your whole soul. It's a movie that's clearly meant for men, so girls, stay away ... So if you have a man between 12 and 29 years old, you've never played Farcry and are not thrilled with the director's attempts to write books / Porting games to the cinema ... then that's for you ...
