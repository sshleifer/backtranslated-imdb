A similar story that has been done many times, and this was not an improvement. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes you should be able to switch it off almost completely - the end was again deja vu. <br /> <br /> The only morality I could see from this is: - stupidity + criminals are not equally successful - if he has messed you up once, he will do it again
