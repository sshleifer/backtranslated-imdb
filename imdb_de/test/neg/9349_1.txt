I like the "Star Wars" series. I also like a good, cheap sci-fi movie from time to time. Heck, I even like the nickel-and-dime jobbies produced by Roger Corman. <br /> <br /> I do not like "The Ice Pirates" though. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it just looks too cheap, you know? For a movie to take place in space, he feels tight and closed, as if filmed in the front seat of a Mazda. And while the special effects look appropriately cheesy, they look more than foam rubber coated with metallic gray. Usually, I'm not bothered by such things, especially when the story and the characters are worth it. <br /> <br /> That's not the case. <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole story about these space pirates who do not choose to find an ice-laden planet they can melt and sell as water (a hot commodity in the future, I think) is about as original as the jokes, which is not a compliment. <br /> <br /> The humor comes at a step-level (like castrating) machine you'll see early on), and everyone seems to have a moody attitude. And who told John Matuzak that he is funny? Whoever, she is ashamed. Good old Robert Urich tries, but he is a reliable actor on board a badly sinking ship (or a spaceship in this case). <br /> <br /> I have seen it about three times and felt the same way every time - shanghaied. <br /> <br /> No stars. Despite the presence of Huston (a year before "Prizzi's Honor") and Carradine (at the end of a one-time career), these "pirates" should go over the plank.
