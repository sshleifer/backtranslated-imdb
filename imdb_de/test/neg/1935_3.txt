I saw it when it first appeared in cinemas in 1996. I remember that I already knew Elijah Wood's work (that's right, he did things before "Lord of the Rings"!) And the merchandising connections to the movie were pretty abundant ("Flipper" water guns were even in circulation) , Adults were reminded of the old movies and TV shows, and for the sake of nostalgia their children took to seeing it, who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy. Unfortunately it was not what someone expected and flopped. They know that a movie is in trouble when a boy swims away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the sea and a pack of dolphins frightens the shark, and the boy - instead of getting into a boat out of the water - floats in the water for five minutes , he thanked his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he did not think that the shark is still out there, maybe even under him. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Paul Hogan. He looks old, crispy and tired from recycling his Croc Dundee ticket. By now no one remembered "Crocodile Dundee," let alone Hogan, and half-expected that he would suddenly pretend he did not know what a hairdryer for fish-out-water / social satire Laugh <br/> <br /> All in all, this is a really poor "family movie" that is amateurish and sometimes hard to see. I hated it when I saw it in cinemas in 1996 and I hate it more now.
