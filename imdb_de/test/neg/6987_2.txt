This movie must be the worst I have ever seen. I only saw about half an hour and just turned it off. The cars in this movie look like the two front ends of the Geo-Metro collided. This movie is not even good for laughs. I only laughed when Dante said with a funny voice, "No one can beat Dante, Muhwa hwaa." I said the holy god and turned it off. Bad, bad movie. 2.10
