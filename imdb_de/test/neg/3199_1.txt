Possibly one of the largest celluloid waste of the last 100 years. Not only does it suffer from a painful (and highly predictable) disjoint script, but it is clearly a copy of Alien II. Within five minutes, I had correctly predicted who would die and who would not (and in what order). The special effects are ridiculous; There is a scene where a crew member (not convincing) is beaten by two critics who look like a teddy bear pair, and the sparse humor is out of place and bleak. There are better things you can do with a VCR remote than watch this movie.
