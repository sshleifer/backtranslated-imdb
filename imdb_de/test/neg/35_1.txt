Maniratnam, who in India is often compared to prominent filmmakers in the world and is considered a genius in filmmaking, has once again proved that he only makes the frames look good without giving much thought. Forget the pure movie joy that can be derived from the cinema as a very old art form. <br /> <br /> I do not want to pretend and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies shot all over the world, but thoughtfully and a little educated movie goer can see that his films are not innovative containing profane actions, no after effects and then MOSTLY containing a ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama that is abundant in Indian films, Maniratnam has again successfully confirmed my aversion to his films. <br /> <br /> Sorry for those who said otherwise in this forum. My suggestion to you: SEE A BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE ABOUT THE GLOBE.
