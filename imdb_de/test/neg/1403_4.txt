This miserable psychodrama uses every greasy device in the book to arouse our attention and compassion for its characters, who, with one exception, do not deserve any attention, let alone two valuable hours of film goers. <br /> <br /> Like Robert Redford's "Ordinary People" (an excellent film that clearly shows the emptiness of "heroes" by comparison), a deceased teenager has died and plunged his family into the pain of loss. In this case, death was a suicide, an event that almost always poisoned the emotional well-being of the survivors in a particularly corrosive manner. We will follow these people in the next 8 or 9 months. The father (Jeff Daniels) becomes a withdrawn, practically mute, mostly drunk stiff man, secretly saying goodbye to his job for months, instead sitting on a park bench all day long, insisting on a full plate of food for each meal to set up the deceased son. He treats everyone else in the family with relentless malice. He regularly sees his doctor, but the question of therapeutic intervention in his apparently dysfunctional condition is never called into question. The mother (Sigourney Weaver), among other things, yells at the neighbor's wife when she tries stupidly to do so Buy "marijuana" (her name) in a head shop (which adult would actually try such a stupid stunt?), And in the end, the coma disappears with a lung disease in which everyone in the Theater of Cancer emits a heavy smoker). Ms. Weaver has a few flip-lines, but is generally too dumb to earn much empathy. <br /> <br /> It's not that there are no people out there acting stupidly in situations of severe stress. But why make a movie out of such a jerk? What can someone learn from the behavior of this couple? <br /> <br /> The deceased's older sister (Michelle Williams) is in college and too happy to distance herself from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emile Hirsch) is the only believable member of the family. His suffering is sincere, his causes varied, and his behavior is coherent under the circumstances. But Hirsch's character is too quiet, too grumpy and depressed to wear the film. The other Bit Players, Subtexts and Cutesy, unreal dialogues do not help. <br /> <br /> The suicide theme is transmitted almost casually by two other minor characters. So, what is writer and director Dan Harris trying to say on this topic? That it is not a serious matter? Why Jeff Daniels has agreed to play the juice of a father as written in this script can only be answered by his therapist. Avoid this dog. Rent Redford's classics instead. My rating: 4/10 (C-).
