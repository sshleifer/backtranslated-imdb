There is a lot of ketchup, but not much sense in the allegedly explanatory third episode, which stacks the naff visuals without effect. Good old Alan Smithee has directed this, in which various members of the same family (all poorly played by Bruce Ramsay) are being terrorized by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, once again rolled out of mothballs). Peter Atkins tries to add poetic accents to his script, but does not seem to realize that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick people. The incoherent presentation can not adequately fill the film's lean running time, though this may have more to do with studio interference than anything the filmmakers intended.
