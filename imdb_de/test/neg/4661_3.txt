Dear Readers, <br /> <br /> In my film studies, I've found that whenever Michael Bay makes a movie, people wave and hate it, but they still go out to see something and it makes somewhere around $ 100 million. Why? Because Michael Bay is one of the top five directors of all time. Michael Bay has established himself alongside Ridley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick and Miyazaki as the best action / adventure director of Hollywood. This point is proved with his most panned movie Armageddon. <br /> <br /> A Texas-sized asteroid is racing towards the planet, and the only way NASA can do it is a team of men. The asteroid drills right down to the core leaving a nuclear warhead into it and blow the asteroid in the air. Only one person is qualified: Bruce Willis. Willis portrays Harry Stamper, a hardened oil drill who tries to keep the rest of his family together. This fact can not be helped because his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) has an affair with his best driller AJ (Ben Affleck). Hired by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), head of NASA, Stamper and his team are training Roughneck drills to become astronauts and save the world. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a two-part movie. First, there are the funny parts we meet the gang and the crazy ones. Then they step into space and the whole comedy is sucked out of the window and replaced with breathtaking special effects, cool music and great, serious acting. Murphy's law goes insane in the second part, which means that everything that can go wrong actually goes awry and the film's suspense rises to an outstanding level. <br /> <br /> With a cool cast and crew (Michael Bay as director Jerry Bruckheimer and Gale Anne Hurd as producers and JJ Abrams as one of the screenwriters.), loads of special effects, great humor, great music and an intro of Mr. Ben-Hur himself, Charlton Heston, Armageddon rocks big time. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector, Matt Macleod <br /> <br /> Parental Alert: This is not a movie for kids. The F-bomb is used several times and many other curse words are also used. There is also a strip bar scene and the extremely intense second part may be too heavy for a kid.
