The journey here is a search for God, the big man in the sky, the big cheese with a beard. Veiled as the thirst for ultimate knowledge. Leonard Nimoy takes over the direction of The Shat himself, Captain Tiberius William Shatner Kirk. In an attempt to combine the fun aspects of the series with Sci-Fi Histrionics, Shatner and his co-authors have just achieved an almost embarrassing parody of a parody. Where is the danger? Where are the brothers in spirit of arms? where is our poorly rehearsed crew? Star Trek humor is a wonderful thing if it's in the right places and has a straight tip that matches what came before The Final Frontier. There are some light moments that can not compensate for the lack of serious moments. While we really need another Spock revelation? <br /> <br /> Some beautiful sets and knowingly little trek moments aside, The Final Frontier is just a bad movie experience. 3.10
