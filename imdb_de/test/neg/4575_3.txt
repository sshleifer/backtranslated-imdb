Before I speak my piece, I would like to clarify a few things: 1) I am a chick who does not engage in chick films ("Kate & Leopold" and "Someone Like You" are EXTREME exceptions - Hugh Jackman's ass). 2) I just picked it up because I'm a Fichtner Fangirl, looking forward to seeing him in a bathtub. 3) I'm not a Demi fan, though I think their appearances on "Immortal" and "A Few Good Men" were great and earned seats in my video library. I also think she is a bit crazy (by no means she is NOT silent) sleeping with Brucie). <br /> <br /> If this is a character study of an unfulfilled woman living a double life of independence and happiness, I would say that we have a narcoleptic melodrama. Marty: Literary agent. 6-Digit Salary Lives in an upscale Penthouse in Manhattan. It was easy for her to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk to recommend a nightly escapism. Or maybe through an inter-diemsional portal? She has the career, the look, a cool car, a great pad, where are the man and the kids now? Step by step our boy Aaron - a real escapism. What are architects? They are artists who can do math, dreamers who make real money. Aaron gives Marty the dream of security and fills a void in which she obviously has no self-confidence. On the other side of the coin is Marie, who still lives out the fantasies of her schoolgirls as she winds her way through motherhood. Her children are her career and her life. But what about Marie, does she exist only through her children? In the Waltz William, a Parisian stranger who helps her focus on the only thing she has lost contact with: herself. An alleged journey of self-discovery and a late adulthood, which in some is thrown with fear and rage some resentment against Marty / Marie's own mother. This gets a 3/10. All I can say is thank goodness for the BPL multimedia department. I would not waste my $ 2.99 on blockbuster, but award a Harlequin Blaze title.
