A really strange, surreal mess of visual ideas that probably looked confusing on the printed page. What Robert Redford has just attracted to the project, you may never know. Sidney J. Furie leads the knockabout journey of a selfish motorcycle racer who takes a militant youth under his wing; The child looks up to this anti-hero and begins to improve his amorality. Alienated and repugnant - though for some, the sight of Redford's undressing, undressing, or undressing might be enough to justify the attention. Lauren Hutton is also undressing, but all sexy flashes are just prelude to the agitated; There is simply no story. Perhaps Furie made an esoteric statement about Feckless Wheeler and her flock around 1970. If so, this approach backfired before the blank generation because the film was not a success. * 1/2 of ****
