Impressive. I saw McCool one night yesterday and all I can say is "Wow". Here I go. IMPORTANT SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Would you like a summary of the plot, just to see how stupid and pointless this movie is? I would never tell anyone to see it, unless I wanted to hurt them. Anyway, here's a little insight (or a big part) of the plot. <br /> <br /> Randy works for a bar, McCool's. He meets with this woman named Jewel, who persuades him to have sex with him, surprisingly. Her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to rob her and gets killed. Randy and his cousin and the crime scene detective stand out for Jewel. She is the mascot of stupidity and uses each of these guys to get what she wants, including a DVD player. Randy hires a killer to kill her, and eventually the detective is killed by ex-boyfriend's psycho-brother and the killer and Jewel take off. <br /> <br /> Seriously. That's it. I hardly missed anything except a few more sex scenes and an almost pornographic scene where Liv Tyler used a tube as Jewel to show off her sexuality. What was the purpose of this movie? To be honest, I think the producers and directors could show their male urge. What I believe is absolutely inappropriate and just stupid. When I see a movie, I want an action. I want characters. I'm not interested in sexy women who are flaunting anything they could have. For heaven's sake, something should happen in a movie. That's as bad as the Fight Club. <br /> <br /> It gets worse. John Goodman is the detective dedicated to the higher being. I myself wondered why Goodman would play something as outrageous as this, but then I remembered that he was in O Brother, where are you? also. His reputation has just improved a lot. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler was an amazing actress in the Lord of the Rings series. In this movie, she is nothing more than a dumb bitch who wants nothing but her way. Your reputation has decreased by seven or eight points for me. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed, just amazed that people would work so hard to do something so stupid. The music is absolutely crappy (playing with "YMCA" while killing John Goodman's character does not really suit), the characters are absolutely unlikely. it does not even fit into a genre. Next comes a pornographic comedy. If it should be funny at all. What it was not. <br /> <br /> I think I'm done with the talking now. But let me just assure you that no one who is sane will ever want to see this movie. If they do not crave Liv Tyler as much as the characters, that's it.
