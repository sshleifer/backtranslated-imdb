It had potential ... it really did. But there is so much about the film that was ridiculous and ridiculous. I'm a horror movie, and I thought that was stupid. like my 13-year-old! I expected to get out of it at least. And yes, the gross factor of the vines writhing in man was there; The preparation for the ruins, however, is just stupid, stupid, stupid. with a little water and some snacks ... IN FLIP FLOPS, NO LESS ?! Puh-lease! Even better, who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourism sector without an interpreter or able to speak some language? Are these people idiots? <br /> <br /> You hear nothing of your German brother and do not call for help? Who does not do that? He finds only a few Greeks and Americans to search and find something?
