This is a poor attempt to spin the old "cons turn good" yarn that we have seen so often. It actually reminded me of the American series "The Players," though it was not nearly so good. Omar Epps, the tough guy in the group, is totally unconvincing, as is Ribisi, whose attempt to be the funny guy is lost along the way. The performance of Danes was decent and you can see in this performance why it was filled in Terminator 4. The MOD Squad is a movie that lies in a kind of gray area between thriller and comedy. Sometimes it takes serious, but sometimes it tries to be funny, but fails miserably. The film has a kind of half-finished feel - as if it were stretched to the 90-minute mark. <br /> <br /> You will be disappointed.
