I've just spent the last half hour reading the other reviews, and I do not know if I want to laugh or cry. There is no way that ADJL looks like Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, Fairly OddParents, or any other magical world that has almost been exaggerated. ADJL anime is not a way either. Anime is a drawing style (and some say more, like plot and Japanese origin). Either way, ADJL is not an anime. Stop saying, and if you're looking for something that's like anime, look elsewhere. like Teen Titans and Avatar. <br /> <br /> ADJL is typical. It's just like all other Disney shows. An arrogant main character child who believes he knows everything and does not bother to listen to the elderly and continues to make the same mistakes. Best friend Sidekicks. Repeated plot with a hint of twist. And sibling rivalry. Can not they even create a character who has a brain and is not filled with himself? Can not they have children who respect their elders? Can not you imagine something different with the plot? Can not siblings get along and hate each other? ADJL is just too general, because you also have bad guys who are defeated and come back, and are also complete idiots who have no background for their hatred. Come on, you'll think that someone who is at least 30 years old can outdo a 13-year-old. ADJL is like watching everything else on TV today and over again. Nothing special, just new design characters and a little idea that has been used over and over again.
