Does not that seem to be known? Wait, that's right. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been made in the TV series. What's the point, if you repeat yourself, maybe you ask? Is it the Americans who did not see the program? Do the scriptwriters no longer have inspiration? Or maybe everyone on the set had a sudden attack of amnesia and forgot that they had already covered that floor? For someone who had gone through the first three series, it was just boring. I had to turn it off during the 'tablet that turns your water green'. If the best you can imagine is Leonard Rossiter's hiring of Saturday Night Fever, you can forget it. <br /> <br /> The guy you had to replace the late Richard Beckinsale is fine, but not the half actor I personally would exorcise the role as a token of respect for him. Or better yet, not to disturb the movie at all, and let the hilarity of the TV series speak for itself. But no, they could not ... as long as money could not be earned. Sorry, really. 4.10
