When Pam Grier made COFFY in 1973, it was an exciting but flawed film. The plot was hard and satisfying - even if the acting was often amateurish. It was so successful that American International Pictures decided to rework the formula the following year with FOXY BROWN - not a bad movie, but almost "COFFY II". Now, just a year later, the studio had apparently given up creating something new for Mrs. Grier, as SHEBA, BABY was essentially the same conspiracy of COFFY and FOXY BROWN. Since the idea was so recycled and the drama and drama are so tired and energy efficient, it really scrapes the bottom of the blaxploitation barrel. Just like these other films, SHEBA, BABY begins with some Native Black gangsters forcing someone to love Pam Grier. In the past, it had been drug dealers and pimps, now it was gangsters trying to get all the credit companies and pawnbrokers out of the city to conquer the market. And like the other movies, Pam is a one-woman hit group that misses justice and a good butt. And like the other movies, there's a "cat fight" between Pam and a white woman right in front of "Mr. Big". And like the other films, Mr. Big is a white man who pulls all the strings. And like the other films, she is also captured by Mr. Big. And like the other films, he does not kill her immediately, but gives her plenty of opportunity to escape (here he leaves a knife lying around comfortably). And like the other movies, she finally gets free and kills his jive - @ $$. <br /> <br /> Although this formula appeared interesting in 1973, it was evidently a predictable boredom through this film. Even if you had not seen the other films, it was still bad because the action was so slow - the beating and kicking seemed so slow and staged. The same could be said for the weapon game. In one scene, four men attack with machine guns, an AR-15 and shotguns. Pam reacts by opening the fire with a .357 revolver and killing 3 of the 4 and making the other surrender !!! Even if she got a good shot she was pretty slow and the boys just seemed to wait until she killed them !!! Even a World Champion shooter or Rambo could not succeed with such one-sided chances - after all, these guys had very impressive weapons and they were already focused on them when they "cleverly" whipped out their pistol and were easily dropped off these professional hitmen !! <br /> <br /> Apart from slow and lame action scenes compared to other Blaxpoitation films, the film has many logical gaps that show the writing was awful, but the studio just did not care. In one case, her boyfriend "Williams" knew about the yacht and the Nu-tronic at the end of the movie, but Pam never told him - how did he know that? In another, the cops are approaching a boat filled with bonnets, and the bonnet immediately opens the fire. However, the cops had no evidence that anything happened, and the crooks began to shoot with little provocation. And the crooks had .30 caliber machine guns and other amazingly powerful weapons, but in many cases they were killed by police officers with snapshot noses! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is a great example of "been there / done that ... a whole lot better". I love blaxploitation movies, but this movie is just too stupid and too slow to earn a reputation except by very loyal fans of the genre.
