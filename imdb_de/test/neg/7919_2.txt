I think that this is a disappointing continuation. I miss many of the old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I do not like it, because not even half of the original voices are responsible for the characters again. Charlie lost a lot of personality, and the villain Red is not even half as bad as Carface in the first one. If you're a big ADGTH fan like me, it's worth it to see how the story continues, but do not expect to have 5 stars in your book.
