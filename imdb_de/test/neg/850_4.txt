Following the success of 1975, this film is a cheap story of a plantation where Massa goes down with the slave women and the Missus with the big black stud and the son of Massa'a. In fact, there are so many problems that I really do not know why someone bothered to get dressed. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to see white women slaving their naked bodies up everywhere, or you're like a movie showing a breast every five minutes, this one is here for them. <br /> <br /> There's a funny / sad story here, but it only comes at the very end so as not to interfere with all the hot, sweaty sex on the plantation.
