a boring, terrible piece of Italian Euro trash about a scientist who spends most of his time drinking beer (that's what makes him American, right?) Our scientists spend most of their academic lives out of their heads, surely all really big ones Theories come from) who studies something (dolphin calls, fish migration patterns, who knows). He hears a strange noise from his headphones, proving that his radio receives a station in Jamaica. At the same time, a Jack Skellington girl is trying to calm down the dolphins in the Seaquarium she's working on because she's obviously annoyed with one of the worst, most bleached bad hair manes of the '80s I've ever seen Amount of fish she has spent lately. The beginning of the film was a really badly colored plot about two annoying, very Italian people whose boat is attacked by something you have not seen under water. The vain woman is never seen again (the best part of the story), and the boys' body is found without legs. The cloudy, alcohol-critical scientist (who has an inexplicable English-American-Italian accent) and the stick girl with the hay hair are beginning to theorize that some kind of giant monster lurking beneath the seas off the shores of Italy ... um. .Florida. <br /> <br /> You are calling for the help of an electrician to set up an underwater microphone so the monster can sing karaoke. This guy has a beautiful girlfriend whose only downside is that he pronounced Peter "Pey-tah", but for some reason, sexually attracts him to the anatomical skeleton with the frizzy hair, a situation that makes one blink > The dubbing is terrible, the editor a spaz and the action generally a yawn. There's a little bit of how this weird science company genetically altered this monster giant shark octopus barracuda thing for some reason that makes no sense. A stupid sheriff and his cramped deputy are traveling with a scientist (who we know to be smart because she's wearing huge glasses). At one point, the scientist takes on the huge, horrible monster (yes, right, Ed Wood's Giant Squid was more believable) with just a small hand ax, and she wins the contest. Hurray for skinny little women who are obviously the best monster hunters! <br /> <br /> The solution to the Giant Thing problem is to blow up half of the Everglades and leave a dead zone for several kilometers in each direction. To hell with ecology and the environment, right? We have to kill this huge monster! In the end, the electrician and his sweetheart rode on their Vespa into the sunset. since she survived the deaths of her colleagues and he is not very upset that his girlfriend was beaten by the crazy guy with the greasy hair. Hooray for true love! Wait a minute, is not everything lazy?
