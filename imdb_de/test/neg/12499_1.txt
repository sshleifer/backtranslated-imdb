This movie was sooo bad. It was not funny at all. Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny. Oh man, that bad. Thumbs down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Wonderful, Soul Man and probably one or two more. Chris Kattan worst as a high school janitor who is a talented dancer and runs a dance studio in a warehouse. He has a jealous girlfriend who breaks his ankle and her dance floor goes to the cute blonde rookie Chris has eyes for. I really thought the acting was bad. I like to laugh at loud comedies, it was not. "Not Another Teen Movie" was not funny, but had many more funny scenes than Totally Awesome. "Scary Movie" is super funny. I always laugh when I see them, very enjoyable. This movie is not funny.
