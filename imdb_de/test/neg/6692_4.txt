The strawberry blonde has a great script. But I wish Errol Flynn would be there instead of James Cagney, he's not the person for the role. I think Olivia did a great job. This movie is also a daydream, so it's hard to follow. I do not like the attitude of men. The way Cagney imagined it was over. I give him a 3 for bad behavior by male protagonist. (If you like tough men who like to fight and argue, this is your movie). The Strawberry Blonde would have been better if the main character had rather had a positive attitude and changed the script so that he is happy he is with Oliva. This film points out that money brings no luck, women really jokes plain and simple, not the best movie, but everyone has to decide for themselves.
