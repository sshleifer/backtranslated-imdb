Attention, possible spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it actually makes fun. The director has inserted all the stereotypes that have ever plagued B series films. The stupid fool (nice frame) is repeatedly caught by the bad guys, bosses grin and reveal his conspiracies before they happen, so that they can be ruined and who have harassed / killed the father of the hero in an unclear past. Side step in the person a policeman - short, bald and his only preparation for the final battle (another clich√©) is that he returns his baseball cap to the back, and so on. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is at the top. After the chief villain dies, when the hero Paralised Stoneface Jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a ten-story building, they go out of the building. This looks only three stories high from the outside and resembles your regular town hall. <br /> <br /> When leaving the building, the side kick can not run as his right leg seems to be injured. How can nobody say: ten minutes ago he fell in his shoulder and his feet were okay. There is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the beholder, the curious things like "Where is the villain's body that should be near the building?" and "Why do not policemen or curious people gather around the corpse?" <br /> <br /> I could continue the list forever. Why is another villain claiming to have invented martial arts when kicked in the ass in no time? Why do bad guys generally make stupid moves when attacking? Why does the hero look so dizzy? Is there really someone who thinks "Yeah, these characters and this action make this movie an unforgettable experience"? And the actors suck. Our hero and savior of the day wears the same expression on his face. The whole movie. This disgusted attempt to be a cheeky grin must be a copyrighted accomplishment by him. <br /> <br /> Also, the thought that so far 12% of the people who rated this movie gave it a 10, makes me inwardly terrified. Maybe they were serious and then we are doomed to fail.
