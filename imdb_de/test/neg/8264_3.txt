Masters Horror: Sounds Like plays in Seattle, where Larry Pearce works as a manager of a computer software call center. He has lost his 6-year-old son Michael (Nicholas Elia) to a rare heart disease in which he has an extremely sensitive ear. Larry hears everything tenfold, from people typing on computer keyboards, people whispering in the room, people knocking on the floor with their feet, taps dripping, and even the breathing of people becomes unbearable for Larry as he keeps going bombarded with penetrating noise. Eventually, Larry decides that he has had enough, and if he can not stop the sounds himself, then maybe he can stop listening to them with the help of a big meat-claw ... <br /> <br /> This Canadian American coproduction was episode 4 from season 2 of the most-watched Masters of Horror television series, written and directed by Brad Anderson. I thought Sounds Like would definitely be a miss. The script was based on a short story by Mike O'Driscoll. I'm really surprised how many positive comments there are on the IMDb right now. At first it would be very difficult to describe this as a horror movie & it feels more like a bizarre sentimental drama until the last 5 minutes Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero and the guys from KNB effects are actually working. Larry has this strange inexplicable ability to amplify sound and sounds from the start, so after 55 minutes this episode ends up exactly the same kind of repetitive buildup, leading to a bloody ending, even though it's too late for the episode rescue. This is pretty slow, and although it's well written, it should not be horrible, and I'm a little confused about who it should be. <br /> <br /> Director Anderson is OK, but he just keeps doing the same things over and over again, until there's not a single drop of blood in the whole thing in the last 5 minutes. There is no horror, there is no fear or tension and absolutely no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically, this is very well done, has good production values ​​and does not look like a cheap TV program. The acting is really good and it is a pity that the story is a bit limited. <br /> <br /> Sounds Like one of the worst Masters of Horror episodes, many people seem to like it and that's fine, but it's definitely not for me. Another master of horror, another disappointment.
