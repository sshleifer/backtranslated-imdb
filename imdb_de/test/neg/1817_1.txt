I felt that the last night episode was slow and somehow boring. I honestly do not think it has anything to do with writing. Because I know that the story was well staged and tried to keep things in place. I did not think it was that bad, but overall I did not like it. Most of the blame has to do with the director of this episode - Stephen Williams. I always hated Stephen Williams directing. If Jack Bender continues with this episode of the season premiere, he would have kept her at a good pace and kept things floating to keep things interesting. I'm glad Jack Bender is directing next week and it's getting a lot better. I'm glad he got the first Syaid episode as a director, and I'm curious what he's going to do this time since Stephen Williams directed too many Syaid episodes. <br /> <br /> I always think that Stephen Williams has to be thrown out of the show. He does not even do anything interesting with the show. <br /> <br /> Why does the opening have to be done with a target while in the helicopter? It was so boring! Also bad view on the camera work!
