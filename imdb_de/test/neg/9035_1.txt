I just watched this movie the way it was on TV and I had nothing else to do. I went to IMDb right here to check out the Trivia site and randomly look at the user comments. And what do I find? Any stupid idiot elevates this movie to heaven! I would not even have written anything, but if no one else takes the time to spread about this stupid ass movie, I thought I could. The worst was the guy who played Brian Wilson (I think I got the name right) when he was playing exaggerated, especially when he was high. The rest was not as bad as he was, but nobody was good either. I'm not an expert on the beach boys, but I really can not complain so much about the story. No motivation for one of the character choices, but hey, maybe they were idiots in real life. And worst of all, I thought I thought it was going to be a movie about the beach boys, but you really only have a few characters under control. I hate it when they do that in movies, the same in the doors, though I like this movie more. No more energy to write more ... it was shit! do not buy or watch
