I had bought it again and again in the rental business and wondered if I should try it. Today I broke down and did it, and I probably should not have done that. <br /> <br /> Although the author / director gave the film a handsome effort, he was well behind the intervention. Although the characters did not feel they had it, they did not have enough depth or development to really deal with them. Sara's sexual outbursts became tiring - fast. I have nothing against sex in movies, and I do not care about fucking characters, but being a "bad" girl does not mean you tend to ask people randomly if they want sexual favors. When it turned out what had happened to the characters, I was bored and ready to prepare for the climax, the end, everything exciting ... and nothing delivered. The things the people in the story are finally telling you seem to be forced and unrealistic and just were not played right. If they had thrown in something more scary, that would have interested me. This should have been more of an exciting / dramatic film, and would have stuck to the title "Jon Good's Wife" rather than the entire "red right hand" and horror movie cover. Hell ... that should have been tension, period. <br /> <br /> Either way ... look at it on a rainy day or late at night when there's nothing on TV. Although not as great as I had hoped for, I would opt for some infomercials.
