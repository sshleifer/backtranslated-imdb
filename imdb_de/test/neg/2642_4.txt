"Milo" is another answer to a question no one has ever asked. Do we really need more slashers? I think we already have more than enough. I think the professional, overpowering types are overwhelmed, so we're dealing with a murderous kid. Also a zombie or a ghost if he feels like it. He drowned a long time ago, but that did not bother him and he still kills people ("Friday the 13th," what's that?). One day his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise Milo comes to visit them. With some really bad shots showing everything except the murders, the cast is throttled until only the last girl is left to hear Milo's dumb mystery. She and her friends wanted to know. When Milo finds out, he makes another murderous raid (is not it already his bedtime?) And the girl, well, she screams a lot. Acting is not even the end of the barrel. the barrel refuses to be associated with him. Milo can be an eerie bastard, from time to time I give him that, but some movies can not be saved without a great script or unnecessary nudity.
