This is a piece of Hollywood product that should never have left a movie. Dialogue without plausible thoughts, plotting without a point, staging without skill, directing without directing and acting without the value of a Backwater High School beginner's play. The entire cast should have been arrested for excessive acting. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, okay!
