The films use bluish black and vibrant skin tones to give this film a noir feeling, unfortunately not work. In fact, it is quite irritating because it obscures the demonic characters and reduces them to one-dimensional beings. <br /> <br /> At least the original had a hysterical energy and the bloody set pieces were pretty awesome. Black Gore is hardly scary, and even the female lead demon is not at all scary when she tries to growl on her screen in her best camp Lugosi style and growling 'Naked Lunch' directed by Russ Meyer likes the attempt of William Burroughs -esque, appreciate. Otherwise, give this movie a wide scope. The Bava and Argento fans are again bitterly disappointed.
