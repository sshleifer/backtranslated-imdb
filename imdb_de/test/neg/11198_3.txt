I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was a poorly written and bad-looking echo of the people I know. <br /> <br /> Great moments between the characters? including many scenes from Temuera Morrison and Lawrence Makoares together? were often destroyed by long and verbose monologues through which the actors had to stumble. Beautiful and ill-fitting phrases rustled in particular from Lawrence, as if he were the new Maori Messiah in his pulpit with beer crates. When I watch a movie with Maori actors, I find I can do that. Always pick half a dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life. With Crooked Earth, I struggled to find a key character that was true for two hours. Most ?? including wiremu and peka? ended up saying or doing things that I did not understand and could not connect with. At the end of the film, the author managed to alienate the audience, where the Maori were unable to relate to it, and the Pakeha was therefore given permission to fire the film. My feeling is that the movies are message ?? or at least the bulk of several who were struck by the audience? is important enough to avoid the use of character extremities. Unfortunately, no one who read the script before it was shot thought of this 'Eyes Wide Shut' advice. The audience was not so subtle that one laughed, cried, or was angry when the music changed. It reminded me of Darth Vader's introductory music in Star Wars: obviously and mildly amusing. <br /> <br /> I think there are some people who like this movie. It's funny in part, has a lot of action and some really powerful scenes. Calvin Tuteao and Quentin Hita also did jobs. On the whole, however, I did not enjoy the experience the way I should. Barb Wire, Speed ​​2, The Island of Dr. Moreau and Crooked Earth look like they're Tem's quartet of crap.
