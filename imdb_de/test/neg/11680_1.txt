This is by far one of the most challenging films I have ever seen. It's a close hit on the face of some Indians who speak English and look in the mirror. disgusting. the bubble gum version of the 70s politics of the north Indian plains. the message - the educated English-speaking Indian tried to rescue the poor beggars of India with all sincerity. it ignores the fact that the poor beggars are also able to save themselves. The problem is that the development of the love story and character is based on a completely fraudulent version of politics.
