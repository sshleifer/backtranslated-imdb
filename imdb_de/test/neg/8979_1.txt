This is by far the worst British comedy that, according to the first episode, has managed not to speak of the pilot. The play is weak from the main character, who is played by Ben Miller to Sarah Alexander (from the fantastic coupling) to the cast. The plot / action was not atmospheric and very predictable with many worn ideas. A very painful series that had to be endured but unfortunately placed between two excellent shows. When describing it as a British response to "Meet the Parents," it's a disadvantage to "meet the parents" and is as fresh as an old shoe that plays around with the family dog. Britain should have known that rip-offs from other countries never work, considering America's sad attempts.
