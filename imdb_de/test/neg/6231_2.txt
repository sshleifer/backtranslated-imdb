I love most Jet Li movies (except Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie in a VERY cheap 3 pack of The Master and Twin Warriors. Although Twin Warriors was very impressive and I was totally fascinated by it, and the Master was a bit "Karate Kid", but also enjoyable, but I thought this movie would be terrible. I'm not just saying that because I'm used to better movies. I say that it was almost "Kazaam". The battle scenes were awful (blurry cameras and no real fights) and the plot was your typical "stupid kung fu act". If you want to have a conspiracy that is so stupid (see 'The man becomes a woman to become almighty, then falls in love with Jet Li'), then it's best to have some good fights. If you are looking for an original HK Jet Li film, we recommend that you rent "Shaolin Temple 2" (aka Kids from Shaolin).
