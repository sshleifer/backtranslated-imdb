I find it almost touching how the Star Trek fans, in spite of their incredible number of bugs, desperately try to like this movie. <br /> <br /> At first, none of the familiar characters are in their character, so to speak. Scotty is portrayed as a hulking hobbyist, instead of the engineer skilled in the original series. Uhura ... gods, I can not even think about what they did with their character. All their conversations were painful to hear. McCoy seemed to be a neurotic stepfather to Kirk and not his trusted friend. Spock ... well, let's just say, Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted. He got a bad dialogue ("I do not think you have understood the gravity of your situation, Captain." Gravity, get it? Get it?) And almost made a buffoon. Kirk ... oh man, do not start me. William Shatner is initially a hammy actor, so it's really a disaster we get when he's allowed to direct. That's what we got. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely ridiculous. Giving Spock a brother is a rather desperate act that goes unnecessarily into the soap. But hey, let's start with that. The search for God. Again a weak basis for action. Do not you think? OK, let's start with that, too. Suppose the two aforementioned plots are sound. What's wrong with it? First, it recycles far too much. For example, the company is not working properly again. Should we assume that Starfleet would send a seriously damaged ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to dominate the situation? If so, why not put him on a better ship as a consultant? In addition ... the crew is grossly incompetent. Scotty has the ship in pieces (and apparently lumpy enough to drive his head into unconsciousness when hostilities are aboard!), Nobody seems to notice the Klingon ship's decay at a crucial moment (despite the fact that the sensors the ship is present in the weapon area) and the crew seems to be too familiar. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. If this is the flagship of Starfleet, it's a wonder the Klingons did not overthrow the Federation already. <br /> <br /> As for the personal struggles with the pain, it was crap. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he could not save this turkey. In short, nobody could. I imagine that Leonard Nimoy is the most embarrassing of all involved. I hope it is anyway. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, the original cast did not bow to this shabby opus.
