I looked forward to watching this movie, and it has very interesting perspectives on Iraqis from all over the country, not just in the big ones. <br /> <br /> However, while the movie went on and it seemed like I was getting more one-sided and wondering who had edited the movie. To reduce a few hundred hours to just 80 minutes, of course, decisions had to be made. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed a movie that showed how the Iraqis felt on all sides of the issues, but with the newspaper headlines contrary to what people said, and all in the movie in the end had the same opinion, I considered it obvious that the cut was done with a pre-made bias. <br /> <br /> could have been such a great movie.
