OK, a movie about a movie that makes a rip when filming videos might be entertaining. Could, should, be funny, nervous, even controversial or at least interesting, and yet ... This movie is the negative version of Bizzaro. Hamlin was entertaining as a 'B' movie producer. Shatner played crazy and yet sympathetic and had the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. The production value was lame. You actually see the boom in a scene. The sound was terrible in some scenes. Hey, I'm a big fan of Shatners and Hamlin now, but their talents are wasted here. At least the story had a clich√©d ending.
