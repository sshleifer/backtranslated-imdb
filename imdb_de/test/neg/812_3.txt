Outside of Sweden you are not expected to have seen this movie. I'm glad. The cast includes several actors who represent an important part of modern Swedish film history. And yet ... <br /> <br /> Peter Dalle apparently had only an idea that lasted about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is completely abused in this film to copy a younger GÃ¶sta Ekman. Incidentally, Ekman is the only actor to live up to expectations. <br /> <br /> The credit that can be given refers to the photo, a great idea with black and white. Music is OK. <br /> <br /> But on the whole it's a waste of god-actors and the time of the audience.
