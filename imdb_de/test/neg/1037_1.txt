If you're not interested in seeing 2-hour scenic mountain shots with hysterical characters, lots of histrionics, and cheap 70s (not much of it), I'd recommend avoiding this movie. It is long-winded, over-long and has a pretty annoying amateur feeling. Masterpiece? No, an average thriller shot on average in a beautiful Italian landscape. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of slow 1970s movies when there's a plan to please and entertain you. In this case it did not work for me. The plot is banal, interwoven with superficial and stereotypical characters, supported by hilarious, angry mobs and your typical Italian widow, all dressed in black. The movie may be worth seeing, as the scenery itself is spectacular and quite breathtaking. This film is nothing out of the ordinary, there are much better Italian horror films than these. Not much else than a yawning party. 5.10
