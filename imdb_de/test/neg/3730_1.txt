The feeling of seeing and enjoying Minnesota is absolutely the worst (** movie with A-list stars) I've ever seen. No bar. This movie fails on all levels. It is poorly photographed and edited. There are uninspired spectacles, the way in which the actors seem bored out of their heads. Maybe just collect paychecks? And worst of all, the muddy writing seems to have been created under the influence of some unpleasant substance that can only be found in the sewers. I can not begin to understand how the author / director could ever have found someone to fund this project, let alone attract one of the stars that made it. I really wish I could get back the time I spent with this garbage. If possible, I would have rated this film with zero. Better still a negative number.
