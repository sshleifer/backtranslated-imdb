Combine good casting, bad writing, good orchestral scoring, bad dialogue and a good idea idea with a lot of potential. However, they are never realized if you have slipstream. <br /> <br /> Just bought the movie for a money, it's worth it, but not much else. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Mark Hamill again. <br /> <br /> A proper sequel should be made to fix the damage from the original. Or at least give him the right attention he should have received. <br /> <br /> Berstein's results demanded your attention from the opening credits, but the long beats of the slipstreams and the even longer exposure of interesting plot points were cushioned to get his attention. <br /> <br /> It's really easy to watch a movie like this, after all, it's the producer of STARWARS and the director of TRON and an incredible cast, but it's what it is. And that is not much. <br /> <br /> Favorite Line- "We'll make it, ha-ha! ... (BOOM!)"
