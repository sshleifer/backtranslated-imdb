Slayer is a pointless vampire movie with a few twists on an old plan. Special Ops team is sent to South America to hunt blood-sucking natives. Your leader is a real old man who has aged well. The vampires attack villages because the rainforest and the old food of wild animals disappear because of the greedy companies and farmers. Fighting and losing so much blood that they never bothered to wash the cast for the entire movie. It looks like they slept in the bloody clothes and baked with blood. While each member of the cast brought their own talents, it did not really click as a movie. The effects were okay, except for the vampires dangling from the buildings on wires. If you are looking for a lot of blood and violence, this is for you.
