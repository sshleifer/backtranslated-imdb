This movie was awful. It was so terrible. <br /> <br /> Most annoying was the way the process was conducted. The defense attorney may continue to move in interrogating a witness without the prosecutor objecting. He attacks the children brought to testify with ferocious wildness and repeatedly yells at them that they are lying. These are not things that children are sexually abused. The trial is stupid and ruins the whole movie ... (Law & Order has corrupted me for the accuracy of the courtroom).
