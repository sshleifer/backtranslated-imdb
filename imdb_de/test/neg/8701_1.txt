I really wish Hollywood would come up with new ideas and quickly. Instead, they go around and make a perfectly good movie with a re-make. This movie is terrible of the DeMille version. Throughout the movie, I said, Huh ??? - What ???? - I do not remember this part. The only exciting thing in this film was farewell to the Red Sea. And in the version of Heston - it was much better than this version. Has anybody else seen how an atomic bomb or nuclear bomb was faded in and out during the separation of the Red Sea? I think I did. Anyway, I could - could - see the last part tonight. <br /> <br /> I wish Hollywood would deal with different ideas and issues as they shoot new films. Instead of hashing old movies again. <br /> <br /> You should be left alone well enough. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: <br /> <br /> Well, I have watched the last part. If Moses invented the second copy of the Ten Commandments with his own hand - or did I see things - ask someone - email me and let me know. DREADFUL
