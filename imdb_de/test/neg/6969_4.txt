Directed and described by the famous / notorious Edward D. Wood Jr. With a pseudonym (Daniel Davis) starring Glen / Glenda. This is an almost radical documentary about transvestism; Wood himself is a transvestite with a fetish for angora pullover. It seems to be miles of footage and an incoherent Bela Lugosi is used to stretch this strange and awkward movie to 67 minutes. Police Inspector (Lyle Talbot) asks for clarification from a psychiatrist, dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) to better understand the emotions and disposition of transvestites, Captain DeZita and Woods sister Evelyn. Noteworthy: Farrell also acts as a narrator. Later Fuller helped write songs included in the Elvis Presley films BLUE HAWAII, KISSIN COUSINS & KID GALAHAD.
