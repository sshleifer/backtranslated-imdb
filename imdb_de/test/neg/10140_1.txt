Reba sucks. It sucks hard. It's about this terrible country singer trying a comedy. You can call this show "Generic" as well, because that's the way it is. It is stupid and generic. Reba, you are not funny and I am glad that your back show was canceled because you are sucking. Brock, Barbra Jean, the red-haired teenager, this jockey guy, and the 12-year-old who was beaten up. They are all shit and none of them is funny. Oh, and I've heard rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil worshiper who adores Hitler and tortures animals. And she puts subliminal messages in her show and in her "music" in the hope that children will kill their parents and kill themselves! But it was just a rumor. Anyway, this is the worst show ever. Reba is gay. I do not like her. I think The Office is better than this show, and this show is shit.
