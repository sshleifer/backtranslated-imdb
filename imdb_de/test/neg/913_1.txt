Guys, get a hint! I mean, the authors do not have any, so I would expect that ... this show is such a pale imitation of the '60s show that you can laugh about it! and the sixties is the one with the cheap special effects and is in b & w fer chrissakes! The mood and the writing in the old show, however, is MILES before this hustle and bustle. Get HiP Kids! If 98 degrees or Brittany asks you to see it, you would! You know it! Just bypass it and tell all your friends that you were "IN" with the "scene" BEFORE it got too cool!
