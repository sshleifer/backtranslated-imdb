Granted, you can drop a model airplane against a black background and call it Sci-Fi. That's enough to interest me. So, if you are, Black Horizon will at least interest you before you look at it. The best part of the movie is when it reuses some recent shots of a shuttle launch. <br /> <br /> The movie is played like the Naked Gun series, and cop dramas are faked with bad clich√©s and bad drama. Unfortunately, I do not think they should be funny, the actors are really cardboard, the dialogue is really shitty, so they just have to laugh about it and not with them. <br /> <br /> On Side note: It's rare to see a movie that's half in space, half on Earth, and does not mix with the expected aliens and supernatural events. I really appreciate more realistic drama based on our space travel efforts.
