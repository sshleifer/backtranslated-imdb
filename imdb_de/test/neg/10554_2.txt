Wow, Kiss the Bride was not that bad, but not so good either. It certainly was not a "Later Day Saint". The film sank in the middle ... maybe a break of about 30 minutes would have made a more enjoyable movie. But the movie is always thrown away by annoying subplots and scenes - the whole gold outing sequence comes to my mind. <br /> <br /> Although "Kiss" was made for the movie release, it looks more like a movie made for TV. Every scene is illuminated like a department store. So many characters are thrown away. <br /> <br /> And the dear Tori is indeed a pleasant surprise. She steals every scene in which she appears. <br /> <br /> One scene really annoyed me. It was the rehearsal dinner in this larger room with many tables - all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250! Where did everybody go? <br /> <br /> The gay cinema has dropped to a new low ... but not as deep as the horrible films produced and shown on the Here! Channel.
