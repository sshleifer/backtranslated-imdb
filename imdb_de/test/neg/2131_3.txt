I wish I could have said something more positive about Devil Fish, but I honestly can not think of much. I can not think of many of these "so bad, it's good" moments. Devil Fish is just bad. The plot is completely distracted (Jaws, anyone?), The drama is wooden, the characters are uninteresting, the special effects are beyond bad and the score is annoying. Add the seemingly inappropriate direction of Lamberto Bava and you have a stinker of a movie. However, I think the biggest sin of the movie is the lack of a budget. It does not seem that Bava had much to do. In 1984, the Italian film industry was completely in decline. especially when it comes to genre films. The resources available to Bava were very likely to be very poor. Films like Devil Fish, which rely on special effects, never had a chance to be good. It is not the only Italian film that suffers this fate. There are a number of Italian films made in the mid-'80s that far outperformed ideas and concepts that anyone could realistically expect due to budget constraints. <br /> <br /> After saying all this and noting the many flaws in the movie, I can not get Devil Fish to score less than 3/10. I've even considered upgrading it, but it can not, because I realize how bad a movie is. Why do not I rate it lower? That's hard to explain. Despite the many problems that can be found in the film, there is something about Devil Fish that I inexplicably like. It could be as simple as my love of cheap, cheesy Italian movies. Maybe my taste in movies is terribly distorted, but I like what I like. <br /> <br /> The treatment of Devil Fish by the Mystery Science Theater 3000 is really gratifying. I rate Devil Fish as 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale. The boys are doing a good job of making fun of the movie's many mistakes. A very subtle observation comes very early in the commentary, as Tom Servo states, "Just because you can work does not mean you should"? another of the many weaknesses that can be found in Devil Fish.
