As I write this user comment, Tim Burton's interpretation of the Sweeney Todd story at the box office earns a lot of money, and the film even earned some Oscar nominations, if I'm not mistaken. I have not seen it yet, but I sincerely hope that Burton did not look for inspiration and / or stylish brands in Andy Milligan's "Bloodthirsty Butchers" of good old Andy Milligan. Yes, although the title Metzger clearly refers to, the main characters of the plot are a barber (the infamous Sweeney Todd) and a baker. Together, they form a hideous alliance in which he kills the customers in his shop and processes the corpses into their famous London meat pies. In other words, an Andy Milligan premise of his most typical, distracted, delirious and amateurish. I think the IMDb rating for this movie speaks for itself. Although the real story is definitely not the worst I've ever seen, Milligan somehow inexplicably attracts mischief. The production is a gigantic mess, with an incoherent narrative structure, really vile photographs, low light conditions, lousy plays and directing, ridiculous tension and atmosphere. More than half of the footage is pure upholstery, and words do not describe how boring the movie is, even with a running time of just 80 minutes. Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Mattei; You are not afraid, there is none other than Andy Milligan? Hands down ?? the worst director ever, but I do not think it means anything to him. If you have a very high level of tolerance, Bloodthirsty Butchers may be worth a look.
