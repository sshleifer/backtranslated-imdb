This is another pseudo-intellectual film "Let's make the Nazis look really bad". The Nazis were undoubtedly pretty bad - most people already know that. However, that does not necessarily make every movie on the subject good. A Discovery Channel presentation of "The Wannsee Conference" would have been much more interesting. <br /> <br /> "Conspiracy" falls into two categories: documentary and drama. It is not a documentary, the film is too "staged" and the presentation too "usual". It is not drama, the characters are too shallow and conflicts too easily "solved". <br /> <br /> Another thing is the slogan: "One of the greatest crimes against humanity has just been committed. One hour." As the film shows the Wannsee conference, the meeting had nothing to do with a consensus on the final solution. The decision on the solution has already been made by the SS. The sole purpose of the meeting was to commit all key stakeholders to a plan that had already been set. No decisions or plans were made at the Wannsee conference. There were only threats and coercion (some needed less than others). <br /> <br /> Finally, one thing the film shows (though not extraordinary) is that man has a tendency to grapple with culture and aesthetics, an attempt to conceal the fact that he is horrific Cruelty commits. This is evident in most "makers" politicians and politicians.
