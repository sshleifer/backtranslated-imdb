I absolutely could not believe how unworthy this production is. I honestly thought gay men had a better taste than that. I know I do that. <br /> <br /> The bulk of the blame is not in the cast, but let's get them out of the way first ... the only one with real talent was Joe Souza (plus he had the best character in the cast). He had a nice, clear theatrical voice. Okay, and Jaymes Hodges's voice was so-so, but he had a blank expression on every number. The rest could not keep a note in a bucket, although the music was apparently synchronized after the fact. It really must have been terrible to hear them live. They were all girls too, except maybe three. If I wanted to see naked WOMEN on stage, I could go to the bars. Not sure why anyone would opt for the production of L.A. instead of New York. I would imagine that there is more singing talent available in New York, although L.A. would think they could find better-looking boys. Apparently not. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... the real fault lies with the creators and producers. This score was the most banal, dullest trip I've ever heard. It sounded like some theater queens had taken all their musical CDs, thrown them into a blender, and poured the goo on one side. I'm sure there are many who can not tell the difference between writing good drama and whatever that is. I mean, seriously, I laughed the whole ass, but not the lame jokes. I think the morbid "My Lover Died of AIDS Song" titled "Kris, look what you've missed" was the hysterical one in the whole show. Genius writing ... Kris / Missing ... wow ... They are almost rhyme ... must be a good lyric. And Jesus ... the end of this song ... "Oh Kris, Ohhh Kris, OHHHHH Kris ..." ABOUT AND ABOUT !!! My other favorite was "You have to be a Pumpy Junkie Boy to be a Humpy Hunkie Boy" ... WTF ??? The whole show was full of the most arbitrary lyrics just because they rhymed. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently they heard Sondheim and said, "He's not that great, I can do that ..." as the belated reference "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby" by COMPANY proves in a song. Another madman: Why are the 20-year-olds singing about Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Obviously, they come out of the lyricist's mouth and not the actors ... bad writing again. <br /> <br /> If you love torture and pain and I know that many of you strange fetishists do, look at this. But you were warned.
