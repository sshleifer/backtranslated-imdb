Terrible, terrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> I loved the original movie. It was funny, charming and had heart ... this piece of garbage has NO of these things. Reused jokes from the original film, stupid plans, bad animations, different voices (with the exception of Kronk and Yzma) that sounds NOTHING like the original (especially Pacha ... * shudder *). <br /> <br /> The characters are not in the model, the animation is flat and boring, it's just a bad job all around. <br /> <br /> And why is Kuzco an idiot again? I thought he had reformed ... but since when are these TV spin-offs true to the original * roles *. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there's nothing redeemable about it ... not at all <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
