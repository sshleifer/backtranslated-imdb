It is still hard for me to believe that a fine - albeit overlong - novel by Dean Koontz has been transformed into these utter excrement. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it is disgusting. Boos to all who participated. Shame yourself! <br /> <br /> P.S. The fact that sequels have surfaced shows how little taste and discretion remain in Silver Screen Land.
