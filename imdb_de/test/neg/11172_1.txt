Do not be fooled by the plot, as described on the cover (at least in the Swedish version). The story about it seems pretty interesting, with speculative hints. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the absolutely saddest movie experience I've ever had ... It's just and really VALUABLE and should not be sold or leased to third parties. If you still think the story is intriguing, think about it: phones can move, execute and kill, just like other electrical appliances. It can throw things at you, track you and run after you. PLEASE DO NOT NOTE THIS FILM, it's a shame for the horror genre ...
