A stupid and violent thriller that is a rip-off of 'liberation' but without any charm or intelligence. The plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to free itself from this disgusting entry. This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea. It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James live in such a mess.
