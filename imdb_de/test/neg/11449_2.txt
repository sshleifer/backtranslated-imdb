The topic was good, the direction was ok. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as major. The acting of the supporting cast was at best amateurish. The casting director and director should be held responsible for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, he stood out with his poor histrionics like a sore thumb. He did not look that way and did not move like a soldier. There was a scene where a combat satellite from the militant battle was needed and they showed it from a camera angle. The satellite is hundreds of kilometers in the sky, the only viewpoint is from above. It was a pretty embarrassing moment. The public today has matured and they recognize when trying to pull wool over their eyes. The director is a major, so the story could come from his personal experience. No problem, but the movie is only as good as its actors and directors. So if Major Ravi wants other projects, he should pay more attention to the casting.
