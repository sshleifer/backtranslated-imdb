Hollywood has had a long love affair with fake Arab night stories, but few of these products have survived the time. Most memorable were the films of Jon Hall, Maria Montez, who have long become a camp. This is filled with synchronized songs, anachronistic slang and slapstick. It is a really rich harvest of Mesopotamian corn, which today is almost unbearable. It was nominated for its imaginative special effects that are barely perceptible today and mainly consist of trick photography. The only outstanding positive feature that survives is the beautiful color and clarity. It is sad to say that out of the many films made in this genre, only a few of Alexander Korda's original "Thief of Baghdad" stand out. Almost every other movie by Arabian Nights is superior to this. It is a loser.
