**** SPOILER ALERT **** My friend, some friends and I have rented this movie as part of a marathon with really bad movies. We somehow knew what we were getting into. However, the lack of conspiracy, direction and special effects left us hoping for a great (or drivable) fight scene between the two main characters ... the badly rendered swimming cobra and the violent giant komodo (which people like to eat, like ice cream scoops). We somehow end up with this, but had to be stopped because of budget or time constraints? The one redeeming feature is that it is ridiculously bad and many salient details are addressed by other readers. I recommend this movie if you want to cut onions to make you cry.
