Well ... there were some great, creamy-smooth facial images of Marlene, along with her "shocking" gender-specific outfit (plus her unmissable "monkey-to-human transmogrification"); But overall, the generally unconvincing storyline and the dated drama - not to mention the engaging melodies of Miss Dietrich's "baritone" voice - were little to make Blonde Venus a permanent fixture in my mind. Cary Grant - still in his infancy in kinematics - seemed to be always "looking for himself", while Herbert Marshall was probably never anything else, BUT Herbert Marshall was from birth to the day he died. From a historical point of view, Blonde Venus was fun, of course, as long as you could set aside "big expectations".
