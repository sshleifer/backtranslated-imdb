I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this movie by Bunuel (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a lifelong resentment against the Catholic Church and was pleased to try to insult Catholics in a rather stupid way. This is one of the dumbest; almost like what you would expect from an 18-year-old smart-aleck in the film class. The last minutes of the film, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final reference to religion. <br /> <br /> As you read the "scholars" about this slow, occasionally amusing film, it's about how church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If this is actually the point, Bunuel expresses it as round as possible. The central male figure is a bad guy who loves to kick dogs and push blind men into the street, turning billboard ads into mental fantasies of strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the fault of the church (because he interrupted his lovemaking) or is he just an idiot? I vote for the latter. I think that Bunuel must have had many personal arguments and chose the Catholics as the culprits. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments when you might be crying "Aha! Surrealism": a cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out of a window (a poor model), a man who ripping a feather pillow, a woman flushing a toilet while we see pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit ... in black and white). The rest is an unforgettable treat. Unfortunately, during his remaining career, Bunuel still chased the same bogey men (Viridiana, Discrete Charm ...). If you're interested in seeing surrealism on screen, check out Jean Cocteau's early work.
