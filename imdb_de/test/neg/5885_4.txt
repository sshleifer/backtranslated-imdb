This is an extremely competent movie. The camera work and the camera work are excellent and the acting is good too - especially the good acting of Daniel Auteuil as Marquis. I really thought that there are no problems with these aspects of the movie at all. Instead, I was a little annoyed at the way the Marquis was portrayed, as he did not seem very honest and seemed to be a very revisionist view of history. In fact, the Marquis has in recent years, with great insight, become a Defender of Freedom, not the fat sado-masochistic rapist he really was. In a way, this is very reminiscent of the whitewash in THE PEOPLE VERSUS LARRY FLINT - where these men are elevated to heroic status. Even if you do not believe that the Marquis's perversions were not so bad (including rape and extreme acts of violence), his portrayal in this movie as a "sexual social worker" in this prison seems quite stupid. Instead of the violent and selfish Sade, he spends a lot of time caring for a young maiden carefully and slowly helps her to explore her own sensuality. What a nice and friendly man. Now that I think about it, this idea reminds me of the man Maurice Chavalier played in GIGI (but without vocals) - a sweet older man who loves the ladies. I strongly doubt that the true Marquis de Sade would have recognized this character at all! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the film does not have much nudity, although what it shows is extremely explicit. Only a madman would show this to their children, as this is a very adult drama. It is very well done and quite entertaining - just not so honest. The director admits that the film in the interview is largely fictitious under the peculiarities of the DVD that I have looked at. So watch the movie if you want. Understanding is not very good historically. During the 18th century, sexual volunteers were well accepted in France, as they were quite generous. So, although the movie implied that it was not SEX, the topic was, it was the violence and rape that was (and still is) a problem.
