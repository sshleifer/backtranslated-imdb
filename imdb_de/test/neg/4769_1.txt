First, I saw another reviewer saying that this movie was "fantastic." Nothing could be further from the truth! This movie is completely garbage !!! A funny horror comedy that is not even a little funny !! Do not assume that it is so bad that it is good because it is not so. It is a total waste of time and money! <br /> <br /> Here's what I see in this waste of a DVD. A group of friends meet on a weekend, get drunk, and then decide to do a backyard video. They grab the video camera from mom and dad and start immediately with scenes on site. They all get a big kick when they look at the camera in front of the camera. They think if they think it's funny then everyone will find it funny. Well, they are wrong. This backyard video is garbage. The "acting" and comedic gore effects are lousy, but I think that's to be expected, as this is nothing but a home video gives everyone who wants to make a movie hope. If these people could produce and release their film on DVD, anyone can! <br /> <br /> 0 / 10-- Save your money.
