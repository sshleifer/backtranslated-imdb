COMMITTED is more of a character study than a movie. However, it is just another relationship that is adorned with the ornaments designed specifically for a young audience. The direction seems to be very simple, with obvious dramatic irony and a classic case of the lost loser compared to the unsuspecting. COMMITTED is sometimes seen and there is a little sense of originality from Lisa Krueger. <br /> <br /> COMMITTED is completely aimless for the first twenty minutes. We meet Joline, but the movie starts when her husband disappears. Joline sets out to find him. <br /> <br /> Some parts are weird. Other times the film pulls. The second half is more humorous when we see Jolines developing mental antics for the more intense ones. The annoying guitar music is terrible, but perhaps a necessary evil, because COMMITTED offers anyway little. An average movie that is hampered by completely meaningless moments. The only funds of COMMITTED are Heather Graham and Patricia Velazquez.
