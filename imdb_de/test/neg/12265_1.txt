This film proves a theory that I have had for some time - in Australia, as long as a movie deals with the right topic, it will be a success, no matter how awful it is. Aussie Park Boyz could not be worse - the drama is more than terrible, the plot is basically a poor warrior impulse, and the filmmakers obviously have no idea about ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang in the twenty-first century in Sydney!) Time, when there were any Irish gangs in Australia, was at the time of tinkering about a hundred years ago!) But because of ethnic rivalry, one in four themes is a sure success in Australian cinema (along with struggling families and minority groups ) (and the biography of a famous Australian) won several Academy Awards. I've always suspected that Australian critics are cleaning up any junk that deals with these issues, but part of me thought or at least hoped they had their limitations. This film proves the opposite. So for any emerging Australian filmmaker, do not bother thinking about the movie or choosing people who can actually act or even get the facts right. Just write a script about a poor family trying to make ends meet. or someone from a foreign race who comes to Australia and has to deal with racial prejudices and stereotypes, or, if you want to take a leaf out of those people's book, an ethnic gang that is not really fighting against another ethnic gang plausible During this time, the film is set and your film wins five Academy Awards, no matter how pathetic it is!
