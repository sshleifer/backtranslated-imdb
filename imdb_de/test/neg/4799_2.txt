The bipolarity of this movie is crazy. In a moment he makes fun of Latin Americans, American tourists and banana republics in general, the other she wants to touch, with burnt villages and orphans. Even the serious revolutionary hero eventually becomes the parody of a revolutionary. But the comedy parts are not even funny because they were obviously stolen from Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, the "hero" is basically a rogue with a heart of gold. There are also stereotypical sound effects: Latin Americans speaking English together and a villain just disappearing from history. And what is the point? It's basically a revolutionary propaganda with no solution and no planning (because there's simply no way these people can lead a country). The US government is evil, but who will make money from it? No poor peasant, that's for sure.
