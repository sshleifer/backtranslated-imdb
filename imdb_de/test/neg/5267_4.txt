I was really looking forward to watching this movie. It had all the ingredients of a great tongue in the cheek, but it just did NOT come together ALONE. Kevin Spacey's accent was tolerable except that he had sometimes forgotten to use it, and I would rather not have listened to Linda Fiorentino's pale attempt. Her and Helen Baxendale lacked charm and personality, luckily their screen children had charges so they could at least find some family members they loved. You could have charged spaghetti with the plot, and I'm sure the script was written by a teenage student in an English high school contest. That is, when I did not twitch, I grinned, so it was not a totally wasted 90 minutes. I found the overlaying of Kevin's face on the painting very clever and rather funny. Maybe I'm a bit hard, but I expected a bit of good picture quality and it just never came.
