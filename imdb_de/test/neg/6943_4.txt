A sadly predictable, clich√©d story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. Unfortunately, the script of the once great experimental writer John Dos Passos comes from an original of the French exotic potboiler Pierre Louys. This time Marlene Dietrich Concha is a manipulative, cold-hearted Spanish beauty. Don Pasqual (Lionel Atwill) pulls her out of the cigarette factory but she drops him. He warns his big boy friend Antonio (Cesar Romero) about her, but to no avail. It follows a duel. Concha accuses Pasqualito of killing the only man she has ever cared for, and he does not: he points his gun at the sky, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going to Paris with the young winner, she returns to the man who died for her. With an unexpected contribution from Edward Everett Horton as Spanish Governor. Dietrich plays the role of a Spaniard by constantly moving, turning around the waist and standing up and then turning back, unfolding, throwing his head and so on. And she makes faces and has a curl in the middle of her forehead. The photography is strangely overcrowded: no exterior scene can be captured except through a tangle of bare trees, no interior scene without so much detail that it's almost impossible to follow people moving through space, not shooting successive scenes from Dietrich without a big wardrobe change. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers that it's almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea.
