This is a great example of what happened after Dave Chapelle retired at Comedy Central. Here is the problem with Carlos Mencia. First, his birth name was Ned Holness, and it was known that he was renamed Ned Arnel Mencia until he was 18 years old. He was born in Honduras, although he behaves from Mexico. He also grew up in the United States. <br /> <br /> I could forgive all that crap, but ... <br /> <br /> He was caught stealing other people's material. Joe Rogan was his loudest critic in this way. The stereotype Olympics was an idea he had taken with some Miami DJs. He stole Bill Cosby jokes. He stole George Lopez's material in his own HBO special (13 minutes of it). <br /> <br /> He thinks what he does is so original, but Dave Chapelle and Lisa Lampanelli have been racing for years in front of this idiot (among others). <br /> <br /> This show will crash and burn. The word Beaner can not take so long before it ages. He has not done anything new since the first episode. <br /> <br /> "Want to hear a joke? A beaner jumps on a fence !! That's funny for 3 seasons!" Not. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
