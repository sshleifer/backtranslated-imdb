This movie is an absolute shame! I really liked the original airport, and I can not believe how the same people could produce this Zwiesel in nine years. At first, the drama is bad. The original had actors who had previously made high-quality (non-disaster) films, but here actors are used who have already made the disaster film (Blakely, Kennedy, Wagner). Also George Kennedy character Patroni seems to be promoted very quickly. He is now the main character in the movie, but his character is not strong enough to replace him: he has lost the charm and humor of Airport (1970) and the character is now just boring. Did I mention the plot? Is it even believable that someone sends a missile after the Concorde? NO!!! There are too many loose ends too. Scenes that have no relevance to the plot. The scene where the hot air balloon lands on the runway, the pursuit of the thief in Charles De Gaulle Airport are two such scenes. Both would be interesting - if only they had something to do with the actual story. There are also many unanswered questions: Why does Patroni open the window and fire a flare at the other plane? Why is Robert Wagner's character changing? (There must be another stupid and expensive way, why is there no investigation after the rocket nearly blew up the Concorde?) Why are the backprojections so bad? (It looks like a cartoon rocket of the Concorde Even though it works well (when the plane lands in Paris), why does Patroni think he's in a flight simulator (when he turns the Concorde) Why is he being welcomed into the cabin of the plane after he frightens the passengers and so scary ends when it can be described as the end Because of its one-dimensionality, nobody seems to notice: The blessing that the young couple gets on the plane from the girl's carriage is Shmaltzy, the man who The saxophone is annoying, and the woman with the bladder problem is just stupid: the scenes in which Susan Blakely lies on the roof of her conservatory and when she tells Wagner that s he still loves him, they are terrible. This film should have been the highlight of the previous three or three airport movies: Instead, it's a devilish, sub-moral, complete and total waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent" !!!!!!! Do you remember when Patroni asks the French pilot if he "ever landed on his stomach?" This movie certainly floppes the belly and ends up flat on his pointed nose ...
