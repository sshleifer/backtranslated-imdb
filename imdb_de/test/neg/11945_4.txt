I am a longtime fan of the original of this movie (Bella Martha / Mostly Martha), and anything that makes this movie great and enjoyable is missing in this one. I miss the slow pace, the build up of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of the lights and moods and the dialogue. I do not think the story itself is enough. Martha / Kate is a bit more secluded and Mario / Nick is not a clown. In most cases, the things that make a scene great in the original do not work in their copy here. The small changes take away the tension. My opinion is that you should see the original. It pays off the inconvenience of subtitles.
