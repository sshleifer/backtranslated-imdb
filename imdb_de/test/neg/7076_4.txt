I work in a video library, so I saw this for free - thank goodness if I paid for it, my criticisms would be less forgiving. <br /> <br /> Well, the main idea of ​​the movie (geeky girl makes bloody revenge) is not so original, there are several parallels to "Carrie" (a true, practical joke about a loser, besides a nice girl, that you really sorry, Tamaras and bad family background). I still think it's a funny idea for the nasty teen horror movie. Unfortunately, they did not take advantage of the possibilities that existed here, and rather paid attention to the wrong things. <br /> <br /> the actress who played Tamara. She looked great (when she was hot) and her kitty lines were fun ("Sean can not come to the phone, he's the damn king!"). <br /> <br /> What did not work: the whole Wicca thing was stupid. I generally prefer rational explanations (she would have planned it with her teacher or one of the boys to get their revenge). there were a lot of logical wholes and the gore looked really bad (if the boy cuts off his ear and tongue, please !!!) <br /> <br /> the whole idea was not tied to Oscar Buzz. but I just think they wasted the comedic and exciting potential that they had. It was bearable, but not good!
