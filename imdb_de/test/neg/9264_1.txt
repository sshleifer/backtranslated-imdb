Well, after the hype surrounding the movie and after Surya described the film as PATH-BREAKING, I went to the theater and expected something big. Boy, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characterizations in the movie are SO weird! Which woman would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? An idiotic Coo-Coo version? And why had she been in the rain with her baby (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband had argued? What was the purpose of this scene? To start a vulgar shot "Maaja Maaja"? Not only was the song not aesthetically preserved, it simply was not needed in the script. NOT EVERYTHING NEEDED! Second, the first half had virtually no history. The entire first half was a FREAKING drag. Each scene in the first half of the film had no meaning to the actual story of the film. And how has Aishwarya (Bhoomika Chawla) suddenly changed so radically? And how did Gautham (Surya) and Kundhavi lead a happy life together after six years, even though they were SO so unhappy to marry each other? And if Gautham loved Aishwarya as much as he said he did, why did he even marry Kundhavi, even if it was his uncle's death wish? WHY? That's the question you keep asking during the movie! And how fair is the end of Aishwarya? After all, she was Gauthams first wife? Krishna, the director of the film, claimed that he had been working on the script for two years, but his screenplay is full of flaws and the audience is completely confused. Third, Krishna's unimaginable images of Rahman's Awesome disappoint. Surprisingly, Anthony's cut (usually excellent) shit for the song "New York Nagaram"! The whole song looked like it was a slideshow created on Microsoft Power Point! "Munbe Vaa" Rangoli Chorus was wasted and showed Gautham playing football !!! Who wants to see how the crazy guy plays football during such a beautiful refrain?!? In addition, the film needed only TWO songs. Munbe Vaa and Kummi Adi. The rest of the songs including "Machakari", "Maaja Maaja", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" are simply not needed. Rahman's fine efforts are simply wasted on a stupid movie directed by an amateur director! Fans of Rahman, you ask why Rahman constantly moves to Bollywood. Why should he stay here after seeing how his songs are portrayed in Kollywood? Even more annoying is that after Krishna decided to include Machakari in the film, the song was cut in half, which is really, really annoying and packed in a so-and-so performance. His expressions in all the songs in which he was presented do not really fit the way the singer sings the songs. Did Jyothika act in the movie? Everything she did was scream! Would you act all that crying? One of their worst performances ever! Her new hairstyle does not suit her. She looked much better in Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu. Their costumes during the song "New York Nagaram" are far away. Bhoomika Chawla is just great during the movie and lives up to her role. Vadivelu's comedy is ANNOYING. If you watch him, you wish him to hit him in the face. It is Santhanam who is the show-theft during the comedy scenes. And why the hell did Sukanya even agree to play such a tiny role that only anyone could have done? And why is her make-up so hard when she has a perfect complexion? Music by A.R. Rahman is just great. "Machakari", "Munbe Vaa", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" deserve special mention. Rajasekhar's cinematography is fine and not as good as in his previous films, though the scenery deserves a special mention during the song "Kummi Adi". Anthony's work is really disappointing. The movie is just so crazy and could be severely cropped. Krishna's direction is just shit. Dialogues (A.C. Durai and Krishna) are just too cheesy to digest the part in which Bhoomika explains her love for Surya. The script and the script (Krishna) are indescribable. The film moves at the least interesting pace. And Krishna's screenplay is filled only with unexplainable underground pieces. <br /> <br /> And for God's sake, why was there so much publicity in the movie? Pepsi, Maggi, Suzuki, you call it. Was the producer of the film (K.E. Gnanavel) on a tight budget or was he just desperate? Overall, Jillunu Oru Kaadhal is a wet Squib. With such a title, one would expect a heartwarming and cooling love story, but in the end there is a painfully botched love story. Really very disappointing.
