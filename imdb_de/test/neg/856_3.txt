Okay, now I'm pretty sure my summary got your attention and that my comment that Zazu Pitt's is Satan is not without foundation. Let me explain. The film seems at first glance to be a Dandy B film about a nasty organization called "The Crooked Circle" and its vengeance in the form of murder of a rival organization committed to investigating crime. While this is very strange (especially the idea of ​​a club of private citizens solving crimes) and COULD were interesting, this film falls apart despite an impressive list of well-known support actors. Why? Well, because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) whines the biggest part of the movie like Olive Oyl with a strong toothache !! While murders are committed, people are kidnapped or whatever, you can always count on Zazu howling at full volume - almost like someone who's rude, a 3-year-old who wants everyone at a party on them gets attentive! At the same time she is NOT an integral part of the film, but received a top-billing. Why she's there at all goes beyond me - I'm assuming it's just whining and screaming. As a result, I found the film virtually unsurpassable and was completely ruined. Now you probably know why I described this actress with dubious talent as "Satan"! I'm sure the actors in this movie, when they saw the final product, felt about the same way I did about their horrible, exaggerated and amateurish performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is in public domain and can be downloaded for free on the internet. I can see why.
