Let me first say that 1 in 10 is too good for this movie. It's unfortunate that IMDb does not have a tenth of a star ... I saw this abortion of a movie for insomnia in the middle of the night, and it was rubbish. The action was terrible. The acting was terrible. The movie was absolutely boring. "Malachi" looked like the shadow with Alec Baldwin (The shadow is also infinitely better than this one) The character Eve was so undeveloped and two-dimensional that she did not even get my attention. I did not even know her name was Eve. Don was interesting when he shut up. The "TWIST" (if you can call it that) was ridiculous and pathetic. When it came to that, the movie had done such a horrible job of building up suspension or attachment to some character that I just thought, "Who gives a S ***". The only thing that made me raise an eyebrow at this movie was the fact that the Med. Teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (Also a movie that was light years ahead of the movie assassin.) Anyone watching this movie was involved, should be ashamed because he wasted 90 minutes of countless people. No wonder no actor in this film ever made a fruitful career. In summary .... This movie is so bad, I feel dirty and need a shower. The worst movie in history, Gigli was better, Prom Night (the remake) was better and dare I say Saw IV was better ...........
