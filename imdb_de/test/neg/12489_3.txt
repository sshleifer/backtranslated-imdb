At the beginning of the film, Ramgopal Verma says that "Sarkar" is his tribute to the Godfather. This feels more like an insult. Compared to the classic Coppola it fades terribly. Although no one expected Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the film generated much expectation and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan plays "Sarkar", a character who automatically draws comparisons with the Indian political party Shiv Senas Supremo Bal Thackeray. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar, who returns from abroad and becomes involved in Sarkar's politics at home. Just like Al Pacino in the original godfather. <br /> <br /> As with most Bollywood fares, incidents and characters are obviously simple and without any solid foundation. Fast phone calls and sudden announcements turn the movie from one direction to the other. Abishek goes into Mumbai's deceptive underworld politics crime scene like a duck into the water. Amithab Bachchan as Sarkar should look great and powerful, he just looks old and unaware. The main part of his acting is focused on constantly staring at various things in the movie set - the actor in front of him, the floor, or some other random direction. <br /> <br /> Kay Kay, however, is extremely successful as the unlucky elder son Vishnu. Zakir Hussain as Rashid, the Dubai-based smuggler who wants to gain a foothold in Mumbai. This actor has an impressive screen presence and can scare your back as he looks. The moment he enters the screen, you want to run and hide under the bed. <br /> <br /> Despite the apparent flaws that the film could not resist, the film has been well-proven at the box office. The humming and the big star obviously help. Verma also manages to soften her interest, albeit towards the later half of the film. He actually makes a sequel to this one, which I'm sure will be more of the same price.
