It's a bit hard to believe that this is from the same director who gave us HELLRAISER. Where is the style, foreboding and charm? I mean, HELLRAISER is not a big horror movie, but at least he had something. NIGHTBREED is like a big ball of bad ideas that are poorly implemented. From the opening there is a problem with subtlety: the monsters are shown in the first shot! The opening dream sequence shows too much for too long. Our hero does not show any professional acting skills (but nobody expected that from this bastard genre). There are murders you wish would be more interesting. Then we have David Cronenberg. The man was never really meant as an actor. He adequately fulfills the role of the scary psychiatrist, but he should have done so behind the camera and saved this catastrophe. Then we come to Midian, an eerie false cemetery with a spooky fake gate. This is not a big improvement on the cemetery in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. It gets worse when we hit the creatures in it. There's nothing really wrong with the character design and make-up effects (well ... except the guy without a scalp, the guy with a pointed chin and forehead and the fat guy with dark circles), the problem is the way how they act and the terrible dialogue that is given to them. Barker's photograph of the underground city is tired and this part of the story could have been done much better. Some may call what SPOILERS follows. After our hero dies and becomes "Nightbreed," we wait around to see what he's going to turn into (talking about things that are flying and werewolves), but when the time comes to change, They apparently thought their hero was too pretty to give a hero decent creature design. With the turn in Cronenberg's "character," the story becomes less interesting until the Freaks fight against the norms (which is just bad). Barker's mythology failed him here. Behind NIGHTBREED there is no genius and little originality. The image could have used a bigger budget, a serious script, and a character design that does not say "oh ... oh, how lame". What a waste. Not scary, not cool, not even very dark, only weak.
