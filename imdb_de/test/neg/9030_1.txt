OK, I've seen over 100 Troma movies and some of them are pretty bad. "Sizzle Beach USA" was terrible and "I Was A Teenage TV Terrorist" was unbeatable, but this is the worst movie in the trombal library! A bunch of women are being held in a jail and tortured while trying to escape. <br /> <br /> That's really terrible. Also go as commercials. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would likely kill the director if they saw this bad apology for a cult movie. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
