This movie is a perfect example of how a movie can not be successful on a budget alone. It's obvious that a lot of time and effort was spent here: the animation is fluid, detailed and outstanding - the soundtrack is not all that memorable, except for the final song by Celine Dion (at least I think it was her). The music score consists of full orchestral material. Kudos to the animators and composers! 10.9. However, the story and the characters coincide. It feels very "there done, done", predictable and uninteresting. The characters have different personalities, but nothing too sympathetic. They annoyed me without end. I really tried hard to like this, but I did not care about the story - it was a cliché action-adventure plot. There were "jokes" that were not funny. It was vomiting that was predictable from start to finish. The dialogue was a cliché and horrible - especially the last line "There is not ... that gives wings, it's love!" Whatever it was, I remember how I bent. I wish it would hurry up and end. I was not the only one either - the people I went with thought it was boring. Please have a look at the movie Asterix and Obelix Cleopatra if you want to see one. That was a waste of time.
