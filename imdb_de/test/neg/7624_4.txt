After his success with A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wes Craven decided for some reason that his next project would be this TV movie. I'm not a big fan of this director at all; The early exploit strip The Last House on Left as well as his modern Slasher Scream go well with me, but the rest of his work is a hit and Miss and I hesitate to call him the master whom others have called him. The main theme here is cryogenic freezing, though it's more of a stepping stone to action than an important part of the movie. The main influence here is obviously the outstanding zombie movie Deathdream of 1974 and we focus on Miles Creighton; A businessman who has been cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident means he must be thawed immediately. Miles is part of a project for the sick; They pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future if their diseases can be cured. Miles is successfully revived and perceived as a miracle ... but the person waking up is not the person who was frozen, as Miles returns with no soul. <br /> <br /> This film could have been quite decent. Judging by the idea behind it, we instead get an action that does not really have much to offer, and it must be said that Craven does not have the potential of the film exploits. The "soul" is the main focus, but it seems that no soul and only a murderous intention / compassion is the same thing, which feels a bit unimaginative. The film was made for television, so it's not very bad and it's obvious that not much money was spent on it because the whole production feels very cheap. Michael Beck never became a very popular actor, and that's not surprising when you judge his performance here. While he is passable, he largely lacks the charisma and he is not impressive in the central role. The plot does not flow too badly, but there is a lack of tension and / or tension and things slow down too often, which makes the movie occasionally boring. It all comes down to a predictable end. Overall, I have to admit that I was not impressed by this movie at all. As far as Craven's filmography is concerned, Chiller would go down with Shocker, the Scream sequels and The Hills Have Eyes II as a failure.
