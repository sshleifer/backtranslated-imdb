It's always interesting to watch a horror movie after receiving so much praise from other fans. Experience has taught me that one should never generalize the catch flavor within a genre. My expectations for this movie were much higher than my opinion. <br /> <br /> Children should not play with dead things - a movie with a good planned plot that too often fails to perform. The whole idea of ​​a group of actors staging a revival of dead bodies fascinated me. Everything, however, degenerated into cinematic chaos. The actors, who were for the most part competent and surprisingly expressive, were offered roles that did not maintain consistent characterization. Some of these characters go back from ambivalence to the desecration of a cemetery over outspoken criticism to ambivalence. It is one thing for characters to have a changeable heart throughout the film; It's another thing to create an overly dynamic, circular posture that repeats every ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Another inconsistent element of this film is the premise. Does the main protagonist want the ceremony to be a theatrical prank, or is he actually conspiring with dark spiritual powers to raise the dead? Despite the above shortcomings, I would recommend this film to other horror fans, as I believe that only true horror fans can appreciate the dark atmospheric components and ignore the inconsistency of the plot. The scene where the dead rise from the grave becomes haunting (even for a seasoned zombie enthusiast) through the combination of scenery and sound, as well as the large selection of trained actors who will play the revived dead. Current filmmakers should learn from CSPWDT how to use the right video and audio techniques in mood development. <br /> <br /> If you're a zombie movie executer like me, you should take the time to find and watch this movie. It's a funny clock.
