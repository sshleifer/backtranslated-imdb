I was very excited when Paranormal State first appeared on A & E. I thought it might bring more interesting ghostly evidence. The production value looked good and I really love the logo. Then, after a few episodes, I began to believe that this show might not be looking for evidence, but had a strong religious agenda. <br /> <br /> It seems that every case they investigate has a big, evil demon I can not even move a teacup in front of the camera, but everyone is scared. Then comes a power of the Christ ritual that saves all. <br /> <br /> Other members of the team have little focus. The entire show focuses on Ryan and he feels like one of the people who gives you pamphlets about his church on the street. Has the paranormal phenomenon and the demons become new missionaries of Christianity, frightening the conversion of people? Actually, this should be in a Christian network. I was very disappointed.
