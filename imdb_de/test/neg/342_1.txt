I loved this movie after reading other reviews. What a disappointment! There are so many possibilities that this movie is bad. The computer graphics were missing to say the least. I found the spectacle stiff and unbelievable. Watch the sand as the lost "E-pods" (what an original name!) Are found. Where did all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized parts that resembled other movies, such as Alien, Pitch Black. Come on, a huge ship to transport a prisoner? And what about the prisoner? Does he speak, can he speak? I have always been waiting for something to hold the parts of the story together, but it never came. If this movie was done on a low budget, it shows. The only part of the movie I liked was when it finally ended. I do not mean that I liked the end. I just loved the fact that it was over. A visit to the dentist would have been better. In my view. Do not waste your time with this.
