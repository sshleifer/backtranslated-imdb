This DVD is barely 30 minutes long and has boring interviews, showing that the average Slipknotian has an IQ of around 30. However, these aspects are the least problematic. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that Slipknot One is one of the least talented metal bands that have ever sold over 100,000 units of their crap. (The only reason I say "one of" instead of "that") is because System Of A Down is even worse.) Like Ed Gein's girlfriends, the band's music is made up of ancient metal clich√©s that are should be found both in their image and in their ultra-dull music. In fact, her image somehow makes fun; Her videos are like bits and pieces of kitsch horror movies, so they serve at least one purpose as entertainment. <br /> <br /> Their music, however, is nothing of quality - whatever: just a bunch of Gimmicky riffs played millions of times ago, played only on the guitar belt and not related in any way, yet random to "songs" are summarized, they form "songs" that have no cohesion, no highlights, no nothing. But if the riffs are really bad, then the vocals are even worse: Slipknot's vocalist has a stereotypical, so uninteresting, "bad" growl - the kind that today has 90% of all metal bands - but that's nothing compared to that Moment when this fraudulent hick tries to sing! What can you expect anyway? Rule No. 39 of the "Nu Metal" manual says very clearly: "You will growl and sing alternately Ignore the fact that the two styles do not mix well because most of your fans are so flat-hearted that they are you love will be even if you are in the microphone ****. "Slipknot are absolutely the worst when you" singer "emits melodies. <br /> <br /> But back to her image. It was stolen, copied, demolished, stolen, borrowed without being asked by Mr. Bungle. You have never heard of them? Of course you do not have. They only listen to Nu-Metal, and Mr.Bungle is a long way off and beyond any categorization. They also wore masks - grotesque, terrible, similar to those of Slipknot, I might add - in the late 80's and early 90's. This band, whose front man Mike Patton is by Faith No More, was never tall because their music was not directed at the average music fanatic (to say the least). <br /> <br /> So basically Slipknot aren 'Even the original in the image department. They have nothing new to offer, so will be forgotten in a few years: as soon as the masks become boring to the legions of their cited fans, Slipknot will be forced to compete with their generic music in the music market. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Mike Patton, it's interesting that a number of Nu Metal bands often refer to his vocals as a big influence. Predictable - and luckily - Patton is not flattered by it and has denied being in any way proud to have an impact on one of the worst metal subgenres ever ... <br /> <br / > Have fun with this short DVD and the cheap thrill that it could offer for the untrained ear and the bored eye ... And then polish the Slipknot posters, because in a few years nobody will take care of them, the poor ones. <br /> <br /> After seeing Corey in the documentary "Get Thrashed," I finally understand why he's wearing a mask: he's a baby-faced blue-eyed ginger who looks like Dave Mustaines younger brother! Not scary. <br /> <br /> For more information about my music world, visit: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1 <br /> <br /> Please punish me hard, very hard, by clicking below click on "No".
