No movie I have ever seen is almost as boring and stupid as this garbage. And I've always been a big B-movie fan. Having seen all this crap, I can honestly say that this is not nearly a B-movie. <br /> <br /> No one in this film could act if his life depended on it. The script is so stupid, I do not think I've ever heard anyone in my life speak this way. The author should spend a few years studying real life people to see how they behave and speak, even then they would not be able to make a film because it is so obvious no one is involved in this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monster toys. Do not forget a sexy scene, the women in the leather outfits are so grotesque that you would rather puke, than to interfere!
