I'm usually a fan of Bruce Willis, and although he played the cold-hearted professional killer, I thought he was the most appealing character here. That is, his character makes such a mess out of his job, it is unbelievable that he has never been caught before. The plot is so thin that it is nonsensical. The ending was no less annoying and insulting to the fact that it would have been possible to predict it in the film after about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> ** Follow Spoilers ** In Hollywood's morality, the good guys always win with a few casualties on the way, and the bad guys die or at least end up on the road to justice. The stunning insult of the film is the way our IRA terrorist, who has somehow become a cuddly, sensitive character, begins a new life. Like his former terrorist playmate (who is now a loving wife and mother). Who is the bigger villain? The former (and as far as we can tell) incorrigible terrorist or the leased assassin? I can not choose much between them - in real life or in film. <br /> <br /> This is the poorest movie I've seen this year.
