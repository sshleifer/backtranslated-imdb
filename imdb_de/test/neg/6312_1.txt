This movie has some of the worst drama I've ever seen. Dennis Quaid's performance was a high school caliber. It's difficult to portray an unconventional character like Jerry Lee Lewis. Just ask Jamie Foxx (though Ray Charles had a deeper personality and music experience than Lewis ever owned). The Phillips brothers belong to The Dukes of Hazzard, and Alec Baldwin plays with Jimmy Swaggart and is a bit like Donald Duck, who plays Shakespeare. When Robert Duvall played a country preacher, I bought him. Baldwin never let me believe a word. Wynona Ryder was the best part, and she was mediocre. (And can anyone figure out how she was 13 years old when Lewis met her and was still 13 years old one year later?) Some internet reviews make it clear that the key facts of the movie were true bio-imagery. This movie worked bad at the box office and should have it.
