Incredible. Great cast, fair acting, interesting plot. <br /> <br /> But this movie has such graphical atrocities that are neither tense nor exciting, just annoying restlessness. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Everyone could see the freak returning to their habits. And that Robert Englund behaved like an idiot; Forbid your daughter to sleep with a soccer player, but if he tries to kill an idiot and like Kiddypr0n, is that alright ?! <br /> <br /> The police officer whose daughter was kidnapped - does everyone have the feeling that he is a police officer and not an actor? Not me. This movie continues with one end that we see in other horror movies: if the returns were in order, Part 2 could be made. Bad, really bad stuff. Could give inspiration to creep ...
