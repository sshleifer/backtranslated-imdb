The only reason anyone remembers this steaming feces load is that Pink Floyd rated it. (Or as they were then called "The Pink Floyd"). Stefan, a really annoying tramp stool by Eurotrash, comes together with the American model Estelle, and they get naked and naked throughout the movie ... <br /> <br /> And the point of it is, what exactly? That drugs are bad? Or is only heroin (horse)? The problem is that you are not concerned with the characters, and even Pink Floyd was not the best work. When Steffan overdoses in the end, you're almost glad to get rid of him because he was so annoying.
