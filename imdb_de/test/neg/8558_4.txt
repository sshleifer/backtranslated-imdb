LORD PROTECTOR is child benefit, but for whom? Obviously shot for television or STV, this amateur Rehash KRULL has several main characters - a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist - on the trail of something or other to defeat the dark forces just unleashed on them planet. LORD PROTECTOR has been poorly written, traded and listed in existing California locations such as city parks and a ranch. He has nothing to recommend, not even a waste of time. Jay Underwood is the only "name" actor, and most people, especially the intended target group of five-year-olds, probably will not remember such old Disney fare as NOT QUITE MUMAN. A nameless actor playing a sorcerer in a poorly fitting silver wig at least plays it with his tongue firmly pressed into his cheek while the others around him behave as if they were in a dinner theater production by KING LEAR. At least I hoped for a decent action or special effect sequence. Unfortunately, the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are the old-fashioned, overpainted comic gags we saw in the 1950s and 1960s, such as Bert Gordon's THE MAGIC SWORD. The filmmakers planned a sequel that mercifully did not exist. Frequently, such cheap Hollywood back lot productions use a combination of legal and porn actor. During the film's seemingly endless running time, I explored what was in this film. I was not lucky.
