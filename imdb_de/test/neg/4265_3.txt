There is nothing wrong with showing how an old man falls in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it. <br /> <br /> But. They did it in a subtle way. They did not make it so clear from the beginning that the director prepared them for falling in love. Not as natural as two people (age no bar), but force them to be around each other as if they would fall in love. <br /> <br /> All in all there should have been chemistry. It would have solved the biggest problem. People with reservations about the subject would have been engrossed and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story, regardless of impracticality. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time believing Jia's character sometimes. More difficult to understand was why Vijay - a photographer and an artist who seems serious - was interested in such a frivolous girl. Unless he himself has hidden some frivolity that never came to light. <br /> <br /> There are many uses of Dutch angles or angles where the frame is tilted. It is generally used to show something unnatural or something that might lead to something that is not right. Therefore, RGV calls the relationship itself unnatural. <br /> <br /> Camera angles, background scores, editing and even the juxtaposition of images and symbology underline and over-emphasize their relationship. Is the Indian public so stupid that we have to say something in 10 different ways so that we can understand it? Especially when the two danced together ... it was obvious what was going on. What was the need to slow down the scene with dramatic background music? I think the topic was very well chosen. But Verma should not have made the film constantly with the intention that this is a controversial topic. If so, then handle it carefully, why not?
