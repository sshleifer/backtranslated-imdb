It's strange that while the film has full sex scenes with X ratings and violent murders, it never feels as shocking as it should. A group of scientists visit an island in the Caribbean to investigate a radioactive incident. Upon arrival, a mutated islander makes the happy thing to assassinate the men and compete with the women. It does not always seem to work that way. <br /> <br /> Among the Sored Acts we find some lesbian encounters, a threesome with male prostitutes, different heterosexual connections and the rape of an already dead body. Although it is all very explicit, it never fails to shock or stir as intended. As soon as the sex is pornographic, he just loses his edge; The suspension of unbelief is broken, and we find that we are watching people in sex. <br /> <br /> There is some blood and blood in the murders, but given that this is a D'amato strip, it's really tame. For a more immersive experience, check out the similar Erotic Nights of Living Dead. <br /> <br /> 2/10
