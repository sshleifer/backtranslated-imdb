Yes, I could not stop yawning or my partner. Unbelievably boring - 90 minutes seemed to take at least three hours - and I'm not even a fan of action movies, but that just falls asleep on your feet - unless you're a 70s pullover with a polo shirt! <br /> <br /> ** SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW ** If you've counted ALL events, do not hold your breath - that's not the case! <br /> <br /> But seriously, it's absolutely impossible to convince or involve the observer. It's like a long, boring and pretty disconnected dream. Frederic floats through her and can leave work whenever he wants, and attractive secretaries keep bringing tea and messages. Of course not the real life! And an office without paper or files - just a huge calendar that lets you know that the movie really needs six months. <br /> <br /> Frederick never seems to be touched by real emotions, and his wife and children behave like rag dolls - in stark contrast to any real life. Even Chloe, despite her strong views, never really seems to feel anything. The only 3 seconds of a real feeling occur between a couple being overseen in a cafe and have nothing to do with the plot. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe there are some moral considerations, but whether it's entertainment or even if you're looking for a good cinematography, this movie is unbelievably overrated by most other viewers.
