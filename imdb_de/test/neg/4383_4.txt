When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I've just started to show all of his old movies on video so I can see them with adults. I remember that I especially liked this model and thought it one of his best. Now that I'm a bit older, I can say that it's quite average, but I think it's one of his better films. In a play phase for him, Norris plays a policeman who is being persecuted for participating in the arrest and detention of a dangerous serial killer movie. Serial killers are all the rage these days, and people would like to see them as an invention of the 90s. By contrast, it's good to see where the current love of action movies (and stalk n slashers) of the 70s and 80s came from. While Norris' attempts to show humor as well as any form of human compassion are shitty and ridiculous, no one like Chuck could get in the head. Since I'm also a big fan of Steve James, I can recommend this film to see also for the genre legend Billy Drago, and Mitch of The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. Not great, but it's better than anything Norris did in the '90s.
