Yes, I realize that half a dozen other critics have called this movie "Copying Amadeus", but it can not be said enough. Scenes seemed to have been directly removed from Milos Forman's screenplay with only superficial changes. You can expect to see the following: <br /> <br /> -The arrogant scene of the Maestro ("I am the voice of God, everything else is meaningless!") <br /> <br /> -The Maestro makes itself funny work of a mediocre composer (complete with raspberries and simulated flatulence, as in Amadeus) <br /> <br /> - The mediocre composer's dialogue with God ("Why do you teach me music but deny me the ability to compose?" ) <br /> <br /> -The musical dictation from the deathbed scene ("Shared time, start with the violins ... coughing") <br /> <br /> -and the list goes on ... < br /> <br /> The problem is even worse. These scenes were not only copied shamelessly, they were not made very well either. Jeepers, if you want to demolish an original, you should at least try to improve it in your own creative way. <br /> <br /> No, there is something worse. It is the fact that the director has tried to take the story of Mozart in the history of Beethoven. People, Beethoven was not a blatant, vulgar Slob, as he is portrayed in this movie. In addition, Beethoven was not a chatty idiot, giving hints to his 23-year-old music student. Unfortunately, films like this one are responsible for slaughtering the story. <br /> <br /> And another thing, Beethoven (in real life) has never called it the "Moonlight Sonata," as he does in the movie. This name was called by a confused critic several years after BEETHOVEN DIED, and unfortunately it stuck. Beethoven's original title was "Quasi una Fantasia". <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER, as Beethoven (in the movie) "B-Flat! B-Flat! B-Flat!" and hits the note on the piano, he hits a white key! <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER THINGGG !!! Beethoven was (in real life) a few years before the composition of his Ninth Symphony completely deaf. This movie shows that he has little disability (every other line with "what?"), Just enough to be annoying. <br /> <br /> AAAND !! NO !!! THINGGGG ... !! The American accents ...! Forget it. No matter. I've wasted enough time on that. Go back to "Amadeus". If you want to see an interesting biography of Beethoven's life, read "Immortal Beloved," which brings poetic liberties, but at least they are interesting ideas. If you want to see something on the brighter side, check out "Impromptu", a movie about Chopin. Apart from these three, I've never seen a good tribute to a classical composer.
