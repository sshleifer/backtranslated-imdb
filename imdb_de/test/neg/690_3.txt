Although Humphrey Bogart got the stars in King Of The Underworld, I bet he did not thank Jack Warner for it. In fact, this film was a hollow crown. The King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of the Paul Muni film, Dr. Ing. Socrates, but given the cast of Humphrey Bogart, the character was more like Duke Mantee in the Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer in the person of James Stephenson. <br /> <br /> Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge performs a tricky operation on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey is a man who appreciates the good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge $ 500. And there's more to it, where that comes from, if he plays his cards right. Eldredge, who has a problem with gambling, sees a good way to earn undeclared income. <br /> <br /> However, when he was killed in a raid on the gang's hideout, Francis is likely to be implicated by the law and the American Medical Association, no matter how much she protests against her innocence. It's not good, and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to escape celebrity. Of course, the celebrity and Bogart and a traveling Leslie Howard like the author in Stephenson all meet again with her. But Kay is brave and resourceful, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts. He is a gangster who shoots people without mercy and gives his followers hot feet just to laugh. Concerned about his image, he kidnaps the writer Stephenson to write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let's completely outsmart Kay Francis, hard to believe he was king of all. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the lesser works for one of the stars.
