I was looking for a documentary with the same journalistic quality as Frontline or "Fog of War" (by Errol Morris). Instead, I was horrified by this shallow and naive report by a very complex and disturbing man and his regime: Alberto Fujimori. This film should be called "The Return of Fujimori". The director believes that she has made a "perfect" film because it alienates both the pro and anti-Fujimori factions, although this is actually a very biased and unprofessional work. <br /> <br /> The film has some key facts that are wrong: <br /> <br /> 1) It uses the so-called "landslide" vote of 1995, in Fujimori with 65% of the Votes were re-elected as an example of the massive support of Fujimori by the people. But we all know that it is the fruit of a very organized electoral fraud. <br /> <br /> 2) The film states that Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) killed 60,000 people. Indeed, the Truth Commission's Final Report states that 69,280 deaths were committed in Peru for political violence. 33% of them were caused by SL. The remaining 67% remain with the police, the military and other groups. The fact that she uses the same misleading information that Fujimori has been using for 10 years is another example of how awful this movie is. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has learned about Peruvian politics and history, Fujimori is clearly a consummate manipulator, a delusional figure and an inhumane egomaniac. His regime was far from democratic. For the Peruvians he is still a threat. Despite these facts, director Fujimori tells the story. Not only how the camera is to be positioned, but also the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of its political agenda. He always seems to have the last word. There are no journalistic "Cojones", just soft questions and undisputed comments. Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? When the director was interviewed after the screening, he did not hide the fact that she was deeply impressed by Fujimori, his charm, and his intelligence. Yes, she has definitely been charmed by him, and you can see it in this movie. It is obvious that she finds it very difficult to digest the many facts that point to his responsibility for corruption, murder and deception. She assured the gasping audience that Fujimori was truly a "patriot" when, a few moments ago, one of the leading Peruvian journalists insisted that Fujimori was above all a "traitor." She added that, despite all the allegations, no "single dollar" account was found on any account of his name, and so on. It was like hearing the same band of ruthless thugs who had been ruling the country for ten years in defense of their land. It was a sad moment for journalism. <br /> <br /> This movie makes history unjustified. It is an insult to hundreds of dead who have been disappeared or unjustly imprisoned by the Fujimoris regime. No wonder she later confessed that all Peruvian intellectuals she had made friends with betrayed the movie. Impartially? The words "oportunistic", "naive" and "denial" come to my mind instead.
