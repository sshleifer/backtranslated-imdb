This movie was not that good at all. Here's the first clue and that it's not going to be a strong movie, Harrison Ford's name not only appears first, it's also bigger than the title. The music was nominated for an Oscar. What the hell was that? This music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. The acting was at best below average, with the exception of the Amish boy he had made decent because he was so young. Then you have the story that was weak and a little over the place, and it got adapted for! The music was awful, I know, I already said something, but it was really bad. The premises were really good and it should be redone. Well, that's all I really have. <br /> <br /> Your average movie type, <br /> <br /> -rever
