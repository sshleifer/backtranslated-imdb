If anyone at National Lampoon reads this, PLEASE FINISH YOUR TOP FROM YOUR BUM, really now! Why the hell are you doing such films? They are not funny and it really is a complete waste of time when looking at the sexual content. It's such a horrible movie you might want to shoot yourself while watching. I'm serious, guys, it makes Harol and Kumar, blah blah blah, look like a really good movie (and we all know that H & K is one of the worst films ever made). How bad is it Now, even losers who like National Lampoon will hate this movie ... They will want to murder the director, I swear to God. I hate you, National Lampoon, die already. To die.
