The time for this film has not been quiet since the transitional days of the sound. The plot has a gangster who falls in love with a celebrity who wants to help his violinist who loves her. There are of course complications. The problem with the movie for me is that it did not age well. There are performances everywhere, and some emotional scenes seem like they're ridiculous. In a late exchange, when Carol Lombard throws somebody out of her room, I had to howl with the singing of the song. There are other times when the movie becomes static, a sign of the limitations of the microphones. It's not a bad movie, it's just that the film's technical limitations interfere with real enjoyment. Usually we forgive, but this time I just could not go with the river (then the copy I saw was absolutely terrible). Worth a trial in a forgiving mood (and to be reminded that Robert Armstrong actually played more than Carl Denham in King Kong)
