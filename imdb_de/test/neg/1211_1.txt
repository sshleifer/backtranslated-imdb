I've written a spoiler alert, but there's not really much that can be spoiled. It's like rotted meat. This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Not because of the actors or the special effects, but because of the sheer number of mistakes, both factual and physical. First and foremost, the MIGs are not MIGs at all. They are Mirages and they are French. And how the hell can Doug's father withstand the maneuver his son is doing to fend off the "MIGs" without a G-suit? And why would Chappy try to get on his plane without a G-Suit? And how could Doug defeat the opposing pilot ace with such ease? Anyway, I did not like this movie. And the worst part is that it has 3 sequels, the last one from 1995. That's scary.
