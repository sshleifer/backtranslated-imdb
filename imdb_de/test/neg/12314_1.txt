The sun did not shine, it was too wet to play with, so I went to the movies, on this cold, cold, wet Dates day. <br /> <br /> "The cat in the hat" was the name of the strip and when it was over, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played the cat, his humor was lame and the children did not have to see it, the humor was not tame. <br /> <The movie was like drinking milk from a rabid cow, so it's fun to have fun, but the filmmakers did not know how. <br /> <br /> This movie is awful. The acting was bad, the plot was too changed and the humor was surprisingly very rough. <br /> <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, a lawbreaker and a future sheriff. When her mother needs to work, she takes Ms. Kwan to baby sitting. Perhaps the lonely funny part of the film, when Ms. Kwan looks at a Taiwanese courtroom, is a "la C-SPAN". She falls asleep soon, and here comes the cat. <br /> <br /> The movie gets out of control. The cat came to try to make the kids have fun. He has Thing 1 and Thing 2 who suddenly start destroying the house. He improvises a TV infomercial and accidentally cuts off his tail. And if the cat gets sick of Carmen Miranda, that's not funny. Maybe his only funny disguise is a hippie activist. And there's a fish trying to warn the kids about the cat. Too bad he did not warn us that this movie was as much fun as sour milk or chopping off the tail. <br /> <Soon the kids are out looking for the family dog ​​who has the key to a box on the collar. If the box is not closed soon, her house will house the cat's universe. Here it gets a bit more interesting, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> The drama is terrible overall. Mike Meyers brings his kind of disrespectful Austin Powers humor to the cat, says things like "You dirty ho" and introduces himself for the rest of his life as a woman, after he beat himself as a pinata in the testicles. Spencer Breslin is great as the problematic Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is as sweet as Sally, though they alone are not enough to save this vile aortic dissection waiting to kill John Ritter (random accident). Alec Baldwin's slippery and slimy Lawrence Quinn is disgusting and always tries to recruit the children's mom played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, Mama's boss, and is also the voice of the fish. The last three are also boring. <br /> <br /> If I was a parent, I would not take my potty-humor children because there is a lot of it and more. Save $ 7.00 and see something else. Like the late Dr. Seuss once said: <br /> <br /> It's fun to have fun. But you have to know how. Really, Universal, stop! Theodore is already turning in his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mother always says: "Curiosity has killed the cat" .- The cat in the hat * out *****
