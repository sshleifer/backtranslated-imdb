A man is pulled from a London street and taken to another country, where he is tortured as a terrorist suspect. Boring, banal movie boring me to hell. More an idea than a movie. I was halfway through this 77-minute movie when I realized that I had no idea who someone was on the screen. It was as if they were taking every other similar film, taking out all the ideas and putting them in one place, without the very idea of ​​character. It is certainly a passionate act, but there is no emotional center, there is only one kind of people the filmmakers believe are enough. It is not. And while the story, which in theory is important as a warning, the film is too boring to convince anyone, especially if one has seen the other better movie (similar to Reese Witherspoon)?
