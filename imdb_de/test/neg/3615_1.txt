Now we know where they got the idea of ​​having snakes in an airplane. To put it simply: Do not pay to see this movie. If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, you can either catch it by cable or get it as a free sample of NetFlix or Blockbuster. Do not pay to rent this. If you pay for it, you are a stupid person. The acting was terrible, the plot was terrible, everything except the snakes was terrible. Whether they were real or CGI generated, they looked pretty good. Still, this movie must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Even the nude dance scene was pretty bad, so I quickly moved forward. Do not sit, I did not warn you.
