Skip this Hollywood version, a real piece of garbage. A cheap insult to the ingenious original "Spoorloos" or from the English title also called "The Vanishing". In typical, grotesque Hollywood fashion, it completely misses the target. Usually this is due to a bunch of talentless beancounters who have no idea what is artistic. They just look for the "formula of success" and want it applied to everything. Benefit from it. Similar to the terrible "The Scarlet Letter" of 1995, which adapted the original story so much to the MacDonaldsland crowd that it became an aberration, not even to a bastardization, but to a heap of claws similarly shaped but they do not look, feel or resemble the spirit of the original. Apart from the fact that this movie had at least Gary Oldman, who is interesting to see in everything he does. This dog has nothing to offer, even the usually very talented Jeff Bridges is embarrassed. A great tragedy is never intended to be "the feel-good film of the year", but takes one or more of the tragic events in life, which unfortunately occur far too often, and allows the reader / viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition. <br /> Do yourself a great favor when looking for a rental property, skip this grotesque rubbish and get the original from a 1988 Dutch / French collaboration. This is a great movie. That's a terrible mess.
