Despite a great soundtrack and the presence of the ever-amazing Rappaport and Woods, this is another of those stupid comedies in which New York pounces on the hero to show the author and / or the director what a crazy place it is is. Yes, there are a few other things in the movie that are shit too, but that's what's important. The trend for independent filmmakers in New York seems to be "I do not have to have a talent, I have NEW YORK!" Okay, to be fair, the movie has its moments. The flashback of why a guy's name is Wacky Jack was pretty amusing. The script is neither a story nor an action, it is a series of not good scenes that are linked by the same character. <br /> <br /> One of the worst things is that there are no motives to do signs. Uncle Sam gave the child the medication, why? If it's that important, why did not Sam do it himself? Then the main character is scene after scene, and there is absolutely nothing that can be gained by lying. The guy falls in love with a flight attendant, and none of them has reason to fall in love. The characters are a bunch of farmers the writer can move to see if he can do anything crazy. <br /> <br /> If you're having a good time or seeing bad indie movies because it makes you feel smarter than watching bad mainstream movies, check out this. If you want to see what a good brutal thriller looks like, look at Takeshi Kitano's "brother". "Kicked In The Head" is the perfect example of why so many people hate unconventional indie films: LOTS OF SUCKERS. And a note to the director: Do not be afraid to occasionally arouse, entertain, enlighten, or entertain the audience. Being bored does not make you a better filmmaker than those who can interest me.
