Why does this movie have so many rave reviews? <br /> <br /> This is amateurish, unstable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only memorable thing here is the stupid title song. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are low and the "weird" ideas (if you want to call them that) are weak, they seem to be remnants of SNL remnants that even they would not dare screen. <br /> <br /> I start to distrust the IMDb reviews thoroughly. <br /> <br /> This is light years away from Kentucky Fried Movie - not even in the same Galaxy. <br /> <br /> It's not even possible to write 10 lines about it. <br /> <br OK, another good thing: ugly street scenes and ugly people - something you do not see often on today's TV and in movies.
