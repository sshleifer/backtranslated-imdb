A virtual copy of The Cave saves less on the budget and a slightly different presentation. I knew the movie was going downhill when I saw the spotlights in an actor's face mask. The conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to have no purpose and added nothing to the film, except for a few moments of silence. Acting was not as bad as the typical B-movie, and their fear was believable, but as professional cavers, they seem to be psychologically too unstable for their job. Totally not worth to waste $ 4.50 on the rent.
