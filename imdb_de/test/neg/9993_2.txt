When I read the script online, I thought "Capote" needed a trim. I just saw it at PPV and I can tell you that it was not cropped, it was slaughtered like this poor family! Example: In the script, Truman names Shawn "Adorable One"; here he is "Mr. Shawn". Bad enough are the amateurs behind this movie, Capote inflamed and beating his circle (are we really going to believe that they've thought so little of Nelle, they have them little mutilated opus like a disgusting joke?) Make Perry Smith this oh-so-sensitive victim, even though he has shown how to send the clutters. It is one thing to deceive the facts, it is another to drop the ball: The executions were carried out between 14.45-1: 19pm on April 14; Truman is shown in jail 22 hours later! <br /> <br /> I was really excited about the "drama". Keener does not even sound like an Alabama native. Like Cooper again and again "Alvin!" Shouted, I waited for the Chimpmunks to show up! Hoffman does not give us the charming Gadfly, but a pathetic vacuum cleaner that considers a terrible act his ticket to the big time. When Hoffman whines that he is "tortured" by the endless appeals, I wanted to give him a shotgun so he can do us both a favor and blow his brain out!
