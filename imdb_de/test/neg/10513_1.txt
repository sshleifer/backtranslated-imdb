A dark but humorous story where a police officer has first-hand experience with vampires and decides that he has to quit his job to persecute these evil beings. The fighting scenes were as hokey as the rendering of a World War II by a middle school student. The lines were spoken as if the actors had no motivation to be there. The props were bad because they did not even look like they could work the least. Most of the film was apparently filmed in a basement (in some scenes you could see the rafters in a scene that should not look like a basement). The plot had no motivation to move forwards or backwards, it only seemed to stand still sometimes for no reason for some actions of the characters. I sometimes had the feeling that the sound effects for this horror genre and more for a comic series were not consistent. It's similar to the movie Blade because he's an African-American vampire hunter. Here, however, all the similarities end, and the film seems to come closer to a parody of Saturday Night Live.
