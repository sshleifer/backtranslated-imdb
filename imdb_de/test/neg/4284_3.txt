Man kills bear. Man becomes bear. Man / bear meets bear. Man / bear remains man / bear after the meeting with the bear. The end. Seriously, that's the entire conspiracy to this movie. Yes, I have made it extremely easy, but you get the picture. I just wish I had not seen it. <br /> <br /> The mentioned "man / bear" is an Indian who kills a boy's mother. And although that may affect something, there is certainly no real conflict between the two parties. There was also some abuse of the two moose in the movie. But that's beyond the point. <br /> <br /> All in all, very below average. Certainly it needed much more to be entertaining. Maybe more laughter from the minor characters and more drama between the two main bears. That's what distinguishes bad movies from the good ones. "D"
