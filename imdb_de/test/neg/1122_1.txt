When I found out that there was a Christmas holiday 2, I could not wait to buy the DVD. I sent my money and watched it as soon as it came through the mailbox. I love all the national Lampoons movies with Chevy chase and I bet he was glad he was not there! I could not believe how bad that was, you might think it was impossible not to talk about a national movie, but believe me, that's it! , This film probably looked like a good idea on paper, with cousin Eddie as the main character, he got nervous from the start and was completely confused in the middle of the movie and at the end of the movie. I was brain dead and could not remember what had happened! ,
