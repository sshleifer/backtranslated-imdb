A buddy and I watched this movie when it came out in 1980. He played in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place. It took two days in the theater until they stopped showing it. It was so bad that we laughed the whole way. Since that time, we've been judging movies based on Kill or Be Killed as the worst movie ever. As other critics have mentioned, it is so bad that it is funny. It is certainly not worth a second look. I just can not bring myself to give more than a 1, because I do not think that the creators of the film, which are intended for the film, are so bad and I can not make an accident for an accident. We are sorry.
