The kind of B-movies from the 50's that were schlocky and yet so much fun is what makes Predator Island a homage. Shot in Connecticut, Predator Island is located on an island with the Hell's Beacon lighthouse, where only the couple who looks after the lighthouse live. In the typical 1950s fashion, after half a dozen young adults, young adults bump their boat against the rocky shores of the island. Ugly creatures from outer space invade the island after a meteor hit nearby. The creatures both begin to inhabit the bodies of their victims, as well as to devour them. Much cursing and lame comebacks are the main form of dialogue in this film. It's so funny that sometimes you just have to laugh. If you're looking for a movie that is stupid but in a fun way, then this movie is just the ticket. <br /> <br /> Interesting note: In the film I appear as a corpse in the background of the final scene. During the filming they needed about 50 extras, but about 300 people came to this opportunity. They eventually used nearly 200 of them.
