I should know better I've seen too much of Rob Lowe's early work to expect anything good from this film, even when it comes to hockey. <br /> <br /> Here is another tired sport theme. Child has potential for grandeur, seems to go far, if his intrusive attitude does not mess up. And, boom, he comes out as this kind of hell video player. Is that all you can say about sports movies? Certainly there must be other things that athletes do. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this film must be one of the biggest cheeseballs. The interaction of everyone is just silly and not in a silly, funny way. I can not imagine any secondary qualities that could liven up my position. Not the actors (certainly not Swayze, who plays Lowe's reluctant mentor), not the story, not the music and very little of the skating sequences. <br /> <br /> I'm usually a jerk for 80's movies, though they tend to be a bit fishy (like North Shore, the Karate Kid). A good 80s sports movie can be found elsewhere. There are many of them out there.
