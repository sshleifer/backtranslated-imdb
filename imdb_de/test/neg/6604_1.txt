Not many people outside Poland had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the brilliant writings of Andrzej Sapkowski. He is very popular in Poland for his fantasy short stories (I think none of them has ever been translated into English, unfortunately!). In short, wiedzmin - the main character in sapkowski's books - is a traveling monster bat, a man of extraordinary strength and skill: he's pretty much your favorite cool guy in Tolkien style. Unfortunately, nobody would see that after the movie. 'wiedzmin' is nothing more than a collection of random scenes that contain wiedzmin and other characters from sapkowski's scriptures, but not from afar, which are similar to the story's plot and dramatic step. The fact that some of the footage shows attractive naked women does not add any quality to it. The film is getting worse by the minute and does not even meet the requirements of the category "That's how bad it is actually good". If you really care about imagination and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read the books instead.
