If you want to make a truly traumatic experience, this horrible movie (if you call it that name) is for you. A movie that is worse than the postman Sizzle Beach USA, Batman and Robin, Kazaam, Fair Game ... Well, you understand what I can say is the worst movie that has ever been made I hope that Troma or someone in America distribute it so that the US can experience the French stench as it is worth.
