Yes, Pigeon and Coburn are great and it's interesting to watch them, though Coburn looks rather reserved and boring here. It's nice to see Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City in the 70s and the cars and clothes of that time. That's all good in this boring movie. The dialogue is incredibly bad, as are most of the actors. The motivations of Ray and Sandy seem forced and unlikely. I have already seen this "pickpocket exercise" several times. There is a long structure that leads to nothing. Better to see an episode of "Streets of San Francisco" or one of the many great crime / capillary films. Just to name a few, there is Bedtime Story, played as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Grifters, Paper Moon, The Sting and, best of all, House of Games.
