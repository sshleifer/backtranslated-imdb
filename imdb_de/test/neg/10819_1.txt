Dire! Dire! Dreadful! Ridiculous! Disappointing! <br /> <br /> Right, you caught in "The Cave" with several "tough" men and one or two women, your systematic killing by "something" and you DO NOT STILL BE naughty adult words !!! A 15 Cert 'here in England, and you can tell! <br /> <br /> The egos of the "Macho Men" were just too much, the bucket is going to happen, I'm going to be sick. <br /> This film should never be exposed to daylight and irony, kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and forgotten forever. I feel like this is not the first time she's cracked her head out of a hole in the earth. <br /> <br /> Just like the movie The Cube, it looked like a good concept, but was just rented in the last post by, well, yourself. <br /> <br /> This comment contains spoilers okay, it's called The Cave. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Bruce.
