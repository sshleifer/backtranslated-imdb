"Beowulf" is like a very bad game: no characters, no story, no real dialogues, bad fights ... It's probably the worst movie in the history of cinema. It is deadly boring, a loss of time. I'm really sorry for Christophe Lambert, who obviously does not know how to choose a role. If someone suggests you "Beowulf", then believe me: run like crazy.
