Director J.S. Cardone presents something sinister and scary, but nothing more. A widowed mother Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) inherits a house in the mountains of Pennsylvania. So she takes her two daughters and moves into the sprawling estate, which seems to be in the middle of nowhere. But somewhere, ninety years ago, a tragic accident caused accidents in which many children were killed and forced to work in the dark. The area, and especially the Tunny estate, seems to be haunted by the spirits of the tiny, evil souls. Legend has it that the screaming kids came out in the moonlight to get their revenge. and you believe it better. Also in the cast: Ben Cross, Taylor-Compton Scout, Chloe Moretz, Julie Rogers and Geoffrey Lewis.
