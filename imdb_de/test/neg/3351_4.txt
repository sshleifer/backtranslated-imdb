When you look at the cover and read about it, you come to a completely different movie than what you get here. Then perhaps I read again the summary for the other movie called "Mausolem" because at that time two films were released for this title, in which both plots were common with key elements. However, I read all about this film here and I know that I have seen this one and not this one and this movie is even less what a movie with this title would be about. I'll be honest, I expect more from a zombie-type image and you get that in this movie to some extent. However, there is more material that encompasses the occult and alien forces, as the opening scene of the people being removed from the coroner at the beginning of the film will occupy. The film also has the old theme that kids go somewhere where they do not belong to a crazy party. In this case, it is actually a mausoleum. The other movie that I believe does not really play this important role in the movie is higher and I also see the score higher for this movie, but it was not the movie I was expecting.
