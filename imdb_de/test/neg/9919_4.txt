A story about growing up, where a teenager rebels against the church and her ministerial father in a small Norwegian village. The landscape is picturesque, but the story is rather presumptuous and tedious, and much of the film is devoted to quoting scriptures. It's like a religious propaganda movie. Theisen, who has just shot another film, is pretty good as a sensitive young protagonist, as is Sundquist as her stern father and Riise as a woman who fascinates Theisen. The film should be fresh and charming, but feels rather stale and tired. Director and co-author Nesheim, who has mainly worked on television, is no match for the task.
