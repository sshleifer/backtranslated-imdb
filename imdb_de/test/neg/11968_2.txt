Me and my buddy have unfortunately seen that. It was shown here on a Sky channel called "Zone Horror," which basically shows evil B-movie horror movies around the clock. It was a boring Friday night, so I decided to have a laugh and watch this one. Apart from the cruel acting, the terrible conspiracy, the bad effects, the inferior camera work and the brain-loving ridiculousness of everything, it was alright, LOL !!! Seriously, it was quite a big laugh, looking for holes and laughing at the stupid actors. There are some half-naked people who could cheer the movie a bit, unfortunately it was the "uggo" who became topless when my buddy called them: oD If you get bored one night and play this by chance, take a chance, it might you just like it :)
