Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It's just so bad. Really an uneven and unfair portrayal of "bad" versus "good" in the wine world. Did you notice that the filmmaker tried one of the wines from the featured protectors of individual wines and terroirs? The camera work is best dizzy, while the content can get you to sleep soon. This is not revealing journalism. What I got from this movie was that the filmmaker was trying to say something about the globalism of the wine by showing, for example, that the Mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world. Okay, that's a good start. How do these wines compare? Does the Mondavi Napa cab taste Italian wines? We will never know, because nobody in the film commented on it. Instead, there are many allusions to Nazis and fascism. Well, these things do not grow grapes. Hmmmm.
