Following the film, which marks the pinnacle of the Ninja genre of the 1980s, the spiteful fans of "The Revenge Of The Ninja" were "treated" with this bizarre offering that blends Ninja Shenanigans with spiritual possessions into that somewhat frightening one Experience spying on a nugget of human excrement in a public swimming pool threatening spies to swim. <br /> <br /> For example, take the supposedly "action packed" introduction to playing all golf courses. Of course! Here we see a nasty, green ninja killing a group of golfers for seemingly no apparent reason (though I must admit that the elitist stance adopted by many participants in this particular sport is a little annoying ... hmmmm.) Maybe that's why he murdered her? .... yes, I can identify with that. In fact, later in the movie, it is said that one of the golfers was a top scientist, but this action is never developed or never discussed again !!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to the intro, the police continue to surround the golf course and basically shoot the hell out of the assassin ... and they have to keep shooting at him because he just do not stay down !!! Yes, literally hundreds of rounds are pumped into him, and STILL HAPPENS that he is killing more and more law enforcement numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally (after an eternity) our rogue detonates a smoke bomb and disappears. ... or so it seems, because he's actually just hiding under the ground. After our hopeless officers have left the scene to search for his body, he crawls out of hiding and staggers away. <br /> <br /> Next we see the pretty Lucinda Dickey, a really beautiful actress who is in excellent physical shape and plays a telephone worker here. From her high point of view, she accidentally discovers the dying (AT LAST !!!!!) ninja. Upon closer examination, the man, allegedly on his last legs, suddenly jumps on her and holds her to the ground. After some fighting, our brave heroine succeeds in getting rid of her, but does not expect the ninja to have hypnotic powers and inevitably succumb to them. At this point, the dying ninja indeed projects his soul into our heroine! His intention is to use her physical form to kill the officers who killed him (the few he could not really eradicate at first!). <br /> <br /> From this point on, throughout the movie, whenever our heroine goes to one of the above-mentioned police officers, she becomes shaky with overwhelming film sequences of flashing lights, smoke effects, and the sword the ninja left her Way exposed to her suspended! <br /> <br /> To make things more complex, a particularly annoying cop (who has enough back and shoulder hair to embarrass an average yak!) is still trying to win her affection (on extremely bloody, annoying way !!!) ...... good Of course, one does not need the prejudice to find out that in a rather weak "(less)" turn towards the end of the film, he is one of the officers she must kill ! <br /> <br /> But wait, there is still hope! <br /> <br /> Come on, the only sho Kosugi! <br /> <br /> Yes, the ninja itself and looks as cool as ever! The golf club news is evidently fast, and after hearing about the events there, he flies all the way from Japan to solve the situation (foreboding the worst!). In a short sub-story (that's a few seconds!). ) Sho's interest in this ninja is personal after the villain has been shown to have killed Sho's father / teacher (?) And blinded Sho's eye (which requires Sho to wear a really decorative-looking eye patch!) <br /> <br / > Having stolen the corpse of his dead nemesis from the morgue and then tracked down our heroine, who offers the evil soul an unwanted abode, is the culmination in an oriental temple (apparently nowhere) where our husband is located Sho succeeds to reunite the two disjointed aspects. <br /> <br /> Now the evil Ninja and Sho are revived from the dead and fight in traditional ninja style with swords, the winner being ........ good Yes, you can probably guess. <br /> <br /> Really, this film has ha There are only two things, the always excellent Kosugi (which, as always, looks absolutely fantastic in the role) and the lovely Miss Dickey. What a pity that the material they were in is so rancid. <br /> <br /> Well, to be honest, I have seen much worse in my time, though I still am. I can only recommend this to those who desperately want to complete their Sho Kosugi / Ninja movie collections.
