I approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst movies ever made. I sat down to see this way of thinking and was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> It's not great. It is not even so good; In fact, it is pretty poor. It's not as bad as I thought, by far. It is quite inappropriate, and obviously as a cost-cutting measure, a lot of stock footage is being put into the service, many of which have no obvious relation to the narrative - a very personal film made by a man who obviously did not have the skills or funding to live up to his idea. Before you put _Glen or Glenda out of circulation, check your own artistic skills. I would like to be able to draw, but everything I try to sketch seems to me like stick man. I would like to sing, but I only scared little children. Wood had an idea, and unfortunately he did not have what it took to make it work. However, this was an incredibly daring film for the puritan 1950s, even if it seems at first glance exploitative or incoherent.
