Ocean's 12 starts to get annoying and gets worse. Like a Celebrity Awards presentation, each lead actor is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop short of having a flashing "Applaud Now" sign. The first 60 minutes of the film are unbelievably disconnected, poorly edited and sometimes completely unrelated to history and confusing. Speaking of history, ... there is one, somehow ... but it's barely visible to all the "Look at Me" shots and cameos. Only Matt Damon actually seemed to "act" during this film ... the rest of the cast just seemed to be there to attend a Rat Pack Wanna-Be session. As for the raid, the action, the drama ... was used in the last 8-10 minutes of the film and was pathetic and disappointing. Dreadful! Dreadful! Dreadful!
