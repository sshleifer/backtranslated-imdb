I have not seen every Jackass episode. It was mildly entertaining, if nothing else worked. But after seeing Jackass # 2, I loved Bam and Dunn. They had a nice attitude in the movie, so I thought I would get involved in viva la bam. Boy, I was wrong. Seriously, you could get some 2'-students together, give them the same budget and I bet they could do something more creative on the screen. I mean, C'Mon MTV !! At 23, where most people are in, give us this garbage. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so compelling. You do not know the characters because there is no attitude at all. You can not appreciate Bam or Dunn or anyone else. If only there was a tiny, tiny thoughtful sleep. Everything we will not forget as soon as the next shot goes on. <br /> <br /> You finally make a good recording and you like what's going on. They sit there waiting for their reaction, and then a jerk closes the scenes with two lame sentences and a bang. Was that the end for this shot or what? If I had been there, I would freak and laugh. Do some crazy stuff and let my adrenaline pump up, but these guys ... They just wrote stupid reactions. <br /> <br /> Yes, such a waste of money. <br /> <br /> Many ordinary people who were not taken under the Jackass wing could write a much funnier script in a heartbeat. Or impress with visual camera work. Even spontaneous cool guys without a script would do a better job. MTV could calmingly bring more material to the screen. You just have to fire the author of this stupid show. <br/> <br /> Some scenes actually require a bit of courage and therefore 2 stars.
