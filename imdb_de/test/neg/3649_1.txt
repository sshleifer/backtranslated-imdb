Subject: Worthtime Acting: Fair (some of it) Content: Ridiculous <br /> <br /> Details: The sound goes from screaming high to almost inaudible. Music is not terrible (but mostly). Dialogue and characterization are ridiculous; The main character's process of discovery is obvious to everyone except himself (and the writer, apparently). Animal scenes are just stupid (sing "moon river" in unfinished, forgotten lyrics, stupid duet to a "herd" of wild boar as an example). After all, the "wet T-shirt" contest is so stupid that it has to be seen to be disbelieving. (Note: the "girl" who wins is not ... well, I will not tell.)
