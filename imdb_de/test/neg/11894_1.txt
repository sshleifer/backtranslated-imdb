This must be the most boring movie I have ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that, thankfully, I did not pay for it. We got a free performance at the school and everyone in the audience was embarrassed when the fun started. This piece of garbage is a badly filmed, much too long film. The real idea of ​​why the film had to be shot took about 10 seconds. The only ones who can be interested in this movie are those who lost their job and want to know why. You might find some of the interviews interesting. Another edition might have made an interesting documentary, but I doubt that the interviews shown were in any way involved. As it is, it is only a tragedy to both see and be part of it. AVOID THIS FILM AT ANY COST!
