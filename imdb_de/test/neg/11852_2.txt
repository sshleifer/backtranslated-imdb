This movie is sad. According to my IMDb co-users (* SPOILER *) RAPTOR uses footage from the Carnotaur films. Well, since I have not seen the Carnotaur movies, I can not say. But I notice pretty bad editing and even worse acting. This movie is a big steaming bunch s ***. That makes absolutely no sense. Here's this thing that calls itself PLOT: Mad Scientist Rebuilds Raptors. Birds of prey kill people. Sheriff examined. * SPOILER * (though I do not know what I'm spoiling) Sheriff takes up the crazy doctor's plans. Army guys are sent in and birds of prey kill army guys. Birds of prey Yes, exactly. I could make a clay figure that looks more real. The FX are the cheapest ever used in a movie. There is a lot of gore. Greed cheap. It does not even look real. I'll agree with another person who rated this movie that the only thing that applies to this movie is the fact that it ends. There is about two seconds of originality in this movie. And that only comes when the sheriff talks to a tax agent by phone about his electricity bill or something. This idea was used in about 100,000 other films with 100,000 different names. Overall, I'll give RAPTOR 1/5 just because it ended.
