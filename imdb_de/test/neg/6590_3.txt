Yes, it could not be historically accurate (in fact, only 6 soldiers of the 9th Rota were killed there), and yes, it has some mistakes and exaggerations (bent machine gun, come on!) Or the "history lesson" about how Afghanistan never was conquered by everyone - a trained Russian officer knew the story much better than that - take, for example, the British campaign in Afghanistan. And yes, there are no Hollywood style multi-million dollar special effects, but it's the best point to show the lives of the soldiers there, their relationships and feelings when the best of friends are killed before their eyes. In my opinion, 9ya rota does a really good job of showing all these things. <br /> <br /> Again, the film has weaknesses, but in my opinion, it seems to be one of the strongest Russian films of recent years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
