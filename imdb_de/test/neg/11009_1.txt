Let me first say that I really REALLY wanted this movie. The actors and actresses looked their role for the most part and did their roles pretty well, but the movie had no real plot. It seemed so "crazy" in such a way that no interesting story ever shone through. In addition, the camera work was often sloppy, it was trying to snap the camera and failed miserably. Mostly the shots, which should look cool, were confusing. Maybe something was lost during the translation, but some of the characters were just ... stupid. The crazy handsome boy sniffing people like a dog? Uhhhhhhh. OK. Overall stinks a fat 1/10. Not worth your time
