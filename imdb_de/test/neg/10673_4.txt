Frank Tashlin's "Censored" is a so-called Private Snafu short, which should underpin the importance of censors to prevent the expiry of military secrets. Snafu tries to inform his girlfriend that he is to be stationed in the South Pacific, but the censor thwarts every attempt to send the letter. These early scenes are the best, with the invisible censor ripping the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially set eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snafu succeeds in sending the letter with the help of the Technical Fairy First Class (which actually teaches him a lesson), is less funny and achieves a disappointing dream that is just a dream. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's extremely barren girlfriend, who is even seen naked and with strategically placed limbs! Directed at the military, the Snafu shorts were often characterized by a heightened discomfort, but these self-limiting scenes are by far the most erotic I've ever seen in one of those shorts. In spite of all that, I prefer the snafu shorts, which are a bit more for the jugular, which usually leads to the death of the main character. To get good examples, look for Tashlin's "The Goldbrick" or Chuck Jones "Spies." "Censored" is comparatively weak.
