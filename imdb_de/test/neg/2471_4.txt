For what it's worth, this is a pretty decent road runner cartoon, albeit a bit short (just under 6 minutes). The gags are at best appropriate, the animation is competent and the newly restored DVD Master looks good. But here the qualities end. Allow me a little background story: 1958 WB got a lot of music from the tin thanks to a labor dispute, which would be used in 6 of the cartoons of the year. There is only one phrase to describe this short music, and that is "it has the 4Kids sound". I use this phrase to describe music that is totally out of line with the on-screen action and feels like it was recorded by an orchestra made up of members of a Sonic Youth cover band. The music in this short version feels hopelessly tackled and unbelievably disgusting, especially considering that there are scenes in this short version (namely the piano trap) that would have worked best with little or no music. <br /> <br /> I do not have any I think a WB cartoon would be ruined by horrible music (even Lava's scores are not that disgusting), but considering that the cartoon is not that remarkable anyway, it almost becomes painful to look with the music. It's as if the consequences of Doctor Who in the late '80s could be bad anyway, yet thanks to Keff McCulloch's unbelievably terrible music (which sounded like he had pressed the demo button on all five Casio keyboards at the same time) was unbeatable , <br /> <br /> I'm going to make people call me crazy for it, but I could easily watch one of Larriva's RR cartoons. At least the music from the tin usually matched the action on it.
