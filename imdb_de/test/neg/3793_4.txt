I had been waiting for this movie for a long time. As far as I know, it has never been released in Australia, so at the end I found a copy on the net and ordered it there. It was finally here weeks after my order confirmation and I was extremely excited to finally sit in front of my TV and watch a movie that sounded so interesting and controversial and was filmed in a part of the world where there are so many good movies. What a disappointment. Within the first few minutes I realized that I had ordered a B-Grader, but still full of expectations. I convinced my son (18) to see it with me while I love sharing when I find a valuable movie with good statements and / or storylines. About halfway up, he said he could not stand it any longer, it was so predictable and amateurish. I agreed, but watched until the very end. Acting was disgusting even for B-grade standards. The stereotyping is also predictable and I feel for the good people of Lake Arthur, Louisianna, who must have been forced to do so after the movie that shows them. Undoubtedly, in many parts of the world, not only are there racial prejudices, not only in the States, but I doubt that they would get away today with all the ridiculous alibis presented here. I had to review the date the film was shot because their attempts to film the cruel scenes were something I expected from a first attempt by a high school student to do a film like Indy. I would like to see how this film is handled by experienced scriptwriters and filmmakers. It's an old story, but it could still play a role in professional dealings. So disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations. The soundtrack was probably the only thing I liked.
