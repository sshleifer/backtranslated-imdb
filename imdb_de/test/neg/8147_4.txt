Granted, I've looked at the MST3K version of this version, but that's not really that bad, at least compared to others who earn my cinematic hate school 'called Girls' Town' on the way races, redemption and crazy (inadvertently The story and the drama are a bit flat, as is the storyline, but it's actually entertaining to some degree when you feel completely bored. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just one small sub-movie of the 50s, but far from the worst movie ever made, with some bright spots in the movie (The Ave Maria sequence was good for me). <br /> <br /> If you like the MST3K- You will not be disappointed, not so much for myself, but I can imagine worse torture methods (Spiker)?
