First and foremost, I'd like to put a big and medium sized finger on the Troma DVD distribution that was stupid enough to reveal the identity of the pivot killer of this movie on the back of the cover! The overview mentions only by chance who is responsible for the massacre on the final day, for God's sake! I do not care how horrible or predictable a Slasher of the 80s can be. Just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point! So, a piece of advice in case you also buy the Troma double feature with "Graduation Day" and "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell", is not it? Do not repeat? Turn the box over and read the back! Watching the movie is already a painful experience, but reading the back really would spoil everything. <br /> <br /> Well, what about the actual movie? Oh boy! Personally, I'm a fan of the cinematic work of Herb Freed. In fact, I do not really know if I should admire him or feel sorry for him! All of Herb's films are pretty bad and amateurish, but at the same time you can see that his direction is spirited and full of good intentions! In contrast to "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil", he followed a contemporary trend of the popular genres and tried to exploit the typical high school slasher films. To offer a minimum of originality, all Victims on Graduation Day are promising athletes and members of the same coaching group of coach George Michaels (fantastic name, I think Herb Freed is a fan of "Wham!"). In the opening balance, we see a young girl die dramatically on the field shortly after a 30-second race was won. The debate over whether their coaches and teammates have not overstepped their physical limits is raised, but one particular person goes one step further and kills everyone she blames for Laura's death with sadism. What a crazy little movie! The script must be one of the most incoherent I have ever seen, with a lot of red herrings and negotiations that go absolutely nowhere, and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words! There's a guy who gets impaled by a spear-clipped football, others are beheaded with an absurdly big sword, and even the most unlucky bastard of them crashes to death on a disguised spike bed! Herb focuses so much on the genius and fast pace of the murders that he totally forgets the negotiations he had previously presented in the film! For example, Laura's sister returns home from her military training and apparently begins an investigation into the circumstances of her death. Half of the movie, however, her character hardly appears in the film. Even the stepfather of the girls is referred to as a violent drunkard, but this interesting gift is immediately ignored. Instead of carefully tense suspense and misleading red herrings, disco dance and roller skating sequences and? Well, sure? Numerous pictures of unattractive chicks of the 80s, who pull off their tops. "Graduation Day" could count on a respectable cast despite its bad character! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "City of the Living Dead") plays a big role as the sophisticated coach Carmen Argenziano ("When a Stranger Calls", "The Defendant") briefly appears as a police officer investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried", "Dracula's Dog") has a very amusing role as the headmaster of the school is under pressure. The youthful beauties on duty include Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Heck, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies is reason enough to count Graduation Day among the quintessential fighters of the early '80s. It's a stupid movie, but entertainment and giggles are guaranteed!
