I would give this movie a zero if I could. How someone could rate it higher, is not me. By the time I saw Rollerball, this was my best bet for the worst movie ever made from a big studio with a real budget (Mangler 2 or Leprechaun in the Hood being the worst ever, does not say much) <br /> Tim Curry's mother needs surgery or something for him to agree to this non-sensual garbage I'm really not sure what happened here The novel was great, director Frank Marshall had a solid track record Alive and Arachnophobia (maybe they should have changed the title to "Africa"), the cast was good and the budget was there, you might think someone had taken the trouble to read the script. <br /> <br / > It would be better to look at Battlefield: Earth again than waste your time Congo will make you long after MST3K returns
