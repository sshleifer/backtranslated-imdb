"The Final Comedown" wants to "say something" about racism and urban violence; Unfortunately, the message is invalidated by the nonsensical writing, the amateurish production and the cumbersome polemics. How persistent do you ask? To give just one example: A black doctor comes out of hiding unarmed with his hands up and is ready to surrender to the police: One of the (white) policemen says: "Do not shoot him. He is a doctor", whereupon another policeman he answers: "Well, he's still an asshole" and shoots him in cold blood. The cops are portrayed as ignorant, racist killers, even if in the end as many dead are among them as among the blacks who staged the uprising. And this whole event was somehow "sensitizing" the whites to the degrading treatment of black people, though in fact it can only create hatred and violence on both sides. Pamela Jones, as Williams' girlfriend, briefly illuminates the screen with her smile and body, especially in a tender sex scene, and increases the rating of this film from 1 to 2 out of 10.
