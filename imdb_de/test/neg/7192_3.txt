Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is a budding songwriter. Newton (Robert Woolsey) is a potential inventor. Both are working on a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building. Johnnie wants to sell a song to Winfield Lake, a songwriter that also owns the building. Lake's secretary Mary (Betty Grable) is Johnnie's sweetheart. When Lake turns up dead, circumstances conspire and Mary and Newton believe that Johnnie is the killer. They conspire again to involve Mary, who is going to jail. But who really shot Lake? Who is the Black Widow, the blackmailer who threatened him? The other characters in this crazy murder mystery are: Lake suspicious woman, a complacent private detective, a seemingly slow caretaker (Willie Best), Lake Auditor, a songwriter who thinks Lake steals him, and another who thinks they all are to steal from him. It's up to Newton and his truth machine to reveal the true killer. <br /> <br /> The Woolsey with the baby voice Wheeler and the cigar seem to me to be an arbitrary mating, but they made several films in the 1930s. Some of them were funny. <br /> <br /> Not this one. George Stevens, who made a remarkable career, directed this grim comedy with a boring murder mystery. But two scenes are good, and both have Wheeler and Betty Grable singing the excellent "Music in My Heart" by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh. The first time they sing it and go up a staircase (after that they dance down again). Later, Wheeler and Woolsey stand on stilts so they can see and talk to Mary, who is in a high-floor prison cell. Wheeler and Grable sing through the bars. <br /> <br /> "The Nitwits" has a few laughs, but the level of the comedy is best illustrated by Woolsey's line: "Sonny, you have the brain of a six-year-old boy and I bet even he was happy "Getting rid of it." It's watered-down Groucho who did not use the superfluous "self" when he said it.
