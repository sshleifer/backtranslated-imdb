At first, I think the casting and acting were excellent. The problem is the story. There is basically no story worth telling, and therefore basically no movie here. Larry McMurtry did Lonesome Dove and I can not fault the original, though it probably did not need sequels. He made Hud with Paul Newman, one of my favorite movies. Mellencamp is said to be a country singer, but the only song I hear him sing is an old Buck Owens song. The film makes chicken farming a big deal. Mellencamp's character has a good wife, and it's absolutely stupid of him to deviate from her. The incident with driving in the cage is absolutely stupid. Maybe people do it in some parts of the country for fun, but I never heard of it.
