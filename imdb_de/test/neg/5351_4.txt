I did not read John Grisham's "A Time to Kill", and maybe that would have helped to understand the movie better. But maybe not. I hear that this is Grisham's most faithful adaptation so far, and if this is true, I can see why so many publishers rejected the novel when Grisham introduced it as his first work "is one of those films that He wants to be an exciting, exciting thriller and a movie that deals with certain social and moral issues, let's face it, these two types of films do not go together in Hollywood, which is why <br /> <br /> The story is about a young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConaughy), a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson) before the murder of two Hillbillies who violently raped his young daughter The day before the trial of the rapists, Carl hid in a cupboard in the courthouse, and as the rapist He was rushed through the building, he stormed out and shot both of them. To help with the defense, Jack accepts the help of a former law student (Sandra Bullock), who proves that her role in this film was completely unnecessary, and put the film in the film for marketing purposes only. Meanwhile, a rapist's little brother (Kiefer Sutherland) was upset that a black man had killed his brother and decided to take revenge. All this leads to a shootout in front of the courthouse, kidnappings, brutal beatings and racial uprisings. I admit that all this caught my attention throughout the movie in addition to the scenes in the courtroom. What I later objected to was handling the film with ethical questions and using formulas in the plot. <br /> <br /> The main question the film keeps asking is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. Sure they can, but that does not mean the man has to be acquitted for the process to be fair. However, this movie does not seem to think so. Besides there are in the plot several gaping holes, which serve the convenience. For example, there is an unknown character named Mickey Mouse, who is a member of the Klan, and for unknown reasons he helps members of the defense team to escape the grave dangers of the other members of the clan. After Bullock was abducted by Sutherland and his company and left dead in the wild, this unknown human comes and rescues her - and we NEVER learn who he is and why he is helping the people he should terrorize /> <br /> If Speaking of the reign of terror of the Sutherland character, it's amazing how witty the police and the Bullock character are holding him throughout the movie. There is a scene where Sutherland turns into a sniper from a building opposite the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake as he comes out, and shoots one of the guards instead. Now you think, with dozens of police, it would be easy to surround the sniper. No such luck. After all we could see, no one seemed to care that a sniper was still going on. Even after Bullock was rescued by Mickey Mouse, she never mentioned who her kidnapper was and was not questioned. Why was that? Easy. The Sutherland figure was needed throughout the movie to add continuous tension, although logically it should not have been in the picture. In addition to Bullock's figure, there is another ungrateful figure. He is Jake's assistant, played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be a reason why his character is in the film - a series of singles for the audience. In my opinion, singles show a great weakness when using "serious" films. It shows that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and the dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention, and thus make the audience laugh, to assure everyone that they are watching an entertaining movie. But enough of the many minor problems of the movie. What about the message of the film here? It is clear that Carl is indeed to blame for the murder. We saw him planning hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. The lawyers argue that it was temporary madness, etc., that made him kill. In despair, Jake asks the jury to close their eyes while detailing the rape as part of his final argument. After describing everything, he adds a last line ... "The girl is white". Then we see members of the jury with tears in their eyes. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, a girl comes out and shouts, "He's free, he's free!". Wait a minute! Are juries basing their judgments on their feelings or facts? Above all, why did not there be scenes that showed what the jury was discussing and what they had really thought after their emotions subsided. I'll tell you why. They could not show the deliberation because NO JURY could free a man from such a crime, no matter how much the closing arguments of the defense touched their hearts. What is the message? That someone is entitled to kill if it is a form of revenge for an earlier crime committed against them? <br /> <br /> This film would have had the courage to say that murder is NOT OK in this situation, because in reality there would be no acquittal. But with dollars in mind, the filmmakers were more concerned about saving the audience's emotions than delivering a responsible message. When people start to kill in revenge, the creators of this film should be held accountable. What a socially irresponsible movie that is!
