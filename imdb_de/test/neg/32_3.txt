This film seems to be well done and further efforts should be made to promote women's films. Besides, this film is also deeply disturbing as it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character who is deeply disturbed. If you've seen publicity material, you may think that this is a moving film about a relationship that has come to an end, but none of that indicates how truly the central premise is disturbed: <br /> <br /> One A woman suicides threatens, unless her soon-to-be ex agrees to relive the most precious memories of her relationship here. When it is said how unfair (to say the least) such a threat is, Tessa (the alleged protagonist) suggests that "life is not fair." <br /> <br /> Huh ??? This character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover to stay, forcing him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) while assuring him, "this is not sex." <br /> <br /> Reverse the sexes, let the leads of Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green play, and this could affect Lifetime with a title like "Hostage to Obsession." There is no medically accepted definition of healthy mental and emotional stability that includes Tessa's behavior in this film. <br /> <br /> Props to Kristen Thomson for playing a borderline psychotic, manipulative ex to a T, maybe too good because there is no well-adjusted person, neither man nor woman, who could observe this and not shudder at the Back would run.
