History, as I understand it, is based on "real events". This can be either good or bad, depending on what kind of license is used for these real events and how they are presented. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are enough to strangle a maggot. I did not expect much. I was expecting a story from rich high school kids doing a deep sea cruise under a stern skipper. I figured that this was a coming-of-age movie in the form of a boot camp or a basic training where the drill sergeant says, "My duty is to bring you out of your winning civilian relationships." Well, that IS in a sense. The children start as children and end up as an organic group. But that's a lot funnier than any bootcamp movie I've ever seen, outside of a deliberate comedy. Who made this thing? The air is filled with slogans that are not in high school but in third grade. The dialogue violates the ear. Jeff Bridges usually does a better job than average, but in this case his performance is mediocre. He brings nothing special in the role, although it is difficult to know, given his lines, how he can do much with them. The rest of the cast is indistinguishable and some of the children are painfully inadequate. There is a lot of tearing and considerable crying. The best scene is a dolphin. <br /> <br /> The immature stereotypes continue until the end. The Coast Guard is used as a hard-hearted court at the post-disaster hearing. The interrogator only hits Bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and misconstructions of events. "They let the crew drink alcohol, right?" (A few harmless drinks.) "And you did not punish them, even though you punished them for killing a fish." (The dolphin business.) The technical details of the sinking are dark. What is actually a "white whip"? And if it's as dangerous as Bridges claims, why was not the entire crew alerted and life-jackets worn? But why continue? If "The Albatross" were a dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ridiculous comic script.
