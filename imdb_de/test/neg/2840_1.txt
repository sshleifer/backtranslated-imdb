Lisa Grant (Adrienne Barbeau) is a realtor who runs the risk of being killed by a crazy lunatic who kills people in her job who think home prices are too high. The motives are damned reserved. Lisa's friend happens to be a talk show presenter who the killer is constantly broadcasting. At first, I was sure that this should be a comedy or a satire, but as the endless minutes thundered, I realized that this was not the case, and that the film was grossly incompetent in every way, shape, form and form , I'm just surprised that something terrible was not staged by Jeff Lieberman (yes, send me some hate mail again, Jeff du Hack). It all went down in flames, everything started here. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: The movie channel
