I could say that this would be a bad one from the trailer, but the lure of the DVD box made me rent it anyway. Boy, I was right. <br /> <br /> Also, for some reason, the DVD version is very blurry and sometimes unclear (in terms of video quality). It looks like they shot the whole movie with a 20 year old camcorder that looks so bad. I really did not like the plot, and after watching the movie, I was very disappointed. I'm not going to tell spoilers, but let's say that the end was so bad that I laughed, it's been done so often English middle schooler's newspaper. If I had to pin down a movie as the worst horror movie I've ever seen, this movie could just be that way. I can not believe they actually released this movie. It really is not worth the rent or a dime of anyone's money, unless you want a good laugh about the cost of the movie.
