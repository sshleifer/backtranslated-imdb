OK, here is the deal. I love action movies and generally have no problem exposing a lot of disbelief about action holes or other implausible actions. However, this film went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous. Let me make that clear. Police send a notorious gangster and police murderer (along with a number of other prisoners) to a bus with a total of two guards. They are then forced to stop at a police station where exactly two police officers work, one of which is one day out of retirement and the other burned out. Apparently, the building was about to close, and somehow the police decided that everyone else in the area had the night for New Year's Eve. Law. But wait, it will get better. Gabriel Byrne shows up to shut down Fishburne before he can rattle him and other dirty cops. (although we never learn anything about their relationship or their dealings). Interestingly enough, the police officers launching the attack on the area are in full SWAT outfit with night vision goggles, assault rifles and the entire nine meters. Later, they even bring a helicopter with MORE people in full gear. I'm not a cop, but I'm pretty sure you can not just roll out of the station with a whole Swat train gear without asking anyone what you do. And the police helicopter ??? In the supposedly terrible winter storm ??? No one near the station hears or sees this great siege of lightning grenades and heavy rifle fire? I mean seriously, come on. I know this is happening in Detroit, but even there it would raise suspicions of a supposedly top secret mission. I also think it's great that they find a Tommy Gun in the evidence room and somehow the weapon still works and the bullets are still intact and usable. <br /> <br /> I could live with some of these problems if there were not any. There are other questions. For one thing, the first few minutes of the movie are filmed beautifully in a very hectic and hyperactive way, and I thought the sound was destined for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The rest of the movie has no sense of tempo, suspense or drama. The "characters" are unrelated, probably largely due to their lack of interest. There is not enough interesting action to turn this movie into a good action movie, and there is not enough character development / storytelling to make this movie a passable thriller / drama. The "relationship" between Hawke / Fishburn is the only thing the director even tries to make interesting or intense. By the way, the last scene in the wild? I thought that was in the middle of a rundown industrial area of ​​Detroit and suddenly we're in the woods? Acting is not so bad in this movie, it's just that directing and writing are cruel. I really like some of the movies from Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Dennehy, but this one is awful.
