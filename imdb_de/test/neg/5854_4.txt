ASTROESQUE (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the title should be ... even less an idea of ​​what half of the time is going to be in this film ... yet It was still somehow interesting to me. This is a low-budget movie after "El Mariachi", shot in 16mm ... and the recordings are very well composed and visually stylish. Director, screenwriter and cartoonist Michael Allred ... I think it's no surprise that the movie looks good. Unfortunately, part of the acting is more than bad ... and the rest is competent at best. Allred himself is best off ... but only because he does not speak much. He mostly walks around looking cool most of the time ... or running around crazy rednecks trying to kill him. The sound is pretty bad too ... almost as if it were unfinished in some places ... maybe they could not afford to pay for the music they had planned? Strange, vague science-fiction conspiracy ... in tone similar to "The Man Who Done to Earth" ... but most of the movie runs on a standard run-from-the-bad-guys and kills them -sie-kill-you plan. Ultimately too awkward to be successful, but not without interest for adventurous movie watchers.
