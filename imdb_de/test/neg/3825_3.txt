This film was the first of the 70s in which women were imprisoned. This movie was incredibly violent and the inmates had many sadistic tortures. The movie is set in the Philippines, which looks like a terribly ugly country. Undoubtedly, the producers have used this factor to their advantage to emphasize the cruel situation in which the prisoners were. Blaxploitation movie queen Pam Grier stars in this movie. She plays Blossom, a renegade who is thrown into the hideous women's prison. Her friend, played by Sid Haig, tries to save Blossom. He and Blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction, and Bloom's detention was staged by the corrupt Phillipino government. Pam Grier and Sid Haig, who stand out among the otherwise sparse cast. The film itself placed too much emphasis on the violence against the prisoners. Their kidnappers used them only as objects of their sadism. That got boring quickly. This movie could have used more interesting storylines and subtleties. This is not one of the better pictures of Roger Corman. The many women-in-prison movies that followed this one were much better everywhere. I would recommend The Big Bird Cage only for Pam Grier fans.
