I do not think it's necessary to write a movie with such a mocking title as "Snake Island," but even in the abstract boundaries of its own genre, this has reached a new low, so my anger needs to be known. The only reason I ever bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because I knew it was going to be bad. It was really late at night, I could not sleep and in the past, really bad movies would consume the energy and make me long for slumber. Very quickly it became very early that this movie would be terrible, but he was even condescending to those expectations. <br /> <br /> The film was directed and directed by Wayne Crawford, who also plays movie stars as a movie star on the African River, who has to hang up his team on a remote island called Snake Island until another boat comes down to pick them up , They hang around, get drunk, and are then exposed to the onslaught of poisonous snakes on the mission to cleanse their island of humans. <br /> <br /> If your jaw dropped in the last sentence of my second paragraph, do not bother to read it again, you did it right the first time. Honestly, I prefer my creature traits when the creatures are simply attacking the stupidly stupid people out of hunger, not because they have some kind of mission. These are not mutated snakes. They are not giants like what you see in "Anaconda". They are ordinary, everyday African snakes like mambas and vipers. They only have the brains to form armies, to take root causes, to work together to catch people, to understand our language and even to dance! Has your draw fallen again? Well, it will continue to fall. In the middle of this awful B-movie, about the part I already gave up, the human characters start drinking around a campfire and suddenly they fall into a sort of orgy. And as they dance naked and so, the snakes stop suddenly stopping them and start jamming. The combination of this scene and the scene where we find that snakes, some of the world's most villainous creatures, have for some strange reason made an alliance against humans turned out to be too much for my poor brain. And just as I thought, although the filmmakers could not bring it to an even lower level, the snakes began to sing. <br /> <br /> The people in the movie? Well, let's just say, I've never cared so much that the creatures kill everyone so fast. I just could not take it anymore. <br /> <br /> I really do not think I have to go on; you get the picture. If there is something that makes "Snake Island" different from other competitors, then it dares to become even stupider, and that is not a complementary feat. Why? Only why? I will always submit to these really bad movies. I think I'll never really know. But "Snake Island" reaches a brand new low. It's a cheap, shabby excuse for a movie that makes "Anaconda" a mindless serpent movie that looks as brilliant and refined and exciting as Steven Spielberg's "Jaws". You were warned.
