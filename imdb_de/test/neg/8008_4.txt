I think that this movie has too many does not make this movie bad. The twists are not the problem of the movie. The story is pretty clever and could have been very cool if filmed properly. The main problem with why anyone complains about the twists in the movie is that the movie is simply not intriguing enough to make people follow them. The film is filmed badly (at least compared to its genre rudder Lock, Stock). Worse, the characters are (though often well played) just flat. The characters do not have enough time to visualize themselves well enough to engage the viewer with a single one of them, let alone understand them. Oh, and the locations are just awful: Locations person (I did not bother to remember the name for your name)
