This documentation is full of problems. <br /> <br /> How arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family? I understand that you think the topic is interesting. I was bored. This is not a fascinating story for me, and I do not know why you think it was like this. <br /> <br /> I do not mean to be mean, but I have to say: most people in this movie are just not attractive. And that's fine, not everyone is pretty. But your camera technique of putting the lens in her face so you can not help being overwhelmed by her unpleasant appearance because it fills your 47-inch TV is not enjoyable. I had to stop half the time shielding myself from the warts, wrinkles, pockets under the eyes and yellow teeth. Actually, I try not to sound inhuman, but to turn back the camera so it does not look as though strangers are breathing in my face. <br /> <br /> The camera work in this "movie" is the same as amateur amateur. It's the kind of camera work everyone sees with a camcorder at a family picnic. Uninteresting framing, transient and even static shots are neglected. If you want to do this for a living. <br /> <br /> I honestly can not tell what the big thing about this thing is.
