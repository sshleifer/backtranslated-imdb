Awful. There is no way around it. A script on the level of a Mexican soap opera, a selection and use of filming locations that make the movie labyrinthine and at the same time repetitive and monotonous, with catastrophic performances of almost the entire cast. The references to Tarantino's bad work are more of an insult than anything else. I suppose that was not for the shameless and plot-independent exploitation of Matadinho's generous curves, no one would bother to see this movie in a theater, not in the mood to see Portuguese cinema.
