Creepy facemasks and Slasher movies have come together over the life of the cycle such as cheese and chives. People often assume that it was John Carpenter who triggered the trend, but as with many clich√©s of the genre - the Italians did it first. Films such as Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the authors of a crazy maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a few American slashers before Halloween, which justify a mention. Classroom massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend prior to 1978, while the city, which fears the dreaded sunset, is widely regarded as one of the earliest teen kill movies. <br /> <br /> Carpenter's groundbreaking film was not the first masked nightmare, but it certainly began with the competition between directors to unveil the spookiest disguise for their bogeymen. Over the years, we've seen some memorable competitors, but my favorites would have to be: the crazy miner of my bloody Valentine, the sadistic soldier of the Prowler and the copper-faced murderer of the Wicked Games. I'm also looking forward to many of the killer clowns that have occurred in the entire category. The last scene in The House on Sorority Row must be listed as one of the best, and The Clown of Midnight is also one of the craziest disguises. <br /> <br /> A leather mask was probably the last type It is used in a Slasher movie, probably because it is widely associated with sexual perversion, which of course does not lead to a sinister disguise. In later years, however, both blackout and darkness decided that fear could well be associated with a gimp suit. So did the later of the two? <br /> <br /> The screen lights up with the sound of blue sirens as police officers run to a hostage-taking. It seems as if a stressed-out gentleman has had enough of being in cruel turkeys with a low Brahm figure, so he has decided to hold his wife and child at gunpoint. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to wrestle with the shooter, but unfortunately loses the fight for a loose pistol and it seems the gray haired officer is at the end. Fortunately, he is rescued by a precise marksmanship of Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the hottest female police officer in the California police force. <br /> <br /> Her heroic encounter first brings the brunette to the Detective class, and it's a feat that's highly envied by her male counterparts. In the meantime, a leather-covered madman is cheering in the city slaughtering whores and dumping their bloody corpses on street corners. Ryder and Shine are set on the murderous Gimpe case, and the first call to question is a shabby local photographer known as the "Street Walk", Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is such a first-rate inspector that ordinary police regulations do not seem to apply to her, so she quickly gets in touch with the cameraman, even though he suspects that Numero Uno is a suspect. As the bodies gather more and more in the city, she decides to go undercover to flush out the S & M madman. <br /> <br /> Zipperface effortlessly sums up everything that went wrong with the slasher genre toward the end of its rein, if anything. What began as a great springboard for aspiring filmmakers and their loved ones had been reduced to a channel of feces through films with flat direction, tensionless twists or shocks, and talentless mediocre actors. The boom years of the splatter-flicks of the early eighties masked their lack of strong dramatic line-ups with sticky special effects and exciting directing effects. Unfortunately, at this point in the cycle, titles such as Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes had been conspired to determine the category in which many of the above characters ended. In an early grave. <br /> <br /> Donna Adams is not even vaguely convinced as a lawyer and her inexplicably idiotic behavior - including doing a striptease for a top suspect in a nationwide murder investigation - more mind numbing pitiful than you'd expect would. Mansour Pourmand could not direct traffic, and the vast majority of performers would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial. I searched and searched, but found nothing of merit or note. <br /> <br /> If you manage to keep the TV on until the end, you may be quite surprised by the identity of the killer. To be honest, I doubt you even care about it until then. And another plus? Well, um ... the disk is perfectly symmetrical, which means you could use it as a mat to set up your cup of tea? Apart from that, there is really no other reason to buy Zipperface. Bad bad bad and not in a good way, these are 90 minutes of my life that I could have spent constructively by plucking my chest hair. Miserable.
