Let's face it, a really horrible movie, no ... I mean, a "really" horrible movie is a rare, weird and beautiful thing to watch. I admit that there is a special place in my heart for movies like Plan 9 from space, Half Caste, Species and so on. And though I give this movie a 1, I urge anyone who likes a bad movie to do so. It's really a bad movie to find a friend, have snacks, drink something and find the special occasion it deserves: Aussie Park Boyz. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of the main character to the eyes, where the eyes roll off while trying to inject the intensity directly into the film without ever looking into the camera (a slice of ham straight from silent pictures - lead your heart out of Rudolph Valentino) to the sudden hey-we-out-of-film graduation, you ... will ... not ... stop ... laughing. <br /> <br /> To sum up the film, it is the warriors of a poor man, complete - and that description alone should be enough, but then comes the miracle of the "spaghetti food scene," the "we" I have their tickets 'They will not leave the city now' Scene ', "It's the Asians! Run !!" and more. The only really offensive part is a voluntarily filmed rape. Besides, I dare you to watch this movie. And I dare to find evidence of the acting, the lines, the direction or other of those boring and superfluous elements that critics say a movie must be judged to be good. <br /> <br /> If this movie does not trigger any uncontrollable laughter before its end, I can only roll my eyes from side to side and say "You dog! You dog! You dog! You dog!" "
