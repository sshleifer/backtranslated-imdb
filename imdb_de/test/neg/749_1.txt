My mother, my cousins ​​and I are pretty big Jane Austen fans. We know all the words to the 1995 masterpiece of pride and prejudice, and have met Emma Gwyneth Paltrows with embarrassment. I've read all the books and even ate Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a few times. My mother and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bad idea! This is about the worst movie I have ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass or the 1939 film by Nancy Drew on Wal-Mart (my previous "worst films"). The first thing you find wrong in the opening scene is that the "heroine," Catherine, has a cruel and strange idea, inspired by dirty novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch. Throughout the novel, she has dreams (day and night) of being carried away by a vile man with a greasy wig, being dragged across a field that's heading for God knows what, and suddenly by a raging dude Saved on a white horse. <br /> <br /> The second thing that every viewer of the movie will notice right away is the high-pitched vocal and saxophone music that the soundtrack should be. No dainty classical music or English country dances here! Almost at first glance, it is also obvious that the actress (lacking a better word) that Catherine plays is completely out of the game. First, it is rather unattractive and is even more reproduced by its inexhaustible behavior. Her looks and movements are just crazy! Besides, they are completely affected and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> This sad lack of acting skills affects pretty much all actors in the movie. Not even Mr. Tilney, the supposed "dashing young suitor," is decent. <br /> <br /> With the introduction of more and more characters, a strange costumes of filmmakers becomes apparent. Huge headgear in the style of Marie Antoinette meet the (mostly) correctly designed Empire dresses. A French woman, apparently a friend of General Tilney, in black is like some old Goth nightmare - she has a striking resemblance to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance becomes even gloomier with a HUGE crescent beauty sign on her cheek. I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all women wore. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly that my mother and I cried for about ten minutes was the "bathing" scene The first thing that struck us was that men and women were together in a big bathhouse bathing - probably not very likely at the beginning of the 19th century - then we saw that all women wore large porcelain or plastic plates, which were worn with cords around their necks.The plates floated horizontally on the water and contained some mysterious pieces of something We figured it was soap, then fragrant herbs, and when the mysterious substance disappeared between shots, we concluded that it was food, but I'm still not sure. <br /> <br /> And That's not even half of Northanger Abbey, my warning to anyone considering renting this movie: Stay in the picture, and if anyone's considering buying it - well, I do not know what I mean there to say. <br /> <br /> You might think that the actors and the others who made this film get about a quarter of it. On the way, they would realize what kind of monster they are creating and stopping. Unfortunately not, and Northanger Abbey was released to the world.
