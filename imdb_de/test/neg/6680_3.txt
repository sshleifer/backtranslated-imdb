I was interested in this movie because someone made a beautiful video with clips for Bj√∂rk's "Bachelorette". So I saw the movie. And it is really amazing. A masterpiece of animation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, history can not keep up. It starts off well, with interesting plans about people fighting to own the rosebraut, but suddenly elevators fill up with water and lose their walls, people float there, and finally Utena is turned into a car for no reason high speed chase. <br /> <br /> I like anime a lot because it can create alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. If you watch this movie, turn off the sound, it's better that way.
