Another lame attempt to make a movie "dark" and "thought-provoking" - whatever that means. You have Al Pacino say many words: "Television killed football." Yes, anyway. This is another movie showing Oliver Stone's Delusions of Grandeur. If Stone tries to show us that football is going to be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his posed camera movements and Kid Rock songs? For purely aesthetic reasons, he even throws Cameron Diaz into battle. It's a shame that Diaz and Pacino have to meet in such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Since "Scent of Woman," writers and directors have used Pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines. His characters are nothing more than loudspeakers - their voices cover up what would normally be superfluous and banal. He has to reinvent himself and show how he can act without screaming. He has to stop apologizing for hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like "Organized Football is Versous" and playing a good story.
