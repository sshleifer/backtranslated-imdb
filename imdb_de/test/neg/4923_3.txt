The fact that a movie is on DVD does not guarantee that its quality is very good. The fact that the quality of a movie is worn down does not mean that you should not buy it. This review actually refers to two movies paired on a single DVD. <br /> <br /> The actions of these films are of little importance. You are only interesting for people who collect Holmes movies? If you just want some of the better deals, you would do well to buy some from Jeremy Brett. or, if necessary, a Basil Rathbone. There are a few other very good Holmes films showing good actors at once. like "Seven Per Cent Solution" or "Sherlock Holmes Privacy". In any case, these films are considerably less predictable. <br /> <br /> Here we have a couple of movies featuring some of the best actors, though the results are rather disappointing. This seems to be the only CD with these films (although "Deadly Necklace") appears in the same version on other CDs. <br /> <br /> "(Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace") is from 1962, though it does not look or sound. Some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produced by Hammer Studios. Not that Hammer is not really a drum stuff, but when it comes to Christopher Lee, they usually did a better job. The print is a direct transfer from a rather worn 1: 1,33 copy in black and white. The quality of the color indicates that the original may have been in color, and the cut ends of the film aspect suggest that it was originally 1: 1.66 or more. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in the beginning of the 20th century ?? not unlikely, since Holmes was still working at that time (and did not actually die until 1957). However, the script is not adapted to an actual Doyle story. It features an Egyptian necklace, and Professor Moriarty is a world-famous archaeologist and prince of crime. The plot is melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> The biggest defect of this movie is this? for whatever reason? Hammer filmed it in Germany. It was shot in English though. It was then synced to German and then synced to English again. So what you're hearing is not Lee or any other original actor, but a bunch of strangers? outside Lee, I do not doubt that anyone would know any of the other actors. That's too bad since Lee (see "Hound of the Baskervilles") makes a decent Holmes. As it is, his voice is doubly condescending and as simple as bread pudding without raisins or cinnamon. <br /> <br /> The music for this film is mainly jazzy, in a possible attempt to be "period". Too bad that nobody thought about ragtime. As it stands, the music does not relate to what is happening on the screen and is often in conflict with the action. <br /> <br /> The other movie is "(Sherlock Holmes and) The Speckled Band" from 1931 with a young Raymond Massey. The picture and sound quality is fully in line with the efforts of 1962 and is even better. Massey makes a pretty respectable Holmes, though he certainly does not have the role of Rathbone and Brett. The other Thespians participating in this production are unlikely for modern readers. The acting? as in many films of this time? Thanks to the post-Victorian stage and the silent films a lot. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that "The Deadly Necklace" is available on DVD, "The Speckled Band" only with the previous film. <br /> <br /> There is very little else to say about this film. The settings seem to be an odd combination of the 1890s (horse-drawn carriages) and the 1920s (electronic devices like a primitive voice recorder). All in all, it is an interesting curiosity and a sufficient incentive to buy the DVD with the pairing and not just a DVD with "Deadly Necklace".
