2001 is one of those films in which, if you do not like it, you are told that you do not understand it and you need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. They are told that you obviously have a slow attention span and just want to see sex, explosions and let the action pass on a tablet. <br /> <br /> Let's break the movie, right? Three minutes of blackness, with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the savannah. Then a few monkeys find a black stone and start killing things with bones. Cut off the first of many 20-minute shots of ships while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the background. A bunch of meaningless dialogues and a group of lunar scientists find another monolith. <br /> <br /> Reduce a spaceship that's too long for the crew - three sleeping people, two people named Dave and Frank just a little more personality than the stiff ones in hibernation. And then there's HAL, the "perfect" supercomputer that runs the ship. Predictably, he snaps and breaks the first law of robotics. That's something that has potential. An evil, cold-ruthless super-mind that controls the environment and can predict any movement. And what does he do? He lets a man float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so that the three sleeping boys die and Dave is hovering in a capsule. He simply uses the airlock, puts on a space suit and turns off the HAL slowly. Then there seems to be a psychedelic "evolution" in Jupiter. <br /> <br /> Here's the movie with the pauses: Monkeys see monoliths, kill things. Scientists find lunar monoliths. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave receives a pre-recorded message and continues to develop with Jupiter. <br /> <br /> This is not it, if I do not understand it. I'm bored to tears through long stretches of nothingness. Sure, it's realistic, but I have no reason to be interested. Regardless of the message, no movie can be good without being entertaining. Honestly, any character could be replaced by Keanu Reeves and nothing would change.
