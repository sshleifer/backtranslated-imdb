This Harold Lloyd Short was not really much; not one of his funniest efforts. Of course, I never think of other children as something hilarious. That's the main part of this story, Harold and his wife Mildred Davis babysitting two of his in-laws' young children. One is a baby crying all the time, and the other is a four-year terror that does everything but demolish the house. Keeping the child from chaos was not entertaining to me. <br /> <br /> Best of all, the last four or five minutes in which the couple thinks this big idiot (Noah Young) is breaking into their house. Half the time is when the cat scares the couple, but overall this segment is fun with good gag-gags. It reminds me of another Lloyd short film "Haunted Spooks". Do not save the whole picture, which I probably would not look at anymore. Lloyd has done too many other good things to waste another 25 minutes on it. It's just not so funny.
