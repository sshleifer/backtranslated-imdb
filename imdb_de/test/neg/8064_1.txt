How bad compared to this movie is Cannibal Holocaust Citizen Kane. There is the stilted acting, the cruel dialogue, the half-baked plot and, like his companion piece, far too much in the way the animal killings on the canvas actually took place. In contrast to the Holocaust, Ferox is a direct film. It is not a pseudo documentary. In a way, this helps production because the film is very sharp and sharp compared to Holocaust's graininess. Unfortunately we get back a group of people who are morally reprehensible. They torture the natives and essentially bring everything they eat. There really is nothing worthwhile in this film. I've been rather lenient with my review of the Holocaust because of an actual attempt at testimony and style, but in Ferox's case, there's no reason to watch it, unless you only have blood and blood.
