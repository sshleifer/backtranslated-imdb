This is the television program of the 1990s, not the film of 1979. It looks like three episodes that total just under 90 minutes. Before I looked at her, I thought it was one of the movie versions, and I immediately realized she had a TV show feel I just do not feel the story is not there, and there is not much excitement or Drama. I often looked at the elapsed time on my DVD player, I was really bored too. I also thought that part of the dialogue, politely expressed, was not good. I also thought that acting left much to be desired. But that's just me, it's a good, clean and healthy family entertainment. There is certainly nothing offensive here. Children will probably enjoy it. For me The Black Stallion is 4/10
