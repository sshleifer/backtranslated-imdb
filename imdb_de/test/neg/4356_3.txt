It is extremely rare that I see a movie from 1955 that I do not love. Noir, JDs, science fiction, drive-ins; I dig it the most. Robert Aldrich is a director who has done a great job, and most of this cast has done well. So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> When I worked in the independent film world, we talked about so-called "actor films". Acting films are films that are not suitable for anyone except for other actors. Actors like "actor films" because they see ACTing - that's a totally exaggerated melodrama. Actors love to get the chance to "let everything they have" and they are very happy with watching other actors doing it. In many interviews with actors, they say, "He was a great director, he did not bother me in any way." Actually, that's the opposite of good direction, because the only thing about having a director on set is keeping the actors from making a fool of themselves (which they'll always do, if they have the chance). Apparently Robert Aldrich forgot about this project. Or maybe he was ill. Or maybe he thought there was no hope of saving the script at all, so what? However, here is an example of a lesser-known movie that is best forgotten. The characters gesticulate, pontificates and hammer it usually through. One thing I can say is realistic: It's in Hollywood and everyone pretends that his little issues are the most important thing in the world. It's not fun to watch, but it's realistic. What's unrealistic is that a producer desperately trying to keep his star under contract will do anything to antagonize him in almost every possible way, including the obligation to engage in illegal activities. But these and other actional contradictions only carry the melodrama, which increases the opportunity for hand wrestling and allegations. <br /> <br /> I've made it to the end of this movie, which does not make it worse than a "3" out of 10 in my book. But why test your own stamina when there is so much else to rent?
