I saw this in my city's independent cinema - no surprise, because no mainstream theater would want its fingerprints on this train crash. The constant shifting, refocusing and zooming can cause a sensitive person to motion sickness. It looks more like a film student project than a serious movie. <br /> <br /> Although the characters are well played, they are unlikely. Josh is deceitful and always tries to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. Unrelated to Emily and Josh's relationship, she comes out as a crying, insecure girl desperately trying to marry. Rhett is an emotional child who can not understand the complexity of human interactions. Without redeeming qualities, I did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> Obviously some people liked the movie because the couple behind me laughed hysterically. Of course, they could make fun of it. I could hardly blame her for it.
