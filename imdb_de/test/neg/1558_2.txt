Zarkorr is a bad movie. This does not even rate his good category in the so bad. It's just bad. From the (missing) set design to the acting to the special effects everything stinks of this film. For starters, the film looks like it was shot in empty rooms with a few props to make it look good. Then we become so acting that a high school game looks like an Oscar candidate. And to top it off, there are the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur would park them in their garage. The cities where the monster is supposed to be crushed look like my nephew's train. So obviously wrong that they yell at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster suit. It's just too bad they spent their entire budget on it and have nothing left for the rest of the movie. And maybe a decent script would have helped.
