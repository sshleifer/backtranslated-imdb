Review: A group of five young American men badly hit by a train during the Ardenne attack during World War II receive the assignment as an outpost, looking for activities by the enemy. They are in very poor shape, both physically and psychologically, and believe they have struck gold when their outpost is in a deserted but once plush mansion with food. But after a while, there are some enemy activities, and it is very strange. Not hostile, but strange. It seems that there is a German squad out there in an equally bad state who wants nothing more than surrender. <br /> <br /> Comment: Based on a novel and my guess, the novel is much better as the story does not seem to translate very well to the big screen. In fact, it's another war movie, much more about mental pressure during wartime than fighting and slaughtering. I can almost feel that scenes that have been full of suspense, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, just stay flat in the movie. It's not exciting, just different and in many ways absurd. Often people are just crazy and the reasons are unclear or hinted at best. So if that mental pressure does not come through, the main part of the whole story, I thought the story would have fallen through. It was not good, it was not interesting, it did not keep me on the edge and it did not really send a message. Actually, it did not do anything. <br /> <br /> The cast is interesting, many young actors who became stars at the beginning of their career. The drama is good, but not outstanding, and some characters also fell into the absurd zone. Much of this, I also think that this story needs the time, space and pace of a novel that can not be given here. Going halfway is definitely not good enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
