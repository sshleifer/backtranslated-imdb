The only thing that has more holes than the premise of this movie is the script. Flatliners is the ideal showcase for Joel Schumacher's glorious, extravagant, ironic lack of talent. The plot is completely illogical, but falsely cumbersome, and everything is directed in a centimeter of his life in a clich√©d, overheated way. I think it's great that the Med School autopsy room is a deep vaulted marble arched building with red Rembrandt paintings hanging on the walls. I love how Keifer Sutherland drives a Jeep mounted on a canvas. No one in Joel Schumacher's films lives in an uncaused way. It is always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painful in the hip. The hip is severe and obsessive, according to the concept of a middle-aged billionaire man child of hip. And holy crap! The part where Balduin's brother # 16 dies and comes back to life and is followed by all the women he uses, "I'm calling you" and "I just need some space," is the funniest friggin thing in the whole Universe!!!! In which world do we live in the world where Joel Schumacher constantly has to throw money from people? "Flatliners" led me to review the entire work of the man exclusively on the high-quality yuk contained therein.
