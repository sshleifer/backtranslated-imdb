Rarely have I seen an action / suspense movie that was so boring. None of the action scenes is exciting, the plot is nothing special and apart from a few actors, acting is bad. Charlie Sheen (Platoon, Major League) plays the White House Chief of Staff, who is in the middle of a plot to kill him and other people. Donald Sutherland (A Time to Kill, Fallen) plays a friend he tells everything he can, and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante's Peak) plays a reporter who meddles in the situation. Charlie Sheen is fine as a star, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who performs well. Linda Hamilton shows a poor performance. With a bad movie, I really like it when it comes to a happy end, but this movie has a very cheesy ending with something almost ridiculous stuff.
