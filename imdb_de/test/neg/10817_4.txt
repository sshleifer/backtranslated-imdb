Some scientists go into a cave for some reason and there is a kind of creature that kills them. <br /> <br /> I usually give a more detailed story, but I did not pay much attention to it. All in all, it was boring and the only time you really pay attention is during the action scenes the director has done wonderfully. <br /> <br /> The acting is fine, but the characters are so boring and unforgettable they mingle in your mind. You'll forget who lived and who died for two reasons: 1. The kills are boring 2. The characters are boring. <br /> <br /> The end might have shocked me more, if I knew who was who /> <br /> So you're looking for a movie about the creatures in the cave? Instead, look at the descent.
