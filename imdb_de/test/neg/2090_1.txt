Last week on Friday I saw "Snakes on a Plane" with my friends. It was amazing compared to this horrible movie (though many scenes were ridiculously funny). Basically, a woman has a Mayan curse in which she poses harmless, harmless garter snakes who, instead of attacking her, crawl into her victim. The girl with the bag of coke is pretty hot. The title screen says "100 passengers ... 3,000 Venemian Vipers!" Scary, I know. There were not even 100 passengers on the train. Only a few stoners and a few other washed-out losers. It's worth the five dollars if the woman turns into a giant CG snake and devours the whole train, then gets pulled into a huge vortex. It's just sad that someone went to such lengths to make a crap movie just to make a few bucks because of "Snakes on a Plane" - madness.
