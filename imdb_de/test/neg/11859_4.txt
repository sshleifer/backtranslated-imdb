I'm going this game and it's alright, I think. I only expected a bit more. The main problem with this is that hacking is extremely hard, even if you read the instructions, you can not get it. The graphics are not as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could bring some improvements. When guards move in the water and a sticky shocker shoots in the water, the guard fries up, but nothing happens. In my opinion, this is the worst of the three. I have not played the first yet, but Pandora Tomorrow, this and double agent. However, this game earns a 4/10. Could do with some improvements.
