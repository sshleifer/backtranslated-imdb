First of all, I'm a big fan of Tolkien and will base most of my criticism on his books. <br /> <br /> The film is a standard adventure movie that has been created with sophisticated special effects and nice sound track and fine acting. If this movie had something other than "Lord of the Rings", the reviews would not be half as good as here. <br /> <br /> The problem of the movie is that it takes over the basic plot of Tolkien's books but then it goes and "hollywood's" all it can, many scenes from the book are missing or are quite changed that Characters are also changed out of the book, a thing that should be punishable in my opinion! What the film lacks is a deep insight into the characters, I know that making a good book out of a good movie is almost impossible, and it did not work out better, most of the time the characters' motivation remains blurry. <br /> <br /> As an adventure cinema, it would be 7+ / 10. As an adaptation of Tolkien, 2/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I mean, honestly, what is Arwen doing? Rivendell ford? And the comments that this movie is "the best of times", I can only say that you are very young, or you have not seen any good movies ... Peter Jackson should have called this film as a movie adventure film based on the Lord of the Rings.
