His significant charisma and eye-catching presence are all that keeps this water afloat, but Fred Williamson has made far better urban action films, including many of his later films released by Vid. The Williamson films of the big studios from the early to mid-70s rarely had the breakthrough of their mid-level players, and this is a prime example. Clumsiness, little violence and the PG rating are far from questionable. Definitely worth a look for Hammer Completeists.
