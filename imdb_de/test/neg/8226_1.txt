I have no qualms about how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Fine. What ever. I lived there long enough. I do not need to see a movie that captures the garden state. <br /> <br /> What I'm worried about is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy for you. We will use a few bullet points. There are likely to be some spoilers. (Not that you could NEVER predict the movie): <br /> <br /> -The music placement was irresistibly enforced and patronizing. Example: Large: "What do you hear?" Sam: "The shins Have you ever heard of them?" "No." "Listen to this song - it will change your life!" And then they play the Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. (Do not you love it when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you - the viewer - how to react to something? I love that! Hey, they should have put subtitles in different scenes where we're supposed to "giggle" "Say 'aaaaaw)'" "cry" "get inspired" etc.) <br /> <br /> -The scenes were so bad. SO cliche. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: The entire movie. But no, really an example: You are in the rainy quarry near the ark. Greater runs - in the pouring rain (oh he is SO TORMENTED!) - on a heavy machine part and SCREAMS! Oh, how moving! But wait! Here come Sam and his buddy (the annoying drug addict) and they ALL SCREAMING !!!! BUT WAIT!!!! OH DEAR GOD!!!! Here it comes! THEY KISS!!! Long, deep !!! IN THE RAIN!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> -The dialogue was so bad. SO cliche. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They leave the ark and Sam says something like, "Hey, good luck exploring the infinite abyss." And the guy says back, "you too". Oh ... Oh my god! I never realized ... could it be? Oh my god it is! The life of Large is like ... ohmigod ... AN INFINITE ABYSS !!!! Another example: Large and Sam in the airport. Sam says something like "Is this goodbye?" Not enough for you? OK, Largeman says something like, "This is not a dot at the end of the sentence ... it's ellipses." And guess what happens when he tries to go down the bridge and return to his LA life. You know what? Do not guess It's a waste of your time. <br /> <br /> - It's a rip-off movie by Wes Anderson. When not working in a melodramatic and clich√©d way, the movie spends a lot of time with crazy, crazy characters. Hey, Sam's brother ... Thanks, Zach Braff, for taking him in, because he really made the movie a lot more structured. Also demolish Anderson: the dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. In friends walks, "vagina!" says one of them. Then they see him sitting with Sam, so one of the friends says, "Sorry, I said vagina." And Sam says, "It's okay." <br /> <br /> -Inventive cinematography that is not inventive but meaningless and annoying. Give me a break with the acceleration / deceleration of the movie. Again, Wes Anderson makes it effective in his films. And it was done well in "Donnie Darko". But it was really pointless. Impressive. A crazy party where people take X and snort Coke. Better to roll all the tricks! <br /> <br /> - You can count the good moments on one hand (even if your fingers are missing). That makes it even worse. The retarded quarterback thing ... well, that was good! The little thing he says (largeman) just as they are coming to the quarry (something about turpentine shed) ... that was good! Oh, wait, that's it. <br /> <br /> You know, Zach Braff is always a bit too sweet, I think. But he is sympathetic. But, man, that's forced, overbearing, melodramatic (have you already got that?), Overly sweet, overly everything. This movie is awful. Apparently I'm outnumbered, as this waste of time is currently rated at 8.0. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for something really bad and subtle and unique. NOT. RENTAL FEE. THESE. MOVIE.
