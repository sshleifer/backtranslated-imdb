Cowardly and cynical, "The Hospital" is the nadir of Paddy Chayefsky's special brand, which disguises Sato's status as satire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to director Arthur Hiller and ham, this ridiculous script gives away the visually ugly, bad presentation it deserves. <br /> <br /> Just a great performance by George C. Scott, in the kind of common role he was born in, prevents "The Hospital" from being a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Ironically, though, Scott's performance is doing a disservice. Its magnetism lets them watch as they turn off the VCR more profitably and clean the cabinets, stare at the clouds, or watch repetitions of "Baywatch". Anyone who invests emotionally, in any case invests the set-up _ modern medicine apparently gone amok _ will feel cheated by the grim payoff, where Chayefsky shows that the system works well, making your carping quit. <br /> <br /> While the first half of the film delivers a fun black comedy, it turns out that it's a red herring. Before this becomes clear, Chayefsky Scott gives some good lines, as his middle-aged white middle-class man. <br /> <br /> Bitter, alcoholic, impotent, Scott Herbert Bock has alienated those who know him best and he has the bile to further estrange them. In Chayefsky's worldview, of course, this makes Bock a magnet for a half-old hippie chick. <br /> <br /> A set of adjectives to play, the long-haired, leggy, braless and almost bustless Diana Rigg fights in the role of the girl. The British rig is misunderstood as a southwestern free spirit, but any other actress would fight as well. Like the rest of a good cast that is no longer needed, Rigg can not overcome a script that is not interested in any character but Bock or a philosophy that goes beyond banality. <br /> <br /> For fans of George C. Scott This is another star round and worth watching. For fans of the black comedy turn off after the first 45 minutes. For everyone else, do not bother.
