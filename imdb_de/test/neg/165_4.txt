After seeing that, I came to the conclusion that it was most likely a chick movie. After that, I found out that Keira's mom wrote the script so she pretty much confirmed it. A chick movie, however, can appeal to men; This seems and does not seem to be so good for women (look at the bleak cash receipts). I think both sexes agree that the scene in the movie is stupid, with an analogy between the pain of birth and the pain of an amputated limb without anesthesia. Although men do not suffer the pain of childbirth, we understand that this is a painful process. but it is a natural pain, an amputation certainly not! Women understand this better. I suspect a woman has tried to make a feminist statement that has a bad taste. In fact, many things in this movie are in a very bad taste. Although movies today are known to have a bad taste, this movie is really "excellent" in this section. This could have been a good movie showing the struggles of Dylan Thomas during World War II; and how strong was the feeling about men who somehow managed not to serve military service. Keira's screenwriting mother tries to show how this feeling was used against Dylan, but it really upsets it. Instead, we get a girl's movie about how two young mothers join together. Type of. In a way. Perhaps. Somehow. Noteworthy is the fact that a soldier (the husband of Dylan's wife's girlfriend) is sent home after a combat service. However, it is not clear if the war is over !! Many things about this movie are similarly unclear. and although I have already said that I will do it again, it seems to be the central motive of this mess.
