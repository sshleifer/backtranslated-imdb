This ugly guy with long, bad hair and his girlfriend lands in this house and they argue and argue about his old girlfriend. It was suspected that there was something weird in it, but I did not see anything scary at all. It mentions a demon from the sea, but that's not going anywhere. I wish it had been done, because then it would have removed the tension from the jealous love triangle. The title of the film makes it look like it's an eerie and exciting movie, but it's so far from it that I could not believe it. I waited and waited until it was over and I was so happy when it happened. It did not fit the title the way it should have. The cover had a cool image, but I should not judge a cheesy movie by its cover.
