This is an amazingly bad action movie. I would say the main mistake is that it's boring. Arghh! Funky wardrobes, retro chic set design and decent cinematography can not identify this movie as a Snoozer. Mod Squad's second (biggest) mistake is the lack of character development - underlined by the lack of talent of the actors. I tend to like Claire Danes' work, and I was pretty surprised she did not exist in this movie. Giovanni Ribisi is incredibly wrong: how could his cotton, awkward playing style possibly fit into an action movie? As for Omar Epps, he has to take a few acting lessons to learn how to emulate. The man had the same facial expression for the entire movie! My suggestion is to save a few bucks and wait for this turkey to be seen on the cable.
