This is a very strange product from Hollywood. Apparently, there has not been a good test because actors in the final credits have been completely edited out of the movie, which means a hasty cut was made. It feels like the normally competent Demme has wrestled and been thrown away. On the other hand, it lacks so much substance that maybe nothing could save it. It has no real center in the narrative or in time. Although the runtime is 92 minutes, I remember that it ended abruptly, around the 80-minute mark. It's over, even before it starts. It's pretty laugh-free. <br /> <br /> The virtues of the "Matthew Modine image" were as elusive at the time as the current Luke Wilson image.
