You'd think a movie about incestuous sisters who eventually kill their employer can not help packing, but then you'd be wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy. There is no character development. There is no redeeming visual beauty. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of time. The exploration of how the relationship between the sisters develops is nil, their sexuality is never anything but a grotesque, the class relationships are glossed over, and the employer's stupid caricature does not equal depth.
