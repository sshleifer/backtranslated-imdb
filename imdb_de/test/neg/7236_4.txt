This is the sequel to Octopus. <br /> <br /> Pff ... OK. A lot of stock footage, but pretty good. I'm surprised that there actually was a huge robot octopus that actually did not look so bad! I was actually pretty surprised. <br /> <br /> The movie as a whole was just fun. It never explained how the octopus got so big, and it's not connected to the first anyway. But it was still fun. <br /> <br /> In the end, me and my girlfriend laughed. Once the octopus has been blown up, the two main characters start a bomb, and five explosions, most in stock, appear on the screen! We joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a "five rockets in a" toy! Believe me, it must be seen to be believed! All in all, stupid fun. It's worth giving a chance and buying when it's cheap.
