I've only seen most shows since I left the TV in my dorm on as background noise. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of Mencia, but this show really does not do me much. Occasionally he will say or do something to pull out a giggle, but he has that aura of complacency that totally ruins it, which is not very common in this TV series. Instead, he's just complacent. I think that only reflects how witty his comedy is: stale and uninteresting when he is not in the right way. I've seen him getting involved in his show sometimes, but for the most part, he just sits there smiling and confident, and it does not suit him well. <br /> <br /> Just my opinion.
