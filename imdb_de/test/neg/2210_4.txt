This movie is totally incarnated. However, I have already seen this film several times and intend to watch it several times, because despite its sheer dumbness it is very entertaining. And it has one of my favorite Hokey movie actors, Casper van Dien, who stands here in his full hokey movie splendor. Here Casper van Dien is completely Casper van Dien, and you must love him for it. If he had not been in this movie, it would have been a totally unsurpassed filth, or at least far more filthy than he already is. <br /> <br /> The (cough) "science" used here makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. No one else in the world noticed that a large asteroid approached the earth next to this small group? Not even with thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly searching the heavens for something like this. Such a big asteroid would have made anyone who has a pair of eyes completely confused. And part of the asteroid bounced off the atmosphere and no one noticed? Such a large stone that hits the atmosphere would have caused huge shockwaves, which would have damaged the planet's surface enormously. Surely somebody would have noticed something like that. Bwahahaha! The "science" used in this film is so ridiculous that it somehow works to make this movie as entertaining as it is. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was that despite the extreme heat of all the characters, they were not soaked in sweat and their clothes were completely soaked. At most, the characters looked as if they had been occasionally splashed by someone outside the camera with a water bottle to create a "shine shine". Authenticity was * not * a goal this film was eagerly and constantly striving for. Which gives the film its entertainment magic in a strange and funny way. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth it? Certainly! Provided, of course, you have absolutely * no * expectations of something that even approaches from a distance of reality. And it is your desire to indulge and enjoy total hokeyness right now.
