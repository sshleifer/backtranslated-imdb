The Messengers directors Danny Pang and Oxide Pang are responsible for The Eye and its sequel and their American premiere games, The Grudge Lite, in a farmhouse. A family of four moves from Chicago to a Down Sunflower Farm in rural North Dakota. Almost immediately her teenage daughter Jess begins to see ghosts. Of course, her parents and the police are skeptical. Granted, the movie is well done and there are two or three effective scares, but too much relies on 'boo' effect. Still the plot is a copy of many ghost stories and the ending is anti-climatic and staggeringly awful. The titles are also rather weak and tend to CGI movie, which just does not deliver 4 out of 10.
