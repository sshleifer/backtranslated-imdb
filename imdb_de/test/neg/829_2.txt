When I saw this movie, we do not say that I had high expectations. But I had only the faint hope that this feature in full length at least some of the merriment and wit of TVs "Da Ali G Show" would have a half-hour TV show to a 90-minute film. The film had no attraction to the toilet and the youthful sexual humor. Basically, I should have got rid of it halfway, but was stupid enough to think that in the end it could somehow get better, how wrong I was. I loved the show but hated the movie. This film is only for those who find fellatio of canines amusing ...
