This movie was really bad. At first, they did not even follow the facts. Half of the film was invented and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of the victims of Ed Gein. The acting was awful except for the guy who played Ed Gein, but it's not hard to play a weird guy. Although I find it terrible, I gave him three because they started out with real criminal photos. that was the best part of the movie. As soon as the introduction of the film was completed, it went downhill. The author of this movie tried to spice it up, but it did not have to be that way. The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough, without falsifying information.
