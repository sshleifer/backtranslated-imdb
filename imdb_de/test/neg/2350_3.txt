Let me first clarify. This movie is a real piece of garbage, but although it's a real piece of garbage, it's a better piece of garbage than it could have been. It could have been a great suck, but it's not ... <br /> <br /> What this movie did not have was, for example, scary moments, good acting and a good script. It was not very entertaining either. But the movie had cool music, fancy locations and hot girls. It also works great as a Dracula parody. (I hope it was meant that way, though I really do not believe it.) <br /> <br /> The story focuses on three girls in Transylvania who wake up an ancient vampire, who then gradually terrorizes the girls kill. Looks familiar? Yes it does! <br /> <br /> After reading this, you may think I should have put it to a better vote. The reason why I do not do it is because I almost fell asleep in some places ...
