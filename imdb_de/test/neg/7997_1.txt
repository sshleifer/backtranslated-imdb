This is one of those movies that are so bad that they are awesome !!! It has everything that a film of the early eighties needs: flared pants, big mustaches, chicks with Farrah Hair and especially NINJAS !!!! I have some crucial moments that I need to revoke for you. Cole's army buddy has a strange, monkey-like face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw. In every other scene, the asses who want his land give him his ass so he gets drunk through the entire movie. Eventually, his farmworkers eventually return after being run over by the gangster guy's employees. Frank, I think his name is Frank, he's so moved that he's the whole group "Lets Have A Cock Fight !!" screams. and they all happily move into the cockfighting area of ​​the farm to start the celebrations. That's funny at every level. Whether you take it dirty or literally warms my heart. Another funny thing is Sho Kosugi's little grunt and animated Ninja-style moves. I remember this guy from my childhood, and he always said he was the only real ninja in the world (he had ads in martial arts magazines), if I remember rightly. My friends and I were a bit crazy about Ninja when this movie came out, and I can remember that I often saw him at the local theater. I wondered, when I saw it last night on Starz, why every sloppy American gangster type always has a fortress in the Philippines and wears a white Steve Martin suit. In fact, this guy goes far beyond it by forcing all his thugs to wear white Steve Martin suits. There's a scene that looks like 20 Steve Martin imitators are attacking a 1970s Sears underwear model (Cole). As we set out for the final battle, Cole very awkwardly breaks into the Evil Headquarters and is immediately spotted by a secretary who in turn alerts a guard who fires a round with his pump-action shotgun and no villains from the bad guys and nobody seems to notice or interest. Cole, who wears a completely white ninja outfit, creeps up a flight of stairs and then goes straight to the area where all the bad guys are. The second person in charge tells him that he did not have to kill everyone when they were expecting him, and takes him to the giant cock fighting arena of the bad guys. Do not ask me why Cock Fighting is a big part of this movie, but it is. When they arrive, Cole still wears his ninja mask, although everyone involved knows what he looks like without them. The last fight is upon us when Cole killed everyone and now, as I like to call him, Sho reveals Cole's wife alias Frank's wife and they meet in the most horrible cockfighting arena you've ever seen. Sho then, very politely I would like to add, lets go of the lady and the fight begins. They bend and begin to circle, both masked by the way. When they join the fight, it seems like Cole is somebody else who is sometimes "Finishing The Game" - a funny parody of Bruce Lee's "Game of Death". Cole finally comes to the fore, Kills Sho, who dies with honor by being beheaded and being all right. Next, we see Cole, after ruining everyone's life to split the city again, but not before he anticipates the brutal death of a fat guy with a hooked hand and then inexplicably winks at the camera, capturing the image, freezes a picture, ready.
