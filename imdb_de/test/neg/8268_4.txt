You just have to consider this as an inadequate anti-abortion propaganda and you'll see how bad it really is. The main message of this film is that even the sickest people can not commit abortion. If you ask, it's not far to blow up abortion clinics. This guy wants to kill a poorer girl, but he has to get her to do an abortion first. What a crap. And the worst part is that he has a convincing argument (bringing a child into a loveless environment), but that should be rejected because it's a freak anyway. And the part with the Bible shifters ... First they throw this girl out just because she explains that someone has stolen her money (this rule has to be somewhere in the Bible) and then in the end some kind of angel like Deus ex machina is the one Killer of evil by molesting him on his front yard. Come on. Other disadvantages are a very confusing scenario (and I do not mean that in a good way) ... so this guy is just a psycho why? Because his mother once fed liver? And I do not know what the rest of you are, but he seemed to be the nicest person in the world throughout the turn! Although he wore girls' clothes, stole money and tied girls in his car. If you forget the idiot story, this movie has a really great cinematography and Bob Hoskins was really great, and he has one of those funny little English cars. If it was really a psycho killer, I would give him at least a 7.
