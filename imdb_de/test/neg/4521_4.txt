It's the thrill of a low-budget Noir movie. And there's the frustration of meandering, uninteresting, cheap movies. This category falls into the second category. <br /> <br /> The Spot is the name of a nightclub. The film is about a policeman whose father was killed by gangsters. He sets off to track her down. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the bad expression. Maybe it's me. But I had the feeling that I had seen that a hundred times, usually better than here. <br /> <br /> It also promised: The policewoman is fascinated by a woman playing records she introduces through Juke Boxing then meet. Although this was done long before my birth, I have seen this kind of jukeboxes. And it's incredibly fascinating: When I was a teenager, I went to a bar that had such a device. I always liked juke boxes, in bars or restaurants. But this was different. You talked to him and a hot-sounding woman's voice spoke back to you! This is addressed here, but fallen into the general, uninteresting stew. <br /> <br /> The film has one thing to offer: In a small role, it shows the very young Anne Jeffreys. What a beauty she was and undoubtedly still!
