This film is a perfect example of picking up a fascinating subject, taking up 25 minutes of content and expanding it into a six-hour Borefest that resembles a documentary if the Fox News chose a movie. Even the participants in this disgustingly arrogant film can not hide their laughter at the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few great times in world history where men take a stand and work to create a better world. If the creators talked to Ken Burns for just 5 minutes, they might have found something intelligent instead of this remedy for insomnia.
