Jack Lemmon was one of the best actors ever to be on the screen. He could easily switch from dramatic roles to comedies and make most of his contemporaries pale with envy. While his performance in "Save The Tiger" is Oscar-worthy, I feel he has been given it because he missed his other opportunities to win the award from other, better roles that preceded that current one. > <br /> This is also one of those presumptuous films that basically show the talent of the cast or, in this case, a particular member. It's too bad the screenwriter's output does not match Lemmon's. Do not waste your time with this.
