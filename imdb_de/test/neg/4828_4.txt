I watched this movie about thirty years ago and I still remember it today. When I found it on DVD, I did not hesitate too long, even more because I have a fondness for early Belmondo films. What a bad surprise! Some films should leak out, retain some memory, and not shock the audience. Widely used as one of the rare cynical works of Chabrol, the only lasting impression I have of it is boredom. Some movies do not really age in style. But what about movies that had no sense of style at all? <br /> <br /> The mistakes in the script, uninspired drama - probably due to lack of direction - a kind of production design that does not work It does not deserve its name, less than mediocre photography and last but not least the worst editing job I've done in ages have seen. This makes it really hard to endure was a group of people with too much money and equipment, but obviously no idea or any skills. It's really a surprise that Chabrol's career did not stop abruptly. Do not blame it for the bad taste of the 70s, this is a crap and a worthy contender for the most useless celluloid waste ever.
