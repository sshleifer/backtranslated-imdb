This movie is a bad movie. But after watching an infinite series of horror movies, I can say that it's a bit different than many I've seen. Not in the plot, which is a pretty regular Slasher story, but rather the way the scenes are cut. Murder Weapon gives us many inhuman dialogue scenes, but they take much longer than most films of this kind. That's why some of the victims seem a bit less like cardboard cutouts. Just a bit. It was hard for me to find out exactly what happened in the beginning, and wondered again and again whether certain events were dream sequences. My favorite scene is when two guys are on the run from the killer and seek refuge in a car. In the glove compartment you will find a handgun. "Thank you God!" one of them calls happy. The guy's head suddenly looks like a mannequin's head, and it took me so long to ask myself, "What's that? BOOM!" The head explodes and I find out it should be one of those guys in the car who shot his head with a shotgun, I love this scene, but the movie is a very bad movie.
