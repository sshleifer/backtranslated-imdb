An airplane carrying some scientists and a prototype DNA machine, a powerful and revolutionary invention, fall into a jungle in the Pacific. The insurance company sponsors a rescue expedition under the command of Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), the owner of a large corporation that owns the prototype and father of a scientist. There the group finds the remnants of the plane five miles away from the expected location and the machine and the remains of the persons. They also recognize that a sasquatch, a kind of big foot, is hunting them. This movie is so ridiculous that I do not know what I am doing and spend my time in this garbage again. The direction is awful, the actors and the lines are awful, copying parts of "The Predator" and even "The Blair Witch Project". To sum up how bad this movie is, his best scene is when Marla Lawson, the character of Andrea Roth, is wounded and the expedition leader says that she needs to get a tetanus shot. Andrea takes off her jeans, and the guide says, "Nice butt, but the shot must be in your arm." Ridiculous! My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Sasquatch, O Abomin√°vel '(` Sasquatch, The Abominable') <br /> <br />
