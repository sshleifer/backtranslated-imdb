First, the current description of the IMDb act seems misleading. The film is about a group of girls who take a misogynist tramp hook that tries to kill them all. They stop in a small motel where he holds them hostage, but they develop a strong attraction for one of the girls. Violence follows. <br /> <br /> I picked this up accidentally because I thought it was the other 2007 movie "The Hitcher". Not that The Hitcher would be better, and I was looking for a crappy movie anyway, but that was almost unbearable at times. I think I could have put myself on a piece of paper and could have come up with a better plot. <br /> <br /> I can not count how many movies I've seen with virtually the same story, so this was sometimes painfully predictable, but what really made it terrible were a few scenes that ... let go Let me give you an example. At one point, a door is covered with (which is very obvious) blood, and two police officers, who are on site for a 911 call, look at them from a distance of 30 meters. You also see a bloodied man agree that it looks suspicious, but do not decide to go further. <br /> <br /> But as ridiculous as it may be, the movie was never boring, produced well, was directed and played good special effects, unnecessary nudity and violence. I probably would not recommend actually sitting 90 minutes of your life sitting to watch this movie, but it turned out to be perfect while I cleaned my basement. Highly recommended for fans of nasty movies, and it would be a good movie you can see with friends if you want to talk more than see.
