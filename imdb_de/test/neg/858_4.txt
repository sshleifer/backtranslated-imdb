"The Duke" is a film from the heart of the British aristocracy, in which an old duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid that his great possessions and the huge riches after the death of two crafty aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie) Hey man); he hands his dukeship to his dog. The "best friend" of the dog, an American called Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper), whose parents are dying, is orphaned by the former Duke because he is her great-uncle. A young chef named Florian arrives, and Charlotte and Charlotte instantly connect to a romantic subplot that serves as the keynote of the main storyline, Hubert's The Duke's activities and his many activities and love interests with other dogs , All this is watched over by James Doohan, who plays a butler determined to serve his old Duke, doing his best to serve his new Mr. Hubert. Doohan functions there as the older character to comfort and counsel the younger ones while performing various ridiculous tasks under his new master. A fine comedic performance mixed with elements of the drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor. <br /> <br /> Although I do not like the movie from a technical point of view, I did not like watching this movie because I was watching the discovery of James Doohan's role. Although the plot is good, elements of writing and governing must be obscured. I ignore the absurdity of a "Doggie Duke" and personally refuse the excessive use of comedic jokes about the "bad" characters because of their ridiculousness. The dependence on humor in terms of hygiene is far too obvious and I do not like the general stupidity of many characters. The director, Phillip Spink, too often uses medium-length beats with either too heavily muted voice or affects the overall sound quality. Plus, the acting of Muirhead and Heyman, despite mastering the dramatic and romantic sequences, falls drastically and meets the wholesale requirements for the role. <br /> <br /> But as a mature movie fan I find it easy Be critical of a simple family movie that makes you laugh. I can admit that I found certain parts amusing and other parts that touch together with an action that is far-fetched but has certain connections. I do not recommend this movie for mature movie fans, but I especially recommend it to dog lovers, families who want to enjoy a fun movie for their kid, and James Doohan fans who want to see Scotty in his last role.
