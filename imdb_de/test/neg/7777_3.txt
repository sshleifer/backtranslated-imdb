There is no way to put into words how bad, how informal, peaceful and laughing these "Vice Academy" films really are. You have to experience one for yourself. For the third time in a row author-director Rick Sloane does not even show much writing or directing talent. There is nothing that a person older than 5 years thinks or laughs at, but the (very short) nudity and other "plot elements" make the movies unsuitable for children. This makes me believe that they are really aimed at adults who have the mental faculties of five-year-olds. Elizabeth Kaitan is a more than welcome replacement for Linnea Quigley - she's excitingly bubbly and sweet and her wonderful wide smile is the only thing that can make a spectator smile. But watching her and the other girls in this movie is like watching a bunch of flowers in a horse dung covered desert. (*)
