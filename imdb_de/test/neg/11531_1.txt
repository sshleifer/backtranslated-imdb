I had a good time for the first 45 minutes. or so, but suddenly everything was downhill. The tension got a bit thin and the jokes were the same everywhere. What kept them going was the good actors. <br /> <br /> But the problem with this movie is that it's trying to be funny, like Tarantino and God is the outdated stuff. Since Tarantino is sometimes overrated, this movie is ten years too late. It's best for teenagers, and I'm sure many of them find the figure of Johann funny for the first 30 minutes. The other problem I have with it is that the story fades towards the end more and more. I tried to find a restore point. Maybe it did not recover, because the lack of passion goes hand in hand with the effort to be clever. As in many films, good actors who can afford not to demand a better dialogue or simply reject the script.
