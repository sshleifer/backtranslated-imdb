"Hood Rat" is absolutely terrible. This is an urban version of "Willard". I just can not believe that this movie was made, let alone distributed. Someone at Universal Studios said people would like to see and like this "movie." The only good thing is Ice-T as landlord. He was funny. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hate in movies is faster action. Once or twice is bad enough, but the WHOLE movie is like that. Each scene transition is a special effect in fast motion. The director should be banned from making films forever. <br /> <br /> Trust me, never see this movie!
