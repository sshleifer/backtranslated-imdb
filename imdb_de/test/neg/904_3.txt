A 10-year-old boy who has had enough of his parents decides to wire a car and make a surreal journey across America to find Motorama maps. This is a gas station card game has a chance to win $ 500 million. Along the way he meets many bizarre characters. Nobody can create an "instant cult classic," Joe Minion's earlier "After Hours" achieved this through pure merit and an amazing director, but it was not a moment immediately. This movie, on the other hand, is just bizarre, just to be bizarre. No rhyme or reason for any of it. The plot is at best random and only seems to exist to present different cameos. It's just not a funny or thoughtful movie. It's too much together. I have heard many comparisons between these and David Lynch films. That's a damned heresy, because even Lynch's "worst" movie (worst in quotes because he really does not have any bad movies) is still miles above the dirt. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Cynthia King is very short topless <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Trailer for "Joe Dirt"
