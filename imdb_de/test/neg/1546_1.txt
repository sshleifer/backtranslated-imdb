I have already commented on this movie (under the name TheLegendaryWD). But I see, there are others who have since commented. I can only say WHAT IS THE F ** K? "I can not believe that 16 people commented on this movie or actually saw it, and there are also some great reviews (probably the filmmakers who were in one of the places in a mall, the internet services and write a good review - since they could not or would not pay their own internet provider ... just watch their movie. Although I have to admit that I have a thing for this film, I thought that some other people who write about this movie might confuse it with another ... until I read the reviews ... especially the person who identified the movie's headline on the front of the box: "The Ultimate in Frontal Lobotomy "(What's that supposed to mean?" Frontal "lobotomy?) ... I totally forgot that until I get it in the critics, folks, we're a select few ... I say we'll meet once in a while Year to watch this movie. Wait, does anyone have anything left? If anyone has it, please contact me ... I prefer drunk.
