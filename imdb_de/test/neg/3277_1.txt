Although I agree that this is the most terrifying film ever made, I'm proud to have a copy just because I and a few of my friends were special (mostly in the Dance Club scenes, but also I've had potential with Bolo and the director of Enter the Dragon, but as someone who was the most on the set every day, I can tell you that Robert Clouse was an old and confused person, at least during filming I'm surprised he could find his way to the set every day, and I'd like to think that this would have been a better movie, if not much of it had been destroyed in a fire at the Morning Calm studios. That was I'm sure, but it would be nice to think: I was really surprised that it was ever released and that someone like Bolo hung his name without a fight. Well, look at the extras for pro wrestlers Scott Levy, Alias ​​Raven, was a wrestler in Portland at the time ... nice guy, very smart.
