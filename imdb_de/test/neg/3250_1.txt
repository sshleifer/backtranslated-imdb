This movie beats everything out there. Well, it depends on what you are looking for ... it can be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. This movie is in a league of its own. I do not think a movie could come close. I am not sure what the director wanted to do as a thriller or as a comedy. If he thought he was making a thriller, by a stroke of luck he created one of the best Bollywood comedies of all time. You have to see it to believe it ... a Matrix + Terminator + a host of other films in a movie, along with a story that goes back to Hindi movies from the 80s, with an icchadhari naag ( a mythical snake that can turn into a human). <br /> <br /> It's an ideal movie when you're sitting next to alcohol with some friends and planning to laugh at the movie! I'm not sure if I should give a 1 or a 10. Due to the knocking over of a coin, I decided to give a 1!
