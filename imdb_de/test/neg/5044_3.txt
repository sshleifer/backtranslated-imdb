Gargoyle starts late one night in 'Romania 1532', when a peasant girl (Daniela Nane) travels in her horse-drawn car and looks after her own business as she falls from the moonlight clouds over a living gargoyle and attacks her, and she escapes the gargoyle & happens at a castle of some description, where a furious mob of villagers and a priest can put an end to the Gargoyle, or so they think ... Today is Bucharest, where two CIA agents Ty Griffin (Michael Pare) & Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are currently negotiating the safe return of the son of a wealthy American ambassador from his kidnappers. In the search for one of the kidnappers Griffin loses him on the roof of a building, but finds a large pool of blood and no visible signs of what has happened to him. Meanwhile renovate Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) a church when church worker Gregor (Mihai Bisericanu) informs Richard that he has found an old relic. The two examine and find a cave with lots of slimy cocoons and a very angry and very living gargoyle, who wastes no time in killing them both. Griffin & Wells deal with the case that they are reported missing and soon realize that local legends of monstrous gargoyles are true with a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown), who intends to flood the world with them. .. <br /> <br Written by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoyles, co-produced and directed, another masterpiece that Wynorski can add to his credits is not. Wynorski's screenplay, Ion Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence & Bill Munroe, is crap, boring and as simple as you can get. First of all, I'd like to know if there was only one more Gargoyle who put all those eggs, because I'm pretty sure he could not get pregnant. How has it survived 500 years in this hole? What did it eat? How did the priest know it was there? Why did nobody else find out? Why did the priest want to flood the world with them? To govern it? The gargoyles are unlikely to conquer the world, and then make a priest rule like a king, and if they would do anything to rule? Similar to the guys who wrote Gargoyle, I do not think he was thinking about it, right? No matter how I look at it, no matter how I look at it, no matter how many times I try to square it out, Gargoyles just does not make sense and their story has huge storylines, falls into logic and is not great anyway. The characters are boring and clichÃ©d, the action repeats itself and is not exciting, while the movie as a whole is a real boredom. People do illogical things and everything that happens is far too comfortable, as if the priest tries to persuade Griffin that gargoyles exist and you suddenly turn up and attack them. The cave full of cocoons is a rip-off of aliens (1986), it's embarrassing and the end was lame. That little bit on the big ferris wheel at the show was funny when the guy mocked the boys' fear of heights and forced him to step on it. Director Wynorski saves costs and steals footage from other films The best scene from Gargoyle is a chase through Bucharest, but from the Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie Maximum Risk (1996). There is no vibration, fear or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible, the CGI Gargoyle seems to be part of a computer game and has little interaction with live performers. There are many scenes where people look up at the sky and see scars. It is not even worthwhile to see the thing worth seeing, there is a terrible beheading and that is it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the special effects are terrible, but otherwise they are passable, the Romanian places look appropriately Romanian. Gargoyle went straight to the video and it shows up with a pretty cheap look and feel. Acting is not much, the victim of bypassing the personality makes Michael Pare the most boring hero. Gargoyle is a crap movie that fails at everything a decent creature function should strive for. A total waste of 90 minutes for me to avoid one.
