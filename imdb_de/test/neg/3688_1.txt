This may not be the worst movie ever shot, but it's absolutely the most boring. I wonder why it's mostly filmed in the dark and Vincent Gallo walks away from the camera or looks down. Because he does not want to show his face because he has actually agreed to be in this movie. I liked his early stuff, but the presumption of "Brown Bunny" and the fact that he was thrown in that jerklet hooked him in my book. And Val Kilmer? I really want to send him a sympathy card. The "doors" to this ??? Actually, casting was the only reason I saw this movie, and Val does not appear until the movie is over halfway through. Just a sad movie.
