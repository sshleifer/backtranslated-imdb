This film was praised to ridicule. "American Movie" is a boring documentary about a boring person so commonplace that you can find equivalents in almost every corner of America. It takes a long, hard look at a guy who basically failed to make an independent movie ... or two. If his failings were other than his selfish persecutions or were they in the name of real art, the film might have had a chance. America has a wealth of better stories to tell. This should be flushed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed. Two thumbs up!
