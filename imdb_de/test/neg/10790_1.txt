This movie, although well-filmed and played excellently, was awful. I felt like I was watching a car accident - sure I kept watching, but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely incoherent and the end was miserable. Although it matched the sound of the movie, I was hoping for something to improve this movie. I still do not understand what the hints of rabies and the child get at the beginning of the film from the fox. A fifteen-minute plot really did not do much. It's really sad to see a movie with good actors and a beautiful set that's wasted on such a horrible, terrible story. There is not much to say about this film. Save time and watch c-span. It will be more uplifting.
