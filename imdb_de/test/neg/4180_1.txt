This is one of the moments when you come across a movie with a clean cover, my first impression: sweet full moon, crows, a scarecrow holding a scythe. OK my impression (I had seen scarecrow on TV a few weeks ago) perfect, a nice Slasher movie, with which you can start the evening. ................... wrong, completely wrong I think 5 minutes in I would throw it out but I thought I was wasting $ 3 for that to finish while the scarecrow I think it's the legs of the fisherman wearing heavy rain boots. You see that again and again. I've been watching this thinking ... OK, when those brats get to meet this guy, I thought at some point, they'd died. but no ... I mean, they are still alive. I laughed only a few parts because they were so badly staged. For one, zooming was at the beginning. The director / actor / writer says, "Remember, I had that feeling, now I have it again," and it was either a zoom in or zoom out, to hell I look back. But I think the scene was supposed to be shocking. I mean, what's more shocking is that his wife had the same shocked look ... OK ... she believed him ??? I'm sorry, but YES ... I did not know he was psychic until I read the movie box to make sense of what I was experiencing. not only that, they used images to give the impression that this movie is at least clear. <br /> <br /> The other thing that made me laugh a bit was screaming at the camera to make it weird ....... OK ........ ..... I'm filming a girl who screams at the camera for 5 minutes ....... Right ..... I laughed because it was so pathetic that these kids are not like the other people in the house Be able to behave like a movie. <br /> To crown the scythe something must have been lost or something ... because the villain had only one stick. not even an ax, someone should throw the dam production film <br /> <br /> Do not fall on the picture, this movie is a piece of Sh * t. I saw the trailer and guessed what it has, GIRL, WHERE YOU TALK TO ME AND CORN
