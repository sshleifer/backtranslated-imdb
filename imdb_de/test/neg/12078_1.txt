The 80s were the best times and the worst times for James Karin. He starred in one of the best cult horror comedies with "Return of the Living Dead" and a year later he plays in this play of ... this bad movie. A sequel to Hardbodies (but not really) is a group of rather unlikely characters trying to make a movie in Greece. By design or sheer laziness, the line between the film and the "film within a movie" is not only blurred, but not present from scene to scene (which would be confusing if I was only interested in something that was in the movie in the movie In the first place: Unfunny would be too generous a term. <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Nana, Fabiana Udenio and many extras are topless, Brenda Bakke shows some T & A <br /> <br /> my grade : F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Only trailers for "Hardbodies", "American High School", "Strike", "Virgin Territory" (will be delivered in a double-filmed DVD with the first masochistic film )
