I live in Edinburgh and have a big thirst for history. I was very deterred by the "Libertys". False dog breed for a start !! Bobby's owner Old Jock was an old, single man who came to Edinburgh and died in shelters, not like in the movie. For anyone coming to Edinburgh and hoping to see the movie's sights, the cemetery at Princes St Gardens will not be there !! There were a few moments when a handkerchief was great. The actors were fantastic at filling up a pretty threadbare script. I do not think poor little Bobby actually had enough screen time, possibly because he was once "lost". All in all, the movie was fine and every 8 year old will enjoy it.
