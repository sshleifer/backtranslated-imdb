Wow, what a cheesy movie that is! It looks like it's a backwoodsman. The camera follows the dogs running through the forest. Then it gets a bit boring and follows the story of some girls who move into a house ravaged by Indian ghosts. We then get many shots of a partially dressed girl and another naked girl in the bath. It suddenly gets pretty cheesy when the "Zombie Indians" get up from the ground and terrorize the girls. We even get a Samurai Indian. <br /> <br /> This film starts quite boring, though I found the story of the four Indians who buried themselves very interesting. Once the Indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them because they're not technically zombies) begin to terrorize the girls, all the fun begins. This is not a special streak and can not be taken seriously. It's just funny when you get bored or when you're drinking with friends. I can not help but think that it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is boring.
