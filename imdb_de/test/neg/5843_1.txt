This was one of the biggest bitches I have ever seen. I mean, seriously. How would anyone else feel if they were in Woody Harrelson's shoes and your wife even worried that sleeping with the other man for a million dollars would be a good idea? Finally she talked about it in bed and said how good it was for her, since he could use this money to build his house. Woody never quite agreed until she persuaded him to do so. How can you trust her? Who the hell would that even consider if they were married? I do not care how desperate they were. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. Then he hits her. Apparently, he had no right to distrust her, except for the fact that his wife had just slept with another guy who is very rich and pretty. Oh and wait, then he should apologize to her after she has filed the divorce so she can be with the man she slept with. Of course Woody has no right to say or mistrust her, especially after she has Roy Hobbs card in her wallet. Then, at the end of the movie, she's so obviously in love with Woody and misses him so much that she would not leave Hobbs until he invented a ridiculously silly story to tell her to leave, and she beeps thank you Hobbs ???? Are you kidding me? Was she under contract as a sex slave or something? I mean something to beep? Oh and wait, it gets better. She pokes him passionately before she gets out of the car. Yes, she is not a whore. Oh, thank you for letting me go, let me talk to you one last time. Smooch Smooch, Smooch, although I'm still married to a man I left because of a rich man. I have never seen such a crap in my life. How the hell should we feel good after this terrible end? What should this film be? Nothing came from this! This was the most meaningless movie I have ever seen in my life. Two pathetic desperate people. If I were Woody, I would tell her to drown herself in the waters they were in. Apparently he had no self-esteem. What the hell was Roy Hobbs doing that awful roll? I feel like puking after watching. This movie was so bad that it was seriously ridiculous. I want to have those two hours of my life back, which I wasted on this piece of pig.
