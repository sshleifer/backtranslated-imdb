How could a movie about illegal Mexican immigrants robbed and beaten across the border be boring? Well, "Border Incident" is. No wonder the career of song and dance man George Murphy ended not long after this horrible movie came out. Politics was certainly a way out for this future Senator, who dies a terrible death in this slow-moving film. The film stereotypes the typical Mexican migrant farmers as weak and boring. <br /> <br /> The film only becomes more intense when the identity of Murphy and Ricardo Montalban was discovered as federal agent for the US or Mexico. <br /> <br /> Disappointing, we see similar in our society today problems.
