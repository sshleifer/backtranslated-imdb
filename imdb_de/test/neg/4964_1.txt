Looking at these reviews and seeing all of these high ratings, I believe that large amounts of red corn syrup will please almost every brain-dead idiot. This movie is superfluous. All clich√©s of a Slasher movie without substance. I'm sure I could go over the details of the movie, but why bother to sum it up? Obviously everybody wants Mandy Lane and she obviously does not want any of the boys. Throughout the movie, you will see the following. <br /> <br /> When she ceases to be friends with the typical boy trapped in the boyfriend loser, he goes ballistic, and if she takes a trip to the center of No where, of course, he starts, to hunt them individually. Sounds decent right? But what impressed this movie is the fact that you find out that not only is your loser the killer, but she too. The plan was absolutely ridiculous. Let's kill all our friends and then kill each other. They do not give a reason why they wanted that, and in the face of Mandy Lane's "Goody Too Shoes," they scratch their heads even more, which actually motivates these characters to do whatever they do. It's sad ... this movie had a lot of potential, but the director or author apparently can not relate to the audience.
