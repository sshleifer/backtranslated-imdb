I bought the DVD from a large container for $ 4.99. I thought I had a documentary gem that would actually show extensive footage of the Karakoram Mountains and especially the K2. I spun through the movie and reached the climax scene where climbers catch the first glimpse of Mount Waddington rising to 13,260 feet in the Canadian Coastal Range. At least one of the many Bozos who are set up for the ascent to K2 clearly has no idea what the mountain actually looks like - he must be assured by his friend and climbing partner that he would not have been brought to this ugly mountain by this partner. Given one of the film's premise that about 27 people have lost their lives on K2, you might think the fool in question took a few minutes to focus on a few basic facts, but the clown seems to be thinking about that Although they are good enough for Reinhold Messner, they are below him. To be honest, I have not seen everything. What I saw scares me. They say you get what you pay for. At $ 4.99, I was ripped off.
