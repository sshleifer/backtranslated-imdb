I borrowed the DVD as an alternative to reading the report in a video store. But it's pretty much more terror-tainment. <br /> <br /> While the film presents some information from the report in the drama, take the word of the producers - there is nowhere a reference to the commission report in the film. Not one. <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty bad all around - pretty much all stereotypes of 'hot shot' filthy, cursing government agents, each of whom thinks they know more than anyone else. It may be true, but it really does have a bad Hollywood stereotype smell. <br /> <br /> IMDb's reviews and comments from IMDb user communities tend to be more right than wrong, and I've started taking a look at ratings before hiring whenever I can. <br /> <br /> I wish I had in this regard.
