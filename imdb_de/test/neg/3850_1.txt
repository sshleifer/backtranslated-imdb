This movie is pathetic in every way. Bad drama, terrible script (was there one?), Terrible cut, lousy cinematography, cheap humor. Just terrible. <br /> <br /> I had seen "The Wishmaster" a few weeks before this movie and thought it would be a great alarm clock for the worst movie of the year. Then I saw 'The Pest' and suddenly 'The Wishmaster' did not look so bad. <br /> <br /> bath bath bath bath. Distressing bad.
