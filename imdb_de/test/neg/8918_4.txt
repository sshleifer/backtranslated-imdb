I just saw you die. It is bad, almost very bad. <br /> <br /> 1) The direction and the editing are terrible, just terrible. I almost had to turn off the movie. Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he's doing, he seems to film things randomly and some scenes make no sense at all. I also hate it when the same scene is reused in the same movie. In this movie, some scenes were used three or four times. Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> 2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes terrible. I like the fact that they wanted to make Seagal's character and Treach's character look like they were in a similar relationship to the characters in Lethal Weapon, but it did not work just because some of the dialogues did NO MIND and I did very English Well, it's not that I did not understand the words, it was the fact that the jokes and lines of dialogue had no meaning. <br /> <br /> 3) The script is pretty bad. Why do you always try to complicate DTV action movies? Seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities, why? Is it useful for the movie? NO. Seagal eliminates a whole bunch of people working for the guy who betrayed him, and he knows those people without ever seeing them in the movie. STUPID. The story sometimes goes awry and the jump jumps back for no reason. The story is sometimes messy and meaningless. They should have just kept it and it should have worked. <br /> <br /> 4) In some action scenes, it's not Seagal, it's his stunt double. You can tell it because they only film him from behind and never show his face. He also beats the guys with movie martial arts, not real ones like the aikido that Steven knows. The stunt double uses cheesy kicks and punches. <br /> <br /> 5) Steven is good at the movie. 90-95% of the lines are spoken with his real voice. The rest is dubbed, but not so bad. That was good. Steven also seems to enjoy the movie and is more into the action when he was in Submerged. He likes Treach as a partner; At least he does not seem to like him. He also seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent films. I hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body, but in the same clothes he wears on the DVD cover, he looks more than okay and he should have worn those clothes for most of the movie , not the stupid long leather coat. <I really believe that Seagal was ready to make a good movie. The fact that he was late and picked up early on the Set ON TWO MOVIES directed by Fauntleroy seems to me to be no coincidence. I think he realized that the crew were amateurs or just for a quick buck and he did not care anymore. <br /> <br /> In the hands of a better company and crew this could have been a damn good action movie for Seagal. Something like justice or above the law. I honestly believe that. But the people who did the film are not very good at their work or they did not have enough money to do the job properly. Pity, I liked Steven in the movie and Treach was cool too (Ice Cool), but the rest was bad. Hey, at least this gives hope to Black Dawn and Shadows of the past. I think that mercenaries are treated just as badly. But hey, Steven seemed to be in the same mood as he used to shoot his better movies, and that's reason enough to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but it could have been SO much better. 4.10
