I have never seen this movie alone, but like many others who have already commented, I have seen it as an episode of MST3K. Really terrible 70s beat. But someone has recognized his potential because he has just been turned into a $ 125 million flop called The Island. <br /> <br /> And to the person who asked if there are any good movies from the 70s, I want to remind them. It was a golden age for the American movie, in which directors like Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese first attracted attention. Not to mention little things like Star Wars (1977). Just a reminder that the 70s were far more creative than the 21st century.
