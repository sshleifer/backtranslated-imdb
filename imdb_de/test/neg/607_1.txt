I can not help being completely upset by this sitcom. It's as if they did not even bother to write good comedy. The worst part of all this is that everything is so damned uninteresting and deficient in every way. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, senior man Kevin James has a permanent "I'm so funny" smuggling on his face. It would be tolerable if he were just taken to the comedy department once What he does not do, he just lies there doing nothing like a big, listless baby. Which leads me to the relationship between the Heffernan - the most discreet and worst portrayal of a married couple on a television program. Really headaches that are offensive, Remini spends the entire show as if it were a violent task, even to be around her own husband. Jerry Stiller, who pulls the few laughs out on the show, reiterates his role as Frank Costanza in Seinfeld 100%, only this time his clues mostly point to the water, as the central duo can not recognize a joke even as it passes them , The episodes simply drift on a stream of nothing, their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse. <br /> <br /> This is not even a talent waste, there is no talent here, this is a laughing creative desert.
