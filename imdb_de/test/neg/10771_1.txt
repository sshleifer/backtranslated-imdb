Before I start ripping this movie, mark yourself - I love the Scarlet PimPernel. This story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The movie with Jane Gray is very good and the Broadway musical is the hottest thing there. So I thought, when I heard that this movie was coming out, that it would be great, since it is a BBC movie. To my surprise, it was a faint, totally stupid story that UTTERLY failed to record on The Beautiful Story. <br /> <br /> There were no exciting getaways with reckless disguises. There was no deep love that made your heart flutter as Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed as her husband left - blue sex and violence. <br /> <br /> sink me! What a horrible movie! <br /> <br />
