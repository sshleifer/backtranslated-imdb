This derivative erotic thriller is mostly seen, especially because a bystander happens to be curious about how it will turn out, and director Peter Hall stages a rather hot (and pretty brave) sex scene. The finale is unexpected but absurd, and the whole conspiracy (with childhood trauma and personality disorders) reveals itself as an unbearable clich√©, especially as far as motivation is concerned.
