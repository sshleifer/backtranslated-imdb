The presentation is very shabby. (in my imagination) how documentaries are often. Michael Moore's "Documentation" - Farenheit 911 is far more convincing, but has too much influence on the media and politics. I can not wait to see the docudrama "The Game of Their Lives" by Saturday. IFC goes to the right of the middle. I started a collection of IFC movies from the internet because of "TGOTL" *** from ********** to "Decade". Do you want to see good documentaries? Stay with the History Channel. Or try Docudrama. You can not go wrong with them, my friend. Can not go wrong. The seventies were ten years repeats. Or the old times would have to make you believe. Disco died and it's gone forever. When Elvis died, we all mourned
