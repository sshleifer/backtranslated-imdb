The stupid comedy throws Ray Milland, who seems embarrassing in World War II, as a British officer fleeing German captivity and taking on a man-hungry gypsy girl played by Marlene Dietrich. Slow, long and worn: The tracks are far too old for this type of baby food, though Marlene shines in her solo moments. Three screenwriters needed three books to adapt the book by Yolanda Foldes to the canvas, but this material must have been dated as far back as 1947 - it smells of something Ernst Lubitsch may have pointed out in 1939. The scenario is musty and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together. ** from ****
