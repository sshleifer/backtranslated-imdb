This fake documentation is flawed in many ways, it's done badly, it has uninteresting characters, but the biggest problem I have with it is the basic assumption. <br /> <br /> This film is based on the idea that H.P. Lovecraft has traveled to Italy and some of his works are based on real supernatural events he has witnessed. I'm ready to follow the view that he has traveled to Italy (just for suspension of disbelief), but that some of his work is based on reality and that Insmouth exists is total nonsense. <br /> <br /> First of all, Lovecraft did not believe in the supernatural. In his letters, he clearly said that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters there to show that people were not so special after all. Another myth used in this film is that Lovecraft was an expert on occultism. He was not. All his knowledge on this subject came from the simplest sources. <br /> <br /> So we have a movie about it People scream a lot and when we finally see the monster it is so bad that you can not even laugh about it, you just feel a pain in your love for Horror. <br /> <br /> After You've Seen This The movie Frankenstein Lovecraft said he regretted Mary Shelley because he felt their work had been slaughtered. I'm sorry for Lovecraft.
