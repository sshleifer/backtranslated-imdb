I think this movie was shot backwards, first they shoot a lot of scenes and action and explosions, and then the storytellers have tried to find a story that holds all the scenes together. This movie is without doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. Her average pornography has a much better written and much more coherent script. The movie does not make sense. Seriously, even if you're a Segal fan, there's no reason you really want to see this movie unless you're one of those people who like to stare at accidents, because this is a terrible accident and would never have been released have to be in this world. <br /> <br /> Boran.
