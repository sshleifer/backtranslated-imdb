I like sci-fi movies and even, low-rated, made for television, bargains, movies that I might find interesting. Well, I found this in a bargain box and brought it with a group of friends for a movie night as a selection. <br /> <br /> I was literally * discouraged * that I brought this movie with me. <Br /> <br /> The acting is bad from the beginning, the story is bland and the plot is almost non-existent. All this leads to what the movie really was: a graphic softcore porn movie. <br /> <br /> The film started with a woman in which the prisoners are all sexy women working in some sort of mine. First indication that this movie is NOT meant seriously: attractive women in a prison must do physical labor. Yes exactly! What ever. As soon as the "conspiracy" continued, she was overshadowed by meaningless scenes of people having sex. After half of the movie, my friends and I stopped watching, it was so stupid. The next day I thought I would give the movie another chance and watch the rest. I looked for about 15 minutes and then gave up. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent science fiction movie or even a sci-fi monster movie, do NOT watch Lethal Target! If you want to see a low budget softcore porn on the plot, read Lethal Target.
