It's fascinating how this title comes across as something new and groundbreaking to the average viewer (some comments). Murali K. Thalluri must have thought to himself: "Oh, great! Elephant ... What a fantastic movie! I'll try to do the same movie and see if anyone notices!" Sad enough, he failed even his awful idea. The film proves to be a complete failure. Considering that it's all about the brilliance of Gus Van Sant's "Elephant", it seems even more ridiculous - an embarrassing faux pas for a director. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the suicide of a student in the school's bathroom. This scene already shows the awkward acting skills of everyone involved in this scene. They do not buy a word, they say. In continues, interrupted by short, interview-like pieces of the children who "live off their marriage life," each piece somewhat disconcerting in its simple stupidity based on any worthless monologue. Thalluri means presenting the characters in this way to get a glimpse into their hearts as if they were considered junk food - and fail again. Not five minutes later, Thalluri finally yells at the audience, "Yeah guys, I stole this movie and for a strange reason, I'm proud of it!" by taking Gus Van Sant's most recognizable narrative style from "Elephant", he twice shot scenes so that the viewer can follow each character involved in a scene on its particular path and role in a school situation. Hm, does not that sound terribly familiar to you? For me, that certain amount of very forgiving tolerance had been hurt right there that I could not stand this horrible movie anymore. Shame on you, Murali K. Thalluri, I say! I am particularly surprised that "2:37" in Cannes has made the official selection since 2006, while surely everyone must have remembered "Elephant" (2003) at the same film festival a few years ago! How was this shameful rip-off shown there in the name of the Lord? I am completely confused by this mistake. <br /> <br /> Directors like Thalluri take advantage of the ignorance of the public, which does not (and can not) know every independent film out there. Since Elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema (though it is undoubtedly a masterpiece), few people notice that the story as told in "2:37" was previously told! I can not say how this is possible at a film festival as important as Cannes. It is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the true deception in them. <br /> 2:37 is definitely purely commercial, as an independent film and worthless (at a certain level) rather a false parody of the obvious idol "Elephant".
