Although she has a very pretty lead actress (Rosita Arenas, one of my boyish feelings), acting and directing are examples of what NOT to do when shooting a movie. The Aztec mummy (real Aztec, by the way, no mummies) was made by the The main characters are awakened and start making trouble in the suburbs of Mexico City during the first movie (The Aztec Mummy). In this second part, the leading man and woman want to find the mummy and put it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice ...) <br /> <br /> Then The Bat, a criminal mastermind, appears. mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a "human robot" (an idiot in a robot suit) to control Popoca and (conquering) the world. The last match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the worst choreographies ever seen. The funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a reputable Mexican movie studio! <br /> <br /> Acting is just as horrible when she hears the film in Spanish as in English (they call that over-acting!). ). You should watch this movie about MST: 3000. The comments are even funnier.
