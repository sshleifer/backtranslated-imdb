This was an attempt in the direction of a romantic comedy and one that did not work. Although the film was filmed in an interesting way, the gritty script revealed the best efforts of all. The Fey-mannerisms of the director may have been successful if he had taken a point of view. It was embarrassing to see William Baldwin and especially Armin Muller-Stahl.
