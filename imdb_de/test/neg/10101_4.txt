The first half of this film was promising, because it seemed like the movie would become an inconspicuous character psychodrama like THE MINUS MAN, but then the whole thing breaks into a clich√© and the viewer slowly loses all interest. There is a decent cast here, but the movie is lifeless and the talent is totally wasted.
