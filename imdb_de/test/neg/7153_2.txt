This is a road movie. At least the movie is in yellow and I think that suggests a road movie (?) Hin. I can not say much positive about The Delivery. It's bad acting, certainly her English. The camera looks like a kid is doing that, there's a bomb with a counter, and suddenly a bug falls from the sky. Since it was such a clich√©, we actually laughed the whole time - and that was the most fun. This movie should be released in America, but I'm not sure if you should go as it suggests the quality we produce. The explosions look boring. Basically, everything is over the top. Everything is just too much: the yellow quality, the sound, the baby, etc. Find all the stereotypes in other movies, put them together and you have The Delivery.
