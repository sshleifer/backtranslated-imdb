The most important word that comes to my mind when considering this film is "doubtful". This is a biopic of one of the most famous artists of all time. The Gloved One deserves better. <br /> <br /> Before I study the thoughts of these biopics, I have to say that there are two things that I have found to be effective. Initially, fan shots and interviews were actually used in certain parts of the film, especially in the scenes that depicted the first set of child abuse allegations. I have the feeling that this has contributed to a certain authenticity that was * hard * missing in the rest of the film. Second, the sequence was with the publicity of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I will not comment on whether I believe the marriage was a scam, but after many reports it was a relationship in which care and affection existed between the two parties involved. That really happened in this movie; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had enough chemistry to make it. These successful points are enough to keep Man in the Mirror from 1-star status. <br /> <br /> That is, there was hardly anything else here. Very few actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray, especially those who played Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson and Diana Ross. The absence of Jackson's music was a big loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without his music? I understand that they could not secure their rights because it was an unauthorized production on a low budget; However, it seems that if you can not have the man's music in a movie about him, you can wrap him up just as well and go home because you miss an extremely important part of his life story. <br /> <br /> Jackson's characterization of this movie also bothered me a bit. I do not want to say that he got into trouble and maybe had a few chips less value meals, but here he was portrayed as something almost mentally handicapped. I do not think Jackson, who is known to be a smart businessman, would have been pretty much as naive as the adult world works when he was seen in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally how this movie was written was nothing short of a shame. Many lines or dialogues were either extremely crazy, like the Tinkerbell exchange of Michael and Janet, or nonsensical, like Michael's comments "The blanket of love". In addition, the screenwriters have no idea about subtlety. There were a lot of telegraphs on upcoming events ("what could possibly go wrong?") And extremely obvious hammering of themes and motives in the movie (if I had heard the word "believe" again).). This eventually shook the movie as something that could be considered amazingly bad. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone, when we're a few years or even a decade or three from Jackson's death, will be able to get someone to bring his story to life in a more deserving movie. At this time, we may have a better perspective in his life, and someone will be able to give a truly thoughtful study of who Michael Jackson really was and what he meant for the world of entertainment. This very seedy biography was not the movie.
