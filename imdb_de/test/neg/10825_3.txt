The scariest thing about this horror movie is that the ending alludes to a sequel. 'The Cave' is really a disappointing action movie. A team of cave and underwater researchers travel to Romania (one of those cheap places to make a movie, at least now). After a ruined church, you enter a cave that turns out to be an underworld monster. Or are they demons? The film never decides whether it wants to be action, science fiction or horror, it's a mix of everything without salt and fun and works in a woody way. The best thing about the movie is the cinematography, but even the dark landscape of the cave soon becomes boring because the movie is not fast enough and the characters just are not interesting. Waste of time.
