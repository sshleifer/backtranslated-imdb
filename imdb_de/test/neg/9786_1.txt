Nine out of nine people who saw this were terrified of life as mentally. Nobody should ever have to see this abomination. The English language is poorly equipped to express how terribly cruel this "movie" is. It really is not worth the plastic. In the entire creation story, humanity has committed no major crime. There will never be anything worse. <br /> <br /> It was agreed that the scene involving Tommy's downsized head and the young girl's blouse was incredibly sick and twisted. In fact, many of us have not yet recovered from the ordeal and are currently sitting in a corner of the room rocking, sucking our thumbs and whimpering. <br /> <br /> But the basic question on everyone's lips has to be "why ???". How is it possible for someone to create such monstrosity and then subjugate them to so many innocent people? After watching the trailer, we thought this movie might be a laugh: how wrong we were. <br /> <br /> Please sign the petition to rid the world of "Shrunken Heads" so that no other poor civilians are affected. Please, for the benefit of humanity.
