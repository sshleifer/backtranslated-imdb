I saw that last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and the holy god was bad. From scripts to editing, acting to cinematography - nothing worked. Not to mention that the set design / costumes were so distracting for the period (it spans the years from the late 1970s to about 2006). Even John Hurt, who is usually an amazing actor, was so ridiculous. Granted, Quinten Crisp is an exaggerated guy at first, but Hurt got nothing to give here. I do not know much else to say except the audience that I absolutely loved. Maybe it's just me. But the audience loves everything at film festivals when it sits next to the director and all the actors. It's not a very accurate test of how good the movie is or how well it plays. Personally, I found this movie awful. On the other hand, it was so horrible it was weird. Get drunk and try it out when it's HBO in 2 years, if it ever happens.
