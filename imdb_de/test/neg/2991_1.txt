Do not get me wrong: I like arthouse movies, low budget movies, character studies and foreign films. Unfortunately I could not enjoy this pace - glacier step, complete lack of plot and characters that you can not hate enough to hate, but you can not tolerate enough to like. <br /> <br /> For me, Distant was like watching the footage of a reality show in the cutting room - all scenes that were considered too uninteresting and would not normally lead to the final cut were the only scenes. A camera in my apartment, where two of my friends walk around for hours, does not make an interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Distant definitely gives the viewer a feeling - long stretches without dialogue (spoken almost 10 minutes before the first word is credited) can be put to work (2001 comes to mind), but for me, something else must happen to attract me. <br /> <br /> If you're an observer who can sit through a movie and be satisfied with the movie analysis, maybe it will work for you. However, if you are looking for someone to watch movies to relax, expand your mind, or be entertained, you probably should look elsewhere.
