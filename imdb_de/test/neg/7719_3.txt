I can not get over how lazy the director is with this movie. Instead of creating scenes creatively, he relies on boring old zombie clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Where the two unarmed divers have to descend the college steps into the van, he surrounds them with zombies, but none of the derivatives are bitten. He can not bother to direct a decent fighting scene, so Let's see the leads slide down the stairs. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the zombies limp and in others they run like the wind. This is very convenient for the director, as he can set up whatever he wants without worrying about the continuity of zombie behavior. <br /> <br /> With careful planning and more inspiration, this movie could have been so much better.
