I think I saw the same movie as everyone else. This movie was awful. I'm a fan of all 3 series of the Gentleman League and have always respected the originality of the authors, even if the format has changed in Series 3. However, this film was a blatant half-effort, the plot was extremely bad with the characters. When you went into the real world, this movie looked more like the last action hero. There were about five moments in the movie that got a slight giggle, but the rest of the time I wished it would end. This would have been better than a 10 minute short film series on the DVD. It was more of an explanation for what they were about to do, and looked like some of the authors disapproved of the fate of the characters and joked that they would kill him in the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the League of Gentlemen and can stay fresh then hate this movie. If you only look at it, because there is nothing better on TV, then you will love it. <br /> <br /> someone is helping me !!
