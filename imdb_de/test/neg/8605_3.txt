I saw this movie with a kind of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog in the spotlight. There is no doubt that it (even if you enjoyed it) is a bad movie, but the important question is, why? It has a good cast; it is lively; It's ready to tackle sex directly, and some of the characters actually get something here and there that's unusual for a British comedy. There were also Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, Marmite performers agreed, but they have experienced their moments in the past. <br /> <br /> What she misses most is charm. The characters are incredibly idiotic, unbelievable and alienating, so instead of a movie by Men Behaving Badly, the producers made the producers Game On. Any mediocre writer who wanted to make a film about the sexual attitudes of dark, sexist British men would have gotten a couple of copies from Loaded, Zoo, or even Viz to read Sid the Sexist, and the thing would have been self-written. Instead, the producers clearly tried to invent some idiotic, hard-to-treat characters. Character comedy - unlike slapstick, etc. - only works when the audience can recognize the human truth. But looking at this movie, it's like listening to an annoying joke that you know will not make fun, but you can not stop it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is also done badly. The plot structure is weak, there is little character demarcation or development, and many scenes are not funny. Again and again the same lame Reggae breaks in to subdivide scenes meaningless and scratchy. There are many unnecessary repetitions - if you have a joke about parking outside of a sex party, you do not have to do it again. One wonders what the UK Film Council saw in the script. <br /> <br /> This is a world where most men are raking and most women are always ready. The Apartment and Alfie felt almost the same worldview, but the producers of this film accepted it without criticism. So you have received a kind of inferior update from Confessions of the Window Cleaner. Someone English has to try this thing again and do it right? a good next project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, I think ...
