I do not know exactly where to start. I just imagine a movie that's so bad in every way, from acting to props, to history that makes you angry. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that says a lot because I've seen some bad ones. When I saw this movie, I knew it was a blade, but I thought hey had kung fu and vampires, a combination that I thought could not fail. Until I put this in my DVD player. How Ron Hall messed up something as cool as vampires and martial arts is unclear to me. first the acting. I did not expect it to be an action movie and a B-movie at the beginning, but acting is so bad that I can not help being disturbed by it. Expressions and vocals were far from right, in almost the entire movie there was absolutely no emotion, and when the movie was so ridiculous, he thought I was watching Mad TV. An example of this is the screaming girly man Derek unleashes when he has to kill Master Kao, who should never be born. All in all, I have seen better plays in elementary school games. Then there is the action. not even compared to the things that have been done lately in action cinema. Still, the action was not totally disappointed because Ron Hall seems to have some martial arts skills. But even the skills he has are overshadowed by the stupid things he does, like the part of the movie he's in, and then the camera changes. I almost tore a pillow in half. And the fight scene in which his jailmate fights off vampires by swinging his arms after them. WOW.OR how about that part of the jail where Derek suddenly knows magic and prefigures chants that turn tap water into holy water. and as far as the props go. The rifles look like walmart toys, their teeth are stolen from Halloween costumes, and words can not describe how bad the CG graphics are. I could spend hours talking about all the things that are wrong with this movie, and trust me that this is just the tip of the iceberg. It's only a 2 because it made me laugh. Although I laughed at how bad the movie was filmed, a laugh is a laugh. I would say avoid the vampire assassin unless you want to laugh about a horrible movie or plan to be tortured and practiced for a long time
