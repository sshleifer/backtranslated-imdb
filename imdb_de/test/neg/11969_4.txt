"Scarecrow gone wild: he is the death of the party!" Do I have to say more? The wild scarecrow has received four out of ten stars for one simple reason: apart from the horrible acting, the holes in the holes, the cheap special effects, and the anti-climactic whistling, that was cinematic gold! I think this movie could have been really good if it turned out that the scarecrow was the baseball coach (as always brilliant Ken Shamrock shows). But then they would have had to reduce those great electricity special effects of "Return of the Jedi". <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, my friends and I were convinced that he was actually written by one of the writers of our friends, a stereotypical teenage boy. This movie has topless women, miserably fake gore, and dialogues that could not come out of a paper bag or, in this case, a cornfield. <br /> <br /> If I could ask the filmmaker something, that would be it; "How much did you have to pay the teenager who wrote this for you?"
