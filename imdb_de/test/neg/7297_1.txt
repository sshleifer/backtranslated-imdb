Are you looking for a film for your Turkey Film Festival? THE WOLLER BLADE SEVEN is on my list of the ten worst movies of all time. The plot, the story of a post-apocalyptic samurai warrior, is a tangled jumble of movie references from STAR WARS to THE SEVEN SAMAURI. The action varies from bland to abysmal. The scene in which the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to the mocking laughter. Frank Stalone's Black Knight is reminiscent of John Cleeses Black Knight's MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL. (Word of Advice, Frank: If you turn into a movie like this, your career is over.) I found this little stink bomb in a low-end cable channel and could not stop looking. It's like watching a train wreck, you just can not look away.
