This film worked with some of the most predictable storylines and flat characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook "How do I write a space disaster movie" and follow it from game to game. In particular, the stereotypical use of astronauts who talk to their relatives from outer space - and show a courageous show in the face of disaster - has been repeated over and over again. Max Q seems to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $ 50 million on the project. However, after the last half of the film, which contained numerous lame attempts with special effects, the producers could muster only $ 50,000. To find out that the film was nominated for a "Special Visual Effects", Emmy totally beat me. <br /> <br /> I think a handful of students with a pass in Media Studies would have produced more credible effects! <br /> <br /> And the action holes are too numerous to mention. But I will choose one as an example. Well, I'm not a NASA expert, but it's highly unlikely that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator will suddenly take a position of power in the control room when it's pear-shaped with the program. Surely, there is someone with more experience at Mission Control who the program director would call, not a twenty-nine-year-old who was not in the control room before. <br /> <br /> The only salvation for this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt to save something from the wreckage of the train that is this script. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 out of 10, with Bill Campbell playing a major role above average saving a lower mark.
