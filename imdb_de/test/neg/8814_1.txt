I'm a big horror movie fanatic, especially in the 1980s subgenres. To name one? I probably saw it. Last year, a new, little horror movie that seemed to be slipping under the mainstream radar "Saw" was due to hit theaters. I was moderately excited. After hearing nothing, I found it very promising after judging the previews and posters (except the back and the white ones with the severed hands and feet ... they just looked awful!). I saw the movie on the opening night. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. This film was literally mentally and psychologically painful to look at. Because it was scary? ... NO! Because it was one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. First, the script's design and editing was extremely cruel, even to horror film standards. Do you begin a sequence in an interview room with a victim (Shawnee Smith) who has recently survived a serial killer attack, and then a look back at what she survived? NOT SCARY! It was impossible to feel any kind of tension, even though you knew that the above victim was perfectly fine. Sure, this inverted bear trap was scary ... but WHY should I feel a little scared if CLEARLY just showed me she survived the ordeal? Unfortunately, the entire movie was constructed that way. It starts with two guys in the basement. Then they show flashbacks as they were kidnapped ... NOT AFRICAN! Why? Because we already know what will happen to them as we SAY ONLY the result of the attack. YOU ARE OK! Continue with the story! Unfortunately, the real story was sparse at best. I could not have been less interested in those annoying, pathetic apologies for "characters," and the actors did not help. For the most part, Cary Elwes was solid and then suddenly finished crying like a lost child as he struggled to keep his American accent in tact (it did not work.) The audience I saw it with was in stitches). This made him a premature and idiotic decision that even the simplest would not try. He had other options. Better SMARTER ONES. Despite his intense emotional state (terribly mediated by terrible spectacle), it was still irrational. I did not buy it. BAD FONT ALERT! Although certain sequences were played directly and without flashbacks, they were painfully predictable. I constantly found that my foot knocked impatiently, waiting for the stupid sequence to end. This happened throughout the movie. I saw every single "twist" come. After twenty minutes I had already called on the identity of the murderer, not to mention his connection to his "accomplices" as soon as they appeared on the screen. Better action might have overshadowed the terrible script. Instead, the actors could just as well have had "RED-HERRING" or "ACCOMPLICE" tattooed on their foreheads. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I was deeply outraged that I had wasted only a part of myself. Life in this film, and the entire theater laughed hysterically at the terrible finale. Seriously, you would think they saw a Monty Python movie. I would have laughed too if I had not been so upset that the movie absolutely and completely failed to achieve EVERYTHING he had set out to do. When we left, there was (no joke) a line to talk to the manager of the theater to get her money back (did not happen). I was absolutely sure that the movie would be a cash bomb. The following week, you could not imagine my shock when he found out that "Saw" had reached # 1 at the box office and EVERYONE talked about it (mostly people who called "Napoleon Dynamite" an epic tale for reflection and (" Satire "was a kind of gum.) I'm so sad that people praise this movie, that I often feel like I have to throw up, it's entertainment for the weakest and simplest people in humanity, those who are some weird Seeing jigsaw clown dolls on a tricycle threatening (it's a doll? Drop it over and go off.) What's so scary about that?). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I own every "Friday the 13th", love my splatter movies, thought, "Napoleon Dynamite" is funny, I can not get enough of Freddy, Michael, Pinhead or Leatherface, have an appreciation for unknown horror gems and "Sleepaway Camp "II: Unfortunate Campers" among my Top 10 Favorite Slashers. However, I realize that these films do not have to offer the most sophisticated American cinema. I appreciate them for what they are? fast, just fun. "Saw" is cinematic garbage. The film attempts to be a smart and semi-refined, nasty little thrill ride that becomes an irritating, annoying waste of time, money, energy and celluloid. Cruel on all accounts. Every single copy should be burnt together with his feeble-minded fans. Shame on you all. <br /> <br /> Will I see "Saw II"? Maybe after I shot Liquid Drano twice, before I hollow out my own eyes and spit incandescent Shish Kabob brooches into my ears and colon. My rating: 0/10. Avoid at all costs.
