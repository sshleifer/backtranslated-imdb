Okay, first of all, if you've seen the trailer, you know about 100% of the movie's "scary / jumping" moment. And yes, it's a good thing, because you just want to stay with the trailer and not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar did not live very long in this movie. I do not want to associate her name with this production. I wish her the best for "The Return". <br /> <br /> You have to follow three different stories in this movie, and they are all separated (by time and meaning) until the end. And even then it is a very bad climax. And God forbids even to open the door to another sequel. Yes, in this movie "The Rage and Fury" is on the move. You no longer need to visit the house, just close to someone who is inside and ready. It's not a curse anymore, it's kind of like a virus. Go indoors, be scared, return to the US and spread the joy in your apartment building. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to follow, but you are simply not interested in anyone. The storyline is not slim to any and you have many scenes in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head ... Milk someone? I saw Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia Movie Festival last summer, a different story, but much better than this guy. It's not a remake, but this time maybe they should have just done a remake. <br /> <br /> If you have to see it, wait for the DVD.
