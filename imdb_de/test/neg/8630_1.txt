Man, what a horrible movie. As with many terrible movies, the structure of the terrible lies in the script. This is such a pathetic attempt by a psychological thriller to give the entire genre a bad name. Okay, here's a big problem: Sandra Bullock's character is kidnapped by Jeff Bridges in his car in a busy convenience store in broad daylight. Somehow, her friend Kiefer Sutherland does not find a single witness for this deed and spends most of the film completely unaware of her whereabouts. Come on! Personally, I find that even for the smallest audience completely offensive. Nevertheless, we have to get used to this nonsense. Equally frustrating is the poorly explained motive for Jeff Bridges' actions. His character is a bit eccentric scientist, but far from the sociopath who would do those things. He goes through, gives or gives about ten minutes, and spills his beans on Sutherland, why he did his cruel deeds. The explanation itself, however, lacks the most elementary sense of logic. Therefore, no intelligent audience can really believe in the possibility of evil. And if you subtract that element from the story, the whole thing falls apart. <br /> <br /> Also of great importance: -Jeff Bridges uses a funny, pseudo-French accent without reason. <br /> <br /> - The entire boring subplot Nancy Travis was involved in, especially saving the day by turning the tables on Bridges. <br /> <br /> - The crazy woman who somehow manages to remember Jeff Bridges' license plate, although she also thought that the Lucky Charms leprechaun is real. <br /> <br /> - The name of Sandra Bullock, Diane Shaver, re-scrambles to form the word "disappeared". Are you kidding me ?? - The logistical impossibility of stupefying, abducting, and (in a very remote location) burying a person within forty minutes (as Bridges expressly implies). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that made me. Remember the fictitious, incredibly stupid (but very successful) character of Donald Kaufman in Adaptation. Many screenwriters are brilliant, inspired artists. Some are just Bozos convincing the little jokers who run the studios to distract themselves. This particular script is so amazingly weak that Donald Kaufman himself managed to sell it. Unfortunately, for all of us in the real world, Todd Graff actually did.
