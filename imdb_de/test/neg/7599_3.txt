It's been a tradition since my first VHS recorder that I collected several of the incarnations of the old fox by Charles Dickens. I recorded this and "Karroll's Christmas" this year. Luckily, when it ran on the Hallmark channel at 3 o'clock in the morning at the unGodly hour, I had no choice but to work on commercials. However, this was only salvation of grace. <br /> <br /> The writing was excruciatingly boring, with almost no skilful scene to save it from anything more than a teen-bopper soap like Beverly Hills 90210 seems the only logical explanation for their transformation into a scrooge to be like TV talk show hostess. It was wasted by Dinah Manoff, who plays the other bitch, Tori Spelling (who, by the way, had more layers of paint on her face than some colonial houses), only the sloth goddess, and Bill Shatner is perhaps one of the few amusing things in this area of ​​bleak adaptation. <br /> <br /> Some of the best options are wasted like the entrances of ghosts. Aunt Marla's performance could have been spectacular in the hands of a decent writer, but this Christmas turkey obviously had none. Tori Spelling may be a lovely person, but she has all the knack of a mannequin and that makes a bad show out of herself. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was good to see Gary Coleman working again, but the script does not give him anything to do but roll his eyes and speak really lame dialogue. <br /> <br /> And what's most annoying is that the transformation from Scroogedom to Tori is "sweet and light" as convincing as a passionate conservative. Well, if someone wants to write the ultimate Scrooge story of George Bush and Karl Rove, we could have a refreshing change from the usual bad Christmas clones. <br /> <br /> I think if you are a fan of Ms Spelling and / or 90210, this could be your cup of Christmas spirit. I would prefer a stiff shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash it myself. I can just throw this away before it's here with me for a long time. <br /> <br /> God bless us all!
