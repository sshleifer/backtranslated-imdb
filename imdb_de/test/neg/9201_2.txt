I say Ben Johnson and my Canadians say, "Ben Johnson ?!" - He was a fucking MOVIE STAR, a COWBOY, and in 1976 he was scratching when he played a sheriff who was stupid for making such TV disaster movies like this one at the time. So there are those bees and they kill some people by Fly in the mouth and follow them under water. Eventually, these idiots find the swarm and die, and this woman is trapped by the entire swarm in her car. The cops are like, what do we do? Um, bees die when it's cold. So where can we make it cold? I know - the stadium in New Orleans! So you're driving through the streets of New Orleans with this car and its swarm of killer bees, with a megaphone saying, "Get off the streets, or you'll die." And the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with their broken toilets becomes the stunning sinking of these special Buncha bees. I do not know what's the biggest outrage in this great city ... well, but that's shit, too. Best shown on an orange 16mm print, though Betamax is a good alternative!
