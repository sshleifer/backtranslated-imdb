I do not care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious! It combines the dreary seriousness of Threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are an extremely bleak, but incredibly witty satire about the brinkmanship policy of the Western and Eastern blocs at the time. You have to pay tribute to the filmmakers for even trying to beat the insanely madness of "Duck and cover" or "Protect and survive"! Get the world going, and you're pretty close to Whoops! Apocalypse. Add Rik Mayall in top form as an insane OTT SAS Commander, and you got it right. A worthy companion for Dr. med. Strangelove, and that says something.
