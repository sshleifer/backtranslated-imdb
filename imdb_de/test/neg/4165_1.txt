I was very excited about this movie at the beginning and fully expected it to be a combination of Equilibruim and Farenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was constantly disappointed because the plot and the subplots were not so deep and interested. Halfway through the movie, I thought about having fun with the characters and sets, to avoid having to turn them off. I enjoyed the premise of a future of merging cultures and separating between having and not being. What could have been a skilful and intelligent look into the future turns into a plotting, semantic sci-fi channel midnight strip with horrible drama, cheap sets, and a final, unpaid shot of Tim Robbins vagina. Maybe he should stick to his socialist political talk - since Shawshank everything has gone downhill.
