Jennifer Denuccio said on Square Pegs: "Gag me out the door." I would definitely vote for this movie on IMDB's worst movie list. Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a guy from Chicago who goes to California and sells his brother's jazz records. He is said to be a Barney who is in the local community of surfers. But he seems more like being new to civilization (just try to keep his sex scene going without squirming). There are also the ongoing adventures of the rest of the population that the viewer has to endure. That of Duke (Seymour Cassell), the volleyball expert who tries to behave TT to a normal human being, the vile, drunken surfers who cheat on their girlfriends, and the guy who does with another wager for which he lives in the Car can live Six months. <br /> <br /> California Dreaming is just a big old mess. It begins like a typical 70s trumpet with full 70s music (though this movie was released a year before the 80s). And Dennis Christopher is the most irritated loser who makes the film difficult (keep your finger on the fast-forward button). Although this movie should be about the surfing culture, the surfing scenes are almost completely garbage. People at the surf contest look like they can not fall asleep. <br /> <br /> I think the only cool thing is to see Tanya Roberts out of her role as Midge in the sitcom. "That's 70s show." And Cassell was not bad, he just had a bad movie.
