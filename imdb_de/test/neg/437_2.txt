AWiP tries to be funny, creepy, tense and romantic ... and fails in every way. Acting is average at best, but mostly stupid. The special effects are not enough to make up for the stupid plotters, and the chemistry between * ANY * is youthful. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to be mad at yourself, do not pay money to see it.
