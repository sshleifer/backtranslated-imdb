I am easily satisfied I like bad movies. I like watching movies with attractive young women in small clothes. <br /> <br /> This movie gives all the above a bad name. Yes, you know that what you get is not a high art or something similar. But even for the kind of movie Beach Babes From Beyond is not very good. <br /> <br /> Some people have given it to allow rational thinking to be surgically removed. <br /> <br /> It is not very good. It just is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 just because of a) novelty value for the famous relatives and Burt Ward and b) some girls are cute. Oh, by the way, did I tell you it's not very good?
