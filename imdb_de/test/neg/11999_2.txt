Ladies and gentlemen, let us introduce you? The Toltec! This ancient Latin American tribe had even preceded the Aztecs and was said to have the most vicious and bloodthirsty sorcerers, but they are whipped in the ass by a couple of college tails and a one-hundred-year-old lawyer! But before you can see it, you'll have to struggle through boredom, infantile bites, and sloppy sequences for more than 40 minutes, which are not really dizzy. In case I'm not sure, "The Dark Power" is an indescribably cheesy and awkward piece of 80s horror crap that's still amused by its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor. The author and director Phil Smoot was obviously admirable, but he? as well as the rest of the cast & crew? it lacked the talent and financial resources to deliver something that was only half decent. Smoot carefully watched "The Evil Dead" and other similar films with demonic themes, and somehow he must have thought he could do that too. The movie starts with an old Indian who dies in his remote country house. barely uttering his last word over a whisper? Toltecs. His grandson promptly rents some college chicks, including an '80s aerobic baby, a sweet black girl, and a racist redneck girl. You'll soon learn why the old Indian lived like a hermit, for he was indeed the keeper of an ancient Toltec cemetery. Toltec wizards buried themselves alive to rise again thousands of years later and to feed on the flesh of the living. And, frankly, is there anything better tasting meat than Bimbos? As already indicated, the first half of "The Dark Power" is awfully lame and sleep-inducing. The clich√©d jokes, the lingering dialogues, and the ridiculously oversized shots of Lash LaRue swinging around his whip seem to take forever. Then the movie loses its last credibility as the Toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground. Instead of threatening, they look like worn rock stars with stupid masks and drunken gestures. Just one bloody moment is worth mentioning when a guy's lips extend all over his skull, but overall the slaughter of this movie is disappointing. The remotely worthwhile moments are absolutely pointless, as if a 9-year-old boy (Cletus!) Makes fun with his uncle truck or the vulgar naked chick sipping beer in the bathtub after training. Seriously, if you did not let yourself be turned over by the sight of a Western veteran of the 1940s driving around his whip, I'd advise skipping this movie.
