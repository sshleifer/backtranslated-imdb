Harrison Ford plays a cop in a thriller. The perfect ingredient of SEEMS for top entertainment, Harrison best returns to Indy and Han Solo and protects a witness from reckless and merciless murderers. How easy is it to be deceived. If the film focused on the main topics of crime and excitement, instead of putting up barns and pushing ice-creams into people's faces, it might have been worth it. Incredibly predictable with the best shipping method of an enemy is with corn.
