I bought this movie in the hope that it would become another great killer toy movie. I'm a big fan of the Child's Play series and I was hoping to see it here. Boy, I was wrong. Most of the movie was not terribly scary. Besides, we just really see Pinocchio as "alive" in the final scenes of the movie. The little girl in the movie, her acting is so bad that it's almost ridiculous. Also, the ending never showed what happened to the doll or why she took the little girl to a lunatic asylum or wherever she was at the end of the movie. In my opinion, this movie is the worst of the genre "Killer Toy". If you want a good killer toy series, stay with the Child's Play series. Pinocchio's revenge is a waste of money and time.
