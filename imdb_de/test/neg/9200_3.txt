I really enjoyed the movie. It was sometimes very cheesy. (They destroy the villain with hairdryers - but where are they attached?) However, it's a unique movie, and I enjoyed the acting of Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope. I also liked Fanuel (whatever you write him ...), who liked Megan Characters because she called him a Dweeb. Aside from acting, the "rewinding" and showing what happened on Ariel's and then on Megan's point of view was pretty interesting. I saw it twice and I would see it again
