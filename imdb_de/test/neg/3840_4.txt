Like most people watching this movie, I did it for stars Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper. The two are extremely undervalued and must therefore write a lot of crap. In this film, Hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and is offered help by the mysterious Madsen. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as horrible as it could have been. I've seen both in much worse, both independent and collaborative (LAPD, horrible movie). The direction was pretty bad and the script needed some rewriting, but both offer the best possible performance with the material offered. Also the end is pretty strong, so you can say that the story had potential. But if a glowing review of a movie says, "It could have been a lot worse," that does not say much for the movie itself. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one that can be easily skipped if none of these actors attracts you. But if you're a fan of both or both, just have a look. Both give strong performances that outshine the obvious flaws of the film. Trust me, there are much worse options out there.
