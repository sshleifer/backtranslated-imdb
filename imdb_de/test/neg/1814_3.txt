Overall, the movie "Heart of Darkness" was pathetic compared to the book. Anyone who has ever read the book and has a good understanding of it can see the countless obvious shortcomings. There is an immense difference between the two. It seems to me that the director is in a lost battle. I could not imagine anyone taking on the monstrous task of recreating Heart of Darkness. The immense detail and the magic of the story can not be interpreted correctly. Conrad's story had so many layers and depth that it makes no sense to aim for a visual interpretation. At first, it is impossible to capture the details of the story. The colossal subtleties created by Joseph Conrad can not be properly restored by film. Marlow's feelings and emotions can not be interpreted equally in the film. If you've taken on the tremendous task of tackling Conrad's work, you know as well as I do that Conrad has written only half the story. The additional half consists of a series of connections made by the reader. As readers, you must be able to close and connect Joseph Conrad's ideas. As a result, some crucial details are missing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Even though the movie was a fair length, the movie looked short. It seemed like Conrad was able to pack a lot more details into 75 pages than the movie in an hour and a half. The speed of the movie prevented the viewer from getting to know the characters. Marlow was much more of a stranger. The perspective of the book puts you in Marlow's shoes. In the movie you see Marlow, however, almost from afar. I began to believe that the director was trying to use the same method of "reading between the lines" as Conrad. The compounds were weak, however. I know that if I had not read the book, I would by no means be able to understand the depth of the situation and the characters. <br /> <br /> Finally, Kurtz also seemed to be misinterpreted. His role was short and the details were not all included. It was impossible to understand the true Kurtz in the time he was shown. An important detail in the book was that Kurtz had become a god for the Africans. I did not think that a significant detail was defined. Kurtz also represented a soulless being in the book. He had died inside a long time ago. I think the director understood this detail. But instead of recreating it, he only had Kurtz Pug and mumbled everything. It also seemed as if the director had tried to make Kurtz mysterious, instead he seemed completely unfamiliar. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie reminded me of a teenager who had finished a science project for a next project day. It seemed effortless and made in a short time. The characters were alienated, important details were omitted and overall the central conspiracy was lost in the translation.
