Stay Alive has a very similar story to some Asian horror movies where technology is history. Some of these Asian horror movies are One Missed Call, Ringu and Pulse. So the idea of ​​Stay Alive is very clichéd and obvious, but the filmmakers behind it did not know how to add something new or interesting to the stereotypes in Stay Alive. This movie is totally crap. But a very big crap. All elements of Stay Alive belong to the worst class of horror films: shallow characters, nothing of tension, stupid "horror" that causes laughter and light violence. It is easy to notice that the "director" is not able to create something original or disturbing. I only give you one piece of advice: do not see this movie. I really hated it.
