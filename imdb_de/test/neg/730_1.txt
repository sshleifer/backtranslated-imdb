This is an absolutely terrible excuse for a show. People say it's funny and smart? I do not see how? Maybe because the characters use fancy words? Maybe because they are curious, use dry humor and have two-dimensional personalities. I attended an Ivy League school and nobody seemed as close as these characters. If I had met someone like her, I would probably have strangled her! Men behave like little emotional teenage girls, and all minority figures are based on stereotypes ... Simply put, they sound like a trailerpark family trying to be rich and demanding. This show is just another cookie cutter hit that brain-deadtime viewers regularly eat.
