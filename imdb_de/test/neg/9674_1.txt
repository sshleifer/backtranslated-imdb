This is pure CRAP and probably the worst biblical themed film ever made ... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they've set Sodom and Gomora before the big tide. They described Lot as a friend of Noah, even though he lived after Noah. To top it all, Lot later became a pirate and attacks Noah's Ark during the flood !!! ??? And what about the dealer who comes along on a boat, which is moved across the water with a bicycle mechanism? And swaps alcohol for food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as an alcoholic! Mocking and constant blasphemy one after another, and on and on and on and on ... Filmmakers and all those involved safely secured the first row in hell with this garbage ... <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this crap because you save almost three hours of your life.
