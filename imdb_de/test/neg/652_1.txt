In summary, LaBute translates his sadism into comedic farce. The predictable result is that he keeps on joking, insisting on surrounding them with bloody violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence of his continued efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight, but then apologize to the PC with feeble gestures. Basically, the movie just does not work, its plot is unconventional, the characters are one-dimensional clich√©s, there is no consequence or development of anything, and the comedy (where it's not completely out of place) is the worst high-concept drivel. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are completely wasted on characters that look like parodies of studio-controlled audiences - no matter what makes them sympathetic, neutral (and castrated) and full of moral platitudes. Crispin Glover has just been here long enough to convince her he's not in movies anymore. Chris Rock actually has negative chemistry with his hitman Freeman - it's like they're acting in different rooms, even if they're only two centimeters apart. Chris Rock acts like a digital insert. At least it's not as annoying as Jar-Jar. The 15-minute time of LaBute may be over. It looks like he has passed his reception.
