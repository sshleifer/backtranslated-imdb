Wow, that's anti-Christian bias! This is based on a Stephen King novel, and he prescribes this kind of prejudice, and then Hollywood exaggerates it even more. In this film, we see a Protestant pastor and a Catholic priest, both acting as fools and profane at the same time. Of course, the devil has taken over the city, maybe he has influence on these people, but they are typical Hollywood portrayals. You never show a minister who speaks and acts like Billy Graham or your local minister or priest. And - another "given" - they make the Satan character to the most interesting of the film. <br /> <br /> Max von Sydow plays the devil and makes him a nice guy. Ironically, Von Sydow played a number of these roles after portraying Jesus in 1964 in The Greatest Story Ever Told. You wonder why the actors are so broken? They do not know if they are God, Satan, or anyone in between. Ed Harris, who has played many unlikely roles in recent years, is appropriately cast in this story. He and the rest of the temperate characters in this movie DO NOT make fun of her. <br /> <br /> From all that I've heard, King's book is even darker and sicker than this hateful movie, but better built. Honestly, who cares? King and Hollywood deserve each other.
