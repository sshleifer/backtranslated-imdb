Robert Lansing plays a scientist who experiments with the passage of objects through solid matter, but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four-dimensional! The fantasy of the atomic age is quite charming in a very kitschy way. Maybe it was considered thoughtful science-fiction (with psychological overtones) in his day, but today the movie is slightly over-frozen and naive; It is a camp party tailor-made for television's late and late show. Wood performances by Lansing and Lee Meriwether are hardly rated as one-dimensional, though Patty Duke (a cute brat before "Miracle Worker") receives a colorful, unforgettable ending. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
