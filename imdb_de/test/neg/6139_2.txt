************** SPOILERS BELOW ************** "" Night, Mother "is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), a divorced epileptic woman, who quiet is announcing to her brazen mother (Anne Bancroft) that she will commit suicide, a fascinating premise that is beyond all vitality and excitement, and the ingenious catch turns out to be fraud - the following story lacks substance, gravity, and revelatory value Where are the shocks and surprises when mother and daughter have the last conversation of their lives, where are the secrets revealed, the confessions, fantasies and regrets? They are here, but they are all painted with the same matte color that expresses the emotions In the background, celebrating the "genius" of playwright Marsha Norman at the expense of everyone else, the result is not a movie, but an exhausting endurance test. <br /> <br /> Let me anticipate my comments and say I find Sissy Spacek when one of the biggest actresses in the history of movies, a woman who is so magnetic. so natural that it surprises and surprises me again and again after twenty years of fame. She brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does, and I've seen her rescue more than a trashy film with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice, and her sweet smile. It was because of the great Spacek that I've seen this movie for the first time, and for one of their films to be awful, he has to seriously fail. This movie fails in two cases. <br /> <br /> First, the film is adapted so accurately to the Pulitzer winner stage play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. The entire film is a two-woman dialogue between Jesse and her mother. What worked on the stage - a middle-aged mother and daughter - argues for two hours in small movie houses. A game, no matter how great, needs to * be customized for the screen? it is unyielding and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that no word of it can be changed. The screenplay for this film could have been shortened by thirty to forty pages, and a knowing scriptwriter would have given the brilliant Spacek and the knowledgeable Bancroft some physical sequences, some facial reactions, and something to break up the wall-to-wall yak feast and prison-like single set. No wonder that the script was adapted by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who knows theater, but proves unaware here in the film. <br /> <br /> I can not overstate the effect of the stage play on the movie. It is superfluous and boring to argue with Jesse and her mother about the imminent suicide of Jesse. The women go from the living room into the kitchen in the cave and back to the living room, where they start from scratch. A small house in the Midwest is not the ideal location for a single-set movie, and the director never tries anything clever or original to break the monotony with an outside view or a cutaway or a flashback or anything. There are no music, no other characters, no other stories ... only two women covering the couch cushions and discussing their opinions. The awe given to the game is pathological. Even the most solemn classics of Shakespeare are churned up for the screen. The commitment to the original game is almost spiteful. It's as if the movie was just made to document the dramatic treasure that was the stage play, and the audience had to think about it later. She may be a good stage actress, but in the film, where 80% of the performances are there, she rarely seems to fit. She certainly does not fit in here, plays a grandmother in the Midwest, but looks more like Mrs. Robinson before her morning coffee. She hunts Jesse around the house, looks more than dumbfounded and astonished, and extremely disagreeable, even if her lines convey a loving, though flawed, woman open and so good that you actually understand and agree with her choice of character. Sissy lets us see that Jesse is a flat tire, a wrong turn for a woman who had a bad break and made too many wrong decisions. She never had control over her life, and her suicide will be her way of saying, "No, I'm getting out of here." So she says it anyway, and when Spacek speaks? You hear. She proves in all her films that a good actress does not have to behave like a man, does not have to be bluff and courageous and has lent testosterone. In this and in films like "Coal Miner's Daughter" she quietly shows a gentle power and calm depth that is as impressive as it is hypnotic? you can not help falling in love. <br /> <br /> So it was so hard for me to see "Night, Mother". Spacek is wasted in a matted stunt of a film that never serves to engage or even distract. I would not recommend this movie to anyone but die-hard fans of Sissy like me, and even then you'll be disappointed. I give the movie a full stamp bonus for the ending, brave enough to make the main character do what's right for them, rather than a hackneyed happy ending. GRADE: C
