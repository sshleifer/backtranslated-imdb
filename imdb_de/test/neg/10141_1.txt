This is really an "okay" series. Each of them is pretty good. but I can not take Reba. she tries to be funny, but she is just not there and then she got a stupid accent! If she took her out of the show, I'd like to see it every day. <br /> <br /> I watched the show in 10 minutes now and as I said before Reba destroys the show. But the 20-year-old guy (does not know his real name), but he's so funny and he really saves everything. <br /> <br /> So here's the recipe for a great show. Reba kick it off and then bring the 20-year-old guy to the lead role. <br /> <br /> I really hope somebody out there agrees with me and thinks (like me) that he should kick Reba out of the show and put someone else in the lead role
