A Killer Calls must be the largest release of Asylum so far. It's about a sexy babysitter on duty receiving scary calls from a creepy voice that she repeatedly asks, "Did you check the girl?" Of course, she tracked the cops' calls (after doing some realistically unnecessary tasks - hang up when "he calls", waits ten seconds and dials * 57). Sounds familiar? Yes, that's why I rented it. <br /> <br /> Well, that should be it. And I hate to say it, but that could have been more entertaining than the big crape test that was released around the same time, if not a single deadly mistake was original. It tried to make the main character sympathetic, rather than having some cliched fun with her. Mind you, that could have worked with a talented actress. But she was not. Sure, she looked good and screamed and cried, but. , , well, whatever. <br /> <br /> Then came the terrible end. Not terrible that it was terrible, terrible that it was boring. The pace up to that point (about an hour) was slow, clich√©d and fun. Then it goes in a different direction, and it moves away from another silly, funny Slasher movie with a sexy "teen" turned into a hostel-bustling Gore / Borefest. <br /> Well, no matter what "category". The leading actress fluttered a line? Well, I do not feel like shooting it again. We forgot to give the killer motivation? Well, I do not feel like rewriting it. The tempo changes completely in half? Well, I do not feel like shaving fifteen minutes before shaving. Continuity error? Well no matter. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie (dumb, cheesy, predictable, Campy Splatter movie with a sexy cast) then you're fine until the end. The end is stupid, it's not fun, it's not scary, it's not steamy or cheesy or fast. In fact, there were almost exactly five minutes in which the character did nothing but get tied up (and that's not a spoiler because he's on the back of the DVD) and looked around for the things in the room and then screamed and. , What ever.
