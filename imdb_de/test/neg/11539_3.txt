Excuse me, but my tongue was ALSO in my cheek when we filmed this piece in a pile. As a wicked sister with hair that would envy Mommy Dearest, I did everything I could to channel Tim Curry into Rocky Horror. I am sad that this has not been noticed ... Well, a friend compared it to a "cheapest SHOWGIRLS" with a white hot spoon. I have to be satisfied with that. <br /> <br /> What surprised me is that nobody mentioned the endless (and boring) wet T-shirt contest. It really is the longest wet T-shirt competition in cinema history. And the only one where attendees wore industrial cotton-polyester shirts that defied all effort to make them wet and translucent. <br /> <br /> And has nobody seen the director's cameo as a buddy on the payphone that was interrupted by our hero? With the line "are we already filming?" Clearly audible? Jeez, this is a real movie heaven for REAL lovers ...
