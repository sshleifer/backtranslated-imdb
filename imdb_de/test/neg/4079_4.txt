EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, John Michael Higgins, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon and Ed Helms (Cameo) Self Tight "Continue" to "BRUCE ALMIGHTY" with Carell's Wichsmanager Evan Baxter, who left the TV to begin his freshman job. demands that he build an ark like Noah, and the amusement follows (or should). The Godforsaken sitcom y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolov is utterly lame, and only Carell's loveable personality transcends his futile Evan into something resembling a human being. The end result is a lot of bird tails and flatulence (which is supposed to cost $ 175 million for the CGI F / X). Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant. Incredibly unstable. (Director: Tom Shadyac)
