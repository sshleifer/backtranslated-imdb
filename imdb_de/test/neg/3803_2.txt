I accidentally discovered this in the middle flip channels. I recognized almost everyone in the cast, "groovy" haircuts aside, and wondered what kind of movie could attract such a cast of past and future stars. Since I had not seen the original, I suspected that this was the Poseidon adventure, as it was obviously on a ship in distress. I was wrong! I can not imagine why one of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would associate their name with such garbage. There is no story, the performances all looked enforced, the characters were a parody of the usual catastrophe film roles that are suddenly brought together by an event, pondering the true meaning of life on the level of the bumper sticker philosophy. > <br /> It's worth it to see the unusually horrible achievements of greats like Sally Field, Michael Caine and others. You must have needed the money urgently. Can we blame the director?
