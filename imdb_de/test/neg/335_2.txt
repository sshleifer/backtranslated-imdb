I made a great effort to get this movie after reading the comments on this page. I really do not have time to write reviews, but I felt that this was my job as a science fiction horror fan. This is just the second review I have written. The other was for Dracula 3000. Now it's up to you. This movie is shit. Plain and simple. I kept wondering if I saw the same movie as those who wrote all those "nice" comments. I've seen movies with bad effects, bad acting and bad sound, you name it and I saw it. But that was really shit. I do not care how much it costs or does not cost to ban movies like these and Dracula 3000, and the entire cast and crew are arrested and jailed for murder. Incidentally, I already mentioned that this movie is shitty. I mean, really shit. The plot was absent and the acting was weak. It seems the writer saw Pitch Black and was upset because he did not think of such a conspiracy, so he decided to create his own version. Instead, the sucking factor took him over and owned him. DO NOT WATCH THIS. You'll have more fun pulling down your pants and sitting on burning coals.
