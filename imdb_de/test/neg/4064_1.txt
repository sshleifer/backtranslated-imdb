Maybe this film was actually intended as a satire like "Airplane", but he failed as miserably as the "thriller". I do not understand why they did not pay a real pilot a few hundred dollars for some technical advice. Hell, I would have done it for free! This magical aircraft changed from an 757 to a 767 to a 747 in an hour, and the power levers moved backwards. And the dialogue sounds as if it were the end of a children's "telephone" in which everyone spoke different languages. I actually rewound the TIVO and looked at it a couple of times a second time to see if it was really as bad as I first thought. It was.
