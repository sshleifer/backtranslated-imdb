I find the criticism of many IMDb users somewhat harsh and in many cases I find that they criticize the film from a very professional point of view and not from the guy on the street who wants to sit and watch to see it all. <br /> <br /> In this case I have to say that it was BAD. I'm a sci-fi junkie and there was NOTHING in this movie that even grabbed me for a second. <br /> <br /> There was no real action. I may be an idiot, but still do not know where the government was that was worried about these parts. <br /> <br /> The character's pitiful attempt to put these 3 pieces together is scary. Half the time, the two parts were already there and he just had to add the third one. A 3-year-old child could have brought her together. <br /> <br /> This movie was bad. <br /> <br /> Dominic
