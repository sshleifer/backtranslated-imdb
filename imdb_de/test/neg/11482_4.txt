I expected a lot more from this movie. The preview looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try. The bottom line was "The Adventures of Sebastian Cole" only a decent thing: Adrian Grenier. <br /> <br /> I really like Grenier very much and I liked his performance very much. The character is well designed, but everything else moves only through the duration of the movie. Clark Gregg is really good, but I do not think his character was explained too well. I mean, there is not too much to explain. He wants to become a woman. Nevertheless, something was missing. <br /> <br /> The film's obviously low budget was nice to see. I enjoyed that the movie was shot only with a script (a bad one) and only a few actors. It was a nice change. <br /> <br /> Although the main idea of ​​the movie was actually alright, it was disappointing to see many scenes that had nothing to do with it. As I said, the script looked promising and I have to say that I was interested in where director Tod Williams was directed, but it was basically a very slow movie with not too good dialogues. <br /> <br /> "Sebastian" started to look good in the end, but fell back into a hole. The acting was mostly good, the writing needs some work, but the budget of the film helped him in the long run. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to someone, if they wanted to be quiet film with a strong main character, but otherwise I would stay away. Personally, I would not see it twice.
