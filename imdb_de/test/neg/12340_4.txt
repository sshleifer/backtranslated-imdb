Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car films, this works for Robert Redford like a "Jollies" project, as he can drive uphill and downhill in alpine sunshine. <br /> <br /> The story is as light as powder snow with Redford's townspeople David Chappellet (which name is that, anyway?), who, with the prize of Olympic fame, puts his coach ahead of the pack, father and teammate. Women are a mere side show in his island world, as shown by a rather vile scene with an old friend in his hometown, and then his selfishly yielding pursuit of a free-thinking, independent woman played by Camilla Sparv. Skiing is good, with some good stunts, with a lot of bumps and scratches on the slopes, but the effectiveness of our subsequent knowledge of top TV coverage of ski events has continued to affect us to this day. And I'm not convinced that the Winter Olympics have the same mass identification as the Summer Games, so if Redford finally wins his gold medal in the final role, I might not be so excited another one. <br /> <br /> Of the actors, Redford, the best profile striker, does not and does not do much while Gene Hackman scores better with equally sparse material. Mrs. Sparv is good for the main female interest that Redford treats, as he no doubt treats every other woman in his chauvinistic way. <br /> <br /> However, in reality, there is a lack of dramatic tensions for which the action sequences are sufficient to compensate you completely and you are not interested in one of the main characters. One of those movies where the actors were probably more fun than the audience.
