Guys, what can I tell you? I'm Bulgarian I can not remember how often I talk to Americans and not to mention that they have no idea where Bulgaria is, but they say things like, "There's a war there, right?" or "I never imagined that people in a country like Bulgaria had internet". Look at Bruce Campbell's The Man with the Braying Brain. I was curious about this movie because 1) I'm Bruce Campbell fan - "Evil Dead" trilogy and "The Adventures of Brisco County Jr." 2) The film was shot entirely on location in Bulgaria, the second after "Alien Apocalypse", which is also hard to beat. 3) I enjoy nice B-movies. <br /> <br /> Well ... The film shows our country like an endless Gypsy Town in which they attack your car, waving illegal weapons, and you can be killed at any moment. And Bruce's line "Bull $ h1t Bulgaria" is more than offensive. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach form a great team, Bruce does his specialty - beats himself and that's all. There is nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> People give this movie 10 due to the cult status of Bruce, but it does not deserve more than 3rd movie waste.
