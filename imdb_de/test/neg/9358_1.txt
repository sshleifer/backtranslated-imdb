This very finely crafted film commits the unforgivable (which is ironic given the film's theme). No one who comes into this film knows what matters. Worse than that, 3/4 of the way into the movie, no one has any idea what matters, because everything up to that "moment" is another movie. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Dutcher's first two films, which easily rivaled the best 2 Best of Mormon films ever (competing with Saints and Soldiers and now the New York Doll - seen in a show) I had wished that he wanted to see his movie for a very long time. I was there. I wanted to believe that I would see the next great Mormon movie, one that would hold the Numero Uno spot for a very long time. But no. Three-quarters of the movie took the sharpest left-handers and dragged me through something I never wanted to go through. He takes the mountain. Despite all the moral issues, yes, both of them with little time or emotional capacity to address them properly, they both nod to Jesus with a nod, as if that would do it right away. (It's true that Jesus saves, do not blame me for not believing that, it's not Dutcher's problem.) <br /> <br /> Is the movie well-filmed? Indeed. Do the actors act? They removed their pants. Was the music appropriate? Everything but whatever was over the credits. Everything about this movie was great, except for the story, which was so humid and wrong that everything else did not matter. (I learned "thank you" from New York Doll, a very decent show, by the way.) The third act of the film was neither desirable nor enjoyable or credible. I know that Dutcher leaned back to do it that way, but at that point I was pushed so far out of the movie that nothing, nothing, could bring me back. The absurd unbelievability of dozens of details in the last few minutes did not help. Anyone on a mission knows what I'm talking about, especially anyone who knows Spoiler Alert, knows events sent to someone who is sent home from a mission early for moral and / or psychological reasons. It is as if a parallel universe had suddenly arisen in which normal rules or behaviors suddenly do not apply. <br /> <br /> There are a million things in this film that have been created and embellished to only be trampled thrown away in a tricky bout of "ooh, that's really going to get them" elitism. Therefore unforgivable. I can only hope that when Dutcher finishes his next film ("Falling" apparently), remember that film critics can only buy so many tickets and fans pay the bills. For that reason, God's first army was such an unqualified success. <br/> <br/> Dutcher's shock and awe prove that he moves over the head on the big issues and neither the intellectual nor the creative maturity has business acumen necessary to accept them. I pray, pray !? He is learning his lesson and that he and we are all looking back with a vexation and rejoicing that he has pulled his head out of the field where the light does not really shine and really succeeds in these and other issues, forever changing the world ,
