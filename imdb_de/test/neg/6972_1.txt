Let me say that about Edward D. Wood Jr. He had a passion for his work, which I wish more people had. If we all had the optimism and the captivating hope of Ed Wood, the world would probably be a much better place. I am familiar with Ed Wood's story and have seen the most wonderful biopie "Ed Wood" (1994) several times. I admire his audacity and his pursuit of the job he loved; I still admire his unmistakable attitude. He had a penchant for directing that I wanted more people in modern Hollywood. <br /> <br /> But that does not make it any fun to watch his movies. And "Glen or Glenda," his first and most confessional film, is probably his worst. <br /> <br/> "Glen or Glenda" is a dark cult movie about a crossdresser named Glen (played by director / writer Ed Wood himself), who despite his love for his fianc√© Barbara (Dolores Fuller) can not seem his Passion for transvestitism in which he dresses in women's clothes and a wig and so to ... Glenda! Glen / Glenda's story is told by a doctor and he too is spoken and monitored by a mysterious character called "The Scientist" played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. Oh, and there is also a sub-story about an Alan / Anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the story of Christine Jorgenson, to whom this film originally titled "I Changed My Sex!" had to be founded before. <br /> <br /> Have I already dropped your jaw? As much as I would like to warn you about this picture, if you have never seen it, I would never tell a lie about a movie and there is no wrong word in this plot overview that I just gave you. Everything in it is true. This is a movie about crossdressers and transsexuals, a topic that does not sound very appealing at first and is not very appealing. I am sure that "Glen or Glenda" could give a very moving picture despite the theme with a good script and a good director (and neither had either). It is a confessional film by Wood because he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen. But again, that does not make it a good movie ... or even a worth seeing movie. "Glen or Glenda" is a jumbled, messy mess of a movie sinking into new trenches in the field of bad cinema. It makes no sense more than his notoriously stupid scene in which Bela Lugosi "Pull the string!" about inexplicable pictures of bison. The majority of the film is told in a monotonous voice and reminds me of some very bad informative films I've seen before. It's as if one of those really bad shorts is expanding into a 70-minute feature film and twice as boring. We've been sitting there for ages, waiting for the action that never comes. There is no real attempt to even build up energy when the camera is locked into position for many grueling minutes and long periods when nothing happens. The only moments worthy of anyone's time are those of Bela Lugosi, who sheds some light on these dark trenches. I think Lugosi should be like the deity of the movie, but I personally do not care who or what he should be. I'll tell you what he was: a gifted actor who has been busy making garbage. But he and Wood were very good friends and liked working together, so good for him. <br /> <br /> I will always admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for the cinema, but I will never do it while I live, I admire his films. A movie critic once called Ed Wood's films "innocent fun," but even that is questionable. Innocent? Yes. Fun? No sir. And if "Citizen Kane" is Mount Everest of the movie world, then "Glen or Glenda" is probably the Mariana Trench.
