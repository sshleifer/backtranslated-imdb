How to take Charles Darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick movie. His central and pioneering ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are unaffected except for two short scenes. In one of the scenes it is said that he "kills God"; pure demagogy to make the movie emotional. And the rest of the movie is up to this purpose: it's all about melodramatic and long family scenes with overlapping music that makes you cry. Anyone who actually read "Origin Of Species" realized that there was no break with God in Darwin's work. On the contrary, there was a growing reverence and respect and a revolutionary new way of looking at things. A good film about Darwin could be instructive, thoughtful, and deeply inspiring, even in a religious sense - but that would contradict the intention of the soap opera of this film. This is a film designed to make people moan in imaginary sympathies and then feel transformed, though they can not understand why; Darwin's big name is used only as a marketing tool because you would put a famous name at a party to make an impression. Sad that the sets and costumes are so good: The production values ​​except the writing were obviously high. See it, if you want to cry, for the loss of intelligence in American literature.
