My first warning should have been that this DVD was available for $ 5.00. But since it was Sandra Bullock that I generally like, I bought her. My disappointment with the movie started almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and stiff. The color is distorted. I have constantly adjusted the volume to hear the conversations. Acting is amateurish. Even the killing scenes are a failure. Twice dead people moved their legs. When my cash-poor daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I immediately and happily agreed. This is a surprisingly bad movie. Tomorrow I will be giving this DVD at the Company White Elephant Christmas Party.
