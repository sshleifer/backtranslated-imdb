This line is a good summary of this movie. If you've read it and watched 20 minutes of the movie, you know exactly how the rest of the movie behaves. Some researchers called Surgei (pronounced SirGay) are searching for hell in the underworld of Moscow. He seems to have disappeared, however, and his friend Oven follows with a team to look for him. Could you find a more boring action? Some bad actors, who take care of an old man in the underground. Acting is very bad, the romance feels really meaningless and untrue, often there is no good reason for the way the characters behave, nothing is uncanny and, above all, nothing interesting happens in the whole movie. They just go, ask some gang leaders and other people for directions, go for a few more, complain, find the old man, then run and find their way out of the subway. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives me the lowest rating of this film is the atmosphere. If you only want to watch a movie for it, this may be a good choice. It is dark and it is mystical and gloomy. The rest of the movie is pretty boring, though. They just sit there all the time, waiting for the movie to start or something happens. There are actually some things happening, but they are not going very well. For example, I did not really notice when one of the characters disappeared and I swear I did not sleep or anything. And I do not understand what's dangerous with these kids ... They just walk around the subway together scratching sticks on the walls (I suppose it's supposed to be kind of scary). <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if you really need dark atmospheres.
