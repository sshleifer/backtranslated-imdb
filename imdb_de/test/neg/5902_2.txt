It's generally not my practice to rate films that I do not like at all. However, once or twice a year, I temporarily suspended my rule just to comment on the things I like to warn. I find it more enjoyable to comment on something I like and increase it than when I shoot in bad movies. But some "movies" are screaming for the razor. <br /> <br /> Bilitis is one of them. The camera is not the only aspect that is blurry and out of focus here. An almost unrecognizable plot (certainly incoherent, if there is one at all), bad acting, kitschy script and terrible tempo. These are the main problems. I firmly believe that not all films are the same and films should be judged by their category. It's not sensible to say, say, beach-front bingo against the wind. I condemn Bilitis compared to other movies in his weight class. It's very bad when compared to films like Emmanuelle or Secrets of the Chambermaid. Even the feast of the eye must be entertaining and Bilitis is definitely not.
