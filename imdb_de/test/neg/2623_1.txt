Thankfully, I had no heavy machinery in operation, it could have been a worst disaster. The shots were slow and very repetitive. Different scenes, same settings, medium shot, medium shot, medium shot, snooze. Story Line was pretty empty. William Hurt was the worst. Where did he get that stupid accent? Random shots of the scenery, just to record them, did not do much. There were more shots of Arbor in her car than anything else. The direction really did not usher in the scenes and I did not feel any of the characters. I would have rated it zero if IMDb had the option. Great sedative, if you can not sleep. It has gone 2 hours of my life, I will never come back.
