I've read every single one of Baroness Orczys Scarlet Pimpernel books. I saw 3 Pimpernel movies. I've been very fond of Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews. It does everything for violence and actions and occasionally violates the spirit of the book. I do not expect movies to get caught up in action. I gave up long ago to be idealistic. However, if you've already done a great movie about a book, you can not make it with a TV movie that has great actors and beautiful costumes, but a pretty decent script. In the 80s version ... remain cream
