I read a lot from the readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of the story of Nora Roberts. I did not read the book, I do not know if this adaptation was true, but I know it was not good. Actually, the script was the best part of the film, so kudos to Nora Roberts. <br /> <br /> I planned ahead and saw Carolina Moon for Claire Forlani. I was never sure if she was a good actress. In some films she was decent, in others average and in this really bad. But Forlani was not alone. The performances took place everywhere. Oliver Hudson was made of wood and boring. Josie Davis was hammam. Then there's Jacqueline Bisset in the middle of all this B-rate acting! She did not have much to do but portray bitterness, but even when she was sleepwalking, she was far ahead of others. <br /> <br /> Forlani is still one of the most stunning women in movies and I was not disappointed in this property. I think Forlani can be more than just a feast for the eyes, but until she gets a good performance in a good movie, she will continue to excel. And I will continue to faithfully look at everything she's involved in. That's what makes fandom fun. <br /> <br /> This movie, Carolina Moon, was pretty bad though. Besides the bad acting (fake southern accents are really distracting) the direction was pedestrian. It was not terrible. It was just the boring caliber for TV that you're used to Lifetime. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of a star, you can probably enjoy Carolina Moon for that reason I did. If you're a fan of the book, you might be able to see the story on screen, albeit in a duller form. Otherwise, this movie is not conspicuous.
