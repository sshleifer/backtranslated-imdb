This film turns the facts of Anne and Mary's life into something you can not recognize. Mary Boleyn, who was actually a pretty dumb and stupid creature, and making her a "good" sister, is just stupid. In fact, Anne was the far more interesting character, and that's why her life was told so often, not Mary's. <br /> <br /> In response to a previous review, I fail to see how Anne's life was so "criminal" ... for me, it was Henry who was the real criminal. Whatever Anne's motives may be to win the king and withhold her affection, to win the crown and husband, must be brought into the context of the time when these real events took place. Anne was a relatively innocent person compared to the majority of most courtiers in her time. Most modern historians have not acknowledged or disproved most of the myths and slander that this film immortalizes, and I've never heard of anyone who actually believes the rumor when they slept with their brother. This film is so sensational and false that it is irritating to believe that, without knowing anything about that time in history, one might expect that he believes that the film is presented as a "fact". <br /> <br /> I won 'I can not even start with the funny filming of the movie ... but I'm pretty sure no cameras were invented in the 16th century, so I do not understand why Anne and Mary talking to one throughout the movie ... It's a really bad planning project and it's horrible and annoying, to say the least. Anne of the Thousand Days is also inaccurate, but infinitely more entertaining, and at least one of the story's most fascinating women in history. Do not even think about renting this. There are two hours you will never come back!
