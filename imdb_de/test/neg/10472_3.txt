In Sweet Water, ambitious businessman Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) builds a resort in the middle of the desert in protest of the Katonahs. When three workers find Indian relics and bones in a ditch on the site, they inadvertently release the huge skeleton like a creature known as Bone Eater, and their bones are devoured by the monster. Half-blood sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner), including Running Wolf, is responsible for investigating the disappearance of workers urged by Krantz to arrest the demonstrators. But the Bone Eater attacks other locals and kills, while Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) seeks an ancient tomahawk capable of destroying the evil creature, the most ridiculous script I've ever seen. The characters and the situation are not well developed and things are going on without further consequences. The conclusion is probably the worst part in this movie. The typical white American Bruce Boxleitner is dressed like an Indian (in the story his grandfather was an Indian) severing his own wrist (why? And where is the blood later?) And clumsily throwing the ax into the bony chest's chest Monster and my last hope for an improvement in history destroyed. My last question: If the bone eater eats bones, what happens to the meat and clothing of its victims? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Devorador de Ossos" ("The Bone Eater")
