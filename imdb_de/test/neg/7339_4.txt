I love the book It's full of passion, romance, tension ... and the film brings with it two spunky stars with it. Kylie Minogue was already a big star in Australia after starring in Neighbors and releasing her first single. The decision to cast her in The Delinquents was certainly a marketing ploy. That did not pay off for me. <br/> <br/> Kylie may have been great in neighbors, but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the fiery Lola ... and she was not an Asian descend like Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. <br /> <br /> On the whole, the movie was boring. It pulled out, it lacked the passion of the book, it focused heavily on Kylie and was generally completely disappointing.
