The novel WEAPON, which serves as the basis for this vile piece of trash, is one of the best techno-thrillers to come down the pike for a long time. The character of SOLO, who is NOT supposed to look like a human being, is wonderful creation and it was just terrible to see him reduced to another Terminator clone, with Mario Van Peebles cruelly trying to behave like a robot. " behavior". There is NOTHING, which is worthwhile for this movie. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood insist on grabbing the rights to excellent novels and then slaughtering them? There are so many things that are not OK with SOLO that listing information seems so unfair, as if you were inviting a legless man to a lively hopscotch game. Avoid this terrible movie and look for the 2 novels of ROBERT MASON that have the fantastic character of SOLO. The books are WEAPON and a superb sequel to SOLO. But do not pay attention to the terrible filth of a movie.
