The best part about this movie is that it looks like they needed a lot of material left over from the attack on Pearl Harbor in Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the shot of the P-40, which crashed into the line of the parked P-40, but was filmed from a hangar or crane. Unfortunately it only gets worse. <br /> <br /> There are two black and two white boys as American prisoners of war, as well as some Filipino prisoners of war and Japanese guards. The ranking POW of the Americans is a white naval lieutenant, who of course is an O-3 in the Navy. In any case, he needs a haircut, very distracting. Hockey hair does not belong in a film from World War II. Oh, and he's a racist. He does not want to share quarters with the Negros. Of course he did not want to be with the white man in the apartment in real life either. I think the Geneva Convention contains a clause on officers' quarters and crews, but that was not the point here. Well, I think the plot is secondary to other issues in this movie. He is put in his place and spends the rest of the movie quite a bit on operating the air pump for the divers. <br /> <br /> But once you get started it's not a bad story. The Japanese want the divers to raise the silver discarded by the Americans before the fall of Corrigador. The Filipino Resistance wants them to take their time. And the prisoners of war are doing their best to help. A potentially good story and not so bad, I think. It's a bit unbelievable when the POWs use the camp to swim between the POW camp and the Philippine village every night. Maybe I'm not so picky when I know that this is not a blockbuster movie. I guess that's why it comes out of a 20-DVD warfare movie collection for five dollars. <br /> <br /> The 70s music was neither part of this movie nor a World War II movie. It's pretty distracting, to say the least. The acting was not that bad. Probably better than I could. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of football, at least I found out that Jim Brown is a real person and not someone Richard Pryor did. That alone was worth the 25 I paid for this movie. <br /> <br /> It pays to look at TCM or pay a quarter for it. <br /> <br /> A star for a war movie, another for World War II and another because I feel generous.
