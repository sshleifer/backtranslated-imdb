At the bottom of the Apocalypse movie scale is this piece "The Final Executioner", at least where I'm from. A guy is trained by an ex-policeman to seek revenge on those who killed his wife and his friends in cold blood ... and that's it. Many fake explosions and repetitive shootings follow. Has one of the strangest costumes I've seen in a movie for a long time, and a massive fortress that seems to be run by only 7 people. Great work for dubbing boys (!) Best moment: When our hero loses a sword fight and is about to be spit in the neck, he just takes out his gun and BANG! Why do not you do that sooner? It is a mystery. That's why everyone wants to prevail at all. I'm still puzzling even now. 2/10
