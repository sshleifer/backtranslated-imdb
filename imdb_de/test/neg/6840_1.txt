With all the many problems that make up this terrible piece of celluloid, it is the stupidest plotter of recent cinema history. Richard Gere determines, by some sort of revelation, who the real aim of the jackal is. He does not work, it only comes to him. In doubt "He's following the First Lady!". This movie blows chunks.
