This movie was so frustrating. Everything was energetic and I was totally ready to have a good time. At least I thought I could stand it. But I was wrong. First the funny looping? It was like "America's Funniest Home Videos". The damned parents. I hated her so much. The stereo typical Latino family? I have to talk to the responsible person. We have to talk. The little girl who always hung someone? I just hated her and had to mention it. Well, transcending the last scene, I have to say. It's so wonderfully bad and bad that it's a movie of its own. What a crappy dance. Terrible and beautiful at the same time.
