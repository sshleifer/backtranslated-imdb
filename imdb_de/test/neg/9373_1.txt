The brands in this film, like Suit Supply, take on history because it's set in the 1980s. It is not a very exciting movie. Also the single from Intwine on the soundtrack is very bad, she has a refrain, which repeats itself several times. 'I'm a cruel man, I take everything away, I'm a cruel man to which I'm staying here ..' Jeeez, would not these Assswipes have thought of anything better than that? I think they wrote it in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It's really annoying, just like the product placement in this movie product, that the controversy and publicity pays off for a criminal who should not be a celebrity as he is now made, but should be forgotten how Rats should be.
