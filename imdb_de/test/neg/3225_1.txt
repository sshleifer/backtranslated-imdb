What happened to Mathew Modine's career? I still remember when he was considered an a-list actor ... <br /> <br /> Was it the last island in the coffin of a promising career? Wow, this guy really needs to hate Renny Harlin's bravery ... <br /> <br /> This movie really wants to be a comedy, but it does not make a laugh, the characters are caricatures and badly drawn ... but that hurts me the most , is that Mr. Modine takes on these roles, alongside actors so far from his caliber. I mean, by the time he made films like BIRDIE, he could never have his worst nightmares. I imagined he'd be in movies with a buddy honking a cow that had just closed its anus, and maybe the worst, next to Elizabeth Berkley !!!
