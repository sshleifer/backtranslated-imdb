A ridiculous comedy that moves in the direction of the arms. I love a comment here: "Can not be done today". Well, "The Philadelphia Story" could not run without one or two car hunts. Does that mean, however, that the picture is worse to be old-fashioned? I do not think "Susan Slept Here" was good for every generation and it should be peaceful in the memories of Debbie Reynolds fans. There's no spark in this story of a screenwriter sticking to a much younger girl for "scriptwriting." Dick Powell makes his farewell screen, which must have been embarrassing. Reynolds is pale. Produced by a Harriet Parsons who gives her famous mother Louella a bunch of crazy plugs. * 1/2 of ****
