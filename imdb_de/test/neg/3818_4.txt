Let me just give you some advice. If you watch this movie, just to see how a number of unlikely characters are butchered in a dozen different ways, then you will love this movie because everyone dies horribly, beyond the blood. There is not much else. <br /> <br /> Where should I start: - The characters do not appeal to the audience as there is no background story for any of them, as I do not feel attached to any of them. In fact, I did not like any of them and I was so sick of them that at the end of the film I searched for the distorted horror to kill them all (which he did by the way). <br /> <br /> - bad action; I mean, I did not understand it, take the Asian tour guide for example, he spoke perfect English, then, after sinking the small boat, he somehow got an accent out of the blue, and then later spoke normal English. <br /> <br /> One of the worst endings for a horror: (if you can call it that) After the monster / mutant thing killed almost everyone, they're killed by the last two remaining idiots, they thought! The monster / human thing is eventually killed when the beauty and the geek put a pole through his heart / nick (it was hard to say) and presumably it died right in front of them (within range of the arms), but later it comes back and kill her (wtf) I mean, why did not she kill her when he was right next to them. Arghhhh! I mean, it was just too late, it was as if the author did not know where he wanted the story to go (or he was only a few minutes to 80 minutes, so he added a few retarded phrases to the movie Get 80 minutes of crap instead of 75 minutes. <br /> <br /> What I did not get was why they did not kill the damn thing while it was unconscious, instead they just walked away like idiots So it could come back and kill her The only reason I gave her a 4 was because of the Gore, which was actually the only one I saw this movie to the end because and to see how they are all killed. (No, I'm serious)
