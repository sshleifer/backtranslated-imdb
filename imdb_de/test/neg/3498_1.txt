This movie was offensively PC, predictable and clich√©d. I can not imagine a film that better illustrates the short-sighted, narcissistic preaching of today's Hollywood. If you have not seen it yet, you should not take a look at it. If you have, show some courage and tell people how horrible it really is. My wife, even a minority, was hurt by the film's inherent and infinite racist message. This film has nothing to do with the real world and can add little or nothing to the discussion about racism in this country. Instead, it is a cheap, sensational crap, promoted as a deeper and challenging thought. In what bubble do you have to live to believe that this is impressive at all?
