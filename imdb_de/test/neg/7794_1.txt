Do the authors who conjure up this kind of "comedy" have such an empty life that they have to embody it in tragic shows like this one? Why is the talented and gorgeous Busy Phillips under this trash? I can not stand the Hispanic girl, whose accent sounds very unreal and annoying, like the other African-American girl with the shrill voice. The jokes are often stupid, the Jew screams a lot and the show goes nowhere, a certain episode in which the soldier was looking for love was just awful. <br /> <br /> I do not think there would be so many in a love bureau and only in an office husband? Of course, all women are in tight-fitting tops and tons of make-up to offset their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> I actually found Holly funny in her older shows and I've always admired Busy, but this show is stupid, empty and had nothing to offer.
