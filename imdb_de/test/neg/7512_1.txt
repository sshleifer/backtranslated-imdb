If you like me to see this in a history class or something like that at your school, try to convince your teacher to see something different. Believe me, everything is better than this movie. it's slow, confusing, boring, poorly built, bloody, grubby, do I have to move on? The message is good, but I have seen that they have been better treated in some other films. The spectacle is not even good. This movie is even more cumbersome because it starts as witty (but not intense) because of its surreal story, when it becomes uncomfortable in the end. <br /> <br /> I honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed. Why would anyone want to watch a girl describe a threesome for 10 minutes, seeing her jam for 20 minutes, listening to a hippie, showing sheep, experiencing a kind of rape, and eating the female lead by her husband? <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie deserves nothing more than a 1/10. And if you are not satisfied with my preview, I'm frankly an open-minded guy and I like movies that symbolize through imagery, but this movie was just awful. Excuse me to avoid this movie.
