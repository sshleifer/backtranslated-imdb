A pretty bad PRC Cheapie that I rarely bother again, and it's no wonder - it's slow and creaky and boring like a butter knife. Crazy Doctor George Zucco is back and turns a rotten farmhand in overalls (Glenn Strange) into a wolf man. Unfortunately, the makeup is practically non-existent and consists mostly of a beard and small fangs. If Zucco and Strange were not present with the cute Anne Nagel, this would be totally unsurpassable. Strange, who would play Frankenstein's monster for Universe in two years, makes a Lenny impression of "Of Mice and Men," it seems. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
