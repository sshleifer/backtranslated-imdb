Although I Scream is advertised as one of the most candid Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice Cream, it's more of a caricature of sincerity. Cream seller in a West Anatolian city, where he succeeds in using the same marketing methods of the big ice cream companies. He dreams of dancing in his TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis and dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up next to his gigantic wife with a big erection that makes sex with him for no apparent reason for six years. Is it because he is unsuccessful in his job? Apparently, because he says he used to sell better when there was no pressure on the ice factories. But he says that; We do not really like him so much: he still sells well, he travels through the surrounding villages, while his apprentice stays in the shop selling ice cream to the townspeople. Ali accuses large companies of using sweeteners and dyes while using real "Sahlep" (powdered roots of mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorcycle with a bank loan to be a traveling salesman and passes on ads to a local television station, which itself broadcasts the news bulletin in local dialect. His wife does not love his business, they always argue, and Ali threatens her to do very bad things in a moment of frenzy. <br /> <br /> On a very successful day, his lousy bicycle is being stolen by the city's naughty boys. In search of his stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, blames big business for the theft, but of course nobody takes it seriously. Annoyed at his wife's complaining, Ali goes to a tavern and gets drunk. One of his friends at his table, a would-be socialist of the city, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism, and without any real connection he jumps to the topic of global freezing. Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and stops him. An old neighbor takes him for a night walk and advises him about life. According to him, Ali can even sell hot Sahlep drink when the world is facing global frost. When he returns home, we suddenly see that his wife understood his value, treated him like a hero, and praised his manhood. In the meantime, the thieving boys were sick of eating too much ice cream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali's bike. Ali forgives them and there comes the happy end. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may look promising in a sense, storytelling makes this movie insincere and cheesy. First, the director does not make much effort to tell the story visually. everything is based on dialogues. And the dialogues never stop showing us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's problems do not convince because we do not see it, we only understand it from his words. The director markets his film as a sincere fight by Ali against large ice factories, but the film does not contain anything about big companies. We do not see their pressure enough. The film smiles at Ali because he believes big companies are behind the theft. And when his motorcycle is found, it solves every problem: Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. No real criticism of globalism. <br /> <br /> Second, the film is cheesy because of the coarse humor. Maybe people in this part of Turkey curse so much and do so many vulgar jokes in everyday life, but vulgar language and raw humor are not enough to make a movie funny. I may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and "smart", but they are not smart jokes at all, they are just cheesy. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe Americans like the oriental version of the American pie style. However, American Pie never claimed to be a candidate for the Oscars or to have a political message! If you think you can laugh, if you just see the big erection of a man in his shorts (and we had to endure that joke twice!) Or an old villager who says "f ** k you", then this movie becomes maybe be funny.
