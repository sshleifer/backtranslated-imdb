After reading the reviews, I'm so relieved that I'm not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie! I'm a huge Nicholas Sparks fan. I've read ALL of his books, most of them more than once. Of course I loved the notebook and the walk to remember ... I have not seen any news in a bottle or at night in Rodanthe, so I can not comment ... <br /> <br /> But I did See love John last weekend and I was terribly upset! The movie was not good at all! If you looked at the movie alone and did not think about the book, it was still a horrible movie. I did not get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that I have from other films I've enjoyed, especially The Notebook. I smiled and laughed and cried and was worried and scared ... never! From the beginning I could only find out how they changed everything! The only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named John who is in the military, and a girl named Savannah who is not the other part that went along with the book. Everything else was totally !!!! Above all, in this book was Allen Tim's little brother, NOT his son! WHY you had to change that, I do not understand. It made much more sense, as the book went, when Tim was just a bit older than Savannah and they both grew up together and Allen was Savannah's inspiration for working with horses and autistic children in the movie .... ugh. .. And in the book they spent much more time together than just the first 2 weeks and then the 1 night ... why did they forget those times? I could go on and on and on, but then I would run out of space! So if you're a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, do not waste your time or money on this movie ... just read the book again ... because it's awful and nothing like the book!
