I was very disappointed in this movie. Twice I was forced to leave because parts of the film were so demoralizing and depressing. The film has elements that allude to all the blurry things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, group warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this film was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> And Richard Dutcher is at a great disadvantage to the LDS Church, as he views the missionary attitude, the commitment, the spirituality and the obedience as unfocused and too weak /> <br /> My biggest objection to this Film was, however, that it is just the opposite of a feel-good movie. <br /> <br /> Dutchers Gods Army One was okay. His Brigham City was pretty good. This film in terms of casting, acting and drama was his best. But in terms of inspiration or survey, it was as horrible as it could be. In fact, this movie has so demoralized me that I'm sorry I left. I lost interest in helping Dutcher buy tickets in an LDS thematic film.
