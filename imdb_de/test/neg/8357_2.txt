I'm writing this review simply because I'm a big fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and was appalled by the movie. <br /> <br /> I believe that if you had not read the book, you would have done so without losing the movie, as it did not provide a real backstory to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences in the summer camp, her first therapists (the film actually gives the impression that she was never in therapy until Dr. Sterling) ...). If you had read the book, you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place. and the experiences she has made along the way. The movie, however, started at Harvard and literally threw the audience into what was going on without real explanation. <br /> <br /> Events That Were Important in the Book (Like Wurtzel's Miscarriage, Her Summer) In Dallas, her suicide attempt worked while she was on Prozac from the movie. <br /> <br /> Again, this is pedantic, but Wurtzel has not lost her virginity to Noah. The suicide attempt shown in Sterling was completely different from the book. First, it overdosed Mellaril, in contrast to the para-suicidal gesture shown in the film. All in all, I would say if you read the book and enjoyed / identified it so do not watch the movie. Instead, read "More, Now, Again" (by the same author). Or look at Girl, Interrupted. <br /> <br /> The only redeemer was the performance of Anne Heche, whom I believe to be Dr. Sterling has portrayed very well. Christina Ricci was also good, although her performance seemed a bit ... stilted. Jessica Lange made for a pleasing television, but looked exactly the opposite of Wurtzels mother, which is described in the book. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Do not bother.
