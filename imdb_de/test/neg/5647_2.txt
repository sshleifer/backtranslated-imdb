A pretty dreadful movie, I am amazed that Derek Jacobi and Vanessa Redgrave agreed, it's like an overlong episode from a poor TV show. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake must be Vinnie Jones, he just can not act, whoever had the idea of ​​using him as a leading man wants his head examined if he does not make his own money is in the project? He should play thugs, look threatening and NOT talk! <br /> <br /> Even in Dickens's day, there was central heating as there were three large radiators behind his desk. No wonder they gave it away for free with a newspaper because nobody would pay to see it.
