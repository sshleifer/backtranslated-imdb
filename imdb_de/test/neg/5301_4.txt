I really liked Get Shorty, but this movie was completely disappointing as a sequel. Travolta in no way resembles the Chili Palmer of Get Shorty. He only made this appearance half-hearted, as he has done in all his recent films. He is absolutely not smooth or has the mobster presence about him, which somehow makes you root for him throughout the movie. It just seems like Travolta rolled out of bed and decided he was good for acting in this movie. The plot was just not exciting or smart, there were really no highlights. The only thing that resembled the conversation was watching Christina Millian and The Rock was funny. But anyway, long story short, this movie was garbage and I had to force myself to just come through.
