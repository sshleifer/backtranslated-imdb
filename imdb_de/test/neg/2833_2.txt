That was not a good movie. Badly scripted and acted - the concept was not new, the impact was poor and no showcase for Arnold Vosloo, who is really a half decent actor. I watched it in protest, just remembering to see it at the very end - it's so memorable. Acting seemed to consist of a series of looks and glances that lacked any sincerity. I had always expected that to actually start, and soon I just hoped it would be done. As far as the medical aspects are concerned - I did not expect a real version of ER events, but that was just weird - I'm a doctor, so I know what I'm getting at - and the operational parts were just stupid wasting your valuable ones Time - unless you have absolutely nothing else to do - go out, call a friend who has long since disappeared, watch the paint dry, arrange your sock, do a housework. AVOID at your own risk.
