When I saw this series for the first time, I had the impression that the characters were charming and witty, especially Lorelai and Rory were funny and intelligent conversationalists, if a bit too talkative. After some time, my opinion changed. <br /> <br /> The main characters slowly showed themselves as selfish, self-possessed narcissists, the tiny wounds treating their pride as the worst insults in their eyes existence. For example, Rory did not talk to her mother for months if Lorelai did not consult her about her impulsive marriage while Lorelai Luke took off because he just needed a little time to adapt to his new life circumstances. These people are shallow and see themselves as the center of the universe, where everyone else should behave exactly as their own rigid rules do, and if they do not, they will hold against them for eternity. They do not want to see the problems of other people and treat the smallest problem as the most serious offense. Most characters do not seem to have the capacity to behave as adults. They think they should do what they want and everyone else is damned. <br /> <br /> The series is based on characters. So when the main characters became so unlikely, it was impossible to see the show. I still have the rest of the series, but I doubt I'll ever finish it. I will also consider with the utmost mistrust anyone who rates the show and its terrible characters - they must be as horrible as Lorelai et al.
