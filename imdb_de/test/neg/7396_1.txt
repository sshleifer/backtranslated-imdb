The film is televised while I write. <br /> <br /> I just forgot how horrible an experience I saw in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the film is flawed. The fact that intelligent Europeans and Americans stranded in the desert forget all ideas of morality and civilization within a few days is ridiculous. The madness of Lord of the Flies was longer in preparation. <br /> <br /> Details that are annoying are plentiful. One is the only god-like African character who miraculously survives the terrible climate and has been doing so for ages without losing his mind, and he also appears to have no supply problems. Ridiculous. Also the rescue effort of the tour guide, an Indiana Jones similar, whose rescue attempt ends in a 5-minute walk from the hut in tragedy and death. Then there is the choice of Lear imposed on the group by a guru-like joke of an artist. He reminded me of my hippie high school art teacher. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, however, is Levring's choice of Lear. Obviously, an intellectual mind. How this would ever become a pass-time, I never realize. <br /> <br /> There are only a few positive things. It's a beautiful movie, but that's never important. <br /> <br /> Intellectuality at high school. Funny for the sake of madness. It's a complete waste of time, unless you want to beat up unnecessary art films.
