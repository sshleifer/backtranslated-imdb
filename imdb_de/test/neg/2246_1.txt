Hurray for spelling mistakes! After reading and thinking about my reviews, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this movie is an absolute rubbish. This movie lost her as one of those rare Tarantino fans. I wish he had been made on nitrate film, and all the copies were piled neatly under a chain-smoking Tarantino fanboy. The literally unnecessary violence, the storylines, Tarantino's Table-Itis-Sans drama, and the development of absent characters made this an extremely painful, glorified montage. <br /> <br /> What spectacles were there? And how much of that was just because I was too busy reading the subtitles? I look at my share of Fansubbed anime and praise the attempt for authenticity, but that was overkill for an English-language movie. In the face of blatant historical inadequacies, constant reading killed the plot there. <br /> <br /> Why pay money for a narrator who has no relation to the characters, actions, motives, scenes or other elements in the film? If the film needs this kind of manual explanation, all the dirt is anticipated. Historical Research - while littered with interesting facts, he used the right costumes and props for the soldiers, this film the truth beyond belief in historical fiction. Kudos to Mata Hari, although it was a bit of a prelude to use. Mata Hari was executed by a firing squad and was not suffocated in an isolated room. This destroyed every feeling the reference might have. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mention more than half a dozen homage to other artists in the first 15 minutes. In view of the audience, all these and other clues were lost to many who would watch this movie and all who would enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I am confused about his decision as to when to start a scene, finish it and what needs to be recorded. Why did it take nearly 20 minutes to build testosterone in an action movie-funded movie? <br /> <br /> What I take for the message was banal. The idea of ​​rats and how we react to a primeval nature against them, and "who is the rat?" were at best cliché, but were not realized in the worst case. The mention of American camps for the Japanese and German Americans would have legitimized this question of moral superiority. Literally every character in the film who gets a talking role was captured in her own legend. Is this the world where Tarantino lives? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not pay to see this. I regret that I took the trouble to even look at it, even with well-intentioned hosts. There was a rich base of ideas that needed to be developed, but none was realized.
