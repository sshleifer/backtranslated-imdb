The "storyline" of this film contains some holes through which you could drive a massive truck, but I think that's not always a top priority in horror. Two older sisters in rural England have kept their brother in the basement for over 30 years. Now he was able to flee and began a murder rush, which focused on the soldiers stationed nearby. "We just thought we were the best for him," they keep repeating and ?? strange? All officers of the army love these women and do not doubt their sincerity, though five of their men died. I do not know if I should find the revelation exciting in the end? or boring! In a way, this movie reminded me of 'Arsenic and Old Lace'. In this black comedy classic, two half-crazy siblings mother their stupid, younger brother, but they kill there. The old ladies in "The Beast in the Cellar" are by no means less crazy. The "horror" in this movie of the early 70's is very amateurish and cheap, but there are some nice attempts to build up the suspense. However, too many old ladies talk about the good old days, and this is rarely something in a horror movie with such an appealing title. One of the sisters plays Flora Robson, who is recognized by classic movie fans. She gave the picture to the Queen of England, the legendary Errol Flynn Swashbuckler movie, the Sea Hawk.
