The first time I saw this movie, I was ten years old. I thought it was bad back then, and at that age I did not have any cinematic taste. I saw this movie on Cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why I hated the movie at all. Madonna's character Nikki is annoying and obnoxious. There is no way the main character falls in love with her. The jokes were hackneyed and the dialogue was worse than a TV. Soap opera!! I'm glad I did not see or rent this movie in the theater. I feel bad for my parents, who had to endure to see it with me! Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot.
