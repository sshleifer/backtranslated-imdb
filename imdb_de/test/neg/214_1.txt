This movie is sooooo bad that I was forced to create an IMDb account just to warn others about signing up to either praise or beat them, but nobody was ever so worthy. Until now! <br /> <br /> I'm a big Matt Dillon fan. All I could ask in this movie is "How did Dillon choose this script?" Really. I mean, there are holes bigger than Vredefort. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's a modern Heist movie, not a movie from the seventies. For a loud scream even a child knows that armored trucks have GPS and this sorting has. lets you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever, but I will not do it. Believe me when I say that. Save time and give it a jump. <br /> <br /> Sorry Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie is shitty.
