This crazy Dram adaptation soullessly rifles through the storyline of Dickens's wonderful book, replacing the emotional impact with hurried transitions and any outposts through drawings. It is not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is of course so low, but you must question the point if you do not do so until there is no time or money to do it. Michael Hordern's Scrooge is initially too gentle, which loses strength to his transformation, and this is not supported by a lack of response from him as he observes the visions. The other actors range from acceptable (Clive Merrison, Paul Copley), to non-committal (Bernard Lee), to the appearance of forgetting their lines (John Le Mesurier). To be honest, it does not even score with effort.
