The most impressive thing about 'Anemic Cinema' is the title: an anagram that is almost a palindrome as well. Unfortunately, this works only in American English, as in the UK "Anemic" is written differently. <br /> <br /> I have always found the diligent Man Ray and his artistic endeavors extremely presumptuous, and I have never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his rayographers (whom he invented by accident and who are only direct-contact photo prints), he seems to be the only real contributor to the culture that he was the first photographer to portray female nudity in a way that more as art was accepted as a porn. But surely this had to happen sometime, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story of the Emperor's new clothes. In the early 1960s, the second season of "The Twilight Zone" opened each episode with a splash of concentric circles in black and white. In 'Anemic Cinema' there is a similar picture. I wonder if 'Twilight Zone' borrowed it from this movie. The main difference is that the rotating image here is a black and white spiral. If there ever was a movie that deserves to be called a spiral, it is this one. Throughout Anemic Cinema, (?) Recordings are made of a spinning disc with words (in French) moving in a spiral. The effect is dizzy and the lyrics - about incest and eskimos - are almost dada in their insignificance. I laughed about a clever sexual pun. <br /> <br /> The Emperor is naked, people, and this movie is just 2 out of 10. Au suivant!
