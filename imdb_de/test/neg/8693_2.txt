Nice try to bring Shakespeare's language to life in a post-apocalyptic environment, but the end result is terrible. The futuristic Liverpool does not convince. The budget was obviously not very big, but the production designer could have been a bit more creative. Alex Cox has made some good films, eg. Repo Man and Highway Patrol Man, but I really do not know what he was thinking. Only one opinion.
