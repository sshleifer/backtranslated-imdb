It's almost embarrassing to say that I even saw this movie. I mean, it does not take much to make a good zombie movie, except for good special effects, lots of blood and blood, some scary moments and a good plot. Does House of the Dead 2 do any of these things right? No, not one. Of course it's not as bad as its predecessor, Uwe Bowle, and that's the only thing about this movie that scares me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is notorious, with lines like "What do you do professionally?" "I kill zombies" and "I was never a disc jockey, I was a soldier." The special effects are embarrassing even for a film produced for television. I mean, the zombies all look like they have bloody lips going up on crack. The military base in this film is a parking garage with a desk and an open gated room. This movie is so cheap that he could not even get additional dressing rooms. It actually seems that the entire film was shot in a middle school. <br /> <br /> Why is it that all female soldiers in this film are models? And why is everyone in this movie so unaware of what's going on, that they just stand around and get killed by the zombies? A guy even tries to give food to the zombie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie makes even the worst scifi channel movies fantastic.
