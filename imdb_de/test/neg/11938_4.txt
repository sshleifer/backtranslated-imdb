I really wanted to love this movie, and not just because Aaron Eckhart was involved. I thought the premise was cool because I like movies and shows that are about chefs. The cinematography was good, but apart from being all about chefs, everything else is just a clich√©. Oh, and little Miss Sunshine was very irritating in this movie, though Abigail Breslin seems a bit irritating in every movie she's in. There are some decent cooking flashes, but the food did not matter much in the movie, as I expected, which was a big disappointment to me. This film had a good potential, the cast was great, but they had very little to do. I like a good carefree romantic comedy, but that was just boring. And longer than it should have felt much longer than it is. It's not a horrible movie, you will not miss anything if you do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
