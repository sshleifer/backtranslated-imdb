OK ... before I even begin with the more or less constructive criticism of the film, I would like to say a few words that come from the heart ... THIS FILM SUCKS !!!! DO NOT GO TO SEE IF YOU DO NOT REALLY VISIT LIKE SWEATY BOY BATHS AND WOOD MOVING, NO PLOT STORIES. There is no action. The director tried to puzzle when the feeling just was not there. 2. The whole thing looks like a big, one-and-a-half-hour promotion for some kind of goth-but-still-like-BSB band ... All the boys in the school have perfect abdominals, no fat or ugly young people. .. there is no good-looking girl in the movie, not one. The main character is either wet in the pool or sweaty in his bed ... the poor guy. Must be terrible to go on a date that sweats so much. 3. Can these guys do something good with their powers? All the best? For example, extinguish the fire in this old barn or help his friend who got into the accident instead of just running around and witnessing each other. 4. Wooden play The main character has only two facial expressions. Expression number one: sad. Expression number two: Trying to look seductive, but still looks sad ... In this boy band there are 4 types: The main character, his best friend who got into the accident, the blonde and the fourth ... what was the name of the fourth I think he only spoke twice during the entire movie: once at the beginning (he said that jumping off the cliff with "the power" would not kill them) and for the second time at the end when he and the blonde could have lost the girl .. the movie could have been shot without him and nobody would notice ... Anyway, my verdict: 1 is the perfect score for this movie. Guys - do not go to see it. There is very little action, no tension, no hot girls. Girls - at least the actors look good ... What I would advise you to do is get a soundtrack from this movie - that's the only thing I liked.
