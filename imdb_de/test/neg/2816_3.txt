While watching this movie, I never thought I would defend it. It is honest enough from the beginning not to have much of a conspiracy. There are no real characters to hold on to except the killer. Some of the acting may be better, but most of them are capable. <br /> <br /> I know, three out of ten are not outstanding, but there are reviews that say they were badly shot and were completely useless. I think it's a goal to do what It should be pretty good. The lighting is at times minimal, more natural than most viewers, but it looks like a camcorder snuff movie. In fact, the quality is sometimes too high to live up to, but no one would make it through the few minutes of camerawork that are really so bad. <br /> <br /> It's not terribly scary, but it's sometimes annoying. There are one or two characters that do not seem credible at all, and the soundtrack is sometimes exhausting, but overall it was cleaner than many camcorder movies.
