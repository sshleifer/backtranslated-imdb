Yeeee-Haa! <br /> <br /> I've seen that most American movies are disguised cowboy movies; That Hollywood is so in love, it's just a really original creation that reinvents the cowboy myth over and over again. I'm not sure I'll buy this argument completely, but Slipstream is proof of the thesis. It's a cowboy movie with airplanes. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's better than that. It's a spaghetti western with planes! Replace the planes with horses, make the android a priest, and this film is not to be distinguished from a dozen Seventeen Spanish-American "half-shooter" shoot-em-ups. The movie is not as bad as I think of it the reviews I read here, but he was certainly not good.
