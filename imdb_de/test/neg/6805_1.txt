For anyone who wants to know something about the true Diane Arbus or appreciates psychological truthfulness, this movie is miserable. Arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless and troubled person, but this film shows her as completely self-responsible and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment. Kidman portrays her as weak and vague while she was someone who upset people with her charisma. The totally fictional relationship that is central to the film is unbelievable, and Robert Downey is really annoyed at his grinning portrayal of someone who simply seems superior to the rest of the world simply because of his suffering. The film reveals this encounter as the source of Arbus' interest in "freaks," a truly banal explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the twentieth century. For me, it is a mystery why people with talent and intelligence have decided to engage in any way with this film.
