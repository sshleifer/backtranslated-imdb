I rented this DVD because I'm a big sci-fi fan, but this thing (I will not call it a movie because it was obviously filmed very quickly on video) seemed like they came up with it. I'm still not sure what it was about. There are these people dressed in weird S & M outfits, and I think they are from another planet. It does not make much sense in this low-budget, low-budget movie. If it was her first movie, I'd cut her a little loose, but I think it's like her fifth movie and it's really REALLY bad. This director did not even have to work on such a horrible movie. Do not waste your time or money on this DVD, please do not. It's not even worth the 0.99 cents that I paid to rent the DVD. I'll tell them the DVD was messed up to get my money back. I do not believe in valuing anything bad, but I have to be here. My advice to all who are involved in this sinking ship - please choose a different profession. How can you do such a lazy movie? I would give these negative stars, if possible, it's so terrible.
