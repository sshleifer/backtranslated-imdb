This movie is too stupid for words. Even if you think it filmmaking a filmmaking, if you think it's a perfect camp, even if you waste your time seeing it - you've seen it a hundred times. But maybe you're a big fan of girls with high screeching voices, you still love Barbie and Ken and you can stand this typical 80s electric guitar background noise ... well, then you have a chance.
