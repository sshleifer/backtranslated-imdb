OK, I was on this website before I saw this movie, I read the comments and got pumped up because they were all pretty good for a B-movie. I looked at him and was totally disappointed. The main characters, who as a loner got ripped out of the Mid-West Act, had a stomachache and did not even bring me to the two policemen. I mean, there's a damn door right there in sight, check it out! The plot was completely predictable, the editing was rather limited, I swear that the editor even fell asleep at the end of the movie and the direction was clouded by bad movies. Please do not get me wrong, I love B-flicks, some are really good. <br /> <br /> Would you like to see a good B-rated movie? <br /> <br /> Dave recommends <br /> <br /> "high voltage" <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
