1 hour and 40 minutes of talking - boring speech, more talk and more. It's hard for me to understand how an actress like Anne Parillaud, who excels at Femme Fatale, agrees to such a crap! Incredible. If you need a nightcap, this movie might help, though I would prefer classical music. Unfortunately I just found out that I have to write 10 lines for my comment to appear - that's almost unbelievable! Brief and concise one or two sentence comments that express the core of a film are not enough. Gosh, people. I have made it my mission not to waste time with unnecessary words - as is the case in this film. wolfgang
