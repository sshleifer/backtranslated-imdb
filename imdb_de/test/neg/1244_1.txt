What in the world! This movie theater would have been suitable for the Lifetime Network. Michael Imperoli is a good actor, but I think his portrayal as a "stu" came up short. The Mondays were unbearable and too many. The sideline, where are you? Who made the casting should be partially to blame. The cinematography was useless. A gambling story with a feeling after school. Stories of this kind should be left to the world for Oliver Stone. It would still be shit, but at least it would be fun to watch. It was an attempt that lost its wheels before the race even started. Mario Andretti from the 1982 Indy 500 came to my mind.
