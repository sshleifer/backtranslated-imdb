MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is an OK time murderer. It has a uniformly attractive cast, the action is rarely boring. There are many murders. And the production values ​​are not bad. In the end, however, it runs like a normal TV episode from the 70s, was thrown into the nudity. The film is the end product of an "author" trying to make a purely commercial film. There is little depth here and the movie spends too much time on chases and action scenes. Apart from the scene with the old man on the beach, MMBM is almost free of fear, tension or fear. The director has little understanding of the horror genre. <br /> <br /> It is easy to see, even if it does not leave a lasting impression.
