For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adjustment could be good. But only for her. This is a disjointed "Cliff Notes" version of Mansfield Park, and if you have not seen any other version or read the books, that would be scratching your head. <br /> <br /> Why was it so hard to make a good adaptation of this book? It took such liberties in the 1990s that it hardly seemed to be the same book - the mindset was completely modern and decent. <br /> <br /> Here's Billie Piper, who looks like a pretty country guy. She has a charming personality that is developing well - but she has painted blonde hair, with black eyebrows and - through much of the image - dark brown roots. So much for untouched cousin. It's incredibly distracting, and the rest of the cast is in the greasy hair, crumpled clothing genres that show a real disrespect for the accuracy of the period. <br /> <br /> One thing is good here - Haley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford of all versions. She is perfect, flirting, without being modern or suggestive, funky and totally devoid of any moral or ethical compass. Henry is really good enough to be a slight temptation for our heroine. Jemma Redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in the story and manages to make her really boring right up to her last scene - also very useful. This is just a production that has really missed the mark, an absolute low for Austen fans. <br /> <br /> The only viable version is the one with weird duck (perfect for the reel) Sylvestra La Touzel (despite the very gay Henry Crawford - he's just ridiculous.
