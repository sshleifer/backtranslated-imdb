This film had very little good, the special effects and the drama were definitely terrible. But it was a movie made on a low budget, so you do not expect much from it, it has a few laughs (I doubt they're intended :)). The scene where the old woman bends down and touches the crap that was on the floor, he puts it to the nose and goes to CHUPACABRA! in a really stupid, scratchy voice was priceless. All in all, if you have nothing else to see and just laugh at a really crappy movie trying to win the Blair Witch Project, grab something else and do not bother.
