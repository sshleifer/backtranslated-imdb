Critics are a strange kind of people. Some of them are ordinary people like you and me. Some of them are not. When critics say Subconscius Cruelty is beautiful, I wonder where they grew up. What if you are filming a field, some clouds or a tree with an old camera, if you can not do it in style and capture the mood of the environment? Karim Hussain can not be sure. I've seen kids make better shots than Karim succeeds in subconscius cruelty. But that's not the worst part. The worst thing is the whole recording, I refuse to call film a film, just a bad excuse to portray nudity and extreme torture, rape of both sexes, masturbation, cum, pissing, cannibalism, child murder and much more. I love Gore / Splatter and I love horror. This is not one of the two. This is total crap and if my comments lead to only one person skipping Subconscius Cruelty, it was worth it. Always remember that your life will not last forever. Do not waste two hours of valuable time with Subconscius Cruelty. You were warned.
