The film got really tense when a poor boy was attracted to a pack of wild dogs. After a tense chase, he is rescued by the said grandfather with a magic whip. <br /> <br /> We are then introduced to a series of annoying house mates, including a tart, who is always half dressed. During this phase, the movie increases the tension with strange "plinky" plinky background sounds that had me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> I stopped for a while, but when I looked back at the screen where strange creature grunts and kills things. Advice, if you're ever caught by a jerk in your house - get yourself some cardboard boxes and a tray. <br /> <br /> Although we skipped half the movie because it was completely uninteresting or memorable, we now have the amazing conclusion that the last surviving creature is fighting a "Whip Duel" with Grandpa and his magic whip. I'm not saying what's going on here, but I can say that the whip fight is full of suspense, with aerial combat, split-level fighting and all sorts of drama. I'm going to push this movie through the movie now I do not like the door of a neighbor.
