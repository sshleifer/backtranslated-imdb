The producers Golan and Globe would have been ashamed to publish this garbage in public. I know that sounds clich√©, but by comparison the first "Hercules" from 1983 seems like a mature and exciting epic! This "sequel" is feeble-minded, cheap, insoluble, childish, false, incompetent, and BADLY ACTED. A milestone in the bad cinema and one of the few, few films I have seen that really deserve the lowest rating: no stars!
