As I had just completed the book 'Dalloway' by Virginia Woolf, I was excited to see that it was in one of the movie channels last weekend. What I saw, however, is a movie that is boring, incomprehensible and nonsensical. One can not completely blame the film, it has tried as best it can with the material it had, but if the starting point is Virginia Woolf, it is almost exclusively in the conscience conscience with longer periods of internalization and less written actual dialogue one would certainly think that no film should be made of it, just because it can be made of a film. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the title character, deserves no blame for the failure of this film and none of the other actors. It's just a movie that could not be understood from the story Woolfe wrote and should not even be attempted. Do not look at the movie, read the book. <br /> <br /> - Shelly
