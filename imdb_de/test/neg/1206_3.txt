Do not try to look for logic. There is nothing. But on the other hand, there are MANY really great movies that lack logic, so why bother? <br /> <br /> I like this movie as well as not. I like it because the action sequences in the air are really great and you can see a lot of dogfighting. I also like the F-16, which is a very cool aircraft. <br /> <br /> But there are just too many mistakes to really enjoy myself. I think it's not fair to wish for some continuity, because it's hard to make a really good fighter film - but I also think there should be some sense in flying from California to the F-16 Middle East without air refueling? I would like to see it.
