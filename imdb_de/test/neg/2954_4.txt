The most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time that Garbo was speaking in a movie. Aside from this "milestone" (if you want to call it that), this is a movie that does not go beyond the creaking melodrama, with Garbo trying hard not to fall asleep Garbo returns to her father after 15 years abroad. Her father, captain on a barge, is happy to see her, even if she is a little reserved. She soon falls in love with a gray sailor who also realizes that something, a barrier, if you will, holds her back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two guys do not like each other very much and come soon When it comes to Garbo, when she obscures the situation by revealing her big secret, which is no surprise to us when watching the video box have read (damn it MGM !!) She wags her arms and is crushed quickly. The two male leads are fine. The best performance probably comes from the classic dumb actress Marie Dressler, who plays the drunken captain's drunk friend. What a performance! It is a pity that the slogan "Dressler Talks!" Could not read.
