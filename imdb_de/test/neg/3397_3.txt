I have read many comments on how this film fits the book. I do not think any of them actually read it. Edgar Rice wrote about a dangerous African jungle and monkeys were killers and hunters. We know it differently now and this movie shows Apes in a more modern view. I've never seen a Tarzan movie that even comes close to Edgar's vision. Maybe Hollywood one day with trusting, talented and respected authors to tell the story. So if you never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny look at wild animals, maybe a good cry, watch the movie. I hope John Carter from Mars gets more respect than Tarzan. We miss you, Edgar!
