There I am sitting at home in the morning, suddenly my brother turns the seemingly stupidest film I have ever seen. Considering that it was the 70's and special effects were not to be pointed, this movie was almost the definition of crap. The stupid monsters, the stupid story and the stupid attitude made this movie the worst I've ever seen. So bad that I did not even finish it, I made it to a certain point and then left to see how long I could go without putting a rope around my neck and hanging myself up. (I'm just joking haha) WONDERFILM
