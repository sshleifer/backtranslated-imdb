What you need In the run-up to "What You Need," every episode since "The Lonely" has been a winner in some ways. This episode is the first major failure since 'Escape Clause'. The Serling script is again based on the material of another, a short story by Lewis Padgett. As with "And when the sky was opened," Serling changed the contents considerably, removing a scientist and his machine, and employing an elderly peddler. <br /> <br /> "What You Need" works best when it's cute. The first half, in which the peddler supplies customers in a bar with objects that he will need in the near future, has a soft charm that may have worn off during an entire episode, but works well in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, the main thing it sets up is full of gaping holes. The minute that Steve Cochran appears as a two-bit racquet becomes the main focus of the episode. Cochran's part is a signed clich√©, and his flat performance underlines this mistake. His exploitation of the old peddler is boring and predictable, and the revelation that he's going to murder the old man is utterly unconvincing, making the whole slippery shoe scene look completely wrong. Ernest Truex is a good peddler who gives the character a magical, mysterious, but warm character, but he's not good enough to help the flickering script of inconsistencies. For example, we learn that the peddler's ability to provide people with what they need is based on the ability to look to the future. How exactly can he make such a pen, which magically selects the winning horses. It seems like it should be something outside of its power. Of course, for a man who can see the future, the hawker looks surprised as he awaits the thug in his apartment. There are many more holes that can be selected in "What You Need", but it's hardly worth it if the episode is so skinny that you can still see through it.
