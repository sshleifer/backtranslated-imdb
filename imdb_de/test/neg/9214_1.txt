The film asks you to be aware and conscientious. It also destroys everything and everything, claims the Bible, to be true. For people like me, the first episode was interesting and the second one was catastrophic. It was called "blasphemy" and if you are a believer. It is sad to hear that many people see it as a good continuation of the Bible. However, the film shows you many things and topics that can be interpreted as a cinematic version of the "revelation". Some of us believe that such things should not be abused. A good thing about the movie is that it strongly promotes ethical awareness and makes you think twice about your actions. The director just seems to forget that some people act that way just because they believe and love, as prescribed in the Bible.
