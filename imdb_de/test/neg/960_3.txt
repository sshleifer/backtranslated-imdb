I'm a fan of the original 50's and after about 20 minutes of this remake, I thought this would be as good as the original, but it was not. The motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. Two of the lovers in the film turn out to be brother and sister, excuse me while I get angry. The main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex, which makes no sense given the situation he's in right now. If the filmmakers wanted a sex scene, they should have put it before the main character in the movie earlier (Dexter played by Dennis Quaid found that he is about to die and is accused of committing a crime At the beginning of the movie, Dexter does not live the whole life, so he is not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan, I still think it makes more sense if the sex scene was either cut or had been in the movie and the One of the dumbest parts of the film involved a rifle fight, a few people were killed and a person was run over by a crowded carnival within fifteen meters, but NEVER IN THE CARNIVAL NOTES !! ! In the scene are the tar pits on which the film is built When you fall into the tar, you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds Not only is it hard to believe that things sink so fast into tar, but more importantly, who builds a university in tar pits. I would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is, but I do not want to include a spoiler in my post.
