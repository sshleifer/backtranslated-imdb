My mother did not let me see this movie in the second grade because she said it was too violent. Well, years later, and the only reason I remember this movie is because of my mother, I stayed awake and looked at him on PBS. Well, maybe the build-up after all those years has led to the big disappointment of this movie, but I found it lame. It did not age well, and that made the drama choppy, huge incredible holes in the script, but there are some cool scenes like car chases and a big fight. I will not stay up for this movie anymore.
