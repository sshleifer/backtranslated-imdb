I'm the guy who loves Hood movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season, from B class to Hollywood. but this movie was different. I'm not a hater and this movie was somehow enjoyable. but some pieces were just funny. Well, the acting was not that good, compared to the performance of Silkk The Shockers in Hot Boyz (pretty good) and Ice-T in the new Jack and SVU (great). In the scene in which Corrupt (Ice-T) wants to be a Jamaican guy, he says something and lights the fire, burning both Ice-T and the other guy. This kills the Jamaican, however, Ice-T is unharmed, very similar to Ice's other The movie Urban Menace (whose stars are both actors) was Snoop's character but is supernatural, but after that nothing is meant that Corrupt is like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) is stabbed first, he fights but then struggles normally and gets stabbed in the thigh - WITH OUT BLOOD. and when MJ admits to having killed a policeman because the policeman had beaten up, his friend Benny was weird, Benny was not featured in this movie and the scene is not in the movie. It's important to the fact that Corrupt wants to kill MJ but still scratches his head. Who Jody writes a letter to the figure of Miss Jones, in which she explains what happened to them after the words. She does not mention what happens. 2 other main characters MJ and Lisa. The film showed the horror and poverty of the ghetto, which plagued the lives of Latinos and Blacks widely, was a good part of the film, even though the project's clip was reused thousands of times. and the scene in which Miles kills his Latino brother by overthrowing his bike at full speed (without a helmet) and bumping into my Latino brother's car would have killed him. The film was similar to the movie Urban Menace and half of the actors were in both films and in the production team. It was OK. but i'm out of poverty, i love hoodies, but if you do not love them like me, do not look at them. The only thing that saved me from going out was, it reminded me of my first movie, made at $ 100, and my love of the genre. Nathaniel Purez
