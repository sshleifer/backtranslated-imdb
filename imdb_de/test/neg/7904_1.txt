This "movie" and I say that easily, is nothing but pure garbage. I'm sorry for the people who actually wasted their money watching this in the cinemas. I saw a screener of the movie from a friend and regretted it ever since. <br /> <br /> As a black woman, I am extremely embarrassed to have seen this. Even more, I am extremely appalled that people of other races might also have seen this and believe that they are generally black people. It's full of stereotypes against all nationalities and genders, terribly vulgar gross jokes and lame one-liners wiped out by well-known African-American comedians who should have known better after reading this script! I also have to mention the numerous rap and hip-hop singers / rappers populating the movie as if it were an overly long music video - they had absolutely no room in the movie. I think these were the "Jiving & Singing Minstrels?" DREADFUL. <br /> <br /> The "writers", producers and whoever had the stupidity to fund this "movie" should all be shot or locked up in a room and forced to cope with this crap for the rest of their lives consider. DO-NOT-WATCH-THIS-FILM !!! It is time wasted from your life that you can never come back again.
