No wonder so many young people suffer from attention deficit syndrome. It seems that stage (dance) productions today are all about how many cameras and camera angles can force a director / editor into a one-hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this service? Count them sometimes to do something different with this otherwise totally incomparable show. <br /> <br /> I tried to recognize some faces of some other dancers in the production. That was impossible. They did not seem to have faces, just blurs - it was just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's bare chest (beautiful shine!), The feet of Michael Flatley, and this patented Flatley look that came over the shoulder. Since he was executive producer of this cut-and-paste job, this was likely to happen. You do not have to wonder too much about who your target audience is. <br /> <br /> Riverdance was a much better production because they tried to present the show as you would see it from the audience, not the catwalk, the side wings or the floor nail perspective. If I'm not mistaken, I believe Sir Michael has withdrawn. Thank God for the little blessing.
