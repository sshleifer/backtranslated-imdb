The scientist Charles and his wife (or his assistant) Marissa receive some items and a skull from an old Indian cemetery. When cleaning a vase, they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious creature, the Skeleton Man. Then a military command under the command of Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) is looking for two groups of four soldiers each, who have disappeared in the jungle. They look at the Skeleton Man and shoot him while killing every soldier. Then the Skeleton Man goes into a power plant, and Captain Leary explodes in the plant that destroys the supernatural being. <br /> <br /> I bought "Skeleton Man" on DVD and expected a funny junk, but I found a terribly boring movie, annoying and pointless crap, with impulses and explosions. The fool story is completely disjointed and makes no sense, and the military is made up of fools who insist on shooting the supernatural skeleton man until they are completely slaughtered. Their leader is also the stupidest, with the destruction of a whole plant at the end, to destroy the supernatural rip-off of the alien warrior Predator. On DVD, it is possible to use the fast-forward button along the movie and reduce the suffering of the viewer. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Skeleton Man"
