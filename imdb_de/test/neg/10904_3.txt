Had he not bowed to a cliche, Mr. Shiban could have made a good movie from this story. It was just different enough to keep you interested, and for the same amount of time, energy, and money spent on that stinker, we might have had something good instead of wavering. <br /> <br /> wise, it's as good as you can really expect from a handheld camcorder, so it gets good grades there. It's really the script that's to blame because acting was not so bad, considering what the actors should work with. I thought the days were long gone when we saw someone If you're looking for a radio transceiver that you really want to serve, turn every button on the thing from one end to the other, hit it six or seven times, and then expect it to work. This story is ruined by a series of stupid moves of all characters except evil. It seems we're too shallow to catch all the action devices, so they're all fed a spoon to make sure we get them. <br /> <br /> I do not know you, but it does not work for me. My attention ends with the storylines and overdramatizations, not with the story. <br /> <br /> As I did not think so in the technical sense, Mr. Shiban should try it next time with just a proper script; then he could give us something worth seeing.
