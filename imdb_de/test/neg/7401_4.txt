I just saw the first part of it and came to the conclusion that I would not miss anything if I did not see the second episode. The cinematography was fine, but apart from that, the plot was as common and commonplace as any other war history. The actors and actresses play their characters without passion, and the make-up is really bad (Heiner Lauterbach with his white hair and Kai Wiesinger, as if some dyed white hair could give them more dignity and common sense). I mean, if you've seen more than two or three films about World War II (like most of us) then you would only bother to see a third or fourth, if that's new insights or twists in the plot promises. But Roland Suso Richter seems to be afraid of that, one can almost smell his fear of fulfilling the bourgeois and non-young expectations of the conservative ZDF TV station while watching this movie. Millions of euros were spent to perpetuate the boring and unimaginative German film. These millions of dollars could have been spent on three or four independent films, but no, let's give a director who makes a film that tells people that the war can be rationally explained. My advice: Read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut instead. They will tell you what war is like! Or give me a million euros and I make a better movie than this BS-charge! And one more thing: why are German films only nominated for the Oscars if the film deals with the Second World War or the Holocaust? Probably because this is the only thing that German filmmakers can do well. And that should make us think, right?
