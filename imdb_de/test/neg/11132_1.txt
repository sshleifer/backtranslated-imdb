Great concept, perfect characterizations and voices, but complete waste of time. A real shame, because if it were aiming higher, it probably would not have been the bomb that it was (is); too dependent on skatological humor, for starters. I am amazed at the comments of "educated" reviewers who refer to the "good science" behind this piece of Puerile Trash. Unlike "Finding Nemo", where (with a bit of suspicion of unbelief) attention to details was breathtaking and science was as good as the context allowed, "Osmosis Jones" was utter nonsense; Do not worry about science. Humor was aimed at eight-year-olds, but more appropriate for a few uncomplicated teenagers.
