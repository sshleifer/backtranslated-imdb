I have to say, I found this movie very disappointing. Yes, I know that Maltin gave 3 1/2, and others appreciate it very much. But the operatic sequences were terrible. I assume Jeannete MacDonald is an acquired taste. Yes, in the short sequences I've seen with Nelson Eddy, it's immensely preferable. But on your own ... God, I do not like the opera and despise the operetta, and it is fundamentally unbearable. At some point I had to hold my ears. Gable is just fine and Tracy is thrown away. The plot is annoying in the JM that Gable never said simply that she loves him and the opera. Why can not she do both? Instead, she suffers silently (or not) with her compromises. The side occupation is unmistakable. In addition to the Star Three and Jack Holt (and I suppose his mother), they are all background and memorable. The EQ sequence is the only thing that stores the movie. And only. Yes, it is quite spectacular and moving. But the "Oh God is great" seems very thoughtful. I prefer "In Old Chicago" for old time catastrophe spectacles. Save yourself this.
