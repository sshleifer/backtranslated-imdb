God, that was shit. You can not end a horror movie with a happy family. Yeash I was somehow ambivalent when I came to the last act. But my god. He did not have to kill the girl, she did not die, the spirit father appears with a cure (which does not make sense, since his mind would have been freed after the crush had killed all the evil werewolves). What a bunch of garbage. This is the worst horror movie I've seen in a long time and I've seen a lot of horror movies. This is a slap in the face for Landis and everyone else involved in American Werewolf in London. Blegh. I hope this ruined everyone's career, except Julie Delphy. And CGI: A little new and fancy in 1997, but today it just looks pale compared to London's ornate prosthetics / make-up work. Anyway, I'm done, I hope I scared some people. Get the original or howling instead. Or fails the repetition of American Idol. Just do not look at this mess.
