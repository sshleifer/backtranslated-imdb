Unless you want to be bored to death. I've never been a fan of Gus Van Sant and as part of the characters referred to by the earlier posters as a young generation, I was very disappointed and a little annoyed with the stereotypical portrayal of the characters in the film, especially because they were strung together Films pretty much suggesting to the audience members is that skateboarders should be socially rejected and blamed for crime. As a skater, I watch a lot of skate movies and filming during the skate scenes, which is obviously a big part of the storyline because the main actor being a skateboarder is terrible. This movie is riddled with ridiculous stereotypes, as the "Emo" soundtrack shows that only makes the myth of the media so much that all skateboarders are white rockers. Just a really bad movie.
