Some folkie friends recommended this, but as a film, it is really lacking in originality. I've found that the characters are not flattering clich√©s, and the storyline is predictable from the beginning. However, if you like traditional English / Appalachian ballads, your interest will last long enough to hear the next one. I also read that the soundtrack is in no way comparable to the music in the movie and professional musicians are responsible for the actors.
