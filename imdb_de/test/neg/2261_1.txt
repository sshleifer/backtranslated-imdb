Alexandra Ripley wrote a horrible sequel to Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece, which was published in the 1930s. Margaret Mitchell's heirs sold their rights and allowed Alexandra Ripley to write a piece of junk book that was even worse than the romance of Barbara Cortland. I was a big fan of Margaret Mitchell's book and the fake sequel to Alexandra Ripley was written to redeem money. <br /> <br /> Although I have always admired the acting talent of Joanne Kilmer and Timothy Dalton, this is a really horrible movie. The script is awful and full of clich√©s. Ann Margaret's cameo, since Belle Watling is so terrible that I wanted to beat her. <br /> <br /> The only worthwhile thing is Sean Bean, who offers a masterful bravura performance as a sexy, savage villain - Lord Fenton. Sean Bean's performance is similar to "The Man You Love To Hate" and is an insecure sex symbol. <br /> <br /> But Sean Bean is only in the first half of the movie, so you have to be tormented with one incredibly long 6-hour movie with an unbearably boring script. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie, unless you are a hardcore core fan of Sean Bean and just look at his wonderful performance.
