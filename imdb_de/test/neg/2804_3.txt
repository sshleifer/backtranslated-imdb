A young man who has never known his birth parents receives an old farm in a remote part of West Virginia after the death of his birth father. He visits his estate with a cross section of potential victims, including the comic relief Black Guy and a trendy lesbian couple. (Hmm, is there a thin dip? A guess.) Unfortunately, the party ends when the ghosts of the drifters killed and used as scarecrows by his evil great-grandfather come out of revenge. This movie starts well. An artful montage of photographs from the Depression and fake newspapers against a speech by the FDR - this is, I think, his first appearance in a killer scarecrow movie - creates the mood. I have some hopes for the film that have been partially realized. The story was usable enough. The setting was sufficiently bucolic. The photography was mostly in focus. The acting, although no big shake, was a bit above average for horror movies in this budget area. The film might have worked within the tight demands of the genre if scarecrows were scary. But they were not cheap. They were not scary at all. The better the monster, the better the movie. These scarecrows would not scare Dorothy, let alone Toto.
