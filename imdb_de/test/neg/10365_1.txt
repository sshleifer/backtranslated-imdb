This movie is a cheap movie trying to be a Stoner movie because the characters are looking for pot but none of them are smokers. Just a bunch of garbage. The Thomas Hayden Church should no longer primarily direct this film, which is a waste of film. The people who liked this movie gave good comments, but of all the people here, some are just lagging behind and watching no movies. They believe that every bad movie is good, that the actors suck and the movie sucks balls. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people will be upset because this movie is trying to make it look like the ultimate weed movie if it's just the worst weed movie I've ever seen. I hope people will stop the director from doing crap even that weed can not make this movie funny or entertaining.
