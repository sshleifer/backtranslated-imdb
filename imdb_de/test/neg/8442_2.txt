Let's see: What are the advantages of Piranha, Piranha? If you've never had anything to do with Venezuela, there are plenty of travel stories about Caracas and the landscape (and the jungle side), as well as the various indigenous peoples at work and in the game, as well as many indigenous peoples wildlife. If you like William Smith, he plays a little idiot (as he always has). <br /> <br /> And that's it. If it were not for William Smith, it could probably serve as a fundraiser for Save the Children or another organization benefiting the Third World. The fish of the title you see only at the opening balance. No mutant killerfish like Roger Corman's piranha. With the double fish in the title, you could say that there are twice as many monster fish chasing the characters, but unfortunately this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The story begins with coming to Venezuela with a photojournalist and her brother to make a story in one of the last untouched places in the world, but their motivation quickly changes in the search for diamonds, apparently are quite abundant. <br /> <br /> There is not much of a real story or danger in this movie. What could have been an exciting motorcycle race is clouded by the mass of scenery and wildlife shots that are inserted at runtime. There is not much more action until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (which probably depends on how long the movie would last without the entire travel guide). <br /> <br /> In my view, these are just the options. A movie can really be a bad movie, is boring or incredibly stupid. Piranha, Piranha, certainly qualifies for this former badge and is pretty close to the second one. The only reason why I do not rate it as "1" is that the added material is more interesting than the rest of the movie.
