Looking for something shocking? Okay, well ... the pictures are that. That's all. This film tries to create deep connections with the audience through various symbols and is ultimately annoying. I'm not sure if the director intended to really convey a profound message to his audience, or if he was just trying to scare them out with violence, sex and violence. I think it was probably the first one ... but in the failed attempt ... it just ended up as an artistic trash with lots of blood, some obnoxious characters and an over-reliance on religious symbolism. If you are looking for an independent film that criticizes criticism for its attempted use of metaphor ... you have it. If you are looking for a bloody movie that will make you uncomfortable and uncomfortable ... here you can ... If you are looking for a movie that will irritate you without end, because you find that the message in the end was stupid. .. the movie was stupid ... and you will never get those minutes of your life back ... that's certainly the movie for you!
