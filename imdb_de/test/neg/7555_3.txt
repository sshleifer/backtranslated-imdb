I've never seen a movie that frustrates me more than Lord Of The Dance. Frustrated, because it could be awesome. Frustrated because the dance was perhaps amazing. Frustrated because the women could have been beautiful. How should I know that ?! If your eyes focused on the area of ​​interest on the screen and focused on the spot to be admired, the crazy editor has moved the shot! I fully agree with the other comments about the lousy lighting and the horrible camera / editor work. I find it uncomfortable to watch ten minutes of it being a spectacular movie. <br /> <br /> Give me the opportunity to get a place for the live concert, and I would be in a recording! <br /> <br /> Nicholas T
