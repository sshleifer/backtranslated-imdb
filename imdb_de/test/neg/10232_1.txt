I am a person who never watches animated films, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and the Swan Princess. I was absolutely in love with the first episode of the series, I bought it and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind. I was determined to love it because I spent money on it. I finished the movie and all I can think of is THE HORROR !!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried very, very hard to like it. But I could not enjoy a second of this grueling movie. The songs made my ears break out of my head. The dialogue was so lame that every time someone opened their mouths, I shrank from frustration and annoyance. The villain was ridiculous and I felt that Derek and Odette wanted to die in the end ... and I was absolutely in love with them from the start. <br /> <br /> I'll try to repress the memory of this movie because it almost destroyed the first one for me. There is a song in the movie where the first movie contains a series of flashbacks. The difference in animation between the two is very obvious, and I began to yearn for the first and wished I would never see the third time.
