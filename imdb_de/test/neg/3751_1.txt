Let's face it, this cruelty is not Plan Nine or Cat Women. It's bad, period! The performances vary from theatrical performances (Marla English) to "kittens" (Tom Conway). The photograph (even in good print) is so bleak that sometimes it's hard to see what happens. The real problem, however, is the aimless, meaningless, almost plotless story and the leaden, peaceful direction. At a brisk 77 minutes, it still feels endless. <br /> <br /> The script is particularly inappropriate. There are two storylines that only intersect at the end of the picture. Tom Conway tries to create a super race with voodoo and modern science (though there is little scientific evidence) that he can telepathically control. He detains his wife (for no apparent reason). Meanwhile, a few little crooks and a white hunter type leader are trying to find the village where he works, expecting gold and jewels. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for his experiments. She is turned into a monster, kills Conway (Natch!) And then returns to normal. She sees a golden statue that has drowned half in a boiling pool, tries to find it again, falls into the water and apparently drowns. The white hunter rescues the woman. In the last shot we see the supposedly drowned woman reappear as a monster; A sequel threatens (that's really a scary thought!). <br /> <br /> The AIP producer Samuel Z Arkoff is proud to discover the niche market for teenagers and to satisfy him ingenious low-budget movies in a presentation included on the DVD. However, it is difficult to see how anyone would believe that rancid mixture would satisfy any audience. What charm could they consider possible? The monster appears so rare that it can hardly be called a horror movie. The jungle action is lukewarm and boring. There are no teenagers and no characters teenagers could identify with. <br /> <br /> The producers have shown 77 minutes of film, but they have not made a film. This is a disadvantage, and Arkoff should be ashamed of his connection with it.
