This is absolutely the worst comedy I have ever seen. It's hard to explain, because I'll bet you've never seen a comedy that was neither good nor bad. it's just there (that's the original part - not good or bad, just there)! <br /> <br /> Let me say that I have seen every comedian in a leading role and they all like it. That's what makes this a puzzle. The supporting leads actually work (though the dialogue is bad). The only character that is pretty good is John Goodman's. He is doing pretty good work with the little dialogue he has and actually has a funny line (I will not spoil the only funny line in the movie, if you still decide to look at it.) It includes a pancake mains. I will not call them characters because no characters have been developed. This script is so youthful that the fictitious names of the leads are not even given. They all use only their own. They do not even seem to be trying to act. It's like they all read aloud from scripts that the local junior high sent to them. When I was thirteen, I actually wrote such an article for my English lessons. That was not funny. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Do not rent this. That's not funny. There is not even the kind of bad dialogue you can moan. I just sat there and stared through the whole thing. It was so boring that I could not even bother about how bad it was. I can not imagine how this even gets a rating of 4.
