I have not seen this movie in years, but the horrible "taste" of Quaid's performance still remains on my tongue. Some have commented on how Quaid Jerry Lee Lewis "at a discount," but he seems to have only the most extreme stage that Jerry has in mind. No one behaves like that all the time, and the performance seems hopelessly clownish, making Lewis a buffoonish cartoon. The nuances of a man's life are lost in the rubble of pure hyperfunction. The author of the book on which this book is based (Nick Tosches) is a good writer who has written several good musical bios (I especially liked "Dino" with Dean Martin); Tosches gives us a full man in the books, both separate and involved in the "business". Quaid's play seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a human being. If people were like that nobody would take care of them. As far as the cartoons are concerned, it's a bit amusing, but otherwise it's one of the most exciting, movie-destroying performances I've seen in watching. Awful...
