I clicked on the Encore Mystery Channel to wait for the movie I wanted to see. Moreau. I only got a few minutes of Shadow Conspiracy. An old man walks towards Charlie and grabs his arm. Suddenly, an assassin in a light raincoat strikes the old man (with a side arm) across the street. After waiting for "C" to turn around and look, "A" tries to shoot "C" and misses significantly. "C" was a much easier target, the old man could not have run far. Moron! There is a chase and "C" is in an elevator "A" is on the roof, so he tries to shoot the cable that is parallel to "A". He hits and disconnects the cable, impossible. Later, this time with a special rifle, the "A" lines up on "C" maybe 50 meters away, but is too stupid to see a motorcycle approaching and instead tapping the driver. How does Charlie get his parts? Daddy goes to the producers and says "Look, my kid needs work ..." It reminds me of his stupid sit - com. All the actors are good, unless ... you got it. I usually have to wait 2 or 3 minutes to get on C.S.I. Let's see what I can do in the next lesson. I know, I will trim my toenails! Much better use my time.
