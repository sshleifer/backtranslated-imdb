STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> As a boy, Mark Goddard (C Thomas Howell) was powerless since His family , including his hero cop father (Jeff Fahey), was brutally murdered by vicious criminals he had tried to bring down. With the inner desire to punish counterfeiters who grew up in his old age, Mark turns hard when he brings in the suspects he is chasing and gets into great trouble with his superiors. Then he learns of 'Justice Incorporated,' a secret group of men and women led by a mysterious man (Ed Lauter) who serves to pronounce sentences that fit the crime outside the law. But then things get out of control and out alive could be harder than he thought. <br /> <br /> The Sweeper struggles with the misplacement because we've seen this action before (and better) in films like The Star Chamber, Michael Douglas and Magnum Force with Clint Eastwood. The title also makes no sense. But we also have to deal with the film's utter ridiculousness, including a scene in which a daughter's headset drowns out the sound of her family, a final with a prosecution of a bad guy starting on the highway, and one on one Wright ends Brother's plane, as well as some of the most ridiculous spectacles ever shown on screen, and a very cliched, overbearing screenplay. But there are some cool action sequences here and there, and the unintentional laugh factor of the movie lets him come alive with a pulse. **
