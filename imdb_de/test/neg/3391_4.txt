Some of the biggest and most popular horror films have a wicked sense of humor, but when a movie does pop up, it's not as original as the "classics," it just makes you laugh, then a bunch of you'll scare off critics. This movie has made me laugh several times, this is a testament to the way this movie was approached and shows that. The two main scenes look natural and believable, which really helps the movie. You went all the way and laughed with them, everyone has friends like these two. Another highlight for me was the monster truck, he is fantastic, intimidating and really well hit. Inspiration (stealing completely) from many films, with Duel, Jeepers Creepers being the most obvious and likely to refer to the same named Jack Black star Orange County. But really, you can choose any road trip that goes wrong, and find a reference here. But it's not the goal to win no Oscars. Give the audience a good dose of fright and laughter, and that's 10! Obviously, I do not get 10, I give real reasonable ratings and results, as opposed to 99% of the people on IMDb. There is no way this movie can get zero, just as many lazy idiots give too many movies and as fun as it was, no 10. It's just a good fun movie for those with humor and fear to have. You really can not get easier than that.
