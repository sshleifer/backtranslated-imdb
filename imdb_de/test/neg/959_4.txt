Interesting plot, but painfully boring. The script is missing ... there is a lack of acting. For me, this film is comparable to films of the type "Made for TV". I was lucky enough to survive the movie without falling asleep in my popcorn. I saw this movie with my family. It is quite safe to look with your children. (only half a sex scene) If you want to see a young Meg Ryan ... watch this movie. Very 80's. You'll like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people for Christmas, alcohol, super glue and tar. Or maybe you are like me ... and have a higher standard for filming. However, I liked the beginning and the end of the movie! Mark.
