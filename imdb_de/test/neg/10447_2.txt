I was tempted by comments in the IMDB to see Shark Hunter. The movie was bad, but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was so bad on so many levels that I'm glad I had the opportunity to fast forward. The shark itself is fine. His looks are decent and it's the only thing that saves this movie from getting a 1 (I gave it a 2). The spectacle is unbelievably bad and the dialogue is just as unfortunate. I did not expect much, but I was always surprised by this jerk. Antonio Sabato Jr. is a kind of biologist or scientist or something that I did not really pay attention to. He goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station, which the shark of course took with him. By the way, all scenes showing someone working underwater are not underwater. First of all, if you just go down to find out what happened to this station, what about all the big calming arrows and the harpoons, and so on. Are these things that you normally carry when investigating an accident? The shark theory was further developed by Antonio along the way, so they did not know what they had in front of them. Antonio and this young college student, by the way, a terrible actress, just jump to the controls of the submarine when the submarine is in trouble. What's with it If not everyone receives a kind of subtraining before graduation, I find that a bit silly. The director seems to think that if a crew works in the background, it's a good idea to weld someone in the background. Metal crafting is very important if you have a submarine. I could go on anyway, but I've already said too much. Conclusion: Go to your local video library, borrow this video and destroy it. Then send an email asking IMDB to remove all footage of this movie from their website. All the memories and evidence of this film must be destroyed. We can do it if we work together.
