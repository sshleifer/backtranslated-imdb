DeCoteau has to be one of the worst "directors" working in any genre today, and it has nothing to do with his films, which usually contain homoerotism and run around in their proper boxer briefs. Remember ... Anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and wants to suck your blood / soul (so deep symbolism here). I was just sitting by The Sisterhood to give him his nice shakes, I'm trying to see every horror movie I can, and this one had Barbara (FROM BEYOND, RE-ANIMATOR) Crampton in it (I was before in the world of DeCoteau Linnea Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and some other actresses I like Lemme tells you what the Sisterhood is all about ... As the other reviewer points out, the alleged conspiracy is lesbian Vampires on a University Campus But never before has a parade of hot young women ("actresses", if you like) walking around in bras, panties, and bikinis been so boring.The film has no plot, no gore, no nudity, and dialogue is ridiculous and seems like they did it, parts are switched on in slow motion and repeated many times to speed up the runtime, with about ten minutes of character who walk around the campus (oh, the excitement!), who looks more like a hotel resort than any college I've ever been to. And acting is the absolute worst. The only thing these girls do well is to lean forward and bend to show their bodies. The cast was so talented that I would be shocked if one of them would get a one-day walk-on role on Passions in the future. Ditto for the boys. Yes, DeCoteau pushed more hot types into underwear in this case as well ... people who should be in a K-Mart booklet instead of trying to act. Do these people actually have to audition or just show up in Dave's office and undress? I think the answer is obvious. <br /> <br /> I'm ready to give any movie a chance, if 1.) it is intelligently written, purposeful, original and competent (or hell, even ambitious and stylish) .. or 2.) it is full of anger, nudity, various trashiness and / or it is unintentionally funny. David DeCote's films do NOT provide any of these and they offer better production values ​​for direct-to-video flicks. What a waste! So what's the allure, especially with the emergence of soft and hardcore versions of porn that anyone can easily reach with a computer? I just can not answer that. <br /> <br /> DeCoteau is a gay horror director and could use his resources to give the genre a unique twist. Instead, it produces insane feeling without showing any talent or intelligence. Ironically, when you think about it, his films are anything but gay. They actually make homosexuality appear shabby, mysterious and sinister. The apparently gay characters in his films always try to falsify, seduce, and / or kill the innocent, sexually confused clues. There is no shading here to make things interesting. The protagonists are naive and rarely prove that they are strong, assertive or confident who they are. I would understand that conspiracy if Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps, or Dr. Laura would start making horror movies directly on video, but a gay director just shows that he's hardly concerned with these cheese cheeses for beefcake.
