The bad news: The Canadian version of Beast In The Cellar published by Maple Pictures was of poor quality. Dark and washed out, it seemed to be randomly synchronized by a VHS cassette. In some places even skipped because some frames are missing. <br /> <br /> The good news: This movie is so bad that the poor quality of the DVD did not affect my viewing enjoyment. This horror movie does not build tension and is not afraid. It's a terrible horror movie. While most frightening films have a limited dialogue, Beast In The Cellar is a gabfest, so a character repeats something we just heard from two other characters. Presumably, the whole babbler acts as a filler for a very unimaginative, uninspired film. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not Campy enough to be worth an observation.
