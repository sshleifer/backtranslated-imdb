Anyone who thinks the movie is great, must have seen the head. It strikes me that this movie was made as a joke. It has no good points at all. The props cost about $ 10 and the whole set looks like it could fall off anytime. Why do such films ever arise? This also had two of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in the boy on the starship and the redneck of the twentieth century. This movie is almost as bad as "Cool as Ice" with the incredibly talented Vanilla "misunderstood" Ice.
