I watched this video without any commercial interruption, and I can tell you, even for a TV movie, it was pretty predictable. The actors did a craft job with what they had, and the cast was pretty good - Barry Bostwick, Jane Seymour, Frances Fisher, etc. The script, however, was not only predictable (except the final scene), but the dialogue was dizzy and sounded as if he had been overturned by a novel of novels of the third grade. Jane Seymour's psychotic monologues were ridiculous. I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that anyone who's scary will not arouse suspicion at all. As bad as Theresa Russell was in "Black Widow" - and she certainly stunk it - she at least had the sense to play her pseudo-characters a bit directly. Seymour is a much better actress but has not overcome the material here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score is unbelievably cheesy. It's almost a satire of his genre, like a collapse of Kenny G. A movie with such a dull and inferred script should have been better.
