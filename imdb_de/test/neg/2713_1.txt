This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After seeing this play, I felt I should write to Madonna and ask for compensation for my time, but now I feel like writing Madonna and asking for a great 80's album (considering that she can not record a good album.) save her life more) in exchange for this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Continue to the movie itself, which can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> Madonna hops around and behaves like a spoiled teen who has lost her way. She tries to impress this absolute douche of an actor who plays the "lawyer" in the movie. But the best was the end. I stared with my chin on the floor in the TV, while the credits rolled through to myself, "That's it? That's the end What a piece of shit!". If Madonna had not been a pop icon at the time of this film, this film would have destroyed her career single-handedly. And the funniest thing about the whole situation was that I only saw the damn movie to see where they placed the song "Who's That Girl". Well, guess where they placed it? ............................ .......At the end!
