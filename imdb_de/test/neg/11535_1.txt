I absolutely hated this movie. Although the film wanted to convey some kind of social message, it was done in a clich√©d and melodramatic way like a Mexican soap opera. <br /> <br /> Also the acting was terrible, especially Charityn and her son. That's one of the problems with Dominican movies. They use celebrities who can not only attract the masses. <br /> <br /> I am even more ashamed of the positive reviews here, which unfortunately mean that Dominicans are just condescending to what is being done here rather than giving up honest and critical opinions that help our film industry To support quality.
