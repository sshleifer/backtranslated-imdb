There is no reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Why? Many reasons. At first, the spectacle is terrible. There is hardly a line that is not misunderstood - which is hardly surprising in view of the banality, stupidity and repeatability of the dialogue which the actors should bring to expression. It is terribly written. The most annoying thing about the script is that the writers seem to know only one way in which to make their characters talk to each other after a certain point br /> "Repeat?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, they repeat it for the entire movie." <br /> <br /> "The whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." <br /> <br /> Etc. <br /> <br /> In films like this you generally know who the bad guys are and what they are looking for. (All the good guys usually have to do is stop the bad guys.) A good "Mwahahaha!" With X under control, I'll rule the universe! "Villain is the first stop in a cheap SF plot), but this one Turkey? - You tell me. <br /> <br /> If I understand it, our "heroes" are a lot of mass murderers who were sent on a Dirty Dozen mission into the past, becoming a fascist totalitarian state The new story would not include the rise of totalitarianism and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the earth a dead planet (we all know this because of the fact that this movie has one of those handy long reports on the screen just before the action starts.) I'll tell you who is who and what is what, which is an indication of who the producers are for their audience, d As soon as she is told and appears on the screen - just to save the audience from overloading the brain a lot.) So, who should we anchor here? I think we're being asked to believe that our hero is making a journey from totalitarianism to love, peace and understanding while shooting lots of people - but that does not work like a bow because we're shown to be a decent person When he is at the very beginning, he tries to rescue all civilians aboard the rebel station. <br /> <br /> I think the creators were aiming for a deeper than normal complexity in this movie's unholy mess with more storylines and logical inconsistencies than a dozen of your average SF movies. <br /> <br /> The opening speeches were nice.
