For one thing, he produced this film. It feels like later films with international castings being dubbed. The opening credits say that he was shot in Vienna. Bey was a delight in the Universal Adventure movies of the 1940s. He was also great in a movie I saw ten years ago, but since then I have never heard of it: "The Amazing Mr. X." Maybe it was Dr. X. I remember an exciting and frightening movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is quite wooden. The plot is not easy to follow. When I got the hang of it, I was still disappointed. <br /> <br /> Francis Lederer looks good as a concert pianist. He was a very handsome senior man ten or fifteen years ago. He has never really prevailed as the main star, although he should have done it. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad, but it's pretty hard.
