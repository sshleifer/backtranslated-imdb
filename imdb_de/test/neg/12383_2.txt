That's almost Ed Wood's territory. Yes, this ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a mixture of a turkey buzzard and a bad day in the dentist's office. And this sound effect screeching makes nails on a blackboard sound like Mozart. And why The Giant Claw, when the stupid guy devours his victims with a mechanical jaw. We get big close-ups of the ugly chicken foot, but not anymore. I think the producers said a proper titled big mouth could point to a Jerry Lewis comedy. And when you talk about comedies, this "anti-matter" gobbled gook is weirder than anything in a Lewis movie. I suspect the scriptwriters were stuck for one reason, so a common duck hunter could not take care of a flying 50s threat, so they built a real whopper antimatter from another galaxy. Yes, this KFC fugitive is said to have flown in from another galaxy behind a protective antimatter shield, as some of the local geniuses of the film state in a terrible way. In this case, it's Jeff Morrow, a pilot, who in his spare time advises Einstein on the secrets of the universe. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is Morrow who keeps the ridiculous process out of the bad movie Hall of Shame because he actually shows his lines with a straight face. Besides, he even sounds like he believes them. This is a first class movie act. To cope with the Oscars, Morrow earns a medal in combat when he goes beyond the duty under the most extreme conditions of the film. Take a look at senior lady Corday and you'll be able to measure his strength under fire. She looks like she just woke up from a bad dream and maybe nobody will notice her if she stands still. I hardly did it. The first time I saw this car disaster was through a haze in the back row of today's housing estate. I should have learned my lesson and let this second time break out another 12 pack.
