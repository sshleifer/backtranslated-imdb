The quality of this documentary has me very disappointed. The content is poorly produced, very poor video quality and above all terrible sound. There is very little to be heard about how Bruce Haack produced his music, and there is virtually no direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music. The interviews with people who knew Bruce Haack are ad hoc dumbbells, which are mostly just mumbo jumbo. Too much yak and not enough Haack. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have an above-average attention span, even for slow and / or difficult topics, I fell asleep watching this documentary and had to review it to see the parts I had slept through. If you see this, make sure that you are set up like Alex in A Clockwork Orange before viewing. Bruce Haack deserves much better. Pity about the producer and director.
