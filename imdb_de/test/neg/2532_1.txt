I just saw Princess Raccoon at the Asian Film Festival in New York. The gentleman who introduced the film congratulated the audience on his fine taste. "You could be fully loaded with Herbie," he said with a smug smile, "but instead, you're here to see Seijun Suzuki's princess raccoon." The audience applauded and cheered. Well, let me tell you, I would rather have seen Herbie: Fully Loaded twice in a row. Princess Raccoon, a supposedly bizarre musical based on Japanese folklore, is well suited for one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. It's so pathetic that his misery does not really make me like other Seijun Suzuki movies, which is quite a feat. <br /> <br /> There is such a huge range of things that go wrong with Princess Raccoon that I hardly know where to start. Perhaps the worst mistakes are both aggressively incomprehensible and monotonous. If the roles are confused or half lost in shipping, they will not recognize the difference. If you do not believe me, I dare you to steal a print and have someone do the roles in random order. If you can tell me which way to go, I will give you every penny I have. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film contains a mish-mash of scenes, songs (including a collar-inducing rap number) and pictures that does not seem to be related at all. Terribly integrated computer animations are thrown into the bargain hunt and add another brick to the vast and fast-growing wall of incomprehensibility. It would not surprise me to learn that the writer has written down Japanese folklore that appeared on a stack of note cards, stacked, mingled, issued the cards on a table and then wrote the script according to their order. <br /> <br /> Approximately thirty-five minutes after the film begins, a semblance of action appears on stage. Something about a shapely raccoon princess (in human form) and a regular human being in love. I hoped this was an indication that the movie was anything but a series of stunning scenes, but no such luck. The film continues in the absolutely enigmatic way. I wish I had got off at the time, but I was in the middle of a tight line. In retrospect, it would have been worth the embarrassing scene. <br /> <br /> I'm exhausted just thinking about the last two roles. I spent every moment hoping and praying that it was over. Any big movement of the dolly, in the music or in any scene that looked like it was coming to a close, renewed my hopes that the credits would roll soon. After a painful minute, it went on. And on and on and on. Eventually, after dozens of false alarms, it cut to a certain abstract pattern that vendors would appear. Despite all reason, it cut to another scene. How could I forget? The completely disconnected subplot of a ninja caught, urinated and cooked in a soup was not yet packed. <br /> <br /> I will not get these 111 minutes back, but you can save yourself the pain. Unless you want to amaze your memory or enjoy future Seijun Suzuki films like Youth of the Beast and Tokyo Drifter, do not see Princess Raccoon. I would have preferred to spend my time vomiting.
