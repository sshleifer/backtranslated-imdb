Miserable movie. Not even in the same breath as "To Kill a Mockingbird" or "In the Heat of the Night". Yes, there are racial prejudices, but the film is highly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Come on now. Would you really have Elizabeth Patterson guarding a prison to avoid lynching? Patterson played the mother of all in her day and was the landlady in "I Love Lucy" before Fred and Ethel Mertz bought the building. Male gun killed a white man? <br /> <br /> Claude Jarman Jr., who was so fabulous in 1946, appears "The Yearling" in this mess. He still had those sad eyes. My eyes would be sad too if I showed up in this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> For me, this was nothing but a Faulkner flop.
