I have to agree with what many of the other reviewers have come to the conclusion. An issue that could stimulate thought and illuminate a reverse double standard failed miserably. Rape as a violent crime and forced abusive control, the scenes here were for the most part miserable. It would have been a better idea to give a brief insight into what happened and to let the audience imagine the deed. And the laughter of the victim with the cops as he broke off his police complaint seemed as real as that of the cops. No awkwardness, no hesitation, just to join in. I do not know if that was bad behavior or bad direction, but someone missed the point completely. As for his half-crazy alleged search for his attackers, it's pathetic. They should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves - and let him meet Colin Friels the first time he went to the police. The story could then have been highlighted with a good dialogue and occasional flashback - and saved by the superior acting and presence that Colin Friels - the only reason I've seen this movie - brings to every project he does. <br /> <br /> The only concrete revelation of this movie is, it was crap.
