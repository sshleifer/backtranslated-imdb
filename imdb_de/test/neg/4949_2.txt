I just watched a Forensic Files marathon on Court TV. The episode was identical to the plot of this film, to the incest mystery and the subplot with the sister. I do not remember a disclaimer based on True Story, but the case has written MOW about everything. It seems to be the murder of Ruby Morris by her husband Earl, who was sentenced to life for 25 years for her murder. Just to show you that the truth can be more alien than fiction, because I thought the plot for the lifetime was invented and more than "a piece" as far as credibility goes. I'm with the other posters that said acting was bad. However, I did not notice it with all players. It was really the main character, the daughter whose performance was bad.
