I mainly saw this movie because it looked so good in the trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson should be the same size. Instead, Williams continues the bad movie series lately. What's up with the movie? Rather like the real thing: the ensemble crew does a good job around Robin and, as usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. That being said, this movie was just not good. I really only recommend it if you want to see what it would be like for Jon Stewart to run for president and win. To say that he won is not a spoiler since he was in the trailer. The concept and the idea are really amusing, but that's all. Most of Robin's jokes are only recycled from old comedy pieces by him, and there are very few loud moments, and most are just stupid. Like most comedies that turn out to be shit, all the funny parts are put in the trailer. No surprises, but come on! Part of the movie reads like a novel by Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn! People expected this to be the return of Robin to greatness. Instead, it's more like a floubber.
