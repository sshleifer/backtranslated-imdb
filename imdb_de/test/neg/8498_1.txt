This movie is a gay love story, disguised as a story of graffiti and friendship. Not a review described this movie as a gay love movie, and that's the weight of the action. I do not know if it was about deceiving people who would otherwise be uninterested in expecting the movie to be the way it was marketed ... The film is not connected to the graffiti culture, it abuses and defames the film Graffiti culture and the spectacle is miserable. Oh yes, the graffiti is shit too. This film was a clever way to hide the agenda of gay boy portrayals. Just look at the rest of the films the director is involved in. All contain the same topic. Boring, not what I expected.
