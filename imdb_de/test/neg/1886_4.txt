Okay - the title "House of Frankenstein" was a reference to a line from the original Frankenstein movie. If you continue with a movie titled "House of Dracula," which makes no real sense, you know it's just becoming a franchise. <br /> <br /> Dracula is back without explanation and he is called himself Baron Latos. He infiltrates the house of a doctor nobleman by claiming that he is seeking a cure for his vampirism. Nobleman has a humpbacked nurse who supports him (what about humpback assistants in these movies?), But what really interests Dracula is his other, more beautiful assistant. At this point, Larry "Wolf Man" Talbot returns (again, no explanation given) and happens to seek the same doctor to cure his lycanthropy. And then he just falls into a cave where plants can be grown to help him, which also contains the Frankenstein monster. Dear God, when will it end ... sure, the other Universal Monster sequels were stupid, but that's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> First the good stuff. There are some great settings and the vampire bat effects are a bit better than usual. Some of the other effects are also pretty neat. John Carradine is not bad at Dracula once you get used to him, but still not as brilliant as Lugosi. In my opinion Onslow Stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie, even though he has exactly the opposite of Carradine - all scary and out of class. None of the performances is so great, but it's more about the cruel writing than anything else - the female parts are especially badly written. But stupid as it is, it remains largely entertaining for the most part. The best part is the short length. <br /> <br /> Well the bad stuff ... it's not scary, it's badly written and does not work. I was hoping the three monsters would start a supernatural battle for power, but that does not happen. The focus is almost entirely on Dracula, which is not well represented. On the other hand, this is the only movie in which Dracula infects another man, but this is more like a blood transfusion than a bite, since Universal was always uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext. Larry Talbot is as decent as the Wolfman, but plays a relatively small role. Again, the Frankenstein monster's share is reduced to the anti-climatic closing moments. For God's sake, Glenn Strange was fantastic as a creature! Why do not you give him more time? It is unfortunate that the series had to end on this note (without the classic comedy "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"). In the end, it hissed in the sunlight and died, much like Dracula himself.
