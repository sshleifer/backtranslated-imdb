This show is shit. it was put on a roller coaster on fridays, and although it has undoubtedly destroyed the current theme of friday programs, i will judiciously judge it. It is really very lame. Zoey and her stupid friends are weak characters and the pot sucks and is really lame. <br /> <br /> The lame continuity and the pot are shit and I think the dialogue and the guys are weak. The weak humor and the lame crazy characters are shit, and the whole show is a disappointment that is not worth seeing. It's shitty and really lame. It really has to be one of the lame shows on TV, really not worth watching. I mean, how lame and weak can a show become before it gets punished?
