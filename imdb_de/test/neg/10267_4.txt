If the word "gifts" enters a title preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately rejected. For some reason, people who are capable of creating good art do not seem to see it in others. However, I was always ready to try the second installment of the Demons trilogy. For one, the soundtracks are absolutely a dream. Most American directors sacrificed small animals to bring the kind of talent to the soundtrack of Demons 2. For two more words: Asia Argento. (Of course, she was eleven years old when this movie was filmed, and a few years away from her apparent decision that she would style her acting after the early Helen Mirren: gloomy looks and few clothes.) Lamberto Bava also comes from one of them Italy's finest dynasties in this comic horror sub-genre known as Giallo (he is the son of Mario Bava, who may have invented the genre in the sixties). And the original Demons is an absolute must for fans of B-horror movies of the eighties. How bad can that be, right? Well, bad. The demons continue their attack on the Italian media. The film opens in a modern Italian high-rise, where many people who pursue their lives watch their television in the background. They all look at some kind of combined news report / mater video of some investigative reporter types trying to get evidence of the events of the first movie (which is probably not more than a few days after the first movie). With the usual horror film inability to concentrate, reporters manage to bring a demon back to life, and he comes through the screen to restart the plague. <br /> <br /> Yes. It is so bad. The only good thing to say about the movie is that the soundtrack (unless you're taken by surprise by people like The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is breathtaking. It comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell, who started as part of the Argento dynasty and since then has been making films like Lord of Illusions and Hackers. <br /> <br /> Hire a half decency free rent if you plan to drink a lot, but it's certainly not near the fun the original had. Cronenberg's wonderfully funny high-rise creature Shivers (aka They Came From Within) is much better.
