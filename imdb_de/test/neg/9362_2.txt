This is a movie by Toilet Pictures. If the name of the production company is an indication of how smelly a movie is, that would be the case. I do not think I'm a fan of horror movies, not that I'm a chicken, but this year alone I was not really thrilled with what has been offered, be it from the West or from Asia. 9:56 is not different, great premise, but bad execution, based on clich√© techniques (I think these are the only available tools of the trade?), To evoke some heartbeat moments. <br /> <br /> Se -jin (Ko So-young) is a lonely career woman, who one day realizes that some apartments in the block of flats in front of her house are simultaneously blackouts at exactly 21:56. No, she is not a voyeur, but a series of unexplained deaths in the neighborhood, including one she encounters in a subway, begins to draw her deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding those deaths. With horror In films, there is always a pseudo-logical explanation of how the spooks come about. This is pretty much the most interesting thing in the movie, dissolving the "truth," though experienced movie lovers will not need to half guess the plot. This of course makes it a very unsatisfactory experience to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> There are a variety of characters, such as the girl confined in a wheelchair, and the neighbors taking turns taking care of her, as well as a student, a detective, a mentally challenged boy, and a sinister train commuter , But after the genre formula, these people are usually fond of livestock or, in this case, pointless red herring figures whose sole purpose is to mislead the audience when they confuse themselves or to add something to move the action forward <br /> Do not let me start with the techniques used here. Quick cuts, sudden appearances, long hair, ghouls (ahhhhhhh, so fit!), That can not move properly, plenty of blood, as if it's flowing down a mountain, and the list goes on. However, the sound engineers have made sure they've made some penetrating bone bangs on every spook, even if it's a trick pony. Do not waste time with it, even if you're a horror fan. It's a complete waste of a promising premise, and in the end, you feel like you're just taken. A very long and painful way to endure. It's high time for an innovation in this genre, otherwise one movie looks a bit like another, with ugly long-haired monsters that merrily move but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud noises. Oh, and can anyone oil those doors while they're at it?
