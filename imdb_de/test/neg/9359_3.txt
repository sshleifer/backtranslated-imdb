I had heard good things about "states of grace" and came in with an open heart. I thought that "God's army" was okay, and I thought Dutcher might have improved and matured as a filmmaker. The movie started with some shaky actors, and I thought, "Maybe it will get better." Unfortunately, it never did. The picture begins with the presentation of two Elders - Mormon missionaries - and it seems that the audience is getting to know them and taking care of them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly unlikely series of unfortunate events in which obvious disobedience is emphasized by the missionaries. Success in this film is its successful alienation of its target audience. Through the unrealistic and inaccurate portrayal of the life of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher does nothing but annoy his predominantly Mormon audience. The film does not reflect reality in any way. Missions are not what Dutcher shows (after I've done a Mormon mission myself), and California gang life certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity. The conclusion, which I assume, is that the audience should be touched and should be encouraged to believe that forgiveness is available to all. That was incredible. (Come on, the whole mission gathers when this Elder is sent home - and the mother and the girl are right next to each other!) And cheesy. Next time, Dutcher, try to make a film that someone can identify with.
