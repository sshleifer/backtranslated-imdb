I was initially interested in this movie after reading a summary and seeing some eye-catching screenshots. The promise was for a gripping horror movie in Dario Argento style. I have to admit that Argento's films were occasionally rather incoherent, and some feel like a handful of visual-looking set pieces loosely connected with a vague connecting action. <br /> <br /> I have to say, I'm not really surprised. Even his masterpiece Suspiria shows in the investigation the same tendency, sometimes incoherent scenes mitseri√üen only for aesthetic reasons. However, Suspiria also benefited from a unique protagonist and clear antagonists, as well as scenes that ultimately contributed to the final solution. The church, on the other hand, has none of it. It has no main character, no protagonist; it has no real conspiracy to talk about, no crescendo, no climax, no resolution, no solution. It's a completely hollow, incoherent work that looks like Argento is sitting down and thinking, hey, that would make an interesting scene visual ... let's do it! The movie is a series of these scenes. <br /> <br /> At first it might be interesting and Soavis direction is excellent, I have to say. Soavi can not be faulted for the material as it is made as convincing as possible. However, this good direction draws attention to the terrible mistakes of the script, and it is absolutely pointless. The attempt of a central, unifying conspiracy is nothing but a plagiarism of Carpenter's film Prince of Darkness. Events happen only because the script desires them, and reactions to those events are completely implausible. The narrative flow is irreparably damaged after one point, simply because it is not possible to lift the unbelief; it is too ridiculous. In addition, there are numerous factual errors that are so blatantly portrayed that it becomes embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If the work had been transformed into more artistic and into another work, it might have been irritating or tense. If it had been developed into a truly coherent narrative, it might have been gripping. But it was none of it. The best of it was confusing and sometimes annoying. Actions are introduced, but never followed. Characters are forgotten and changed arbitrarily. No logic is ever applied to any situation. It may have been scary or interesting, but to arouse that feeling, a script writer requires more effort ... much more. <br /> <br /> All in all, the church is not worth a visit for anyone But the total enthusiast of Italian horror is more style than substance. This is Argento's worst-case style, and it's a strong justification for the usual criticism.
