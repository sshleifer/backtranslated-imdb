I scoured all the reviews and searched for those that gave this movie less than 5 stars. They were few and far from each other. Which is completely confusing! Yes, I know it's a Disney movie and not directed by Christopher Nolan, but good sir. That's straightforward. They should have done it and animate the damn thing. <br /> <br /> And even worse, the fact that IMDb does not just let me finish my spell there, because my review will take longer! <br /> <br /> The "awesome" in-game camera images are taken LITERALL by Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf on the Playstation, the story is like a pouting schoolboy, the multi-stranded character and the plot development hinder even weak setup and the grand finale is just boring. Besides that, it was really the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Good, authentic-looking costumes, sets and sports equipment. There I said it.
