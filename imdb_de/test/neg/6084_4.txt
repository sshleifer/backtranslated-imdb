It's a shame that quality actors like Baldwin and Booth have to succumb to lousy stories and scripts just for the money. But, hey, it's a cruel world ... <br /> <br /> This is just another of a long line of assassins who use all the usual narrative twists to try to make them more attractive than they is. Sure, there are some nice places, it's a smooth production, there is good camera work and editing, and it's pretty well tuned overall. <br /> <br /> So, what's the real problem? The whole premise is just incredible. But instead of spoiling a corrupt story, I'll let you find out what it's all about, that is, if you can get away with it. I did it, but only because I like Baldwin and I always hoped it would get better. <br /> <br /> It did not. And it had one of the anti-climactic endings that I've seen for a long time. In fact, maybe never ... <br /> <br /> But it's harmless fun, I think, if you have nothing better to do.
