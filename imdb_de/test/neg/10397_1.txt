Dante would have been ashamed if he had known that his masterpiece REDUCED PUPPETS !!! Even the actors who played the dolls are sold out. Since a doll is not played, it basically does nothing. Nobody will really care who the puppet was. it is only important to those people who played a big role as in a movie. It's just annoying how one could make fun of such an amazing man and his faith with this silent movie. That should be a crime and ... I can not believe you would ruin such a book. I found the movie absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed !!!! It totally ruins what you expect to read. You just make a big joke.
