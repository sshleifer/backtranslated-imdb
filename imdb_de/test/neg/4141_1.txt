After 1988, after the disaster, GJS Amitabh's films lost the quality they had before. Apart from MAIN AZAAD HOON, released in 1989, this was a great movie rest. All films were craps, except for HUM (1991) later 1991 /> <br /> This is another of the Amitabh films people rejected in the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> The film he made as a badge of friendship for Shashi Kapoor who shot the film and did not take a penny The movie also had Rishi and Dimple (again not paired with RANBHOOMI). <br /> <br /> The film came out in 1991, when Bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops, including INDRAJEET, AKAYLA, AJOOBA <br /> <Ajooba came to TOOFAN and JAADUGAR two years ago, both supernatural films that were rejected. This is a different kind of crap. Bachchan wears a mask and a Krissh outfit and makes a magical change from a person to a donkey. Of course you can excuse the special effects in 1991 but the movie is too bad to be seen <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor's direction is not good, musi c is bad <br /> <br /> Among the actors Amitabh was too old in 1991 and looked tired. His acting is okay, but not at the level of his best. Rishi is okay. Dimple is fine, the rest is forgotten
