The first thing that impressed me about this movie was the awful acting. The entire cast was so unable to deliver its lines that I began to laugh at the terrible dialogue in the middle of the movie. An even bigger problem with this movie is that at no point do we find out what motivates the actions of each character. The somewhat redeeming aspect of the film is the innovative visual effects of Halfdan Hussey. As striking as they may be, they can not compensate for the above gaping flaws. A terrible script mixed with drama at the community theater level does not provide a pleasant look. I was really shocked at how bad this movie was.
