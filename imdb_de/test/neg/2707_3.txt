There are few laughs in this boring movie and I can not wonder how this mess came about. The only good thing about this film is the talent of Griffin Dunne, but his best efforts were easily overshadowed by Madonna's repulsive performance. I could go through this without getting bored, but that's probably the nicest thing I can say about this time-waster.
