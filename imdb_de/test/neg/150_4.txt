Not quite as good as the "Guinea Pig" films, inspired by "Flowers of Flesh and Blood" or "Devil's Experiment," which do not convey a true philosophy, this hardcore-added video feature adds hardcore sex (with mosaic censorship) to his inspiration. The special make-up effects, which include slitting the stomach and undressing, are pretty good when they overlap. The amateur feeling of production is a distraction. Everything looks cheap and lazy. The lighting is hard and the sound and editing are sloppy. The simple story refers to a porn actress who plays in a real snuff movie. Just when she gets tired of being abused, the actual abuse begins. In the heroic scene of the film, an actor cuts the woman's belly in a graphic close-up, stuffs his member inside and does his thing. I did not find "Psycho - The Snuff Reels" shocking. On the contrary, I found it a desperate attempt by amateurs to beat "Guinea Pig" and his damned blood. Interestingly, this was marketed by Aroma, a leading fetish producer.
