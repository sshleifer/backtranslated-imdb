Another ridiculously lame and pointless low-budget sci-fi TV presentation? but is it somehow amusing? Kind of?? in passably yielding way. Am I soft? I do not know why they have these titles. Yes, there is a komodo. And yes, there is a cobra. But what is the deal with 'versus' in between? Surely they come to blows? in just two sequences (one that summarizes one incident and the other represents the shady climax) and quite boring exchanges I can add. Getting up is the same old routine of a scientific experiment that got out of hand on a lonely island (without dinosaurs), and some innocent bystanders (environmentalists who want to do animal experiments) who get entangled in it. This means that a Komodo dragon and a cobra will become massive while the government soon wants to destroy any kind of evidence (including witnesses) of their existence by blowing up the island. The survivors are running against time to find a way out. The prominent staples consisted of awesome video game CGI, hack script, a few grubby sets (though the tropical island setting was easy on the eyes), disposable figures (but I thought the performances were alright), lifeless sticky thrills (which for some reason) Reason remained with the same repetitive shot of the victim that was just frightened there - which means I'm waiting, please eat me now, I'm not going anywhere and at some point they were swallowed a second sip to get them ready or just the one To save trouble by crushing them stupidly) and a very hysterical edge with some kind of malicious message among the survival files. Director Jim Wynorski seems to be consistently on cruise control. Michael Par√© is having fun with his rugged dialogues and Michelle Borth added much needed sparks. Renee Talbert is very successful.
