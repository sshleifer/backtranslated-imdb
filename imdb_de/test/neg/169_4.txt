I think I looked at a highly edited version because it was not nearly as visual as I expected - based on the other reviews I've heard the original "Emmanuelle" (1974), Emmanuelle Arsan, 2nd of the Main character is a sexually free mind and 3. Located in the exotic area of ​​Asia, "Laure" does not have the same flair as its predecessor. <br /> I found this movie just too chatty with philosophical issues that really do not interest me, ie the voyeuristic, open relationship between Laure and Nick: "I'm just happy with what they enjoy." .. something in that direction. I can not relate to this mentality and the movie / characters do not light up. <br /> <br /> The second half of finding the Mara tribe just seemed like a completely separate movie. One that did not interest me. At the time I was just hoping it would turn into a porn, so it would at least hold my interest. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just did not understand it. <br /> <br /> I will leave it at that.
