That was a very good show. I enjoyed the build-up of real-time and retrospective when I saw the old Diggers reunited and remembered the horrors of their captivity at Changi POW Camp. The main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in Changi are more like a summer camp than what the place must have been. I am old enough to remember filming of men released from Changi and other Japanese POW camps. No actor could lose enough weight to resemble the condition of these men. They made the Belsen Jews look like sumo wrestlers. I have met several Changi veterans over the years. Many would never drive in a Japanese car, let alone their own. The physical and mental torture these men endured was too horrible for them to talk about it. What percentage has survived? John Doyle may be fine in writing a comedy for "Roy and HG" (I hate it too), but this is a heavy frosting in the story that should never be tolerated. I am pleased that satirists write "The Life of Brian" and make fun of the crucifixion, because it is obviously a comedy, even if some think it tasteless. "Changi" is written as a representation of a real event and as such could be considered as a true record by younger people. Great performances of a fine cast can not replace this easy scenario.
