I saw this Hallmark TV movie when it was originally broadcast. I lost interest in the story because it was said a character was a witch. I just was not in the mood to watch this movie. But Hallmark stands for the best and best quality films. Now there is a reason to watch this movie a second time. Clive Owen, who plays "Damon Wildeve," may have a chance of being selected as the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan passes it on. Clive Owen may have to wait until 2008. The other reason is that the female lead role is Catherine Zeta-Jones (she was a stranger then) and in 2003 became an Academy Award winner for an Outstanding Supporting Actress. Joan Ploughright as "Mrs. Yeobright" is also in this movie. I like the opening line in this movie: "Free my heart from this fearful, lonely place, send me a great love from somewhere or I will die, truly I will die."
