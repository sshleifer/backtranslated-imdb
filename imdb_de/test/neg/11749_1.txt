Let me begin by saying that this reworked version of one of the greatest movies ever made, "Psycho" (1960), was nothing more than a good example of bad direction, bad acting and bad cast. The best way to describe this film is to compare it step by step, acting as the original by acting and processing the process. Shoot the original in black and white, although there is still color at the time. Okay, the people in 1960 were not as used to bloodshed or horrible scenes as we were, but that did not stop people from liking them and being nominated for 4 Oscars. Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to publish this in color, except that the year was 1998. What should be realistic in color was not the case. After the shower scene, Norman washes his hands and it's easy to understand that what was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax. Once he has washed off the blood, his hand is red. <br /> <br /> In terms of acting, there might not have been a better cast of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original. Perkins fit in well with Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiled and talked to the stranger. Hitch wanted a good-looking and good actor and it worked well. In this version, I personally believe that Vince Vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play Norman's role. Unfortunately, his acting was no less than terrible. At the motel office, where Norman and Marion talked for a long time, he had a blank expression on his face and his voice and face never changed. Originally in the same scene describing the madhouse, we can clearly see the sudden expression change in Perkins's face and he looks frighteningly angry, if not aggressive. Vince Vaughn here elaborates the entire conversation as if he had just memorized his lines. Again terrible spectacle. The same applies to Anne Heche. In the opening scene of the original, we see how tense and nervous Marion (Janet) is as she travels to Phoenix. She was happy to get the money, but at the same time she was scared. That's what I call acting. In the remake, Heche has no signs of fear and she smiles regularly to get the money. I do not think anyone would be "happy and smiling" if he just stole $ 400,000 and the entire state police are behind them. In the shower scene Janet grabs the original curtain, turns around and dies after being stabbed. In the remake, Heche is stabbed, turns around, then swings in the other direction, has a foolish expression on his face and can die with great effort. Again terrible spectacle. <br /> <br /> There are also some specially introduced changes to the original that seem to have nothing to do with the plot and the current situation. In the scene in which Arbogast is murdered, two scenes flash between the stitches. One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. Many people, including me, are not sure if the second scene was a sheep or a cow or whatever. What on earth does an animal or a naked woman have to do with the murder of an investigator! The changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. There are also some changes in the final scene. <br /> <br /> Let me add some (and the only) positive points. I felt that Julianne Moore did a good job and played a good character of Lila. And William Macy behaved well, that was almost exactly how the character of Arbogast should have been played. <br /> <br /> It is well known that the purpose and intent of a movie remake is to make the current generation aware of a movie that has a good classical plotline, and to make it look better than the original. And if something happened here, which I just said, it's just the opposite. Unfortunately, many people like me were not impressed after the film, unless we have learned of the existence of an unforgettable original version. <br /> <br /> Please do not look at this movie, it is not nearly the original and the original will always be one of the best movies ever created, if not the best.
