I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half searching for a movie. We could not find one, as we have seen almost every movie. We decided to look into the horror area on a low budget. We were looking for the most attractive cover with slightly dressed women. Finally we chose Last Slumber Party, THE. Whoops, we made a mistake. It seems like this movie was shot with the cheapest camera you can find in K-Mart. The actors were picked up at a Salvation Army and for Steven Tyler. We will leave that to the imagination. The plot of this movie was ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT There is absolutely no closure during the movie. Then come and find out that all events were just a dream. This film should have taken about 30 minutes. If all the camera images were zoomed to still images and the walls were scanned, this would have been much shorter. I can only say that I am glad that there was no continuation.
