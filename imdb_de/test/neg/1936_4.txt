My Take: Even great underwater photography can save a familiar script and wafer-thin characters. <br /> <br /> For those who still have not had enough of the FREE WILLY pictures, FLIPPER can borrow a reasonable rent. Others are (hard) recommended to stay away. Although FLIPPER is a harmless affair, it does not do much for the adult audience (unless it's the first time you see a dolphin). <br /> <br /> A remake of a television program and a 1960s film, FLIPPER sounds like a good idea after all: a dolphin charms the life of a boy and a girl, helping the environment by removing the toxic waste, which are thrown in the glittering waters of the Florida Keys, eliminates and at the same time fights a shark and a shark. Saline seaside resort, which happens to be responsible for the toxic waste and also hates dolphins. But even for the 90s, especially if a scary similar movie like FREE WILLY was a new hit, FLIPPER is another harmless, but occasionally empty summer splash movie for the kids. Although the animals (this is the main dolphin, a clumsy pelican, and a realistic-looking hammerhead, typified as the villain) and flawless underwater cinematography steal the show, there's not much to steal in FLIPPER anyway. <br /> The story is completely predictable, something that even a 6 year old is obvious nowadays. The (human) cast, led by Elijah Wood, a predecessor of Elijah Wood and an unemployed Paul Hogan, rarely has anything to do but stand around and look pretty. Their acting skills, whatever they may be for this film, are rarely shown on screen unless you consider the "acting" talents of the happy Bottlenose Dolphin. I think I'm not trying to recommend FLIPPER because dull family entertainment is not fair, but over 10 years old (no, do the 8), it's better to rent or buy something else. In addition, the movie is about 95 minutes long. That may give you enough time for something else without worrying about your children. That alone could be worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** from 5.
