I had seen this movie just a few days before Halloween 2004. I noticed it at lunchtime and it was an interesting description in my menu bar, so I decided to check it out. Really just a movie that's only suitable for late night TV ... you know, after Conan, but before the infomercials deal. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has very little to do with web, it has a lot to do with spiders, refer to my headline when you need a refresher. <br /> <br /> I found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating. A hidden atom generator, a scientist and a credible portal ... Would have been a good start for a cool fantasy, but then it's downhill after 15-20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad and unencumberable result achievements, poor quality queen who had reinforced her breasts ... given the fact that spiders do not wear breasts. As well as bad sound effects. An obvious low-budget movie, though the cast has been trying. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> 4 Electricians tripping over a hidden nuclear generator while doing a job. They play with the buttons and open a portal. 2 workers fall into the portal and it's closing ... to find out what's going on, the party that's still in our world is seeking help while the other party is watching their surroundings. <br /> <br /> Help does not arrive You open the portal and meet in a parallel dimension. They encounter a race of human spiders called soldiers. After a death and a chase, they are rescued by survivors. <br /> <br /> Now it gets boring ... they hide, talk a bit, try to build another portal and then attack the stick. After losing two more electricians, they open the portal and flee to return to our world ... about 200 million years ago. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting?
