National Lampoon's Dorm Daze is by far the worst movie I've ever seen, and I watched the movie Kazaam. Anyone who reads this, thinks that this movie was in any way good, in any form or form, has no idea what a good movie is, and should never see another movie because he is actually that stupid to call wrong with this movie. First of all, the plot is omnipresent and can not follow all the multiple "misunderstandings" at all. The drama is terrible, to say the least, and the whole thing was done badly. Everyone who has worked on this movie should not be in another child's movie Ever Again! <br /> <br /> It's too hard to sum up this movie in just a paragraph or two because it's so bad. but for anyone who reads this, please DO NOT REQUEST THIS MOVIE !! If you want to watch a good movie, turn everything else on. Even in the US, there are better films than these. <br /> <br /> _friend.
