Ah, such an original title for a very crappy movie. The synchronization is hilarious as the voices and mouths never match. As a result, I had no idea what was going on as I watched this mess develop. There are flashbacks in the flashbacks, and only at the very end does a real-time take place. The Aztec ceremony made me laugh. I rewound it twice and got the best workout I've ever had. The singing aztec lady is weird and the dance and costumes are a scream. A guy gets a face full of acid, there are many fights, you have no idea who a character is (not that I'm really interested in it), and it's a total mess. Oh, and the real fight does not take place for a while, so you can get up during the movie, take a nap, take a trip. You will not miss anything exciting.
