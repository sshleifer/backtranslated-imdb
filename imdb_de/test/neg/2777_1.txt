I'm not sure if I have ever seen such a bad movie. Terrible spectacle, everywhere plot, terrible special effects. There are some "bad moments" here, but not really enough to keep the interest alive. The woman who plays Tracey looks disgusting. There are some pretty disturbing scenes with a dwarf that makes you feel so hurt. On the positive side, the operation scenes for the special effects are quite amusing, as well as the chase, in which a car "tries to push us off the street" without actually making contact. I think the budget was not enough to destroy cars. Oh, and what looks like a postcard of the Taj Mahal is shown every time they cut into the fictional foreign countries.
