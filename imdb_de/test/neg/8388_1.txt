To this day, this is still the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen. So annoyed I even complained to Blockbuster, because he has equipped it. Me and some friends rented it after we believed in the back cover and thought we had a good horror movie. The storyline seems to be changing during the film and there were many irrelevant upholsteries. The movie ended pretty abruptly. I suspect they run out of film. The sound quality was bleak and the first female figure had a very strong Spanish accent, though she was talking nonsense anyway. The guy gave a short eyebrow to his bizarre murder attempts. After spending all this time studying the workshop and the many power tools, he decides to put a plastic bag over his head. All in all, at second glance, I think you have to watch this movie to really believe it exists.
