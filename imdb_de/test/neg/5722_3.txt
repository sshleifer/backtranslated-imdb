Okay, I admit, I like Brigitte Neilsen in an unhealthy way, I only have one thing for 6 'tall women with swords. I said so. <br /> <br /> What's up with the movie? Almost every mistake you could make was made. You take a successful movie series (conan) and pull it through the mud with a bad script, bad casting, bad effects and the worst of everything ... you bring a cute kid in for comic relief in there. That kind of thing almost killed the Indiana Jones series, you know. Cute kids are for Disney movies, not real movies. Neilsen has taken the movie at least seriously, even if it seems nobody else has done. The plot had repeatedly led Schwarzenegger to pull Red Sonja's fat out of the fire, and this undermined her character considerably. A warrior does not need a guy to get her out of the mess, that's her job! Not reusing the Conan character in this movie was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh The film was never in the right mood and its tempo was rather disjointed and sloppy, in contrast to Conan, the barbarian, who had several story lines that flowed gracefully. When it comes to fantasy movies, it's okay to have cheesy costumes, it's okay to have Harryhausen animations, and it's okay to have stupid exorbitant sets that do not make sense, but to have a horrible screenplay is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a classic, but the script felt like it was written by a 12-year-old.
