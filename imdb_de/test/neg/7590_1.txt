This must be the worst movie I have ever seen. The part where they lose their daughter? tear off with the poltergeist overtone? just push it with stupidity over the edge. I saw it in Showtime and still had the cheese softcore porn scenes with me. I have to say, it made me laugh. The 3D effects of the 80s were very out of place. Contain an invisible cat and a spinning vortex. Wow, I wonder if the people who did this actually feel fulfilled in life. The actress who plays the woman seems familiar but still annoying. Her screaming could be used in hell as a torture device for more than retired Nazis. Nevertheless many thanks Showtime for the super crappy horror movie. I will always enjoy the time when I have seen the greatest amount of time and money I have ever seen.
