OK, let's see ... a handsome young stranger is new to the city and walks around on the local promenade. He meets a pretty girl, meets the hideous leader of the hip young vampire club, is dared to follow them into this cave, gets into a conflict with the pretty girl, an epic fight follows ... <br /> < No, they are not Lost Boys, though you can barely tell the difference, as I think even some of the carnival music is the same. (Do you have to pay royalties if you try a movie?) Even the end of this stink bomb is ripped off by Lost Boys. The make-up is below average, even for a low-budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional, and just like many "oh, I had those horrible experience" scenes of teen anxiety needs a movie? The humor is flat and stupid and everything else is sadly predictable. Yawning. <br /> <br /> The only scary thing about this turkey is the promise (threat) of a sequel, an idea that will hopefully enforce every trader in the country.
