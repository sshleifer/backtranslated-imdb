80s Sleazy (Glam) Rock is like house music or current boy bands of the 90s: It is boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it "cult" these days is that it's been a long time and we can laugh about its stupidity. Too bad that "Rock Star" did not laugh at all, because it has to be one of the most boring films in recent years. Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is a singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band. When he is kicked out of the band at the same time, he also joins the real Steel Dragon singer and becomes the next lead singer. You already know how that will end when Chris loses it with sex, drugs and R & R and forgets his longtime girlfriend / manager Emily (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> There is a way to much (boring) music in this standard formula apology for a movie and should be avoided at all costs. Look at the (overvalued, but even more fun) almost Allah or even better a movie about real people who play real music and have real emotions, that doing you do. What a stinker. 10.2.
