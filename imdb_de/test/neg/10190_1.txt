I thought I would watch a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie that tried to get the audience (me) to accept Christ in my life or go to hell. The whole UFO thing was a big red herring !!! The acting was pretty pathetic. In fact, it looked like some people from a Protestant church came together and decided to make a movie. All the characters spoke as if they were in church, talking to other church members. It was not a real dialogue at all. I wish I had read some reviews before watching this movie so I would not have wasted my money. On the other hand, if you want to immerse yourself in the entire church scene and see a demonstration of how you are expressing your views (no matter how restrictive) to other people, then look at it.
