This must be the most boring movie I've ever eaten. It is dreary and bleak, has no excitement, the spectacle of Hulce is terrible, as Hulce can not produce the right accent for this film. The story is stupid and I would certainly not recommend this crap to anyone if you do not want to die of boredom.
