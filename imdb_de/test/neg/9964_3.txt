A paranoid scientist creates a Wolfman by transferring Wolf's Blood to a gentle, quiet, but very large gardener to prove a hypothesis. Thus, the gardener begins nocturnal tantrums, and the scientist tries to use it to return his testimonies, but is rejected by his former colleagues because he has manipulated with nature. The islands of Dr. Moreau, Frankenstein and various Wolfman films merged into a horribly old-fashioned, stupid morality. <br /> <br /> Although the subject is anything but pedantic and unoriginal, this movie is not too bad. and interesting to see as a representative of the horror film production of his time. Like most mad scientist films, this is a weak warning to play around with Mother Nature. It has neither the strength nor the intellectual challenges of Frankenstein, but it does extend its reach anyway. The acting is passable, just like the cinematography, and the movie moves in an entertaining clip. Part of the dialogue is absolutely ridiculous, but hey ... it's just a movie - and a B minus one. There are also some nice shots of a wolf and a bit of humor that keeps the movie from taking yourself too seriously - always a plus for this genre.
