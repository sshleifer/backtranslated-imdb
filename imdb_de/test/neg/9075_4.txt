I chose this movie because I was looking for a love triangle between a girl and two boys. I have experienced this situation and got lost in it, and I hope that a similar story will inspire me. <br /> <br /> My main concerns are: - Why (a) and how (b) the triangles? - Why (c) and how (d) does the triangle degenerate? <br /> <br /> (a) The film offers a simple answer: "because it's better!". <br /> <br /> (b) This is an open triangle: the three divide things together. Mine was a closed one: Everyone knows the others, but the three are never together or talking about the missing person: <br /> <br /> (c) The film does not offer spoken explanations but prefers visual and emotional assumptions The end comes with sensuality, sexuality comes in the triangle, or more precisely, when deep feelings for a member are associated with intimacy, and how for the latter and the former they can be shared. I agree with that. <br /> <br /> (d) In the film and my story, silence is proof that something is wrong. And in an ironic and painful way, the tool for these sad times is always the phone: I lived this terribly planned phone call: "Call me: I'm waiting for you"? and when the time comes, the phone is silent. A variation is also displayed when the line is connected but you do not want to speak? All these scenes were very hard for me to see. <br /> <br /> If the movie was a great help this way, it also got a lot of mistakes: <br /> <br /> - I've been zapping on the boy's family issues <br /> <br /> - why is the shower scene on the DVD cover cut on the film? <br /> <br /> - how does Mickael finally get to the hotel? <br /> <br /> - does Cl√©ment always see Salome? he says "no," but has her address; and who is the girl with him in the bar: his girlfriend? How does she know the address ??? <br /> <br /> - what happens to Vanessa after all: The ring at the last shoot is proof of the engagement ??? with whom ?????
