Human traffic is a pure "experience"? only this time it is pretty limp. <br /> <br /> The main topics studied are paranoia, male impotence and jealousy. but only mild and bad. <br /> <br /> Much of the film seems to imitate trainspotting (drug / club culture)? However, it does not take into account the low times / come-downs that Trainspotting has to deal with (eg death / dependency issues, etc.). It even tries to present a similar monologue to Ewan McGreggor's classic "Choose Life" language. but `The milk bars are on me! Yes!' ?? what is this about? The characters try to analyze their lifestyle, but when their lifestyle is so flat? Your analysis becomes boring and repeats itself. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (for a movie that tries to be cool) is pathetic. These include the sizes Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland? Come on people ?? Good dance music is better than this! <br /> <br /> The characters become annoying and annoying (especially in the middle of the movie) and the lack of caring for the characters threatens to break br /> There are some funny scenes? but there are few and far between. The mother who caught the son in the bedroom was quite amusing. <br /> <br /> But please? The Star Wars analogy scenes are deadly to me. I found it much sharper in some of Kevin Smith's films (eg office workers and Chasing Amy). After the sign ?? Yoda is a drug addict, so is he short and bald? huh ?! <br /> <br /> My score ?? 4 out of 10 ?? do yourself a favor and see Trainspotting or Go instead!
