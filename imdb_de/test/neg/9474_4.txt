First, let me get that from my chest, I hate Octopussy with absolute passion. What is so frustrating that it had so much potential and a very good opening sequence, unfortunately it goes down after the opening sequence. First, there was absolutely no conspiracy, just an apology for Moore to tell his stupid jokes. Next, there are several sequences that would cause a Bond fan to fail, such as the sequence in which Bond appears to disperse a clown-disguised bomb. The bad guys are pretty poor, Louis Jordon can not prevail, as Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi are as poor as his henchman. It's weird that when people are debating what the worst Bond movie is, and Octopussy will be overlooked if he can easily run for their money.
