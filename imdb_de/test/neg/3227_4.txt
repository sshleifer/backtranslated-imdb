Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed his second film, One Crazy Summer, with John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong again in a supporting role. Cusack and Bobcat Goldthwait are the last graduates to go to Cape Cod to spend the summer with Goldthwait's grandmother. On the way, they come across Demi Moore, who is being followed by John Matuszak and a motorcycle gang. Soon, the three assemble to save a house when it's turned into another lobster restaurant by an engaging, spoiled family that thinks "work" is a dirty word. The film contains several funny vignettes, such as the Millionaire Dollar Radio Competition Gag and the Godzilla Sketch. <br /> <br /> Like Holland's first movie Better Off Dead, John Cusack adds immeasurably to the film. Otherwise, this is a film of a movie full of imaginary situations and idiotic characters (as opposed to quirky). Moore even sings a few bars in a nightclub with some awful synthesizers. Goldthwaits gags fade after a while, and Armstrong was never an actor who appeared in any form except Grade Z stuff. The tow-truck twins are extremely annoying and obnoxious rather than the lovable outsiders they're supposed to be. This is more of a hit or miss, Kitchen Sink Comedy, which could have used a better script and a better direction. * 1/2 out of 4 stars.
