Author and director Jay Andrews, aka Jim Wynorski, offers more of his signature inhibition with a decent cast that is threatened by computer reptiles produced by grade Z computers in "Komodo Vs. Cobra" as one generic rip-off of "Mysterious Island" meets "Jurassic Park" as you can imagine. The main problem with this predictable yarn that monsters feed on mankind is the unbelievably false special effects. The cobra and the komodo are unbelievably terrible. The graphics people, however, are good at integrating the monsters with their victims, not that it's the least believable. "Komodo Vs. Cobra" clearly had a budget that was so low that practically everything that did not look human looked as wrong as any of the others. This cheesy monster epic takes place on a remote island where the US military conducts top-secret DNA tests on animals. The result is that gigantic komodos and cobras thrive in this tropical island paradise. At the beginning of the action, the primary scientist is eaten by a cobra, who likes to swim. Afterwards, we will be introduced to a group of "Greenpeace" such as environmental protesters and a journalist. Jerry Ryan, organizer of Planet One, paid five giants with the promise of charter boat skipper Jim Stoddard (Michael Pare of CBS TVs "Houston Knights") and promises another five giants on this forbidden island bring to. Meanwhile, the US military suspect that something is wrong on the island, so they send their own team of men eaten by the oversized predators. Our heroes meet the last remaining scientist on the island. Susan Richardson (Michelle Borth of "Wonderland"), the daughter of the scientist responsible for this crazy science project. She tells them that the military will target the island's destruction. The title match between the two overgrown predators takes place in the last fifteen minutes, after our heroes, who are constantly crushed by the monsters, find a helicopter and take off in time before the military pulverizes the island. In this inferior creature function, there is no tension, tension or something worthwhile. The best thing about this Yawner is the orchestral soundtrack of composer Chuck Cirino; it gives "Komodo Vs. Cobra" an epic feel. Usually, Jay writes and manages Andrew's tolerable dizziness, but far below his low standards. The sexy women have a better survival than the boys. In one scene our heroic group is demanding a river and we do not see any wet T-shirts. Drat! In this filth nothing stands in the way of a memorable dialogue or relationship. I think the military salutes far too much when they come together to conspire. Let's hope that Michael Pare got a good payday from this garbage. The end, when one of the scientists takes on the characteristics of a lizard, is strictly retrospective. It's not that bad, it's good, it's just bad.
