I think Homegrown is a bit misleading for this movie - more like "Plantation Grown" - but it does not have the same sound. My guide described it as a comedy, but the wretched labors of these unfortunate buffoons are not my idea of ​​a belly laugh. More in the genre of the Farcical Thriller / Drama. The characters developed well enough - an all-star cast made it so promising, just a pity that the conspiracy was obviously absurd. Ted Danson made a good cameo, as did Jamie Lee Curtis in her walk-in section. Jon Bon Jovi has the amazing ability to measure the THC content in the front seat of his car! I think if you take some of them before, you should be able to assert yourself here - not for the weapon-shy paranoid types.
