Boy, boy, this film stinks. This movie is one of the worst pieces of garbage I've ever seen in my entire life. Please, even if your life depends on it, NOT, and I repeat: NOT by no means this terrible piece of garbage. Only look at this thing if it appears as an MST 3000 episode. That's the only way I could get through it all. If I had to see it without this show, I would have stopped before it was over. It has a use: A cure for insomniacs !!!!!
