With such a title you will be forgiven the idea that the film is about the great painter Goya. After half an hour you decide that it is more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more scope, it may just be a snapshot of time. With lurid characterizations, too many axes to grind, and a low respect for the fact, Milos Forman washes a colorful, but shambolic mishmash that fails in all three aspects. Milos Forman (who lost his) Jewish father in Nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and get away with it. Won prices for it. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of various repulsive regimes, especially communism. He also did the equally exaggerated, but quite impressive, One flew over the cuckoo's nest. So, how does he come at the age of 74 to offer us this mess? In Goya Ghosts, Goya is just a step away from the buffoon. The main character is Brother Lorenzo, who is passionately played by Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is just as alive as Goya's model Ines (and later in the movie her own daughter). The weak connection with Goya is that he paints both. Lorenzo then tortures (and rapes) Ines, whom he suspects of being a Jew. Her father tortures Lorenzo. Napoleon runs in to free Spain (short). Ines leaves the dungeon where the church left her and looks for her child. Goya is still painting, but has become deaf. His main concern seems to be helping Ines. And so on. <br /> <br /> Historically, Goya was also a historian. Since Forman had sadly abandoned the idea of ​​a biopic of the painter Goya, this fact could have been used to pull the whole movie together. a big piece of history from the perspective of Goya. But the painter is too tangential to get weight. Similarly, should a document about the horrors of the Inquisition be prepared? In comparison with other despotic orders over time, the Holy See has hardly been given a confession. One might wonder if Forman is competent enough to become familiar with a factual account of anything. <br /> <br /> "I thought this could be the centerpiece of a wonderful story," he says in the production notes. "There were many parallels between the communist society under which we lived and the Spanish Inquisition." But the story is too weak to keep our attention. In spite of our expectations and against the background of an important event (the life of a great painter, the horrors of the Inquisition and even the French Revolution), we are instead asked to feel involved in a common (though lovable) confusion of Goya. The result is that we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Background details are treated abhorrently. Goya became deaf in 1792 (at the beginning of the film), not 15 years later. Napoleon is as credible as a slice of a cereal box. We see how the church condemns the death penalty (if the church usually insisted that the secular arm do this dirty work). Battles are overly choreographed and bold. An unkempt naked bush hardly makes up for that. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the production values ​​are usually good. The colors are lively, the pace is excellent (at least until we give up on finding a worthwhile plot.) Bardem is excellent, and Portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a crazy woman. It does not say much about Goya, but what it says is nice, though superficial and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I once had a late, drunken conversation in which my friends and I asked each other. If you could choose a director for your life, who would that be? After his report Forman would unfortunately be at the bottom of my list.
