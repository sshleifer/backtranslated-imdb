After seeing the Blues Brothers' DVD release and her mention of "Wired" in Belushi's bio, my friend and I wanted to learn more about John Belushi. I had heard of "Wired" but did not know much about it and found it at the back of the local rental business. I understand that Dan Akroyd was really shitty about this movie, and I thought it was because he did not put it in a good light. But that had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off well until they turn into John's body at the morgue. When he wakes up at the autopsy table and decides to run for it, the film's utter tastelessness begins. John sees his life and all the turmoil he has created with "Angel", a Puerto Rican taxi driver with malicious humor, criticizes him and tries to try to get him to cross. <Br /> <br /> The two actors who portray John and Dan do not see anything close to the real actors (even with all the other relatives, such as Lorne Michaels), which makes it difficult to really get up she and she focus on how they were in real life ... but that's the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> I think this should be an "artistic" movie - John is constantly plagued with drugs (ie the powdered soaps in the bath as cocaine) in a way that was also hard to trace. The flashbacks are choppy and make it hard to understand. <br /> <br /> Probably the tastiest scene was when John (literally) was forced to autopsy and has pain while he lifts his heart to weigh it. I say it's unusually large due to drug use, overweight, yes, we get the point without the grotesque representation. <br /> <br /> There are very few other actors we know in the movie (where Carrie Fisher is.) For example, they were incredibly close. And Jim Belushi would have been a great person to show that it looks very cheap (we felt the graphics were from the early '80s or late' 70s). It was shot in about a week and all in all John showed it Page not at all. I felt I knew a little more about him as he watched the episodes of Saturday Night Live. <br /> <br /> As a final clue, Bob Woodward encounters a narcissistic way by engaging in the film and discussing with John how he writes his story story. For someone who was supposed to be a very high-class man in relation to the bust on Nixon, his Calibur of Person could agree with every writer of the National Enquirer and therefore lose my interest in any of his works from that point on. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. If you want to see more about John, watch his films, watch clips from Dan Akroyd talking about him, or hope someone has the taste to make another movie about John heading in the direction of "Man on the Moon" is about to happen and ultimately what we expected was I think that was a "moral" movie - you know, do not take drugs, but I think the creators of this movie did not understand that his death was a series from people (like Carrie Fisher) has been induced to stop using drugs for that very reason.
