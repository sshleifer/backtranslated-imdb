Despite the small budget, this film could have been seen if there was a story to tell here. It started pretty well and pretty committed and believable. The actors and characters were interesting, although character development did not develop very strongly. My favorite scene was when they ate all their rations. Some seemed to hate it, and some seemed to think it was not so bad. The story starts very airtight. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then it sank into a little horror, which is usually a death sentence for most sci-fi dead. Suddenly no scientific basis for any of the events. No really credible endgame for the villain? No real explanation for what's going on. If a movie needs to use the F-word for every other word, it's usually also turned down from there. I'm still insulted, believe it or not. I often wonder, what inspires people to do bad sci fi? Is not there a universe of fantastic stories there? People do not feel that they are wasting their time and everyone else is doing it when they publish such things. Why do we get so much mediocre science fiction? No female actors / characters? None at all? This had the potential to be another "Predator", but unfortunately he stayed far behind. <br /> <br /> My last comment - bad editing and ultimately too little budget to build a real campfire? What gives? <br /> <br /> My advice for all low-sci-fi production companies. Make sure you have a good story before you start, and work on bad special effects. It is better, we see nothing but something that seems unreal or unclear.
