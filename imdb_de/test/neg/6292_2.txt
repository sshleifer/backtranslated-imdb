Disgusting British film from a Japanese novel about a very distressed young man who is under the influence of a classmate like Hitler's classmates and plans to hurt the lover of his widowed mother. A few good scenes (Sarah Miles discovers that her son has been watching her and confronts him with rage, the pasty boy tries to seduce Kris Kristofferson by his friendly demeanor), but what is not the occasion to trigger a shock? Ugly and uncomfortable, it does not benefit anyone, especially not (especially Kristofferson, whose hollow looks and usual pebbled sounds are out of place in a psychological mish-mash like this one). Director Lewis John Carlino seems cold, without feeling too absurd, and believes such a thing could actually happen. If he's right, that's a lot more shocking than anything in Sailor. * from ****
