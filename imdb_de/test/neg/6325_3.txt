If you're reading the "Mad Max" plot summary, you've just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the movie. They also found out that "Mad Max" is taking place in post-apocalyptic Australia. This is helpful because you have no idea what's going on. The film, made in 1979, really tries to be Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" (1971), only the film in its weirdness actually makes sense and leaves an impression. This movie is neither and ends with a car / motorcycle trick that crashes like any vehicle in the movie. <br /> <br /> The first thing wrong with "Mad Max" is that he's trying to sell himself as a revenge story, if no revenge seems to take revenge until the last 20 minutes. If the first hour was condensed to 20-30 minutes and then added the last 20 and then another hour, "Mad Max would be a cool action movie with a great vigilante protagonist instead Mel Gibson must wait and behave for 2 / 3 of the film like a sissy and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge, I still have to watch the sequel "Road Warrior" and I have to admit that I'm just looking forward to it because I want to know what he's doing next : This first movie was largely a waste of time. <br /> <br /> George Miller does some great action stuff here, but his exaggerated imagery is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something terrible like a burned hand or something It totally ruins those moments ... It's a terribly stereotypical B-movie technique No matter what you think, it's a great action-sci-fi movie At least it makes one point, but that's not necessary. Violence, made by random, crazy bikers, does not say anything valuable. Even the rogue toecutter Alex feels from "Clockwork" just ugly and completely inconspicuous preformed. The PG violence does not allow the violence of this gang to establish itself and get a reaction from the viewer, it just chews it, if anything at all. <br /> <br /> I give the sum of the stuff that has the stuff to The film crew blasted around and rushed into things, and Miller does a great job of feeling the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre at best and after an hour of mediocrity you get something good and the movie ends 20 minutes later. I keep my fingers crossed, "Road Warrior" will meet the expectations, where the film ends, otherwise more time will be wasted. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
