OK, if you read that, I could've stopped crying. This movie was so horrible that it was pretty annoying. The creatures are a bit sweet, but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment among the prisoners and their guard after they got stuck on this daffodil island. Even if Barbara Bach was messing with her hair, it was not a reward for buying this sterile dog. She walks around with a whispering breath that I've never used before with my voice, and just does not wash herself when screaming a bloody murder. (Hey, the leading man was cute too, but I'm still not reassured.) This is a rip-off of the good old island of dr. Moreau. Poor Richard Johnson, who was certainly born for better things, is bad luck as a villain. I mean, how bad can a bad person be? (Ask Richard Johnson). Joseph Cotten tries not to appear embarrassed as he stumbles through his cameo. In the name of all that is holy, this damned bomb must not be rented.
