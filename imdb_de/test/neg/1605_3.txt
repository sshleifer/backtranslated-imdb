I was hoping that this show is a bit realistic. It stroked me as another mainstream show after I saw it. I did not feel the characters at all. Is this enchanting idea of ​​America how terrorism works? The main character does not behave like a fundamentalist at all, and how he acts for a terrorist is beyond my comprehension. None of the other terrorists proved to be real. One of the members, a blond, all-American white boy, would never be accepted by Muslim terrorists in real life. Another member, a French ex-skinhead, does not fit into an Islamic terrorist movement. In addition, the terrorists have sexual relations with white American housewives, which I find very strange. This is just another stupid misleading American television program. It's about as realistic as Prison Break.
