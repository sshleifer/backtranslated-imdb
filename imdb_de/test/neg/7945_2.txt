Los Angeles, 1976. Indie film brat John Carpenter, fresh from the film school and with a movie - the no-budget parody of 2001 - Dark Star - under his belt - ends a pithy actionist named Assault On Precinct 13. The story In a nearly deserted police station besieged by an invisible LA gang, it was a small hit on the drive-in circuit and was praised by the few critics who cared about it, but the movie world was barely set on fire. up smash Halloween (1978). At Precinct, Carpenter was still learning how to capitalize on his almost nonexistent budget by employing actors from the lower shelf area, holding the action in a hellish little spot, and moving the film forward at a close tempo with a combination of intelligent editing camera turned on genre know-how. <br /> <br /> No one wants or needs to be more hungry in Hollywood, especially if the week's food bill on the 2005 version of Assault On Precinct 13 exceeds the total cost of the original. That means a certain laziness of the filmmaker - you have a stupid big union crew, a studio and a marketing company that do everything for you. That's why twenty years after seeing Carpenter's movie, I can still see every glorious moment, from the little girl who was cooked cold when he bought an ice cream, to the relentless, knocking synth scores. One week after the 2005 attack, I remember Larry Fishburn's immovable ping-pong ball eyes and something else. <br /> <br /> "Forgettable Popcorn Actioner" fits perfectly to the top of the poster. It's New Year's Eve in Precinct 13, a station that's closed with a skeleton bar to see the last hours. On call is Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), a former Narc who is now deeply distressed and jumped on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his partners were iced in the opening scene; Iris (The Sopranos' Drea de Matteo), a nymphomaniac with something for criminal types, and Jasper (Brian Dennehy), a crunchy old-timers one step away from retirement. As in Carpenter's Assault ... a bus with four felons is headed to the station. All drunken eyes are on Gangster Kingpin Bishop (Fishburne, still growing up from his time in the Matrix), who barely survived an assassination attempt by a covert police officer and plans to suppress endemic corruption in her organized crime intentions Marcus Duvall (a tired-looking Gabriel Byrne). Soon the phones are out, the power lines are down, and both criminals and police are heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and paranoia-stricken, while they are against a squad of Duval's corrupt bulls with white balaclavas, bullet vests, infra-reds Bazookas and more high-tech gear than the Skywalker Ranch. We believe this to be the case when the helicopters whirl around the police station and shoot rockets into the windows. This is a secret operation that covers Duvall's tracks. He might as well have taken billboards on Hollywood Boulevard. As with the youngest Seventy genre reworking Dawn Of The Dead, Assault takes in 2005 the few basic elements of the original by John Carpenter and, to quote the Seventy, "does his own thing, man". The main question is - why bother? John Carpenters 1976 is a cult favorite among genre connoisseurs, but is hardly branded in the collective consciousness of the public. Carpenter himself was busy reworking the classic Western Rio Bravo by Howard Hawks into a tight, claustrophobic city thriller for only $ 20,000. French prodigy director and rap producer Jean-Francois Richet, a self-confessed fan of John Carpenter's work, seems less concerned about paying homage to either Hawks or JC - though the script is riddled with references to cowboys and insunins - and seems to aim for as much lightning and firepower as the million dollar budget can withstand. The result: some exciting moments with POV handheld cameras, an unexpectedly high (and bloody) body count, a few neat twists, but essentially a B action actioner with an inflated price tag. As far as Carpenter is concerned as a name check, that is a pure imagination among the filmmakers, which does not pay off. <br /> <br /> I say good times to Monsieur Richet, and I wish you every success in your music career.
