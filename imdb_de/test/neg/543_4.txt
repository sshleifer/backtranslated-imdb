I'm having trouble seeing the meaning of this movie. It's supposed to be a comedy, but I did not even laugh. The plot could be interesting in a well-made movie, but since this is played by comics, the result is absolutely incredible (as comedies should be). The comic series was also a hit and a miss in the episodes, and it can be said that everyone involved did bigger things. One to avoid. I've just found out that comments must be 10 lines long. The crux of these comments is to give an indication of whether the film is worth a look: do not write an essay that gushes or takes apart. If you want: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, the boys, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, you want to pass that on. On the other hand, if you like lame jokes like in Friends and Dodgeball, enjoy this!
