Maybe the target group of this Disney Channel TV movie will be happy with that, but when parents watch with the kids, they'll see clearly that this entire production is "spun". Obviously, it was not a dream to shoot this movie, but it was concocted somewhere in a boardroom and then produced with cold efficiency. There is talent among the performers, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas have little chance of presenting their talents. The incredibly cute Elisabeth Harnois gets involved as the first daughter, but Will Friedle plays another stupid figure, although he is by far not as stupid and annoying as in his role "Boy Meets World". The background for this film is Washington, D.C. and the White House, but there's no real "presidential feeling," and the Secret Service is slightly better than the Keystone Kops when it comes to fulfilling their duty. The Disney Channel offers many original TV movies, most of which are better.
