The Messengers is a bad, generic and boring horror movie. The film has a big problem: it does not scare. The performances and the script are totally stupid. He uses old tricks for fear and all the supernatural events are laughing. I would not call The Messengers a bad movie ... I would call it a random comedy because it's so bad it makes you laugh. The only good thing about this movie is that it is short, so this crap does not stay with us. For so long, there are many masterpieces of the horror genre that count on a low budget (like Subject Two, Lucky or May) unfortunately ignored while this crap in the box office is all a success commend this weak and pathetic horror movie called The Messengers.
