I as a Christian are outraged after seeing only the first half of this picture. The film's website says that they researched the film before writing, but I think they forgot to consult the ultimate source, THE BIBLE. I sat in two different versions of the Bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture. It was as if they came up with something that was not in the Bible and what the Bible said changed what modern movie viewers thought they wanted instead of the truth. Personally, I'm too young to remember the Ten Commandments of the fifties, but it can not be worse. I've written to the network and can only hope that they publicly apologize for this travesty.
