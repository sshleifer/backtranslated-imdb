I did not mean to look at O12 because I did not like O11 that much. I thought O11 was a nice but a bit boring little bank robber movie with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyhow, I was persuaded to watch O12 one evening and I regretted it a lot. The plot is not only boring, but also meaningless. I honestly do not know what it was about. I left the movie after three quarters and got coffee with another girl who did not like him. I can tell you much more pleasure. But even the people who stayed until the end told me that the conspiracy was still terrible and useless. My advice: do not pay attention. Take a look at Team America (weird ;-)) and forget Ocean's Twelve. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the most boring and pointless crap of manure has been on the screen for years.
