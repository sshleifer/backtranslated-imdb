"First Snow" has a fascinating beginning. A traveling salesman has told his fortune about an old man whose predictions turn out to be astonishingly correct. From that point on, the movie will run like a bloated "Twilight Zone" episode. I mean nothing but car rides, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a personable character who does not consider other people's well-being because of his own paranoia. The end is particularly weak and there is absolutely no gain for the boring audience. Do yourself a big favor and avoid it. Not recommended. - MERK
