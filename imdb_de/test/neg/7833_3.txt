A short resume: Almost nonexistent, poorly chosen musical soundtrack, steady-cam recording without Steady, but with lots of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman, NO plot, and nothing really happens. The film goes from one dialogue to another, sounding hollow, never reaching depth and never creating the illusion that you are really in a cobweb of conspiracy and that anyone having an affair is just a boring excuse to show that Leading actress in beautiful underwear. (What is combined with her rusty voice is certainly nice, but nothing to support a movie) The highlight for me is the opening scene, and the movie has deteriorated from there to a point where I have the film at 45 Wanted to give up minutes in the story. I regret having it outside.
