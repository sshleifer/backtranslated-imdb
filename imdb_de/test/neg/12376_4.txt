I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I remember that the scariest scene was the big bird that stopped men who dangled helplessly on parachutes, straight out of the air. The horror. The horror. <br /> <br /> As a young kid who went to these cheesy B-movies on Saturday afternoons, I was still tired of the formula for those monster-type movies, which usually included the hero's daughter and a professor happy determination when the monster died in the end. The romantic angle as a 12-year-old and the predictable actions did not interest me much. I love her now for the unintended humor. <br /> <br /> But about a year later, I saw Psycho when it came out, and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, got kicked off early in the movie. I sat up and noticed at this point. Since scriptwriters invented the story, you should make yourself as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. There are no rules.
