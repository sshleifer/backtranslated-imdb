A multitude of snakes leads to an uprising against tourists who "attack" their island due to the boot damage of their captain. The few remaining survivors, who are not attacked by the snakes, try to flee their escape mission to available boats that can safely divert them from the island. <br /> <br /> Presented directly with injected cans Wayne Crawford's SNAKE ISLAND, the visual humor of many snake girdles, features numerous breeds of predatory species that are in a prominent position and ready to attack their prey. Star William Katt, an author who explores snakes for an upcoming novel, has a lot of fun in his role, along with writer / director / co-star Wayne Crawford (as the captain of the tourist boat) as heroes, who take a serious look to attract crisis. Kate Connor is Crawford's attractive love interest, a lawyer on vacation. The other actors either serve as tourists or as crew, mostly as food for the snakes. <br /> <br /> As in many other films of this kind, director Crawford offers live snakes with computer-generated, and the violence is really tame. Crawford even integrates the viewpoint technique with the camera as the snake's eyes when facing the potential victim (with the actor looking directly into the camera). Never to be taken seriously, the winking approach was probably the best way to shoot SNAKE ISLAND because the premise is just too ridiculous to accept on its own. The effects and suspense scenes rarely work Because Crawford is often unable to successfully stage the sequences in which humans are confronted with the snakes. The serpent attacks themselves never take place on the canvas (one or two shells) or are so weak that they make little impression. That's a no-no for a genre like this. Fans of Katt will probably want to try it, as it features a face comedy that determines the overall sound of certain scenes in which it has to defend itself against the snakes. The CGI scenes, where we see a large number of snakes in a general area, are not very effective, which removes the realism that Crawford may have tried to detect. There are many better horror films with snakes than attackers than SNAKE ICELAND. Surprising moments of nudity, pointed to a scene in which tourists and crew relax after a long day with the bubble bath, without knowing what danger is imminent.
