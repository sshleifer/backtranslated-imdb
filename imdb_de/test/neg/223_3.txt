At the heart of every really great crime thriller is a carefully thought out, methodically thought-out, high-stakes superkrim, in which nine out of ten are committed by a group of sympathetic, cruel morale outsiders to those who dislike life It is good to go back to the man. The scriptwriter of James V. Simpson, who was written for Armored for the first time, has this half right. He made doubly sure that we have nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned, Iraqi war veteran Ty Hackett (Columbus Short of Stomp the Yard), who wants to take his house away from a bad bank (Brother, I 've been there And he gave Ty a good family friend in Mike (Matt Dillon), who is super nice and gets him a job at the tank company where he works with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and a weird French guy (Jean Reno). These guys like to have fun and play pranks, but they are also serious armored car guys, meaning they carry guns and are tough, and after a short while, as you've seen theoretically, Armored is one of them to think, as I did - maybe - just maybe - this will be some kind of awesome, fun Cornball-Heist movie with some features on its nose, which will keep the story going on its natural course to raise the personal efforts of all those involved in the hope of revealing a really very clever plan with many potential "holy things". I mean, the music alone is a textbook Heist movie - dark, curvy beats that work overtime as we're treated to close-ups of characters doing things like "I actually do it" and "Are you crazy?" "For about 45 minutes, the movie had a serious genre-flick potential. <br /> <br /> Then things really start to stink, these guys, these idiots, have no plan, there's no" Okay, do that we now ... "- scene, no blueprints, no explosives, no black vans or ski masks (despite their" dry run ", as you can see in a trailer) No, these guys will steal $ 42 million from their own trucks ( which are only tracked down by HOURLY contacts, even though they are equipped with a few fancy, great "GPS technologies"), and that's not even the case will sit down and discuss it. Damn, Mike just tells Ty about Of course, Tys has his house to think about, as long as Mike promises that no one's going to get hurt, he's on board, you know, somebody gets hurt, why, because they not only the trucks in an abandoned Fa Driving brik to hide the money, they have no plan. That's it. So far you have thought. Of course, things start to unravel. These cats deserve everything they get because they are so unprepared. <br /> <br /> This script feels like it's the product of some bad improvisation game: "Armored Car, robbed by its own guards ... GO!" Despite a semi-decent build, perhaps including the movie in one The story may be completely different, and soon enough, NOTHING makes sense or is even close to plausible. <br /> <br /> If filmmakers do not have a cool "hook" for their robbery, their characters seem stupid and clumsy. And when characters are stupid and annoying, it's hard for an audience to invest in them and their story. And when that happens, any tension is released from the film leaving a ridiculous, hollow shell. <br /> <br /> Skip it. 3.10
