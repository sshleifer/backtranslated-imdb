This movie was so horrible ... I want to beat hell whoever made this movie ... I was a real fan of all Ghulies movies ... but when I saw that, I just started crying, me Could not handle it..Not even ghoulies in there ... like the original creative monsters ... that's so frigging cheap ... I'm getting a witch ... that's bullshit, no one wants to see the witch ... they wanted to see what the movie is about ... "GHOULIES" I think I'm right or what? So we looked at the others ... now we really have to deal with this terrible story ... That makes me eat my own poop after spaghetti Monday !!!
