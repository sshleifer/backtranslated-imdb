This is an unbelievably standard western style that involves a bit of bad behavior, boring plot and silly action. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is how incredibly formulaic this movie is. It contains all the usual clich√©s, even a pub, and the movie really has no surprises. This makes it a boring and weak Western, not in the least because it's so bad. <br /> <br /> It's obviously a small production and the movie looks like it was filmed in 30 days. Directed and edited can be described as bad and all action sequences shown in the film are incredibly stupid. It will look a bit humorous for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> His story is not that interesting. It's a pretty friendly western (which means no blood), which for some reason all seems to be against the younger brothers who are portrayed in this movie as good and very friendly people. The story gets darker and darker the closer it gets to the end. The younger brothers really existed and were part of the James Younger gang, which included the famous brothers Frank and Jesse James. Of course, they were not as friendly in real life as in this movie. It was only custom for the early 40s to have sympathetic male figures. Only in the spagethischwestlichen age, the main characters were really lazy criminals. Strangely enough, this approach has always worked better than the early Western, where the main character is on the good side of the law. <br /> <br /> What makes the movie original is the fact that it was shot color. This was something very special for a Western of the 40s and still gives the movie something special. However, you may wonder why they shot this western in full color. The film is still shot in the style of an early black and white western, and I really believe that this film would have been a little more credible if it were shot in black and white instead. <br /> <br /> You could easily get along without this western. <br /> <br /> 4/10
