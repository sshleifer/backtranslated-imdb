I rented this movie under the impression that it was "Scarecrow 3: Dark Harvest" and thought that this was a continuation of the Scarecrow Slayer series (another extremely ridiculous and horrible series of films). I was not disappointed. It was just as terrible, if not worse, than I expected. I laughed the whole movie. Any bad drama, poorly shot and cut footage and terrible special effects make this movie worthwhile for rental. <br /> <br /> Special features include a pitiful view of the cast and the crew's six months of filming. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "The sins of my ancestors! They have gone down to this moment of time!"
