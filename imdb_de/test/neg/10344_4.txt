Corben Bernsen made a horror film about a chemical weapon that was released at a sporting event and made everyone into mad monsters. We watch radio station employees review reports. <br /> <br /> It has moments, but mostly it plays like a horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas, but they just do not work. In fact, the movie's ideas are better processed in a movie called Pontypool, which works virtually consistently and creates tension by showing us nothing. That shows us stuff and it just seems cheap. If I have a choice, I'd go back to Pontypool instead of seeing this movie again.
