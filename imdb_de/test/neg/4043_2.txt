This movie was so dumb, I could not believe what I saw when I saw it, it was like a huge train crash - I could not look away because it was just so terribly awful! I can honestly say that in my life I have never seen such a bad thing. It was so cheesy and the acting was so deplorable that I just thought, "This just needs to be a joke, right? No one would really make a movie on purpose, would it?" I really hope that's all just a bad joke and these people do not really expect people to see this with a straight face and I really hope that the people who were in this movie intentionally had terrible acting and not really believe that they are good actors ?! The drag queens are pretty fun to watch, as well as the cheesy special effects from a bad 80s science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Just look at this, if you've already seen every other movie in existence first and there's nothing left to see! I would give this a "0" if it were possible.
