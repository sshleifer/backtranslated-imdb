Overall, I needed three tries to get through this movie. Although it is not total garbage, I have found that some things are more useful to devoting my time to, such as: As the removal of fingernails with sandpaper. The involved actors have to feel about the same people who advertise herpes medications; People do not really pay to see that the prominence that you earn is not the best for you personally, but at least the commercials get airtime. <br /> <br /> The first one was bad, but that gave the word bad a whole new definition, but it has a good feature: If your kids persuade you to watch R-rated movies before you want it, tie it and pop this little gem The tears start. ;)
