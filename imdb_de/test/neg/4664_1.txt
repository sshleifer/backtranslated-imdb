Two films: "The fifth element", "Armageddon". The same topic: save the world. The same leading actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: "Armageddon" is very inferior to Luc Besson's film. Some spectacular special effects fail to hide a working and globally conventional script. Some parts of the movie show it. I am thinking of the president's speech and above all of Willi's relationship with his daughter "Grace". At the beginning of the film, he tends to neglect and protect her, which tires her. Then, at the end of the film, true love and understanding radiate in him. On the other hand, the film falls into the following trap: Michael Bay takes his topic too seriously. Of course, the film tries to be funny, but the result does not work, since the humor that is introduced into the film is often coarse and quite quiet, while in the "fifth element" the humor was crazy and involuntary and could be overlooked serious Side of the action. The film suffers from two other disabilities: it is often ridiculed (the Russian astronaut) and almost all actors are badly used. Bruce Willis is in contrast to the character of his "fifth element". He plays the He-Man, he opens it and sometimes he is unbearable. The other actors are hardly credible in their own roles, especially Willis' sinking crew. It seems that this crew is just for fun. One of them is considered very qualified, but he looks like an idiot. And poor Liv Tyler! She's at NASA just to be decorative. <br /> <br /> When the film was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed the weariness of saving the world. His fatigue was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie.
