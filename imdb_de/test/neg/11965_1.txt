First, and for the most part, I just want to say that I'm not retired because I've written well-deserved comments about horrible movies. Only the movie titled "Scarecrow gone wild" could bring me back, so here I am. <br /> <br /> After this has been said, I like to start with this comment. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really terrible, I mean, it would be bad. But I had no idea that I would spend 60 minutes out of a possible 90-minute movie laughing at the horror movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the biggest flaw in the movie (for me that is)). Ken Shamrock. If memory serves me right now, Shamrock is one of the most dangerous men in the world. Now, when the memory serves me again, he was in this stupid movie a stupid comic relief (or so it looked to me). I mean, how do you explain all his lines? My favorite line in this movie was "It took a long time". OK????????? The funniest thing about this line was that he said no more than five minutes before him that he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon-to-be-dead children about how the damn scarecrow could not be killed. If he knows, why should he try to fight it as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow). Like I said, he must have been the weirdest relief, except I do not think his UFC friends are laughing. <br /> <br /> Well, since I finished this well-deserved paragraph for the movie. <Br /> <br /> I admit I can not remember many scenes, and that's not good, considering I just watched the movie fifteen minutes ago. So I'll list the five most important things that are wrong with this movie. 1. If horror movie monsters have their own music, they will not hear the victims or the monster itself. So, why could pretty much everyone involved in this movie make that wretched whistle? I mean, I saw the scarecrow face and nothing said that he was the whistling guy. <br /> <br /> 2. Why in the world was there murders on a beach? I'm sorry, but the historic beaches are associated with party and holiday feeling. But I think this horror movie thought that it would be so successful that it would change all that. Plus it was me or the beach seemed to be as big as a living room. I mean, every time an actor or an actress walks around the beach, it looks like they're walking in the same place. <br /> <br /> 3. The girl runs into the gray tracksuit pants. That really bothers for the duration of this movie. I mean, she looks so ridiculous. And it did not help that she looked like she was the youngest in the group. I mean, how was she twelve or something. There is no excuse for someone being so skinny in front of the camera. I mean, the camera does not add about ten pounds or so, what was her excuse. <br /> <br /> 4. People trying to get record deals in front of the camera. Just when I thought this movie could not turn cheesier, the desire to be Gorth Brooks comes and oh man he was lame. I can not remember the whole scene, but from what I remember, it was not nice. This guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I have nothing to do with what's going on in the movie. The funniest part of the whole thing is how everyone seems to enjoy it. I mean, the only person who does not really know how to respond is the "token black guy". And that's sad, because if I'm not mistaken, he was the one who encouraged this latest addition to American Idoal. But here it is funny. While this guy is all in his new song or whatever. In the distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. And boy, he looks like hell. I mean, there's actually a moment when he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. So, what does he do with this jealousy? Well, I am glad that you ask. He waits for the guy to finish his song, and then he ends the guy. I do not want to reveal the death scene, but I can tell you that. If this scene does not make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will do it. <br /> <br /> 5. This movie was much longer than I expected. And it did not help that they were trying to pick up a few wretched bulls to extort another 10 minutes from this movie. I mean, I admit, I did not see the turn coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that I had hoped the movie was over. But no, they had to twist it. Needless to say, when I said that, I simply turned off the TV and said there was no way the film could get worse. Thanks to my very quick judgment, I can say that I will never know what would happen next. But I promise I do not care !!!!!!!!!!!!! The whole movie is good for a laugh, but please do not buy it. Just hype it to one of your friends and watch it there.
