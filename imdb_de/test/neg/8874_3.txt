This movie can be of historical significance, and it seems amazing how well the facts are together, the setting, the rocket, the space fits, the surface of the moon, everyone is shouting "a classic" - but in the end, doing the result a pretty boring movie for today's eyes, and the tech scenes of the '50s that you might hope for in a movie like this are far from sufficient to reward you with all the tricky dialogue and predictable storyline. The characters and plot may reward a scientific sociological analysis, but often have too little entertainment value. <br /> <br /> Many of the films look like a good movie for nine year olds. Sophisticated themes, human drama and violence are kept at a reasonable level even for children. <br /> <br /> The images of the Earth and the Moon seen from outer space may be more accurate than those in "2001," but what if their use is dramatically inefficient. In particular, 2001 seems to be an extended meditation on the themes of this film, and has not Star Wars somehow modeled the space-defining opening titles of this movie's opening titles? On the other hand, the inheritance is marginal. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a truly groundbreaking and mega-influential, mature sci-fi classic of the '50s, check out "Forbidden Planet."
