An example of all the worst gay stereotypes in a movie. <br /> <br /> And Charles, why are you talking to that weird pseudo-British accent and insist that the child speak like that? Has anyone else noticed that the entire soundtrack music is exactly the same? You should stay with the good old Hollywood Camp Drag material in which you are so good! The Mommy II, the sequel !! I see no value in spending time and money on such a project. There are so many real gay teen stories to tell, and we should see them, not this garbage. Gosh, what a waste of time. Embarrassing example of gay cinema.
