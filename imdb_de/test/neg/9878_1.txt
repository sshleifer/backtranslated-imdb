*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> I was so excited to see Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I could not wait because the book is one of my favorites. But when the movie started, I could not believe how different it was. At first I was like that, okay, so her parents are dead ... maybe it's okay. But then came the rest of the movie. When it was over, I was angry. Nothing was wrong except her name and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden. At the end of the book Gabriel was my eternal favorite ... and then the movie becomes a completely heartless idiot ?! The film also showed the shifters or werewolves, like those vile, evil creatures, as the book shows, as if they just wanted to fit in and protect their backpack. They would never kill people for fun. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a movie like them, they should have given it a different title and called the characters different. Because then I would go out and look at it again and buy it, but when I think about it, I can only see the bad. You could not pay me to see it again or buy it.
