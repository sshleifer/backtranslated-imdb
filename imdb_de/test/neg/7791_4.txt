I like Noel Coward, the joke. I like Noel Coward, writing the game. I like Noel Coward, the composer and singer, but I detest Noel Coward, the actor. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a man who should have stayed behind the scenes, writing his dramas and composing his music and composing his profound and hilarious observations. He should never have been in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, he is one of the outstanding talents of the 20th century, but the man just could not act and his voice ... With rs rolling and overly round sound quality ... well, it In my opinion, it would be easy to rub cheese. <br /> <br /> This is one of my least favorite offers from Coward, as he portrays a psychiatrist with little conviction. An affair with a much younger woman begins by the fact that the much younger woman is an old schoolmate of his lot Younger woman is made worse. Celia Johnson is as happy as she was always a cowardly battered woman. It is her performance that keeps this movie from being bitterly dull. I suppose her own little momentum in Coward's Letter Encounter four years ago qualified her for this role, as she must have raised some eyebrows with such a promiscuous woman. This gave her the chance to win back a few fans and gain some sympathy. <br /> <br /> She was such a wonderful actress and you can see why Noel Coward used her so much in many of her productions. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie, however, is drab and poorly played, predictable and on the whole boring to almost ass squeezing. <br /> <br /> If you want the Noel Coward you should take the time to see what we serve in, Blythe Spirit or This Happy Breed. Three Noel Coward treasures. With such beautiful films as I think, we can forgive him for this turkey. <br /> <br /> I only gave these four stars for the addition of Miss Johnson, but on the whole I would like to avoid them like the plague.
