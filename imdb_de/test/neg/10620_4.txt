Sometimes you get exactly what you expect. It is not to be expected that a film produced by and as the carrier of a rock band in the midst of a comeback will play an important role in the artistic field - and certainly not in this case. In fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself, which, like the 70's rock and roll lifestyle it seeks to portray, is characterized by excess, drugs, and overbearing antics, but unfortunately that's not Fall is almost so much fun. With a screenplay by Carl Dupre that is so cruel that another screenwriter is doomed to fail, and wastes the talent of Edward Furlong, the only highlight of this rock and roll tune that goes wrong is the music, especially the elaborate replica of a 1978 KISS concert.
