MTV's sci-fi animated series "Ã†on Flux" is brought to life with Charlize Theron as the title character, a freedom fighter who combats repression in the walled city of Bregna 400 years later. For her last mission she was sent to kill the leader of the city, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but discovered on the way secrets. <br/> <br/> Aeon Flux falls into the category of good, mediocre execution. Interesting story, but the movie was a bit boring. Many people say that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all. It can be a disappointing movie, but it's at best an average movie. I've never seen the cartoon version of the movie, so I can not compare the two. It's probably better because they have the opportunity to explain the story more. The movie is not that confusing, but it's easy to lose yourself if you're not familiar with the material. The acting was fine, nothing special. Charlize Theron does a good job and seems dedicated to the movie. The rest of the cast also gives decent performances, including Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film, including Sithandra, Aeon's friend. <br /> <br /> The problem with Aeon Flux is that it takes itself too seriously. It has the same serious tone throughout the movie and it gets a little tiring. There is no humor and the movie gets boring sometimes. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the movie is so serious, the dialogue sounds kitschy and the serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are pretty good, but that's not really what the movie is about. So do not expect just an action movie. The twist at the end is not mind-boggling, but it's still a nice ending and better than any other thriller that came out last year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are a bit strange, but they look nice and interesting. The visuals were also done well, so the movie looks good at least. The film can be a case of style and substance. Interesting to look at, but may not keep your attention for a very long time. In the end, it's not the best movie on the market, but for a good price. Rating 4/10
