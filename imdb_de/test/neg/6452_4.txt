A bad-tempered and verbally abusive film studio boss lets go of his male assistant with unpleasant dialects and holds the young man with constant threat of unemployment tight under his thumb. After a year of office terror, the workforce finally cracked. Writer director George Huang may have bitten off more than he can chew here. His "Swimming With Sharks" is not a disputation against Hollywood nor a tribute to the industrious subordinates ... instead, it's a stunt movie with a twist, a one-trick pony with tunnel vision. The environment does not look or feel like Tinsel Town (maybe because of a limited budget), and we never get a feel for this stressful environment as filmmakers know). Lead Kevin Spacey, who also served as one of the film's producers, offers a controlled and focused performance as the mighty mogul whose ego is out of control. He does a good job and yet the character does not sound right. We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high status do not match what we see; Who is this man answering? What keeps him from humiliating others for sports? What projects is he juggling except for the one script we see? The film is so emotionally stunted and understaffed that it looks like a stage play pumped out for the big screen - yet without enough characters or motivations. Maybe Huang wanted to keep things simple, but instead his film looks like a half-finished project that requires much more insight, humor and atmosphere. ** from ****
