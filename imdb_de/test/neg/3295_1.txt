What did he think?!?!?! How sad an actor of such great talent as Michael Rapaport, who stole our hearts in "Mighty Aphrodite" and fascinated us in "Ill Town", has sunk to this miserable level. The inscription on this sitcom is the crust that is on the bottom of the barrel after scraping. Shame on all involved. There is a trend: big movie actors who are no longer hot goods turn to television - often with catastrophic results (see the Stinkaroos on CBS and NBC, but ABC has a hit with "Boston Legal" - hip writing and great nostalgia Use of Bill Shatner). Wasting Michael Rapaport in this rip-off "All In The Family" is an insult to the audience and mostly to Michael himself.
