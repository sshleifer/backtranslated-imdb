I know that the line on my summary is not too polite. <br /> <br /> This film, written and directed by Scott Caan & with Giovanni Ribisi, Don Cheadle and himself, takes 88 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a dog in this puppy of a movie. He is sweet. <br /> <br /> The film opened in late April 2007 in two US theaters, recorded for a week and a total of $ 914 at the beginning of August 2007 on DVD. <br /> <br /> We only needed about 40 minutes before we turned off the DVD. <br /> <br /> This was the kind of movie that was played in the lower half of the double bill. You saw the main movie and let it know what this movie looks like. You may have gone out before we switch it off. <br /> <br /> The 3 actors and the young women in the movie have done everything and deserve better than this .. <br /> <br /> Ratings: ** (from 4) 54 points (from 100 ) IMDb 4 (from 10_
