I hope this is not a sign of what is to come. High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper (though I would not swear that was used here), so the season for all would-be Scorsese and Tarantinos open to talk of that stinker and call him "movie" would be the industry bring a big disadvantage. The photograph is a standard you would expect on a family trip to the zoo. I could build a new house with all the wooden toys. The remarkable thing is that nobody is the worst. They are all the same terrible. Like a whole bunch of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagals. <br /> <br /> What fascinated me most was the title. I'm an idiot for something like Frankenhooker or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was also pretty bad, but at least I laughed a bit, and the acting was just bad, not terrible. I can not comment on Monsturd because I have not received a copy of it yet. Anyway, I hope the people who did that did not make any money out of it. Otherwise, they might be encouraged to try it again. Please, guys, pledge the camcorder and go back to your normal job.
