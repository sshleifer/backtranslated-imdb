Pinocchia's revenge is not a good movie. It's not terrible either. <br /> <br /> The acting was at least on Pinocchio's piece of wood. The doll had all two expressions. Like most actors, except strangely ... the minor characters ... Most of them were overly enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty "B" and as I said before, the doll has really blown. <br /> <br /> The 2 best scenes in the movie is the knife by the hand ... looked pretty good, I think they spent about a third of the budget on it ... and the shower scene .. WOW ... I think they must have spent that another 2/3 of the budget on talking to the actress who did this scene to do it. Outstanding. Seriously, this is a slightly below average "b" horror doll movie ... hire Chucky if you have an urge to see puppets kill. <br /> <br /> The story had some interesting ideas, enough to watch me through to the end.
