"Eh-he-he-he-hey, dude - look at those aliens, they're like - people biting that stuff! Eh-he-he-he-he-he" <br /> <br /> That must be among the worst films of all time. For anyone with a small brain, this is an absolute bustle. Sure, you have the reviewers on the payroll who make glowing reviews and vote high for this atrocity, but it's easy to say who those sell-out opportunities are. Your ratings are too good. To give a movie like this, even a mediocre review that claims to have B-movie appeal, would be a glowing review! This is called a great movie that calls the hands of corporate shills. <br /> <br /> But enough of it. <br /> <br /> This movie had all the bad qualities a movie can have without being so bad it's fun just to laugh about it. The old Japanese 60s monster movies had a quality that was missing this movie. At least in these 60s movies you could laugh about how bad the rubber monster suit looked. Or laugh when you see the strings holding the spaceships, how the models dangled on the strings, and how the flames arched UP from the back. These movies made fun of how bad they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) actually seems to be a good movie - which makes him incredibly absurd. <br /> <br /> The effects were terrible by today's standards. Beyond terrible. However, not quite as bad as the monster movies of the 60s, so they lacked the comedic appeal. The plot and dialogue were as similar as I have ever experienced, and were made worse by being as predictable as you might expect. I will not even point out the plot and the logical gaps in this. It would not be fair to this regrettable conspiracy (and it would take too long to start). Most acting was terrible; Lou Diamond Phillips must have desperately agreed to touch it. <br /> <br /> The sci-fi channel quickly becomes a "cheap thrill-channel" and produces film for film without a hint of concept and intelligence. I can only wonder - why bother? <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this threesome. It will not get worse.
