This is a bad movie. It's not as denying as I would like. Tommy Lee Jones is as comfortable as possible with the script they gave him, and he had some decent action sequences that felt out of place due to their acceptable quality. <br /> <br /> Someone said that all the shortcomings of the script could be compensated if they hired every single workhorse actor in the company, unfortunately even really talented actors like Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard, Gammon, Steenburgen, MacDonald and Pruitt Taylor Vince And if we remember that Mr. Jones can not fix the wooden dialogues, and nowhere is the progress of the plans. In fact, I looked at one point, as I was sure the movie was running the last 2 hours, only to find that I was 51 minutes inside. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film's most painful point was the subplot about the Ghost Confederation soldiers, who seem to help little or no history. Apart from the fact that the confusing business in the end with the picture distracts something. * If you have not seen this film disregard this earlier statement, which may seem tempting and you know that this is not the case, you will not understand it better after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie is possibly a sequel to the movie "Heaven's Prisoners" starring Alec Baldwin in the same role that Tommy Lee Jones wore in this movie. I may have to see it first to see if it's as bad as In The Electric Mist, and second, because I can not seem to hurt my husband in Alec Baldwin (no matter how hard I try).
