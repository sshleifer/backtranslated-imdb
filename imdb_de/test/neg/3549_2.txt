Please, that you do not watch this movie ... It starts with a promise, and as it continues, you long to end the movie ... Predictable, not at all entertaining, wasted movie ... ... The Synopsis sounds good and that's why I saw the movie ... But it was far too predictable without a start ... No great tension ... no great direction ... nothing phenomenal with the actors ... shy away Do not worry about this low rating ... Nothing to write about this movie, so I'll fill in the rest of the text lines so you can imagine how much time this movie was wasting ... really confused about how good a premise that was and how bad a script was written out of it ...
