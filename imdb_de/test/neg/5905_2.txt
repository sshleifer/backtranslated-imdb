This movie begins with the main character comatose in an infirmary and accompanied by two folders. The unconscious protagonist is heard in a voice stating that the religious are gay. The orderlies kiss. I looked at it in a DVD version and suspect that it should be funny? it said? comedy "on the DVD case, after all, and so it goes on.If I had seen that in a movie theater, I would probably have heard that part of the audience roars with laughter because it's so funny and because you're supposed to be in a comedy While it's fascinating to think about what's funny and what's not, this film unfortunately only provides arguments about what's not the case. <br /> <br /> Brilliant Minds Can DO What's funny, people like Ernst Lubitsch Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proven that, but you have to get to know mechanics, I suppose, director and co-writer Dani Levy does not care about these mechanisms, he thinks certain things are just funny, the fact that Two religious people are gay and kissing a man in a coma, for example Do not get me wrong, some people can make fun of that, Dani Levy can not, not for me anyway. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have is m it has this movie is that I see no reason behind it, the main characters behave. I could not understand why the two brothers, an Orthodox Jew from West Germany, a copy of the third class of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany, did not like each other. They are both rather bland characters. Their children are boring, except for the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is now lesbian, but he wakes the daughter she has with her cousin). But also these incestuous relationships? If they're embarrassed - just get away with it as an excuse, because the scriptwriters could not think of anything better. <br /> <br /> The acting is not bad I am more of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than of a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction itself is not really bad, but maybe Levy should stick to directing movies and leave scriptwriting to someone else. Now I heard that he made a comedy about Hitler. Oi, Vai!
