This film clearly has an agenda that can be summarized as follows: never cross the border (physically or metaphorically). Let us avoid anything that is on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else. Suppose all "gringos" are evil, satanic or drug traffickers. Anything outside the border (and especially the US border) is dangerous and vicious. The people there will hate you or envy you or try to steal you or something else. "Based on real events" is just a perverted day that can be fixed on something to give it some credibility, or in this case just to help the movie's ideology push down some naive throats. The film's perversity lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and everything else into very black and white stereotyped categories: Mexicans in repugnant people, Mexican police into a group of corrupt policemen, Republicans into right-wing morons, Democrats almost hippie humanists and so on. Is there anything good about the movie? I hardly think about it, but you may think otherwise.
