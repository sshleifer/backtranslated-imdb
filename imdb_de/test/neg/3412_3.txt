After the first movie in BCI's new Aztec Mummy Collection, it's hard to believe how excited I was about the set and how annoyed I was when the release date was pushed back. I've seen a lot of Mexican horror in the last few months. Some great? The curse of the crying woman. Some entertaining despite obvious flaws? Night of the bloody monkeys. And some cheese? Choose a Santo movie. All these films have in common that no one can be described as "boring". That's not the case with The Aztec Mummy. It has been a while since I last saw anything that stimulates sleep. I did not expect or expect a great movie, but at least entertain me! The Aztec mummy takes any situation that might be interesting, and sucks life through repeated scenes of people doing nothing, and then extends those scenes to an eternity. I think that happens when you make an 80-minute movie with just 30 minutes of footage. Padding extraordinary! For example, what purpose has The Bat brought to screen for anyone who saw the movie as a masked wrestler type and to extend the runtime by about 15 minutes? <br /> <br /> I can only hope that the other two films in The Collection are more entertaining than this one.
