I would have found that any two-video set sold for only $ 6 would be bad. I even read the reviews before watching this movie, and it still has not affected me. I loved the book and knew it could not be as bad as people said. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. <br /> <br /> A patchwork of film, video and what appears to combine stock footage to make a three-hour tour of a chapter in James A. Michener's epic novel. Well, the time span was a chapter, but I do not remember many of the situations that actually occurred in this book. The packaging on my copy of the film gives Maria Conchita Alonso a top-notch statement - though it turns out she's only in a speech scene. On the second cassette. <br /> <br /> The actors are recommended for playing their roles well, despite a grubby, overburdened script. However, they are offended if they accept the roles at all.
