This takes place in Harlem in the 1920s. A black nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt police. <br /> <br /> Terrible vanity project for Eddie Murphy. It tries to mix comedy and drama and fails at both. The comedy is just not funny and the drama is boring and badly played. They think a movie with three comedy legends - Eddie Murphy, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor - would be great, but it's not. There is continuous cursing and in the OPENING scene, a boy is shot dead by a boy (this is displayed as OK). Also, we have demoted the beautiful Della Reese to a woman. One of the "comedic" climaxes has a long, listless and terribly vicious fight between her and Murphy. A boring, offensive and stupid mess. Not the worst Murphy movie, but pretty close. A 1 all the way.
