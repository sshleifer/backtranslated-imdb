This is just one of those movies that keeps you moaning and I wish I was over. The problems are numerous and the benefits are small. I think the main problem with this movie is that it has a cheesy storyline and they're trying to make it an epic movie that's about a movie about monstrous monkeys and smart monkeys that only make a sign of cheese. If you have cheese, make the movie more fun. Granted, the final scene with the monkeys and this laser was very nice to see and more things of this kind were needed. Instead, the actors do such a serious job that you get the impression that the movie is just a crazy plot in the midst of all the serious suspense the movie is trying to build. The plot revolves around a woman trying to find what happened to her missing ex-husband while searching for legendary diamonds. She uses these two types who have trained a monkey in sign language, and now wants to bring her back to the wild as cover to get into the country and begin the mediocre adventure of a lifetime. The only thing that makes this movie bearable is the character of Ernie Hudson and the laser attack at the end.
