Clint Howard, brother of the more talented Ron, plays the lead role of a spiritual case in this terrible horror horror comedy serving children ice cream and killing people. In an effort to be a movie that is so bad that it's good, this movie misses that goal by a mile and instead has to be considered so bad that it's ... well ... bad.
