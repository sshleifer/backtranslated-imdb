Hommage with ham over honest hacking. He softly felt good with his mild pornography until his lack of technical and economic realities, emotional and moral sophistication became apparent. Basically a jumbled remake of the '85's' of the '90's Real Genius,' with fewer and stupid geniuses and a cynical bad ending. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie would appeal to someone who is excited about the idea that becoming a billionaire is so simple that it's almost random, or maybe technical types who like to be portrayed as cool and sexy speculating on the reasons someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the film itself. The credits of the films is more interesting than the film itself.
