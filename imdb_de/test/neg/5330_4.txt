The many friendly reviews here have seduced me to see that. Boy, are they far away from Mark! Giving these 9 to 10 points and calling it "one of the best films of the 1990s" is simply not justifiable. The big problem here is a lack of speed and a paper-thin plot. It's like a slapstick on Prozac. Everything is predictable and listless. The plot is initially weak - two garbage men are looking at their neighbor, witnessing a murder and unraveling a conspiracy of garbage disposal - and the film does not manage to go much further. There are some amusing situations and decent acting, but that's not nearly enough to save that jalopy of a movie. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy that does not get your fat ass off the ground your time?
