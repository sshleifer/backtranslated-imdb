The Mod Squad is not a movie, but a void. That's the most fascinating thing about it and what has always been watching me? I had never seen a movie that offered absolutely nothing. It's a film with no reason to exist, seemingly deliberately designed so that it does not appeal to anyone as if it were just a contractual commitment to someone the studio really does not like. There is no plot, there is no characterization, there are no scenery scenes, there are no scenes as such, just a series of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second. I'm not talking about empty as in stupid summer blockbuster, but empty as in "We do not have the pages yet, so point the camera at something and stop if you have 90 minutes." They appreciate the "artistic achievements" of Charlie's Angels and S.W.A.T. so much more. What it has to offer is far too much of Giovanni Ribisi for representing his most boring culprit, his son of a thousand idiots, as Marlon Brando's method, Michael Lerner with Omar Epps and ?? No that's it. Oh, Clare Danes has a nice smile in a setting. And Dennis Farina has the feeling of being killed early. The most senseless movie ever made is like L'Humanite without the jokes, but for kids.
