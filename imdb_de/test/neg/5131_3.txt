This movie obviously had good intentions. In the end there is a dedication for someone named Kellie, who as a spectator can only assume that he was in a situation that resembles the situation depicted in the film. Maybe she has made the "wrong" choice. This dedication is the ONLY redeeming quality of Love & Suicide. <br /> <br /> The movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. If the viewer is already so irritated after about five minutes, then it will go pretty downhill ... what it was. I know that the movie had a low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty good ... unfortunately, everything else was terrible. The spectacle, the plot, the sound quality, the picture quality ... the spectacle. I'm sorry, but the acting is terrible. Beyond terrible. It's as if the actors are trying to behave like people who act. That's the only way I can think to describe it. When I was watching, I actually showed the script with the director's statement in mind. None of the movements was natural and no reaction of the characters to each other. In short: the timing is OFF. The timing of the entire movie is gone. I'm not a director, so I know the limits of my knowledge, but I really feel there has to be ONE way to convey the passage of time ... until they say the graduation was not too far away, I had the impression that the first part of the film had taken place over a week ... at most one month. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's really a shame. This film could have been really powerful with a few small improvements. All the moments in the movie where we're supposed to feel something are obvious, but just because the setup is obvious (which is a bad thing). The moving scenes fell off completely. For example, if Kaye's brother takes his head off his head and pulls him upside down, we should feel the understanding that he has for her, the innocence and protection of her brother's love. Somehow it just does not get done. There are so many more scenes (for example: ALL battle scenes) and all they do is take the movie with them. All these things taken together, Love & Suicide is a tedious, cheesy, cheap commercial.
