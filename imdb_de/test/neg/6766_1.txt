Yes. A real stinker. I saw this movie on the advice of my "sweet" friends, who told me that this is a great "psychological" movie. This film tries to be incomprehensible. I knew that after the first 20 minutes I came across a stinker. I waited as I expected to see something valuable, and above all, I paid for this movie. The wait was unbearable. After watching the movie, I talked with my friends and learned that this "movie" in the intellectual environments (they call themselves this title) of Turkey was recognized as a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece, but in the category of stinkers. I think a movie has to be self-explanatory. This movie is just the opposite. Stay away from this thing called "movie." Burn your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon". Rate: 1 in 10
