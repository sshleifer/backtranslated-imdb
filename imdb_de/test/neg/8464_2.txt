Boring movie. Bad plot Poor actor The movie is set in a room that was supposed to be in Morocco, but actually in some American city! The "Arab terrorists" are the patriots. The blonde patriot is the "Arab terrorist" ... DAMN! <br /> <br /> This movie does have something nice (that's why it's 2 out of 10). The director makes reality out of the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism that the media feeds us every day, the terrorists are Americans (or Westerners if you like). <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. The first part of the film deals with the journey of the Dutch (15 seconds), while the second part deals with the stay in the amazing dark brown room (1 hour and a little bit). <br /> <br /> The Dutchman will deliver money in Morocco to a "charity", get off the plane, take the bus and land in a dark brown room. He is kidnapped with another guy who gets shot after saying, "They will not shoot us". The Dutch survivor must play chess with a Morpheus-like Arab for so long that you also learn how to play chess! In the end, the Dutchman does not betray his conspiracy because he cut four fingers off him, but because he is tricked by such a lame game, you should watch the movie! <br /> <br /> Well, if you are so tired can not sleep
