Taran Adarsh, a renowned critic, praised such a Dubba film. <br /> <br /> The film has a strange story in which a lover sells his love to a brothel because he wants money to save his mother, and then LOL is forgiven him as well /> The movie is crap <br /> <br /> The entire first half has its focus on romance, a comedy that does not work. The twist shocks, but the entire second half is a mess and the climax is a clich√©. <br /> <br /> Director: Aditya Datt is bad music is typical Himesh. <br /> <br /> Emraan plays his serious role well, but his wardrobe, his way through songs. Etc is similar to his previous films Geeta Bhasra is annoyed that Ashmith Patel could not convince that this actor was only to some degree in MURDER and then a downhill Mithun, and he is fine, but his breakdown into a song is forced , Ranjeet is fine
