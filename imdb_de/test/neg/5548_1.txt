Well, that robbed my nerves, they understood that correctly. I rented this movie for the first time in the 1980s, when my friend opened a video library that featured all the rare movies he could find. He also had all the shock, horror, and exploitation films he could dig out, and I've been through almost everyone. Previously, I had seen Blood Feast and 2000 Maniacs and the Wizard of Gore. They were cruel (especially for the time) and the wizard of Gore got pretty angry. The Gore Gore girls, however, were the one I remember because he was the most disgusting Gory. <br /> <br /> I borrowed it on DVD some time ago because I wanted to hear the comment and thought it might be some cool dances and clothes. I forgot it was done in the early 70's, so fashion had gone downhill by then. I also realized that this was a movie I did not have to see more than once. It had amusing parts, but Gaaaah! It was much more disgusting than I remembered. I'm very tired from the movie, but a few times I was just too shit and had to look away. This was not a good choice for a movie that could be razor-sharp on DVD with better sound and picture quality. The commentary is sometimes amusing and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $ 6100.00). Maybe HG Lewis did not feel good that day, but he sounded tired overall and also had the nerve to hurt himself when the interviewer from Something Wild came across him at Ed Wood Jr. I'm sorry, but you're not just Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> The extremely thin plot is about a series of murders of topless go-go dancers in strip clubs. A cute reporter and a really uninteresting private detective team (somehow he can not stand her) to solve the crime. Henny Youngman owns a strip club. A few really ugly murders happen. <br /> <br /> I'll apologize in advance because I do not want to sound like I need to relieve myself, but this movie was so misogynistic to me more than "Company of Men." Mainly because the extreme dislike of the main character and the director for women - and the audience - just leaves every frame. It's not just the murders. The extremely unattractive detective invariably seeks to treat the reporter on any occasion as dog droppings (he's not exactly a threat to George Clooney, as I said), and she still follows him like a puppy. She faints when she sees a horribly mutilated body, and he looks at her disgustingly, then she pours cold soda from a tin into her face to wake her up. Later he calls the police to report the crime - "No ... do not hurry ... It just seems ... to have lost face." This guy is THE HERO. You can imagine how the other characters feel about women. I could go on and on, but you have the idea. Please note that I make this movie politically correct (and much funnier) than it actually is. <br /> <br /> Most performers are the kind of actors you pray for. Not too easy on the eyes, so do not just watch the movie to see the nakedness, unless you're not too picky. The go-go dancers all look like they desperately want to end the scene so they can get their $ 10 or whatever HG paid interest rate and get their drug fix. OK, it's not that bad, there was a dancer who looked like a pro, and another cool dancer with a huge afro who did not look as miserable as the rest, but still not overly excited. The only entertaining things were a few brief moments in which unintentional humor emerged, for example, when a responsible police officer yells at a murder scene: "Get out of here, before I've arrested you all!" not to a bunch of reporters, but to another policeman quietly doing his job (but mumbling and wandering away). Henny Youngman is somehow funny, as Lewis says he said his lines are so fast that they almost needed subtitles (I'm sure he was trying to hurry all day so he could get paid and hell came out though it might not look as if he had seen some naked chicks?) <br /> <br /> Could be worth seeing out of pure curiosity - for the era in which the movie was filmed, he was probably the cruelest. This is a movie, who is in the film at this time - or if you're a really big fan of HG Lewis and fascinate him or the low budget filmmaker of all. Otherwise, once you've seen it, you've seen it and can move on to other disgusting but much more entertaining low-budget movies from the early '70s ... this movie is not nearly close, say "Pink Flamingos "when it comes to the popcorn factor. If you've never seen a HG Lewis movie, it's best to try "Blood Feast" first. Then you have a much better time. <br /> <br />
