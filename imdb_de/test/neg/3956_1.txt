I have not laughed so much in a theater for years. The only problem is that it was not the intention of the film to make my throat rough with laughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely overcrowded with bad CGI, absolutely awful duologue, absolutely terrible * action * and enough geek references so that it only appears as a complete cheese. <br /> <br /> As a player and geek-type girl, I recognized all of the obvious game references in this film, as well as the geek STUFF, which was just thrown into the background as a feast for the eyes (the Steamboy poster, thinkgeek t-shirts) .com and j-list.com), and that did not live up to the movie at all. <br /> <br The only thing that could have been good about ALL was the characters with ghost kids who were purposely badly made into CGI to make it look like they came from a game, and obviously from Japanese Horror movies were stolen <br /> To be honest, it was hilarious and something I would expect from a midnight show of a television sci-fi television movie. Do not expect more than that and you will have a great time. Just do not take any lemonade or you'll spit it everywhere if you get great lines: "Why did you bring this game into our lives?! WHY?!"
