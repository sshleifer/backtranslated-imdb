I never thought about watching this movie. I always saw it in the horror film shelf at my local video rental store and never thought much about it. Only your run the mill, a mellow zombie strip with a bit of blood and a sex scene. Nothing special, might as well see Python ... oh no, that's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I decided to look at it when some of my friends saw it on TV and said it was a terrible piece of garbage. So I decided to check those stories, and only then did I realize how terrible was the movie that hid behind the threadbare and uninteresting DVD box cover. <br /> <br /> Not that the idea is bad in itself. A plane is a limited area and would be a real death trap for the people on board if zombies appear ... a good condition for a zombie movie. But this film had a good backdrop and was bad with bad acting, unsafe camera work, annoying characters and a terrible score. <br /> <br /> The characters are all hated differently. There are two young couples who are basically friends who holiday in France. A couple consists of a jock and his annoying, bitchy girlfriend, who has an affair with Mr. Jock's best friend, who has come with his girlfriend, who is a blond psycho. There is also a policeman accompanying a comrade (a female and very annoying comrade). The policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters. Then there are a bunch of stewardesses that usually end up as a zombie chow ... no, I did not watch the whole movie, it was just too painful to go through, almost as bad as Cannibal Holocaust. Oh, and there's also a golf player on vacation with his wife, a strange air marshal who really does not seem important until called to deal with the zombie refugees, a trio of scientists who all fall prey to the undead The camera work is often shaky, and although many people do not seem to mind, after a while it can really get on their nerves, as if a small amount of flying buzzes constantly hovering around your head. It's small, but it's annoying. <br /> <br /> The couple is really annoying. All they do is have sex in the toilets of the plane while their spouses are not looking ... in fact, all the young adults in this movie are insanely annoying. They moan, swallow, argue and have some of the craziest and most annoyingly boring dialogue in the movie ... yes, they're glad they die. <br /> <br /> The score is disgusting. It is so generic and uninspired that it kills any kind of tension a scene could have produced, replacing it with the feeling that someone is scratching a board with nails and laughing at you. In fact, it sounds like the result of ... Python! This movie will never stop tormenting me. <br /> <br /> There's also a character that the filmmakers seem to focus on making as many shots as possible. A nun who sits near the young adults and holds her Bible, which is contained in so many shots, one wonders if she plays an important role in the film ... but no, she does not, so why Do you have them in so many scenes? ? Was it because the film's original project was a nun porn movie? Nobody will ever know. <br /> <br /> The zombies look pretty good. Their make-up is good and they are probably far better actors than the living characters, they are much more convincing and likeable! The guard responsible for keeping track of the scientist's illegal charge was pretty funny. A large box seems to fall on him and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg has been pierced with a sharp object ... but he does not scream, does not twitch or moan in pain. He grunts and writhes only in an attempt to get the thing out of his leg ... In fact, he sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain. <br /> <br /> All in all I give him 1 for the interesting shot and 1 for the zombies. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you like young adults arguing and throwing each other, and unfortunately there is not. It's a bit weird about the whole thing, so browsing would probably fail unless you have a psychoactive drug.
