I see a pattern here. If you see a movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000, chances are that you'll find hordes of fans of the movie on IMDb.com, but he was chosen to be in that TV show because it was so bad. I'm sorry, but I've read a lot about Rocketship X-M as a science-fiction movie that emphasized realism. Well, if this is the case, I could write for several paragraphs about the fact that this film is extremely flawed even with the knowledge of the 1950s. Gravity might be the first obvious observation or how MST3K did "selective gravity" as a sketch, well, if they fall to their deaths and just stand there looking out the window, the ship would not turn upside down Scene? I'd like to believe that they started with good intentions and that the budget or something went beyond that, but I think this movie was just plain cheese, like the one from below. Just compare this with "When Worlds Collide," published in 1951, to see the true place where this film ranks. There is no comparison. The movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 for itself, it's not even funny to see alone. There is about 5 or 6 as MST3K episode, as there is no action to make fun of, only bad, bad, bad. Oh, I mentioned, it's bad.
