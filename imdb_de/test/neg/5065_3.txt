The controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe, who herself had brought diver to the wreck in Estonia, put together this stupid "thriller" to save her investment. Of course, Donald Sutherland can always be seen - but only in three scenes. He delivers his material perfectly - as you would expect from a professional. Even the lead, JÃ¼rgen Prochnov, is very good at times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is bad. The actress who plays the Swedish ministerial secretary (or whatever she was - she does not appear to be cast) is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> The script has some nice ideas and the story is somehow interesting. However, the last script should have been rewritten a few more times. Some scenes are just ridiculous - especially the final scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie lasts almost 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes too long. Presented as a 60-minute television movie, this could have been really interesting. As a two-hour movie, it's presumptuous, boring, stupid and just stupid. <br /> <br /> Jutta Rabe could be a good journalist (her ideas of governments using Estonia for transporting military items from Estonia to Sweden have been finalized recently, when the Swedish military officially said they were the ship Estonia actually used for it), but as a film producer she shit. <br /> <br /> The director, the writer and the actors suck more /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10. I would have given it a 1 if not the fact that the story is sometimes quite interesting, Donald Sutherland is there and has real stock footage. <br /> <br /> But we do not even sink the boat! What is this movie about a ship sinking? Like a werwolffilm without werewolves ...
