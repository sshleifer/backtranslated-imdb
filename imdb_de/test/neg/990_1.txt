This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. It was made awful, it did not flow, it was very choppy because many people did not understand the movie at all. I had to watch this movie several times before I got an idea of ​​what was going on. Okay, it's like a kid stole someone's car, and when he's run to the police, he brings it together. His parents, who sent him to his uncle in the wilderness, there he meets a girl who loves climbing and he gets into the sport and has to ask his uncle to engage him in a competition for climbing it's like I said, a horrible movie.
