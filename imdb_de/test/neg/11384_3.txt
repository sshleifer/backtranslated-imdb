At first, this movie was sick. This is where your wife dies and you walk around town with that blond chic at your side. Then your wife dies and within 2 months you are in this chic. Hank (James Brolin) definitely moves fast in this movie. I called him Fast Hank. Fast Hank marries this beautiful woman and before you know it, she has sex with his best friends. The part that gets me is when she does it with Kevin in the barn and gets caught by another Hanks friend. Kevin gets up and leaves, she drops her robe and BAM !! Straight into the other guy's arms and they start to "do" there and there. I suspect he ends what Kevin started. HOW LARGE !!!! I am so, this is a lifetime movie ??? It's a typical AGE MAN YOUNG WOMAN movie that says you can have my body when I get your money ...
