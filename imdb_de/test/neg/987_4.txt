*** POSSIBLE SPOILER DOWN *** <br /> <br /> What a long and mostly uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why did not I care for her? If I watch a movie for two hours, I would like to take care of someone or something. <br /> <br /> We know that Salvatore dreamed of the riches of the new world. In addition, however, we learned little about most of his family's hopes, fears, etc. as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown. <br /> <br /> And why was Lucy even in this movie? She said little; We did not know much about her or what she did (was she forced to serve men in exchange for boarding?) Or what she intended to do when she arrived in New York. To those who might feel that it was necessary to underline the point that a single woman, no matter how cultured, could not reach this land alone, I say that this fact is not enough to give her so much time to give on the screen. This point could have been done in five minutes, with Lucy as a temporary figure. <br /> <br /> Further questions: Why did not the twin brother at the boat meet the family? We have heard of the brother and a closure on this point would have been helpful to give the film a certain cohesion. How long was the journey from Italy to New York? Under the given conditions on the ship, it makes a difference to the viewer whether the journey took five or ten or fifty days. (Somebody said something that he would have seen a "week" at some point, but I think that was when they were on the way.) I needed that kind of detail to better understand what they were going through. <br /> <br /> The only scene I really liked was when the passenger-filled boat left the dock. <br /> <br /> If you decide to rent this movie, do so with the remote control in your hand. You may want to have the fast-forward button on hand. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would suggest that you get helpful information on the times and circumstances for immigrants, with the right language output - especially during the slow, endless periods of footage of land, people walking, etc. - this movie could have made an interesting public television documentary.
