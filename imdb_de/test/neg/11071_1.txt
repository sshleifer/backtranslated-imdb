I agreed to watch this movie with a group of friends despite my extreme dislike of horror movies. However, it was not the shock of a monster that kept me from watching this movie, it was the terrible spectacle and the absolutely disgusting ending. Inside or the cave has no redeeming qualities - it's done badly, ridiculously written, disgustingly bloody and the inclusion of the unsatisfying final scene pushes me back. No, it's not my dislike of horror movies that make me hate this movie. I have seen such wonderful teenage horror as House of Wax. They support the creators of Within
