Depressive black black comedy about a woman (Mia Farrow) fleeing her home on Christmas Eve when she discovers that her husband (Tony Goldwyn) hired an executioner to kill her. It ends with a man and a woman (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then things go awry. Basically, Farrow keeps going and constantly encounters VERY strange people and gets into morbidly unpleasant situations. <br /> <br /> This was advertised as a feel-good movie when I saw him at an art cinema during his VERY short time of Christmas. I found it sick, listless and just depressing. I like black humor, but that was too dark for me. What happened especially to Parker's character was terrible. To make things even worse, Eileen Brennan is later thrown as a nun (!!!) and chews the landscape with enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The only salvation grace was Farrow's acting - it deserves much better picture. It was also a relief to see the very talented Stephen Dorff appear in the end. The end itself was kind of nice, but it could not erase what had happened before. <br /> <br /> Ill, morbid, pitch-black "comedy". A 1
