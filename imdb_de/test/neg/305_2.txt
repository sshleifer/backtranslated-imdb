The premise of the film was very promising - a kind of gay Napoleon dynamite guy. And to be fair, there were some funny moments and funny lines, but overall it was not very good. The script and dialogue felt like a local sketch production, full of clich√©s and scenes that were predictable. <br /> <br /> However, there was enough, which was amusing, that I was staying to see how it ended up indicating that something special happened in the end. However, it seems that either the movie runs out of money or the writer runs out of ideas, because the end is extremely abrupt and almost jumps directly from the most important conflict in the movie to the end credits. Overall it was very disappointing but not totally unsurpassed ...
