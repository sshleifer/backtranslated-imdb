So many great actors, so little worth seeing. But with a script that misses so much of what made the book so special, I can not blame anyone on the screen. Although the book was flawed, it was one of Grisham's only ones I really liked, especially as it tasted of a deep southern town, a world a little different from a coastal townman like myself. I also loved the objectivity, naturalness of what is in the book. In the film, characters get a "nobility" of personality that seemed so stilted. The bad guys and slides are flat and 1-dimensional. But as with so many works by Joel Schumacher authenticity and authenticity are strikingly missing, and every point must be delivered by sledgehammer to the middle section. So preaching, stilted and superficially about such a horrible tragedy, I wish someone would make a remake and make the story a bit more correct.
