Childhood death and horror movies will always remain a sensitive and controversial combination. Therefore, it is my personal opinion that any film that has the courage to turn to this topic should receive special attention from the horror fans. As with "Wicked Little Things", controversial topics do not always guarantee a good movie. Despite the potentially interesting plot, the atmospheric environment and the involvement of the video-right director J.S. Cardone ("The Slayer"), this is an uninspired and clichéd movie that can not provide a single shock or shock. After losing their husband and father, the remaining women of the tune (Mother Karen and her daughters Sarah and Emma) move to a small and remote mountain town in Pennsylvania, where they inherited an old, dilapidated mansion. Their new home is dangerously close to the old mining ruins, where in 1913 dozens of innocent children were tragically killed. Strange things happen, like the young Emma, ​​who makes friends with an (imaginary?) Girl who lived in her house, and the Eerie Natives seem to have secrets from Karen and her daughters. It quickly turns out that the undead children have left their pits at night to take revenge on the descendant of the mine owner, Mr. Carlton, who was responsible for her death. "Wicked Little Things" is pretty tame and extremely predictable. The script shamelessly serves one terrible cliché after another, such as car wheels stuck in the mud at crucial times, broken flashlights, and terribly broken dolls. There is very little tension, even less gore, and the make-up effects are disappointingly weak. The zombified children do not look threatening at all. Actually, they all look like miniature versions of Marilyn Manson, with their black outfits, pale faces and dark eyes. The tension-free finale is stupid and as distracted as the rest of this pointless production. Lori Heuring is completely unremarkable in her lead role as a mom, but Scout Taylor-Compton (currently a big star thanks to the "Halloween" remake) and the young Chloe Moretz are sufficient daughters.
