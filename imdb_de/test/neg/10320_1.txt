I have seen this remastered on DVD. It had a big picture of Sandra and said "Starring Sandra ...". Not so. She is barely there. She does what she can with the script, but that's not much. <br /> <br /> The sound was terrible. By that I mean that things do not match. Shots were fired and the number of shots did not match the sound. People talk in a car while it's moving, and the shot comes from outside the windshield, but there's no engine noise, road noise or other sounds. Somehow strange. <br /> <br /> Score was terrible. It always sounded like the same few notes. Dialogue really terrible. <br /> <br /> It was terrible to act, I could not believe it. Battle scenes were like a Batman comic without "BIFF" and "BAM". They were really lame. The shooting scenes, I mean firearms, were literally ridiculous. I've been through a lot of this movie. Even then it was too long.
