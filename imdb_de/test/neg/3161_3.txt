This is a movie with a lot of potential, well done and played, with a rather week-long and inconsistent script. A young woman with two children moves into her mother's close home because the husband, who is at the top of the workshop where he cuts stolen cars, aggravates her son's asthma. Husband ends up in jail when the stolen car of an ex-pat is being traced back to his business, ex pat is a kind, generous and naive man (and more cardboard and we learn next to nothing), but ends up with that Girl "posing", though only sexually satisfied by her husband. I assume that this film will be successful in Czech, where it will be welcome because of its obvious premise: "The ex-pats may have money, they may even get our women, but they are old, soft and our women want Satisfied, we may be poor, but ... If Evzen could only be satisfied with Marcela, she would not have to play with herself, or if he already had a family in Italy ... but that would complicate things.
