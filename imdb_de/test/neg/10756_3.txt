"Opposing Force [1986]" was not as good as "Dr. Strangelove" and not as good as "The Bridge on the River Kwai". Heck, it was not even as good as "GI Jane," which is pretty sad. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a fundamental ethical problem: In a simulated prisoner-of-war situation, how far do you go before you start breaking the law? What exactly is the law in such a situation? How can one simulate someone's torture without actually torturing someone? Can you intentionally cause pain? How about breaking bones? Mock executions Sexual abuse? Heavy blood loss? Real guns with bullets? Death? Somewhere in between there is a really fuzzy line that separates "acceptable" from "cruel". <br /> <br /> Well, what could you do if you were in such an exercise program and the boundaries between simulation and reality disappear? What could you do? This film tries to illustrate this dilemma. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in resistance training. I have a brother who has gone through USAF's POW training program. In his opinion, it was technically very close to the brand. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty good, but it does not have a very good story. I wondered if it could be based on an actual event, but it became pretty obvious that it was not the beginning of the explosions. You have to change scriptwriters three times into the movie because it takes a real extreme turn and turns into a slightly pointless shoot-em-up with many distracting explosions. <br /> <br /> I found it a pretty unsatisfactory end. again somehow meaningless. I wonder what the point of the whole thing was - I start to suspect that there just was not one. It could have been much better if you were just accompanying a bit more history with the fireworks.
