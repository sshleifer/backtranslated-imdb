I'm still waiting for this dark Muppet movie that we do not know how it ends up from the beginning. I think Linklater could make an attempt to experiment with animations. This time, I did not expect that I had expected such a thing, but I deeply wished. Joan Cusack sucked. She moved to a level created for television, which she lazily played with clichéd clichés. The Muppets were more lives than they. A disappointment. <br /> <br /> But then there was the whole movie, Bar Pepe. I loved him. He was the only one who ever made me laugh (while Goldbergh when God made me choking and cursing). If we can not see any dark Muppets, how about at least one PG: 13 with more of Pepes' controversial jokes and Animals Metal-Head, Egg-Nog-Chuggin-Persona Even the boring Christmas song looked this out. The Muppets must avoid this during a commercial vacation. <br /> <br /> 5/10
