I liked the movie the most. As mentioned in other reviews, it has a good cast, the plot is interesting enough. All in all, it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> But the end is, I think, totally botched, it confused me. Yes, you expect people to cross and double cross in this kind of movie, but quadruple crossings? Well, if it is justified by the act, why not? <br /> <br /> But that's the worst, it's not necessary at all. After a certain point everything is completely meaningless. (here comes the SPOILER). After the airport scene, Enrico and his accomplices already have the money. I could not understand the need for the rest of the fraud. Does one have to rub Federico only with being fooled? I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> So 6 out of 10 for 3/4 of the movie and 2 out of 10 for the end.
