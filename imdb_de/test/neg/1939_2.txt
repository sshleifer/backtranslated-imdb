VIVA LA BAM This "Jackass" excerpt focuses on the (obviously scripted) adventures of Bam Margera and his buddies (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). Although this show has a fair share of comedy and crazy stunts, it focuses mainly on Bam's torture of his parents. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that, Bam, but ... you're not as cool as you think you are. This ego-disturbed show is not only painlessly unstable (and yes, I liked Jackass), but also narcissistic beyond belief. The overly stylized intro ends with Bam coolly declaring that he "wants to do whatever he wants". How about you, what's funny? I liked "Jackass" for what it was worth. The camera work was terrible - any idiot could have done a better show with a camcorder in his parent's garage - but the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the pats' crazy, dangerous or just nasty stunts <br / > <br /> Not like "Viva la Bam". We follow our hero as he plays tricks on his friends and tortures his loved ones, but he never feels anything but lame and scribbled comedies. The stunts and pranks are easily entertaining, but presented in such a boring and boring way that they can hardly make you smile. <br /> <br /> "Viva la Bam" is a bad spin-off that does not bring much good, but little feed Margeras already too big ego. I can not recommend this lame and unimaginative show to everyone.
