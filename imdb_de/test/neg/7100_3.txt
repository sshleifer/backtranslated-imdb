It's as if the editor and the scriptwriter had only 40 minutes of real time. This is supposed to be a remake of a Chinese movie that is obviously far superior to this trash. It's clear that a mindless Hollywood suit or writer has decided that this Mano Man Man Man Man Man movie would be a man versus man, rather than the story of the personalities of the characters built in the first 40 minutes, to play. At this point in the movie, the characters simply do not behave like normal people, nor do they behave like their own personalities. It makes little sense. It's pretty clear why this movie flopped. It just is not credible at all and that's too bad - it started with promises. Do not be fooled.
