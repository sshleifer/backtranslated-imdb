Although this served as a showcase for kickboxing and swordplay, "Vampires: The Turning" (VTT) could have achieved something beyond that. Since VTT does not even want to be a good vampire movie, VTT does not deliver a punch it may have tried. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​using an 800-year-old Thai vampire was interesting, but the story of offspring that she falsely launched (and now needs to wipe out) actually reminds me of Gizmo and his misery "Gremlins," and that's not good when it comes to a vampire movie. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Chao is attractive and serves very well as a "good" vampire, but the lack of any accents is true when she realizes that she is an 800 year old vampire. When she tells Connor that he is "a young soul," she does not provide much of the weight you would expect from an "old" soul. Attractive, but not believable. <br /> <br /> Meredith Monroe was more believable in her role, but for a Dawson's Creek album, one would think she had more time on the screen. The question of whether Amanda succumbs and "turns" is the compelling reason to continue to watch this movie, and you never get it. You get a lot of them, but you never get any kind of development from the characters for this plotter. It's a cheap way to play your audience, folks. <br /> <br /> If you want something that's a good vampire movie, then Lugosis is looking for "Dracula" and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you'll have dozens of flips of Hammer with a lot more power than this one. In the end, if you want good or sexy, this is not the place. That's just forgotten.
