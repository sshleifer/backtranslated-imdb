The somewhat martial brother of a suicide finds out that he and his mother are mourning the same way (by playing out), but that dad is crazy and blames himself. Author and director Dan Harris gives us a dysfunctional family that is torn at the seams, signs with question marks above them, and then puts all the story points in the most obvious words: suicide! Secrets! Gay shame! Family illness! Harris wants to finish things with a proper bow and wants to make sure that we do not miss a trick by first giving thought-provoking material for thought and then formulating it all in a basic and sentimental way. Sigourney Weaver's confused performance as the family's matriarch is dry and she's a pleasure - that is, until Harris gives her make-over (complete with a sensible new hairstyle). It is the cinematic equivalent of a condescending blow on the head. ** from ****
