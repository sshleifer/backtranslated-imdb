Arthur Miller has always been known as one of America's great playwrights for works such as Death of a Salesman and The Crucible. "Focus" is one of his lesser-known games that are brought to the screen. However, I know what a great playwright Arthur Miller is, and I doubt that his original play was very similar to the film. The film seems empty and formulaic, with William H. Macy as the non-Jew of anti-Semitic neighbors in Brooklyn being considered a Jew. Do not get me wrong: the acting is OK, and I suppose the people behind this movie probably tried to say something about racism, but the movie just does not work. Macy, Laura Dern and David Paymer can not create an effective story here with the material.
