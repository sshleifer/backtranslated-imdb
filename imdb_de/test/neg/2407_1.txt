Simply put, the only lifesaving guarantee of this film are attitudes, costumes and an OK punk concert. How H.R.Giger has to feel about his cyborg image on the cover of this movie, I would not like to know. Immediately I could only make sardonic comments on the protagonists of the film. I had hoped that the "freaks" in this movie would do it in a bloody way. I see SPOILERS a comin '! I was wondering if this movie in the spirit of the first 20 min. should be as half-baked as the rest of it? Examines all the obvious political outcry (the police are trying to rape a "freak", discussing the superficialities between the "freak" and the connecting kid and the punk concert with the singer) and using slow motion in the combat sequences (which " Martial arts coordinator "cries) I just do not know. The character named "Steve" has annoyed me since he tries to fend people off the streets (he should be attacked and raped) and looks bad when he broke the guy's neck at the end (I want that Show you how to do it?) I have to say this, if they had developed other characters better than "splatter", this might have gone somewhere. If there was a 0 for this movie, he would have gotten it, but unfortunately it is a 1.
