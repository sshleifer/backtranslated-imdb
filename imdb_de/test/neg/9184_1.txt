"Wagon East" is widely known as John Candy's last movie when he died on set. That's what makes it so sad: not only that Candy suffered a fatal heart attack, but that it was on the set of such a lousy film. Seriously, I do not know what they thought when they found this bitch, but the movie has NO redeeming qualities. It's like taking any unused script for dumb westerns and simply mixing and filming it. No wonder John Candy did not want to shoot the movie; Maybe his contractual participation was what he did. <br /> <br /> In any case, Candy has done a lot better during his career. To be sure, he had already completed Michael Moore's "Canadian Bacon," in which the United States declared war on Canada. Just stay with this and you can say that Candy has finished his career honorably. As for Richard Lewis, who had previously played with Candy in Eugene Levy's absurd but funny "Once Upon a Crime", he made up for this crap by performing regularly in later years on "Countdown with Keith Olbermann".
