I'm getting excited when the movie starts (because I saw Juliette Lewis' name on screen). The script seemed very complicated at first, but understandably, as the movie progressed, it became clear. I concentrated well on it, but the result was disappointing. The object of sex was used unnecessarily often for the film, and it seemed to me that the director was ignoring those who have a tendency to the opposite sex. In my opinion, the well-prepared screenplay could not be embodied. As we look at the cast, the movie promises something in the beginning, or I just expected too much ... and finally, the end ... the end is so mediocre that I would not expect. The main character Cassandra wants to give a message about how to have a baby and how a baby can change a life, in my opinion this scene is the real catastrophe for the movie. All in all, the characters are funny and look beautiful. But only the cast can not save a movie.
