Very disappointing 7th chapter of this slowly dying series. It is obvious that the budget was extremely low. This movie was shot for one reason only. Puppet Master Toys for sale! Fans like myself from the series have decided what I've read and heard that the only one in the series that's worse is Curse of the Puppetmaster. Turn away from the series again. <br /> <br /> The decision to make a PG-13 film for this reason has not turned out to be for the films for some reason. The conspiracy almost seemed to be there, but it was easily lost in the steady stream of nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only interesting film in the series, also directed by Decoteau, is Part 3 - Toulon's Revenge. <br /> <br /> Granted, I prefer the scenery in the movie. <br /> <br /> Yuck!
