For years I hesitated to watch this movie. Now I know why. It's not just a comedy that is not even funny from a distance, but there's nothing to laugh about the movie. It was worse than I expected. I rented this jerk and felt cheated out of time for more money than money. I've never seen a movie that annoyed me so much. It's a movie about stupid people doing stupid and horrible things. I also do not really know how anyone with common sense can actually work in this kind of movie. I've been using IMDb for some time, but felt obliged to register just to prevent poor, unsuspecting people from renting or, worse, buying that stinker !! Really a waste of time and money. I have to say that the plot is terrible.
