As bad as good - not only the script is obvious, but the drama is not only bad, but pathetic. The worst thing is the definition of the characters: unrealistic ingenuity, affected reactions, camera pressure, superficial aspects that are introduced as a key to the plot. In the end, the main character says something like "your daughter does not play football and knows no cooking" second place. Such an offense against female intelligence defines the level of this film. <br /> <br /> Is the film about the psychological behavior of the second character ?, about its influence on the main character? Or just a sequence of events To heat for the obvious ending? <br /> <br /> Please do more - I had a good time guessing what would go wrong next ...
