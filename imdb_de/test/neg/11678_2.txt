The film uses random events of historical significance as a backdrop and criss-crosses the life and timelines of its three central characters. For what purpose can one ask? The problem with this movie is that the script becomes "history," not characters or their lives. <br /> <br /> It starts with a bunch of wealthy, aimless college kids (and a few not so rich too) in the Naxalite movement. Affair, rejection and separation follow. People seem to go their own way. Only until the heroine insists. Not once, but twice. After a break in the "movement," the next hurdle for these three is the plight imposed by Indira Gandhi. Many political figures roam around for no apparent reason. The negotiations are too thoughtful and do not fit together into a logical whole. <br /> <br /> The film tries to force a wrong tempo but never reaches a real rhythm. Hardly coherent, there are no maturing and no growth in the bows of the three former college friends. Even if they are probably married, engaged, settled or whatever, they are too eager to give up everything and go to a village to have sex with the ex-lover or ex-flame. What fertile imagination does the scriptwriter have? So many 4-letter words are used without any rhyme or reason, so it is extremely abusive. <br /> <br /> Chitrangda Singh has a terrible American accent that she does not try to hide. It is disgusting when she hears mouths with clich√©s about her mouth, like "What is it?" I did not think you would come '(this is the hellish nightmare she's just gone through) or at the beginning, "I appreciate your concern, but I can take care of myself. Yikes What kind of clown wrote the dialogues for this? She invites her friend for a cup of "South Indian" (no less) coffee, wishes someone a good morning and then wishes them a good night from someone else in the family. Well, what's wrong with that?!? <br /> <br /> The countless villagers and tribe members are the best actors. The editing is really unpredictable with too many cuts. Obviously, Sudhir Misra tries to make a bold statement and has made a great effort.
