I grew up with sitcoms like Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpsons, etc., in other words, mainstream television. Over the years, many sitcoms have been airing, a very small percentage of which are really smart and funny. The War at Home is a prime example of the majority of modern American comedy. <br /> <br /> I give the show 3 out of 10 points because that's what she wants to be, a comedy, but she does not seem to go out of her way to be a good comedy. A good comedy should set you off with its big jokes, you should not be able to see them coming, and in TWAH I can almost see any joke. The characters are probably the simplest and most horrible stereotypes I've ever seen on screen, and acting is not very good, except for the dad, who loves a stereotypical beer drinking sport that perfectly loves an American idiot drama, incredible characters and jokes that do not hit you unprepared will affect the show to a point where it can not be beat. If you do not have a cable and would like to see a comedy worth watching, try Boston Legal. It's more worth your time.
