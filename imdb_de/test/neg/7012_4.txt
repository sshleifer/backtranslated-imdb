To be honest, it's beyond the bounds of stupidity, but "Killer Pussy" is still an incredibly entertaining little streak. No plot, lots of oiled cha-chas, cheesy effects and a monster eating a penis! What is not to love ?! Quite a lot - a few explorers find this creature, who likes to nestle in a woman's bark guards until, unfortunately, a swing ... ah, has hit its mouth. She finds her host, who is later discovered in a deserted house by a group of moronic guys and their equally brainless, brisk girlfriends whose minibus breaks down. The creature jumps from each girl as they all plague like drunken rabbits ... There's cheap blood, girl-on-girl "blood fight", KY Jelly vomit, sock puppet monsters and lots of softcore sex. Ridiculous, but a cool waste of time ...
