This movie is very modern and forward looking. It is about 75% in English. It is aimed at the English-speaking, multiplexing, young audience. Basic illustration is similar to DDLJ. Acting is below average. Unfortunately, they are a false image and are a bad example for the young people. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle or photographing tequila in the film 5-6 times. The director does not even acknowledge that she is an alcoholic and has an alcohol problem. Throughout the film, she wears only bikini tops, whether at work, on the beach or at a wedding. The heroine of the film who does this makes the adolescent feel that this behavior is acceptable. <br /> <br /> The less you say that Uday Chopra disregards Shahrukh Khan's DDLJ role as an arrogant girl hunter, the better. The film is about gender equality. Equality, however, should not commit the same mistakes, but the right to do the right thing. If men were shown in movies as chronic Casanovas, that does not mean that women should show the same behavior. <br /> <br /> Even though the movie is made in carefree fun, it promotes so many wrong social notions. The name "forward", this "funny" part of the movie has no effect. Even in Canada, women do not dress like this or men behave as shown in the movie. It is certainly not a reflection of Indian or Canadian society. Perhaps they should have a disclaimer at the beginning: "All the characters and events in the film are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film." The only good thing about this movie is the length of 1.5 hours, thank God.
