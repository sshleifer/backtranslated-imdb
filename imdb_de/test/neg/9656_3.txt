I can see what this movie was about. Unfortunately, the deal is unfortunately never complete. The Reality Crime aspect works well and the recordings are all first class. In fact, some of the scenes are atmospherically evocative. Especially the silhouette of the detective talking to the beaten woman, the scene where the detectives go through the trash and the father ties up flies. Occasionally, some scenes remain in too many dialogues. Instead of showing the viewer, the author treats it too much like a book. But the real problem is in the editing. The story does not flow. It can not be a whole from the sum of the parts. In the end, you are confused as to what actually happens. Those who like this kind of detective movie like to follow her and put the puzzle together at the same time as the main characters. With such a poor processing, this is difficult or impossible.
