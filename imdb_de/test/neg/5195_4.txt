If I had known what I was getting into, I would have fled the theater. The film is literally horrible. Despite stunning images, intriguing locations, and potentially intriguing subject matter, the film is dead. <br /> <br /> I was unfamiliar with this period of Greek history and wanted to see a great movie. The hand of the filmmaker is heavy. it is not enough to see a passing train; We have to watch it from a distance, we have to watch cars by car, we have to see the smoke, we have to see how it slows down, and we have to see it stop. The director's approach is didactic. Likewise, the characters he creates never evolve, they never change. Are you so stereotypical that we ask ourselves, are they destined to be anyone? Every girl? Every musician Is there a point in this allegory? It's the most demanding movie I've seen in a long time.
