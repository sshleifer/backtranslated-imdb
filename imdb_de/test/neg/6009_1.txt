This is by far the worst Hemingway adaptation ever. Rock Hudson was a bad joke and absolutely unbelievable as a hardened soldier / adventurer who went to war. Jennifer Jones was far too old for her role and Vittorio de Sica seemed to think that he had played in another movie together. They tried to turn a reserved romantic novel into a large-scale epic, and the result is terrible. As if that was not enough, the whole thing is so slow, over-tired and outdated that it's practically unbeatable. Rock must have kicked himself for refusing "Sayonara" and "Ben Hur" to do that awful crap. <br /> <br /> 0/10. Be avoided.
