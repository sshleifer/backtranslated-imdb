this was quickly destroyed by bad acting, cinematography, numerous pointless scenes, and a dreadful villain. Well, let's see that Joe Estevez is bad (as usual), but he's not the only casting problem. The writer Vivian Schilling is not a great actress. Your script is not so bad, it's just badly directed. If the direction had been better and better actors had been cast, this could have been a really good movie. <br /> <br /> But with all these problems, "Soultaker" is not the right choice as a horror movie, and the tempo is just awful. <br /> <br /> The MST crew had some fun with this movie, but it was definitely not one of their better efforts. 5 nothing for the original.
