I only saw this show for a while because of my cousins ​​and I hate it! First, the girls dress in the same style clothing and have the same first letter in their names. (Come on, I could do better than that!) Then the bad guys (spare me), first we have a monkey with a part of his (small) brain, then we have a (gay) version of the devil, a pink hillbilly, a gang green gang (which is ironic, as her name is), a spoiled princess (again ironic, that's her name) among others. I also found out that there is no male hero on the show. (Not that I'm sexist or anything.) I'd rather see Sailor Moon, it's a lot better than that. If someone else wants to see the show in the room you're in, find a way to watch the TV to break. Believe me, it will save you half an hour of torture. <br /> <br /> Rating: I give you exactly what it deserves, a 1 out of 10 points. Whatever you do, DO NOT WATCH!
