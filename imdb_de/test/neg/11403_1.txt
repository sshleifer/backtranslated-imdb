Yesterday was one of the days when we decided to go to the cinema. We chose "Ik ook van Jou" more or less by chance, but we wanted to see the state of current Dutch filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a book by Ronald Giphart, and I have to admit right away that he is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors known in the Netherlands for their appearances in soap operas and / or afternoon shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) did reasonably decent things after leaving the soap world. So we decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> And what a mistake that was. This movie fails on all fronts. Bad show (the best performance is actually a guinea pig, pretending to be dead very convincingly). Flat, uninteresting story with an inexplicable and uninteresting background (why France, why am I telling a girl from Uganda the story?) Mistakes (blacks, as far as I know, do not use sunscreens) and heating systems in the Netherlands do not create clouds of steam like in New York Even though this looks good on film, people do not wear T-shirts on New Year's Eve in Northern Europe. There's a funny moment when two little dogs are involved and that's it. <br /> <br /> So I think, but more importantly, it seemed that none of the people who left the cinema after that enjoyed it. I heard one of them say that he was extremely disappointed because he liked the book so much. I did not read the book, but my advice would be to read the book, not see the movie.
