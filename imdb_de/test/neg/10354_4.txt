I'm from Australia and love the show. I did not expect much from the American version of Kath and Kim, but I thought I was going to watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad. <br /> <br /> Well, what is there to say? It's nothing special. Selma Blair is fine as Kim and actually had some good lines, but Molly Shannon is not a good Kath. The good thing about Jane Turner's Kath is that when she talks with all her funny accents (like when she says Yumor or Noice) "It sounds like she speaks in a natural way, but if Shannon has an accent, then it is clear that she acts and tries to be the same as Turner. And the show really misses Sharon or anyone else to make us laugh because the characters of Kal and Craig are really not funny in this version. <br /> <br /> So far, only the first episode has been aired. This clearly does not match the Aussie version standards. However, if it's a standalone television program with a different name that is not compared to the Aussie version, it might be a little better. But if you have nothing else to do on a Sunday night (or Thursday night in America), you can not do much harm to the sight or, if you have it, put on some of the Aussie versions.
