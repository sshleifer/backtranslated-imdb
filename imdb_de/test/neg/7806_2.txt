This movie is about the worst thing I've seen in a long time. The talent of Terence Stamp is completely wasted and it was just the only thing I enjoyed when I heard a favorite song of mine, "If I Had A Million Dollars" by BNL, in the appetizer the main character, a nice guy who sitting in the house for his boss. Misfortunes follow. Blah blah blah. If you have time to kill and have nothing better to do, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, look at something else. <br /> <br /> There are not necessarily relaxing moments, but it's nice to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor on screen. It is always a pleasure to see, though this film has managed to dampen those bright spots.
