Sorry ... really sad. This movie has nothing (hmmm, maybe Sybil Danning) to watch you. I also hated to see Linda Blair in this strip of exploitation. She certainly deserves more. <br /> <br /> What is history about? Let's see ... Overseer John Vernon takes the inmates in rather inspiring positions, while the prisoner Sybil actually directs the prison and little Linda has to fight for her survival ... Sounds like a B-movie, eh? It is.
