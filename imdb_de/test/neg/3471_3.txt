"Imperium Nero" is the second film of the series "Imperium". I have already commented unfavorably on the first: "Imperium Augustus". This second TV movie produced and broadcast by the Italian state network last weekend has the same shortcomings. Also contains a considerable number of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child and Agrippina calls him "Nero, Nero". At that time Claudius was called. After his adoption he was called Nero. Nero did not get to know Acte when he was as young as he was in the movie, but after his marriage to Octavia and his appointment as Emperor. When emperor become his sons, where no adults: Britannicus is one month old and Octavia one year old. And many, many more. If you are interested in ancient Roman history, you will find other examples. The series "Imperium" continues with four other films: "Titus", "Marcus Aurelius", "Costantinus" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire". Finally!
