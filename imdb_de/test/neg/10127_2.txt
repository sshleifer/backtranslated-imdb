You'd think a show about ordinary teenagers with superpowers would be interesting, but that's a long way off. Take for example the concept: the main character (s) have a big secret that they hide from their classmates. It's just like Hannah Montana and That's So Raven. Next, the action is only average. Selena Gomez seems to have slept halfway through many scenes. After all, the jokes are either a clich√© or boring. If they do not use colorful but strange dialogues to "make us laugh", they throw various props in the room. I really wish this show would use original and entertaining material. In conclusion, Wisards of Waverly Place is a disappointment.
