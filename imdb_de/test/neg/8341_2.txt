I saw the trailer for this movie before I saw the Titanic, and I have to admit it aroused my appetite. The volcano seemed quite spectacular and full of promise. But what a wet squib. Corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ridiculous. The stupid daughter is just not believable - she should be 13 and not 4. But then the scientists, firefighters and peripheral characters offer nothing more. This movie is just ahead of Cruise II and Twister, but only because these two films are completely disgusting. This has some reasonable impact, but overall it is 1 in 10 points. Do not waste time
