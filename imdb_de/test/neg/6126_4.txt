The beginning of the film is promising. When Jeanne Pollet (Anna Mouglalis) heard the story of the incident on the day of her birth, suggesting the possibility that she was the daughter of the famous pianist André Polonski (Jacques Dutrone), she found out whether this was true or not, and to give the fact that she also plays the piano, which is not such a distant idea. Jeanne meets André and his wife "Mika" Muller (Isabelle Huppert) and their son and discovers that there are secrets in this family, as well as in their own. <br /> <br /> O.K. We have seen this before and it has been done in a more interesting way than here. The character of "Mika" Muller is up to us to understand her motives for her plot, and she's not interesting enough to take care of her. The piano scenes look spotty and the entire piano performance does not contribute to the insight of the character, but serves to make the film longer than it should have been. <br /> <br /> In short, very disappointing excursion from Chabrol who can do better than this
