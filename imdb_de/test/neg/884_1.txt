Let me make this clear: <br /> <br /> "Hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while taking a cyst out of her face and falls in love with a recently-separated bed within less than 24 hours Host & Breakfast Meet her for her solid advice. "<br /> <br /> Wow. Go over "The Notebook", there's a new kid in town. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? Well, how about the depth of this "relationship"? I think we can safely summarize the basis of this immortal love in the following steps: <br /> <br /> 1. Swap polite jokes with a bite of salad. 2. Drink plenty of Jack Daniels. play basketball with old foods 3. Give unsolicited advice on your crappy life. 4. Love during a hurricane. 5. Dedicate your life by airmail. <br /> <br /> I've noticed that George C Wolfe has "The Hairball" and "United Kanye West Project" in his dossier. Would "stay with your genre" too hard? Enough said. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry, laugh or even hope. But the reason they can do that is because at some point during the story, we really care about the characters we see on screen. To care, time must be spent developing these characters ... their lives, their history and why we are watching them now. Wolfe did not seem to want to "waste" our time on such trifles, and instead he gave us about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense interaction between two actors. We've all come to love, but two CHARACTERS that interest us less. <br /> <br /> For a brief moment when Richard Gere exclaims that he does not expect her to listen to his problems, and she invites him to join in. At dinner, the viewer sees a glimmer - a beginning - of something special between these two characters. But instead of enjoying the anticipation and playfulness of "what happens next" in the wonderful, unpredictable joy of advertising, we are instead being forced into a love affair between two people we barely know. <br /> <br /> Let's face it. We have all heard cheesy deposits in romantic films. But the reason why we let Bogart down a bit in "Casablanca" or Nicholson in "Something's Got A Give" is because our hearts and minds were lifted to the skies and brought back through the mud and back with these figures You the line, we are so deeply involved in their plight that we do not even notice the cheese factor. Since Wolfe does not allow us to love or even like our protagonists, all that remains for us is a sandwich from the sausage and a few giggles in the audience. Wolfe takes the phrase of the old Hollywood director to the chase "too literally here." As each stilted liner is delivered by our cast, the viewer will wonder if director Wolfe subliminally says to the audience, "Come on, it's one Richard Gere romance. Just shopping. "<br /> <br /> Due to this amazing lack of character or relationship development, the climax of the film fails in our hearts. When Gere's character dies, I feel like I'm watching the news of someone from whom I knew he was not going to die, or watch a women's figure-eight race at the Beijing Olympics - just do not care. <br /> <br /> Epic.
