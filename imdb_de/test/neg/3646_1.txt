Well, there are a few things about this movie. Everyone should see it. They see the Iraqi nation as if they had never seen it in the media and seen from a perspective that is hardly noticed by most Americans, where the film has the main audience. But all that's so gloriously in mind is some of the film's other facts. The Iraqi people were given 150 cameras, most of which feel the war and the subjugation of the occupation forces as growing pain for the improvement of their nation. And compared to Saddam, it's only a slight scratch on the skin. Also Netflix as the main distributor had announced ahead of the fun choices we just had by sending a mass email to his entire list to watch the movie. Many of what should be termed opinions that are factored in by the interviewed Iraqis are wrong. If you want to review the records of the Red Cross about the torture of Abu Ghraib, then Saddam's henchmen were not tortured. It was a nice mix of 80-90% innocent civilians and 10-20% rightfully incarcerated people. Never was it known that one of these 10-20% was Saddam's henchman or violator of the curfew. Moreover, the Arab world has never listed "Democracy" as one of its opponents, more correctly the US $ 6 billion for Isreal, our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this movie shows the same distortion. I'm afraid the Iraqi people depicted in this film have been edited to speak with a Yankee voice. Yes, it is true that Saddam is a puke and that his removal is considered by many to be the best. It is true that some Iraqis actually receive a good salary. As it is true, no Iraqi people have control over their most valuable oil and US corporations. It is also not mentioned that 20,000 civilians died exclusively because of US artillery. Still, 15% of the land that once had running water and electricity does not. Nor is it mentioned that from 1993 to 2003 UN sanctions, which were intended and drafted by the US government, killed more than 200,000 Iraqi civilians. It is also not mentioned that in democracy the population decides, not a huge war machine that sends the message: "Be killed or obey". I am afraid that the cutting floor has to have a lot of Iraqis who are not so happy with the crew. Just as the vast majority of the world was not for the war. In fact, the Americans, the English, Spain and the rest are not carriers of democracy. They turned their backs to their backs when they saw how full their pockets could be. Hooray, Saddam is out of power, but I'm afraid there is no Iraqi in power yet. Companies are in power, the media are in power. Read, do research yourself and do not blindfold.
