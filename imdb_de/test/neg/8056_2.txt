I'm probably one of the few who can defend and even enjoy "Frisk," the project that puts Todd Verow on the map, if that's where he actually is. I appreciated that someone had the courage to take Dennis Cooper and not withdraw from the material. Verow rolls around in it pretty much. Judging by what he has done since then, he is well suited to this material and should probably stick to it. "Vacationland," a future "teenager coming out," is misguided in many ways, making it an unintentional comedy, and I'm disappointed to have to report that. <br /> <br /> First of all, our hero, the high school graduate "Joe" is way too old to play 18. If we later meet a man who is supposed to be Joe's teacher, it is confusing, because the sweaty-faced man looks much younger than the student he teaches. Joe's mother looks younger than him and does not "act" older. Second, in Joe's opening scenes, he looked like he was either playing mental challenges or actually experiencing them. In his honor, he got better as the movie went on and I found out he was "playing young", but it just did not work - it was weird. <br /> <br /> It is 15 minutes before anything is revealed, who, what and where these people are and why we should be interested. The second scene in the film is an extended business in a gentleman toilet room, which, considering where the story goes later, is absolutely superfluous; The subplot with the teacher goes nowhere, even as a "rite of passage" for our "young" hero ... In a minute, Joe nervously tries his hand at sex in the bathroom (a scene that is so unexceptional that it really makes you I wonder what everyone sees in practice, and the next minute he's an expert on sexual blackmail and violent double crossovers, followed by an extended scene with the character we'll learn later, "Andrew," and that's all what we learn about him, except he's apparently gay, but has not come out yet. <br /> <br /> There's a lot stuffed to the 1:44 runtime (which is about 20 minutes too long - I can not imagine as it was played with the breathtakingly long and pointless deleted scenes of Joe), a negotiation from "Gods And Monsters" with an aged patron, the rhetorical utterances of an actor triggers, obviously not to his line n can remember (he will conveniently be sent in a way Dickens came up with) a slow week); a mix-and-match game that's almost four steps between the boys and their girlfriends, a gay-roaring toilet brush, a wily, wise-looking Nellie queen (and the Nellie Queen has not suddenly taken on the role of " Whore with the heart of gold "as a tired stereo type?) Who exists only to be demoted; Extortion, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and misuse of music loops for soundtrack recordings. <br /> <br /> What you DO NOT find in this movie are interior shots that depict master shots. We are expected to be in an airport, grocery, and classroom, as all the scenes in those locations consist of close-ups and poorly-crafted soundscapes to convey the idea of ​​locales that production could not have accomplished. One thing they could get seems to have been a real gay bar; Either it's the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in Bangor, Maine, as the bar never has guests. Another good giggle came when the actors were about to scream about dance music that obviously did not come out of the speakers but was more of the booming loop music of the "score". <br /> <br /> Actions and characters come and go, emotions are unreadable, and the dialogue, clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper, is "film-oriented," meaning that no one speaks this way. Since we do not get any information about these characters, it's impossible to worry about what's happening to them. It's as if Joe et al one day would come out of the air and just cease to exist as soon as the credits roll (certainly the character of Joe's sister, a would-be Jennifer Gray, who is bohemian crazy), just seems to be "stopping us." "I never know where she is in LA or what her problem is ... but again ... is it important?). Optically, the film sometimes looks very good, more of a proof of new developments in HD video than anything else, I suspect. The cut is quite clunky (there was a great cut, Joe poses naked and says, "I wanted to do some sports, but ...") and we cut a shot that reveals his "butt ..." (ha ha ). The composition is also sometimes strange (I thought I was watching SCTV's parody of "Persona" as the boys talked in bed with each other and visually it looked like their noses were being held together for the entire scene!). <br /> <br You can tell that Verow is really holding back from making a "naughty" or slightly harsher film, as he usually does, and maybe he should not have held back (the frothy toothpaste / sex fantasy worked) well, I thought, though the sound was.) (out of touch with the rest of the movie) ... he produces and directs this story "Sensitive Coming of Age", much like Herschell Gordon Lewis filmed movies without Gore ... porn movies without sex , I got a few unintentional laughs and it was not boring, it was not too good either.
