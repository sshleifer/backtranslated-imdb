I can immediately admit that this is one of the worst films I've seen in my life. And that's not a bit to say, because I consider myself a crappy movie when it comes to crappy film. But that is more than bad. This movie is so awful that it's no fun, it's just bad. <br /> <br /> This is almost impossible to check. There are no strong points and nothing positive to say. I'm just going to talk about a few of the points that got sucked through. First of all, the CGI must be one of the worst I've ever seen. I can not believe that this movie was shot in 2005. The CGI reminds me of something I saw in Babylon 5 when CGI was new and fresh. It is unimaginably poor. Second, the actors all seem to be among the worst day soaps. And when I look at their CVs, I see that I'm right ... Third, the ability to breed giant reptiles is nothing compared to the other technologies they invented in this film: the recoilless gun with endless ammunition ! Seriously, Michael Par√© shoots 100-200 times without reloading in any other scene ... As if that was not enough, there are also shape-changing aircraft! First they are regular F-16 fighters, in the next scene they are something completely different and in the third scene they are F-16 again! If you buy stock footage, please do not mix it like that! Honestly, there's a lot more to say, but I think I'll stop. You all understand what I say. Honestly, I did not think that this kind of movie was done anymore. It's like Ed Wood is doing something. Totally unaware of quality, does not care about what looks like ... It's almost amazing in its awfulness. If I could give it 0/10, I would, but 1/10 is the lowest grade. That's it.
