Oh my god, this movie is so poor, I am amazed I saw everything. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that Vinny Jones should only play one London bat period of story. <br /> <br /> Pisttolero is so unconvincing that it is almost funny. Bending in Dennis Hopper and David Carradine did not save this movie 1 star .. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs .. Vinny Oh my god, I thought I saw everything when he played the Irish Tinker: P <br /> <br /> I think the average viewer will do it I realize this movie is maybe just a movie that will never be. I can not see how anyone could really drop that crap
