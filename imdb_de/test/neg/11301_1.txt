Hollywood has stirred up another garbage that is overhyped and unimpressive at first sight. Hannibal is bad, terrible, incompetent, lame, droll, idiotic, fictional, laughable and absolutely cruel (no pun intended). This is followed by smaller spoilers ... <br /> <br /> This film has huge logical gaps - more than any Bruckheimer / Bay movie - or any - any movie that illustrates the enjoyment of Hollywood exaggeration. It's a sleek Hollywood production that will benefit Hannibal Lector Mania, directed by "so gloomy-takes-so-too-serious" -hook director Ridley Scott. It was produced by an Italian hack producer with an inflated ego, whose credo is "It does not matter if the movie is bad, the money is good". <br /> <br /> I can not get over the fact that the acclaimed screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian have written this lame-adapted tripe, and presumptuous book by Thomas Harris, a good novelist and hack writer. David and Steven - well-known and immensely talented scriptwriters - wasted their efforts on a bad script in return for fat paychecks. Another factor in the disappointment of this film. <br /> <br /> There are too many ridiculous scenes that you can list that are ridiculous in clunky execution and bad logic, such as: Starling / Pazzi cell phone in the middle of the persecution of Lecter depicting Inspector Pazzi as a victim. Apart from ridiculously bad dialogues of Tony Hopkins with a grin and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who can not act with the straight face. Hopkins cites the true meaning of "scenery-chewing" along with hammam actors by Gary Oldman as a deformed psychopath seeking revenge on Lecter. <br /> <br /> The gore effect is good, but rather serves as a repulsion, providing tension that Hannibal particularly lacks. The predecessor - the silence of the lambs - is more credible with tension and tension. Excitement is what made Silence of the Lamb a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention excellently written and tense stagings. The "Brain Dinner" series is so ridiculously fake that it borders on self-parody. <br /> <br /> The end is kind of crass and idiotic - shall we believe that Lecter, with the last shot, still poses a threat to society His glittering eye staring at you? Ooh, scary ... <br /> <br />
