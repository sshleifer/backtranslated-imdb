I thought this movie was too absurd to finish. The premise was too stupid and predictable. I did not get far into the movie. <br /> <br /> Let me see you. She's obviously older than the taxi driver (unless she's much younger than she looks). He is black and she is white. She earns more money than he does (he's just a taxi driver). These are three of society's most statistically failed unions, all in one, and we're supposed to pretend they have a chance in hell. It would be better if she marries the man she does not love. <br /> <br /> I only partially saw it because I love MJW as an actor. His acting was great. You, meh! It was alright, but the premise is too stupid. I did not see the end. I could not do it, so I do not know if it ended differently than I had predicted. I can not imagine a black woman who likes this movie. It is a painful thing to watch a black man taking care of such a white woman. And an old one too. YOU'RE WELCOME! Not in the real world!
