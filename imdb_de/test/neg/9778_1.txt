I spent $ 5 on renting all this crap. Dr. Zack is the unwelcome main character I've ever seen. The movie was full of EVERY clich√© you could ever think of, and contained no OUNCE originality. There was the typical sexism portrayed by rough foreigners. All men had these too proud to take advice that is as stale as Grandma's Christmas fruit cake. The concept and the deaths were really cool, but they lose all the novelties as soon as the monster is uncovered. (Read the SPOILER in the end.) Nothing else is really revealed, the end is the biggest cop-out you've ever seen. I predicted everything before it happened, even who would die and how. The dialogue is missing, and that is by far an understatement. There is usually only accidental screaming, thoughtful stare and chunky sentences. The actors are just GOD WONDER! I do not want to talk about this movie anymore, that makes me angry. I'm just wondering if the director even saw it when it was done. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER ALERT SAVE 5 DOLLARS!) The monster is just a bunch of ants that are now "evolving" bones so they can move (not to mention the fact that this is not evolutionary benefit and that the ants killed the one who was available, even though the film looks like he was killing out of necessity, this movie made me stupid.) The end is the main idiot, the mother ant ( a big blob thing) that destroys all the other ants. Pretty cliche how? In the end, he is almost confused about a sudden emotional attachment to the mother-thing that overcomes him. Give me a break.
