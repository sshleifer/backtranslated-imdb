I saw this video because I like Malta and this movie was shot there in its entirety. Very disappointing as it does not capture the taste and beauty of the island - only the hot, dry and barren elements. The film was boring, boring, completely incoherent, presumptuous, and devoid of conspiracy from beginning to end. They had to be a clairvoyant to follow the storyline or their absence. It had its moments, sure; But also to the dentist. <br /> <br /> In short, I would rather endure another colonoscopy before revisiting this terrible mess. It was so bad that I could not sleep. There are some "Eurotrash" films that were apparently filmed without adult supervision. This is one of them. On the good side, who is Nadia Cassini? I've never seen a nicer pair of legs. She is the only salvation in this movie. <br /> <br /> Disturbing was also the cruel wild boar hunt, which is shown in the credits. A wild boar released by someone on land (Malta has very few native mammals, all small rats, bats, etc.) and then raised by dogs before being shot. Well, despite this movie, go to Malta anyway - it's a beautiful, colorful island; rich in history and a lot of fun.
