No way out was really bad in 2007, and if it's the way to choose Wrestlemania, they're choosing the wrong path. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit & the Robust Boys with MVP & Minn: In my opinion, this was the best match of The Night doing some good wrestling here but not much. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Cruisweight championship open (which Chavo Guerrero won): terrible, not soaring at all, really fast and boring. 3/10 <br /> <br /> little bastard & finlay def little bogeyman & bogeyman: that was more comedy than wrestling, some laugh. <br/> <br /> Kane is king of Booker: a decent effort of these two, but they could do better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> wwe day team championship Paul London & Brian Kendrick defend Deuce & Domino: another boring game, not a flight of champions. 4/10 <br /> <br /> ecw world title Mr. Kennedy def bobby lashley (Desquilification): in my opinion the worst game of the night. really terrible. i thought ecw was not settling, i was wrong 2/10 <br /> <br /> john cena & Shawn Michaels v Batista and the Undertaker: a good match but could have been much better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> Overall these were bulls * that would give 3/10
