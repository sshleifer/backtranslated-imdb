The director was probably still in his early stages of learning as he worked on the Western. Look at the outfits. Everyone looks well-groomed, brushed, well dressed and ironed as if he were ready for the church. Even the horses look well-groomed and shiny. This is a WESTERN to cry aloud! It should look dusty, evil and sweaty. And then there's the amateurish spectacle of women in this bird. The whole lot, a dozen or so, all pretty and well equipped, was freshly raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows. Instead, they all watch with great interest (if not downright lustful greed) for the newly arrived great Seven, who love to feed, connect and comfort them during their battles with the bandits. The same criticism applies to Lee van Cleef, who does a reasonable good acting. Our Lee, who plays the law, has just lost his dear wife. But Lee, hard as organic rock, shows no emotion and is within a few days after the death of his spouse in the arms of a juicy widow, with whom he goes with her brood into the future. The cad. And there is something else that bothers me about this kind of movie: It does not matter how many dynamite-induced explosions take place in the midst of a pack of about 50 horses, no matter how many shots the mob is fired at, only the crooks are killed and the nag always go in one piece happily in the way. (I know ... stupid Moi ... it's just a movie ...). It's not the worst Western ever made, but prepare for serious yawning.
