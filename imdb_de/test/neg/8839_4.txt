Lone Star Productions brought her out safely in the thirties, and "Star Packer" feels like one of the more over-hasty ones. John Wayne is US Marshal John Travers. He investigates a crooked Hoodlum, known only as "The Shadow," which is responsible for stealing cattle, staging, and the like, and issuing orders behind the door of a fake wall safe. Yakima Canutt is the loyal Indian mate of Travers who is aptly named as ... well, "yak". <br /> <br /> Early on, we discover that Cattlemens Union boss Matt Matlock (George pre-Gabby Hayes) really does object to The Shadow; The total gift is when he offers to buy up his (supposed) niece Anita's half of the Matlock Ranch, as "this is not a place for a girl". As Anita, Verna Hillie does not have much to do in the movie, though in a comical moment she has to use a six shooter to blow the butt of one of the villains in a nighttime panic attack. <br /> <There are a few curiosities in the movie - First, Wayne's character alternately rides a white and a dark horse in the first half of the movie. In a sort of neat device, in the middle of the street, there is a hollow tree stump, which is used by a stooge. And finally, the film is not really up to its name, as Sheriff Travers never wears a badge throughout the movie, ie a star-packer without a star. <br /> <br /> The horses are hunting, the runaway stage scenes, the stagecoach from the cliff (another curiosity, the horses loosen up from the stage) are all commonplace. But John Wayne fans will want to watch this charisma early in his career. For those who were more critical, the white cloths worn around the forehead by the Guten group could only mean that they all had a headache.
