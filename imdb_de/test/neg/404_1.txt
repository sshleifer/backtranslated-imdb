I saw this movie based on the comments of some who said it was bad but funny. But be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced. They make science fiction films of the fifties look like works of art. This is sometimes funny, but mostly annoying. And to compound the problem with the seriously miserable special effects is the utter lack of logic that characterized a majority of the events depicted. One of my favorites is where three of the characters fall hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the Arachnia and arrive to find them fully lit. Apparently, the Arachnia has also succeeded in connecting to the electricity grid. Very impressive. This is just one example. And what's worth it, the music is shit, the acting is shit, the two cute girls are annoying, the obnoxious guy is annoying, the so-called handsome captain is a geek, and the black girl who falls in love with him is a fool. Her dad is the worst actor I've ever seen. I am not sure if the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience.
