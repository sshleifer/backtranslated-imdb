Boring, ruthless conspiracy, one of the worst ways I've ever come in, inhuman drama and terrible stereotypes. The film ends with one of the main characters who awakes from a dream. What about it? Even JR from Dallas could not survive this lame turn. <br /> <br /> You have something that can only be described as an inappropriate relationship between a protagonist and a young girl who is supposed to be a paternal but who seems to be a pervert. They have Freshman Community College Movie School special effects with loopholes the size of the Kimberly Hole. This is as if Children of the Corn meets Passion of Christ is imposed on an endless loop of government training videos. If you do not remember to finish it, you do not have a brain. > Do not bother.
