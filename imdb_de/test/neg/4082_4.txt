The creative team behind Evan Almighty could have done a better movie. With one of America's most popular jokes, led by Tom Shadyac, director of Ace Ventura Pet Detective, you expect a higher number of laughs than the picture. Even Steve Oedekerk, who wrote and directed the cruel Barnyard last year and achieves a written record here, has done a better job. The fact is that Evan Almighty is not the worst picture of the summer season, but it could be the most disappointing. The title and the creative team behind the picture suggest that this is a sequel to the 2003 Bruce Almighty. Jim Carrey took the lead in the lead, and although both Steve Carell and Carrey are both funny guys, it's the latter who are better for this material. I've heard that Carrey was offered this sequel in front of everyone else, but the actor refused that he saw no other places his character could dare. So Shadyac moved to Carell, who was always amusingly involved in the original since 2003. After the sleeper hit the 40-year-old maiden and little Miss Sunshine, the man has become a big deal, so he's more likely to face Jim, who introduces Jim to the cinemas. In history, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) has been elected as a Congressman, and so he and his troupe are moving house and state for Evan to succeed in his work. His wife (Lauren Graham) and three children are in doubt, but on the whole they have a supportive side towards Evan, who is optimistic about the future. Things are starting to dissolve pretty quickly though. God (Morgan Freeman) seems to tell Evan that a flood is imminent and that the politician must build an ark. After ignoring the encounter, Evan quickly gets a robe that does not shave and animals start showing up after two. Then Evan starts to build the boat, but the neighborhood is not happy and no other politician (John Goodman). Anyone expecting the crazy laughter of some of Tom Shadyac's other films is likely to be left completely cold by this movie. Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, and Hell, even Bruce Almighty, mostly had very funny pictures, but all these projects have one thing, and that's Jim Carrey's presence. Shadyac did not make a worthwhile movie without Carrey, he worked with Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and now Steve Carell, but only Carrey seems to mix successfully with Shadyac. Carell will not desperately re-work with the director after the disappointing box office and critical mauling, and with Carrey now carrying out more serious projects, Shadyac should find a new comic book more quickly. Carell himself is quite bored here, whoever felt that his role in the first film (although quite amusing) deserved a full-length movie should be taken back and filmed. I think, after Bruce Almighty's box office draw, it was Universal Studios itself, but if a good comedian can do nothing with a character, then the person of Scren is a dud, and that's exactly what Evan Almighty thinks. Lauren Graham is not a great shake up as Evan's wife, and one of the kids does not strike the right note. Freeman leaves everything as God in another amusing and cool performance, but he seems to wear the piece sporadically. The most consistent source of laughter is Evan's secretary (Wanda Sykes) and creeping collaborator (Jonah Hill). Both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. Oedekerk's writing was worse (Barnyard), but also better (Ace Ventura When Nature Calls) than his work on this production. His script has really funny moments, but it's also full of casual family moments and the humor is never funny or offensive enough. The film takes tame and light blows on religion if it were to tear the concept to pieces. The opening sequence in The Simpsons Movie shakes religion harder than the entire 95-minute series by Evan Almighty. With a little more courage and heart the picture could have been much better. I do not doubt that the family's core audience will be easily entertained by this movie, but whether they're happy is another matter entirely. There is a line between observable and worthwhile, a line that Evan Almighty always has on the wrong side. Maybe if you get bored and watch the movies on cable, you can afford to watch, but I can imagine much better ways to spend my time, and especially my money, than to tune into this mediocre comedy.
