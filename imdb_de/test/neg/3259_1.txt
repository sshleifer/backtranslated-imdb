After seeing Caddyshack 1, I had heard that there was a sequel and decided to look it up. The movie seemed pretty bad and I told myself to stay away, but stupidly gave in and bought the damned thing! All the reviews and everything you've heard about Caddyshack II is true. The movie is just tired of ideas and the lame acts and jokes I've ever heard I can only say this movie as much as possible. I deeply regret that I viewed and bought the DVD, but I was not sure what decision was made. Stay away as far as possible.
