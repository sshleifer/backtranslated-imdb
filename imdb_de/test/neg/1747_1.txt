Although the acting was excellent, I've been waiting the whole movie for the bad boy who has caused so many sorrows to so many characters that he gets his final archenemy, and besides him and all the others, he has suffered and gets the husband's job His wife's wife is his death he caused when he fled from his friends wins the girl he gave an overdose and tried to rape. Even his friend gives money to his father, but the butterfly effect does not return to its cause. <br /> <br /> This is a very dark movie as every character affected suffers a never-ending depression. None of the normal discharge routes seems to be effective, and the authorities seem to be only giving stress pills. <br /> <br /> If this is normal in Finland, I will never go back, just in case I am affected by such an amoral butterfly and end up being destroyed like the characters in this movie were.
