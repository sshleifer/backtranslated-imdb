You get a good deal of environmental anxiety from Steven Seagal and some stunning mountain views as well as cowboy scenes (or alternatively use parts of the remains of the HORSE WHISPERER). They then add a large chunk of OUTBREAK virus or similar (note it must be deadlier and at least biohazard level 4) wrapped around a thick militia group leader. They add a teaspoon of martial arts and a zipper with explosions and shots for the taste. Add the classic red Indian herbs. Serve immediately. <br /> <br /> What's the name of the movie you get ?: The Patriot. Perhaps the worst movie by Steven Seagal. I'm sure Seagal tried to say something in this movie, except for the usual I'm-a-cook (but also an ex-seal), but his recipe was confusing and the taste was awful.
