It's hard to mess up this story. BIG BOOK / Good movie by Fred Zinneman, but this movie is WUNDER! At first, the casting was awful. Richard Gere was to play the Jackal himself, as Edward Fox was a similar type of Cypher, and they did not have to bother with the original script by adding so much worthless (expensive) lint. This movie reminded me of as many Bruce Willis films as you can see with the NOTHING Cinematic. (It's his "conspiracy theory") It takes some real action to make a movie so bad from such a fine original script. EACH person of Michael Caton Jones should not be able to make films for 10 years. This is the insult of this film for real filmmakers. If Hollywood had gone to court because it had no idea what they were doing, that would be the movie Exhibit A. Too bad for you ALL!
