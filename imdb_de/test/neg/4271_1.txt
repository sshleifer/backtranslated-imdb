total crap. <br /> <br /> I was kind of excited to see this because it's the only movie I've ever seen from Mansfield Park. I had gone through the first four episodes, but when Henry and Fanny entered the supply scene, I snapped and had to turn it off. Who uses this Sylvestra Le Touzel lady, must be blind and deaf, because the woman is the worst actress I've ever seen in my life. The whole thing is just bad, bad, bad. I dont know. I just do not know why people writing Jane Austen scripts are not able to give their work the respect it deserves.
