This woman is a terrible comedian. She can not joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American garbage that people laugh about because they have no idea how to react. They say, "Well, it's a comedy show." > <br /> I can not stand this miserable woman and her embarrassing apology for the comedy. It does not earn anything except drilling. <br /> <br /> Why can not America drain that kind of crazy pleasure and look for something that actually contains humor? <br /> <br /> She is not funny. Not at all. Why, oh why does one person like this idiot?
