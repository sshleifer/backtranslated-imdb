What would have been a dramatic story about life on the river turns out to be a silly, limp romance about an English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with an Australian accent) who falls in love with the first officer (John Waters) of a paddle steamer. <br /> <br /> The first half of this four-and-a-half-hour mini-series is promising, but drops off soon as it becomes predictable and thin. The plot needed some pep and spark to bring life to the film. The early exit of Gus Mercurio did not help, as his character seemed to me the only interesting. <br /> <br /> Maybe the longer TV version has more depth because this video translation was certainly missing. <br /> Sunday, June 27, 1993 - Video
