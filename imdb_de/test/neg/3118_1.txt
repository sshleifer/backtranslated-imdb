The film contains a very brief scene of Deneuve in a bathtub. For a 56-year-old lady she looks absolutely stunning, but this is the only salvation of the movie. Otherwise, it has a mindless, unmotivated script, and the lead actress has none of Deneuve's appeal. The director has evidently seen too many Peter Greenaway films, and Pola X acts as an imitation of the Greenaway style without his being inspired.
