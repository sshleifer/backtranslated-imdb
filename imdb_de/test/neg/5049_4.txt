Ridiculous thriller in which a group of students abducted their bad and neurotic teacher (Mirren) just to prevent their actions against them. Interesting premise could be a good movie, but this is just lame and far-fetched. Boring with one end embarrassing, to say the least. Mrs. Mirren tries to give some dignity to this misfire, but even she - a good actress, no doubt - could save that garbage. I give a 4 (four).
