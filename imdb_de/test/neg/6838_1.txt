Spoiler !! Bruce Willis, the part-time comic and funny guy, plays a Hispanic assassin named after an African scavenger hound? I believe all the good Hispanic nicknames, such as Sicatriz (Scar), Scorpion, Viper, Cobra, Snake, Tarantula, Latigo (Whip), Navaja (Blade) etc. were not available. And why would a South American assassin be familiar with a terrorist of the Irish Republican Army? The last time I checked, the IRA did not want to open a branch office in South America. And why would an Irish terrorist, torn up in prison, look like a middle-aged Richard Gere? I thought maybe this movie would be a parody of "The Crying Game" when Gere's character was introduced as the person who wanted to hunt "The Jackal". What a bad casting! And why should the FBI hire depraved terrorists to find killers? It seems that a terrorist is seeking mass extermination, and an assassin usually hits a target in a non-spectacular way. But Gere, according to FBI, is the only person Willis has ever seen alive. I thought this movie should be a remake of the very big movie "Day of The Jackal", but this movie is just a stupid version of "Assassin's" with Stallone and Banderas. Both movies are really stupid, and part of the stupidity is the fact that as a spectator we have to watch Bruce Willis doing his routines and we should say, "Wow, is not he smart!" THE PROFESSIONAL with Jean Reno was a much better movie about assassins. "The Jackal" is just a movie about two big middle-aged millionaire actors who could be paid to stand around, look pretty and pretend to be smart! "The Jackal" is so poor that I expected Sly Stallone, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke and Jean Clod Van Dumme to appear as "other" hitmen or FBI. Needless to say, The Jackal has escaped the FBI for twenty-five years, but as soon as Richard Gere starts work, it only takes a few days for The Jackal to be broken! I think the positive message of this film is: "Thanks to terrorists, our streets are safe from assassins." Overall, the "Jackal" has no redeeming qualities.
