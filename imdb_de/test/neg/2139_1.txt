I'm not sure what the director and the editor thought when they made this bad excuse for a movie. Acting is by no means the problem, it's the terrible editing, scenes end for no apparent reason, while in the middle of an action sequence or people are cut off in the middle of a sentence. I'm not sure what the story was, but it did not matter because what I saw was pretty uninteresting. Just bad, a huge "Jaws" rip-off and no good. The MST version was funny though. 7 for that, none for the movie itself.
