I'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but I thought it was weird. Isobel is obsessed with the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and the gardener will fix it. Partly exorcism and partly soap opera, you'll get at least a few laughs. There is the paranoid jealous father, the satanic sister, the mother of the Valley of the Dolls and then the cowboy friend. everything to help the rock that chases the priest to fight the demons of the sweet Isobel. It sometimes felt like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid for it. Instead of the cool head twist, the cursing of the sailor and the crucifix that Regan made in The Exorcist; They get a lot of Isobel jumping on their bed as if it were a trampoline, hiding in their closet and jumping off a hayloft. Yes, it's Chuck E. Cheese who's wild. So if you want to watch an unquoted horror movie that's worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable end ... this is your movie.
