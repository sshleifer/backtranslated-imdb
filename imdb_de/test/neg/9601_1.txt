If you think that Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt and Corey Feldman have a list of good actors, you have to smoke, something I'd like to try. Where should I start: lousy soundtrack, pounding drama, "action" in places. This is the typical amateur hack that was rinsed and was never the love of the star. I actually felt embarrassed for the "stars" in this "movie". The only actor missing at the top was Gary Coleman, who, if he had been in the movie, would have done it at least a little howling, not just bad. There was a part in the movie Carol Alt yelled, "DO I THINK AN IDIOT ?!" Yes, Carol, I do, your agent does it and PLEASE for the love of everything decent and holy ... Go away and stop humiliating yourself! Anna Nicole Smith would participate in this film. <br /> <br /> I would tell you what the plot was, but that would be another sentence fragment in this article, and my thoughts wandered many times during the movie anyway, at least I was barely paying attention.
