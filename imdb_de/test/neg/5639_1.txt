I hear my parents watching (after I had given up 10 minutes after the movie) no idea what's going on. When "Charles Dickens" stared into the camera, I half expected that he would turn into a demon (yes, he looked like one). Unfortunately, that did not happen. <br /> <br /> This film had several reasons why I did not finish it: First, it was unbearably slow. I mean, seriously, it was slow. You can only understand 10% of what is being said, and the characters have been poorly introduced. <br /> <br /> If you have an English accent and a LOTTT conversation, no action, terrible acting, cheesy laugh and the same music / sound effects played over and over again, then this is THE movie for you .. . <br /> <br /> 1/10 - totally terrible. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
