Normally, I would not waste my time criticizing a useless movie like this one. However, I have no work this week, and I have plenty of time to indulge in meaningless trifles. First, I would like to say that I often like non-commercial, non-mainstream and non-American cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography.) That said, there are many bad movies that are released in countries outside the US. Trust me, I've been tortured by hundreds of them. "Lost In Beijing" is a particularly bad movie. <br /> <br /> The opening half hour is an impressive, uninterrupted exhibition of moral degeneracy. This film offers some classic morality ideas that are on a par with Kim Ki-duk's "Bad Guy" (2001). <br /> <br /> 1. Women actually enjoy being raped; 2. Rape should be glorified, praised and respected; 3. Feel free to rape any woman you like, because as you "make" her, she will eventually like it and get orgasm; 4. If your wife is raped, make sure you blackmail her rapist for a lot of money, but if he does not pay, just beat his wife repeatedly as compensation. 5. If your wife is raped, rape her the next day while playing the role of the rapist and mock her with lines like "Did he feel that way to you?"; 6. If your husband is a rapist, just accept him. 7. After being personally raped, join your rapist and hang with him whenever possible. <br /> <br /> How can anyone who is sensible, be interested in one of these characters? They are nothing more than a bunch of degenerates, who not only live their lives carelessly, but actually revel in their futility and support each other. Do not get me wrong. I really enjoy watching movies that reflect lifestyles and customs that contradict my own. "Ichi the Killer" (2001) and "Moonlight Whispers" (1999) are very interesting depictions of sado-masochism. "Strange Circus" (2005) is a very perverted game against child sexual abuse. "Marriage Is A Crazy Thing" (2002) is a scathing indictment of traditional marriage. Even religious films like "Running On Karma" (2003) and "Samsara" (2001) have occasionally entertained me. The difference is that these films actually have some interesting psychological content and characteristics, while "Lost In Beijing" has almost none. <br /> <br /> It is known that people with unorthodox ways of thinking exist on this planet, but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the files themselves, ending with a superficial depiction of hideous behavior. Why is Bing Bing finally friends with her rapist? Why does a rapist's wife accept his behavior unconditionally? The filmmakers have never bothered to tell us. Even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was unimaginable and ultimately served as a mere situational trick. It all feels too bland and has disappeared after the dirty half hour. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers seem to confuse moral ambiguity with complex characterization. The reason you can not choose which person to choose is that it was not developed properly. Do not think that this movie has complex characters just because they are not clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason why they are not clearly defined is because we do not know or know what they think. This is hardly a positive feature of this film. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, camerawork and acting are pretty good, but everything else gets more and more boring as the movie progresses. You can do this in addition to trash like "Turning Gate" (2002), "What time is it" (2001), "Irreversible" (2002) and the already mentioned "Bad Guy".
