I can not believe it! I thought that's a good sequel to Jim having a baby in the movie, but instead a movie with shabby actors, stupid plot, and stupid scenes. This should be in "weirdest films of earth on earth". Thank goodness the same director did not do this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny, not the piss and not the dancing! I laughed at how stupid the person did that, like Homer Simpson doing a movie about a donut! I wish someone makes a remake of the mask's son with such an act! The mask guy (Jim Carry) and his wife have a son who is a normal baby. If the baby finds another mask, it also becomes a mask and the masked guy tries to get his mask back! This is very crap, so I give a 1 out of 10 points. Fu * king sh * t!
