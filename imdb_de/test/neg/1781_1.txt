Even with most B movies, this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen. The graphics are so bad that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. The seawater effects are particularly ridiculous, including the one scene in which they enter the mini submarine, and the "water" seems frozen. The problems with this film are so numerous that I stop here with the details. Needless to say, I'm not joking when I say that even Uwe Toilet Boll could do a better job herself. Avoid this movie at all costs, there are other B-grade films that, while terrible, are at least a good way to pass the time.
