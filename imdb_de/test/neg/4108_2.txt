The drama was terrible, the cheesy, fake, cheap green screen effects were ridiculous and the creatures were left behind. The only good thing about this movie was the concept and the laughter I got from watching such a bad movie - then I got quite angry because I realized I had lost $ 4 to rent it. Why should a movie like this ever be in theaters? I know that this movie hit the market almost five years ago, but is anyone bothering to make films? I only write random things to fill space - because I need ten lines of text to publish this review. This next line should do it roughly. Annnndddddd there!
