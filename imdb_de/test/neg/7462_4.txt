Slow, weird film that draws to its disappointing climax and plodes (I mean really PLODS). You may expect a kind of punchline in the end, but there is none. Both Milland and Snodgress give awkward performances. In fact, the comedy of the movie is actually the only thing it has to offer. The generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts (like the music played on the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a really horrific fantasy scene involving a gorilla. (**)
