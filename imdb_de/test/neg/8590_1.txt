I have just returned from "AGS". After seeing it, I'm convinced that Stone NEVER has watched an NFL game in his life, no matter how much it was written, as he did extensive research on the film. Great cinematography? Give me a break. The game montages were almost invisible and 90% of the other shots of the film were close-ups. Was there anything in this movie that was not addressed in "North Dallas Forty"? <br /> <br /> Aging Star Player ... check. Young hot intake ... check. Painkillers .... check. Owner who does not "get it" .... check. Crazy off-field behavior .... check <br /> <br /> There are also the playoffs in Dallas (d. H. Dec or Jan) in an open-air stadium. Nevertheless, people are sitting in tank tops and shorts! And what about these lights? Did you play in a Japanese kabuki theater or in a sports stadium? <br /> <br /> And the strategy shown in the game was ridiculous. It is fourth and 1 within the "Sharks" 30. Dallas heads 35-31. Click on the goal of the frigging. That would have made sense not only football technical, but you would then have an even better final sequence in which they could have points and had to for the two-point conversion. Hell, tie the game to the extra point and Stone could have done it with overtime for even 3 hours. <br /> <br /> Would the lame montages of "Old Time" footballers be a tribute to the game? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> And the script ... ugh. More stereotypes than you can shake off with a stick ... oops, there's another one. <br /> <br /> "Slapshot" was better than this movie. By far, <br /> <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> Skip this at any cost. <br /> <br />
