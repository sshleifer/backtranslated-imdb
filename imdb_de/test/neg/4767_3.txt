Although this is not one of Miss Davies worst movies, it is pretty bad. And it is sad that the most recent IMDb evaluators have purposely inflated the results of some of their films in a revisionist manner, to compensate them in the past - at least it seems. For years, it's been well known that Davies was a terrible actress and only got the roles she got because her friend, William Randolph Hearst, had found her way to Hollywood. This is certainly the image created in CITIZEN KANE by Orson Welles. It is true that Hearst has used his considerable wealth and clout to build Davies career. With all the money, it's no surprise that she made great films, and it's not surprising that people became a fool of the extra attention she got. To sleep with the man who finances your films will definitely be noticed. However, despite this lead, she has also made quite a few bad movies, and I think we need a balance when it comes to the results of her films. After all, no reasonable person could believe that PEG O 'MY HEART and two other Davies films recently featured on Turner Classic Movies (THE FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE) earned the extraordinary ratings. Higher than such movies as HIGH NOON, BEN HUR, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT !! In fact, according to IMDb, MARIANNE would now be the fifth-best movie of all time with a score of 8.8 !!! Considering that most of the people out there do not know who Marion Davies was AND most of their movies were financial disasters, this is a serious problem !! However, she was a much better actress than CITIZEN KANE suggested, and she first went into movies before she started sleeping with Hearst. <br /> <br /> What sets PEG O 'MY HEART apart from these two other films is that MARIANNE and THE FLORODORA GIRL were pleasant little movies - while PEG O' MY HEART is in some ways just awful. Much was the terrible abuse of Marion. While her French accent in MARIANNE was cute, her Irish accent in PEG sounded bizarre-not particularly Irish. Plus, and maybe I'm wrong, but her constant use of the word 'ye' makes her sound like she was supposed to play Shakespeare, not a 1933 film in Ireland! There was also a bizarre insistence that Marion should be the accomplished all-rounder - so they did not just make them act but dance and sing. The vocals did indeed fit the scripts in some of her films, but here he seemed out of place and seriously affecting the movie. It seemed like you could almost hear Hearst say, "See - she's a great actress - watch her singing and dancing". Unfortunately, Marion simply looked uncomfortable and inappropriate in many of these scenes. But the biggest problem for me was the idea that 36-year-old Marion plays such a young role. It was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the movie was supposed to be the way Mary Pickford had played in the teen years and twenties, complete with pig tails and brave posture. Miss Pickford COULD take these roles with her, even if she was not a girl anymore. But here Marion had increased a bit and looked at least 30 out. No insult - she looked good for her age - but she did NOT look like a teenager! <br /> <br /> Strangely, with the millions that Hearts spent on Marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good script that matched Marion's talents. Believe me, I've rated some of her films very highly (I especially love SHOW PEOPLE), but here she just could not help but flop - this movie was a turkey.
