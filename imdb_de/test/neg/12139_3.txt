Let me be clear. I hate such movies. I do not like anything where the protagonists are all bourgeoisie. I find this kind of literature and film terribly presumptuous. You will never make me volunteer to read a Jane Austen book. The only reason I read the book by W. Somerset Maugham and saw the following movie was for a class. Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a beautiful Englishwoman who borrowed from a villa in Florence before World War II. One night, after having eaten together with some of her rich relatives, she voluntarily picks up an Austrian refugee, has sex with him and ditches, and then kills himself. If the movie keeps going, you really do not want to like Mary. <br /> <br /> What a bunch of crap this movie was. At first, many subplots and characters were invented in the film that were not even included in the book. I very much doubt that the late Mr. Maugham would have appreciated her. Although the characters were wealthy, they were among the most superficial and selfish people I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I gave him no less than three stars was that acting was just what was redeemable. The ever-talented Kristin Scott Thomas is perfect for the role of Mary. In fact, I could not imagine anyone else filling their shoes. Sean Penn and Anne Bancroft also had supporting roles that were as good as the lead role. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the pain of watching this movie.
