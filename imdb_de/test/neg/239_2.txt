Oh man, they knew exactly how to make them then. Hollywood has forgotten the basics of bad filmmaking: cardboard steel and the God-fearing Scientist Action Hero! <br /> <br /> This movie was so close to a masterpiece, but it was not supposed to be that way as it had no jet cannons and intruders from the moon. The MST3K version attempted to remedy the problem by adding a pilot from a show called Captain Cody, in which a guy with a rocket gun battles bad make-up people from the moon, but that was not quite true Comments from the boys in the theater were not nearly as funny as I expected. All in all a big disappointment.
