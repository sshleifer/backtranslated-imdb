Amando DeOssorio was never the one to get in the way of a budget shortage to tell one of his stories. His "Blind Dead" series got off to a great start but had some really ridiculous moments, like shooting a small model boat in a water tank for "The Ghost Galleon". In "The Sea Serpent," he hits rock bottom and takes with him some notable actors. He tells the story of a stupid sock monster that terrifies some water tanks and miniature aquariums. <br /> <br /> A vague opening sequence sets the stage, demonstrating a broken-off military mission in which American pilots, for some reason unknown, drop an atomic bomb (shamelessly drawn in the frame of the film) somewhere in the sea off the coast of Spain. The commander of the military gives this order from an office with a prominent American flag and a portrait of a Ronald Reagan, who has become confused, one of the few things that really makes this movie appear like the eighties. The other two are the incredibly hilarious subtitle that declares the year "1.985", and the dated Sheia Easton hairstyle by Tyria Power that looked really cool next to some torn neon sweats. <br /> <br /> One of the kookiest monsters you will ever see rises from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. We learn that the contested atomic bomb has killed a large part of the native fish. Unfortunately, for our occupation, this has no effect on the Sea Serpent, which quickly crashes down the coast of Spain to create a tiny chaos. When I say that the monster is unrealistic, I'm not exaggerating. It's not just "kind of" a fake look. I'm sure the filmmakers made the best of the ten dollars they seem to get, but most of the time it looks like they're made of Crayola markers, a ping-pong ball, and an old sock. Not only that, it has that ominous music that accompanies it everywhere, music that sounds so much like "Jaws", that it's a miracle nobody was sued. Together with Tyria Power and Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland were caught, and the dialogue could not have been darker. Through a range of agency skills our protagonists are thrown together to ... Well, I'm not sure what the purpose is. Bottoms and Power have to prove that the snake is real to save their butts (he is blamed for a shipwreck caused by the snake, they will be locked in the loose garbage bin after a sighting). None of that matters because nothing was resolved at the end of the movie. Nobody admits that the serpent is real and it is not even dead. Moreover, power and bottoms are still dependent on the law. <br /> <br /> As illogical as it seems, no one but our heroes knows there is a snake (despite numerous disappearances, a ruined lighthouse and a crushed railway bridge), and they embark on an extended non-adventure tour. Get down the track and chase the monster away ... do not kill it, because they know they can not keep up. Their big plan is to use flares to deter it. Although her scheme is messed up, the snake causes a major explosion in the water after attacking (not asking) a bridge mount, and the giant sea serpent is so scared that it swims away. The critical viewer would wonder why the snake was not afraid earlier in the movie when it caused some big explosions after falling into a dock. But that does not matter. It's floating away and our heroes are sure it's gone forever. The end. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine the horror the stars felt when they saw the finished movie they were working on. A turnstile script and a few subdued reaction shots would never have prepared her for the embarrassing time of sharing screen time with a sock puppet / stop-motion creature put together. At least the minor characters had fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed up by a huge snakehead. I'm not sure what was going on when they made this movie; The monster is cheap, but there are rather complicated miniature sets, so somebody has spent some time creating them, not to mention the stop motion animation. It seems to be direct, though maybe the humor of this movie was beyond my head. In the end, the movie is nothing but an easy target for a drunken commentary. See it at a party for best results.
