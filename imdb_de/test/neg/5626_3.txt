Let Freedom Ring was probably made with the best of intentions, but it sends out a strange mixed message in the final product. <br /> <br /> The people in a western city where the railroad passes are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrants working on the railroad and financed by robber baron Edward Arnold. There are some ranchers and farmers whose land is on the railway track, and these people are being treated by Arnold's staff for a short time. One man who does not want to give in is Lionel Barrymore, whose son comes home from Harvard, a lawyer, and is ready to tackle the rancher's cause on the bad guys. But no one knows except Charles Butterworth that he is the wasp (by the way, a very interesting name choice). <br /> <br /> What Arnold did is used according to the best practices of the political bosses of the East to bring the immigrants to the polls. Nelson's idea is simple: if the immigrants only knew the truth about the villain Arnold, they will vote with the original settlers and eliminate the alien urban political machine in their midst. He kidnaps newspaper editor Raymond Walburn and leads him and the press to a mountain cave where subversive newspapers are printed and distributed. The railroad workers are a mixed lot of immigrants, not the Irish working in Ireland. The Chinese working east have a history. It is a true United Nations working on Arnold's railway. The workers are lined up in a row by Foreman Victor McLaglen, and Nelson has the unfortunate task of making sense of him, as did John Wayne in The Quiet Man. Of all the films in which Jeanette and Nelson and they played Certainly went down in history as a duo, this was the worst thing they had done at MGM. Nelson is hanged along with Barrymore for crimes that are at best undefined, but certainly nothing for which it's worth being hanged. And Virginia Bruce, who plays Nelson's girlfriend, rescues the day with a rendition of My Country Tis of Thee that the immigrants join. Considering a revolt of his paid immigrant voters, Arnold packs quite rationally and leaves the city to build his railroad elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I'm not joking, that's the end here. What is the message to vote with the settlers and lose your jobs at Arnold? But somehow you come through here? <br /> <br /> I sometimes wonder if 20 years after the events of this film the case is and the city has settled in a sleepy backwater of the West, while some cities in which the railway was pulled through, now cities are that the good citizens of this city did not think about what Nelson Eddy did. If so, they probably run it on a track. <br /> <br /> Nelson of course has a good voice and can sing a variety of concerts and popular plays, including a ballad for the immigrants of Sigmund Romberg, where else but here. The song is a heartfelt tribute to an immigrant who did well in his adopted home. Too bad that there was no better place. <br /> <br /> The almost platinum blonde Virginia Bruce I'm sure will get dubbed here. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was just as happy that she did not accompany Nelson on this trip west.
