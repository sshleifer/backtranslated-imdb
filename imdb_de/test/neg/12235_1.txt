This movie is a terrible attempt to parody. His attempts to parody various sports films are half done and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Even things that should be funny - like the kicker from India who always wears traditional clothes over her uniform - are not really funny. The fact that the football team gets good marks, which makes the coach crazy, did not laugh either. <br /> <br /> The plan to have a traditional loser offers another chance by training a loser high school football team really had potential as a parody. It is a classic and banal sport theme. Unfortunately the script was too weak for EVERY actor to do it. And this cast is no exception. <br /> <br /> Women are used in bikinis and underwear free of charge, so it's not all bad. <br /> <br /> But Animal House or Talladega Nights. this is not.
