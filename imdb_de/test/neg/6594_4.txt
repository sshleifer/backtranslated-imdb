Where the hell did VH1 find the scriptwriter for this movie? From high school? This movie tries so hard to be sympathetic to Michael Jackson, but instead turns him into a horrible, cheesy cartoon. All the lines are filled with clich√©s, but surprisingly the drama was not bad. As usual, this is a bad movie with pretty good actors. The actor who plays Michael Jackson, I'm sorry for him! I think he did the best he could with the weak script. I did not care that Flex did not look like Michael Jackson. I thought he did the best he could, but later, when he had all the white make up, oh man, he looked happy! The other actors who played Debbie Rowe, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were pretty good. Except that the actress playing Liz Taylor looked too young and healthy to play Liz. The actress who plays Diana Ross did not look like her at all and I could only find out who this woman was later in the movie. <br /> <br /> This film is for everyone who it is a disadvantage on the side of Michael Jackson or against Michael Jackson. It does not change the opinion of another. In fact, the only opinion everyone has is watching this movie, oh god, this movie is really shit! And where the hell is Michael Jackson's wonderful music and songs? There are none in this movie. I love the soundtrack to this movie anyway and will probably buy it if I could. <br /> <br /> On the lighter side this is a very funny, camping movie! It is a great waste of time if you want to see some light that does not bother your brain too much. I'll probably look at it again because it's just so entertainingly bad!
