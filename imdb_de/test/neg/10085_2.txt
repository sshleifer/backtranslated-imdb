When you look at it for a few seasons, two things come to mind: on the one hand, you wonder what kind of girl you want to be a 'model', and twice you go to the nearest ice cream shop and have a low-fat sundae. <Br /> <br /> I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of ​​this reality show contest. No other "famous" model thought about it, and Tyra Banks is very admirable in doing so. But as the series continues, I've come to the conclusion that this is a lot of people who want to make a mountain out of a molehill. Women should not pay attention to this, young people should stay away from it, unless they make book reports on the topic. <br /> <br /> Many women are trying to win slot machines for "Americas Next Top Model". They live together, fight each other, cry together, scream together, go through meaningless modeling with senseless models and modes and are eliminated, and almost everyone claims, "They'll see me again." Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to those who actually won DID. <br /> <br /> This is the dream of some girls and good for them. When I look at it, I hope the other girls who see this and walk like Hades are going the other way - like college models joining the group. It even made me think more than sad people. The "full-figured models" were not more than average ladies who competed with what I believe was the thinnest model group they have ever chosen. That would of course make her look fatter. Bad, bad, Tyra and crew. <br /> <br /> But to be honest, Americas Next Top Model is not a "full figure" model, it's about presenting an imaginary picture of a beauty that can be mass marketed as The ultimate beauty is sold - and this show only looks for the next piece of fresh meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the crowd of judges, photographers and associations. That's why Tyra and her constant "That's me" are every camera angle you can get. But that's the only thing I like about this show. The ex-model gives others who have no chance the chance to enter the doors. But after that ... everything else is status quo for this industry, so there are no surprises or a weekly interest in the program.
