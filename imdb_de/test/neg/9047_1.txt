A snore smell. I have seen this piece of horrible, stinking, worthless garbage at Cameo Movie House (now the famous Crobar Night Club) on Washington Avenue in South Beach in 1980 or 81 terrible, gross, garbage. The theater was on its last legs and mostly drunks snored and slept there. You have not missed anything. The Worst Acting ever. These actors deserve the Oscar for the worst, and I mean the worst roles in the history of cinema. Joke was, the theater showed another Mi-Sti stinker from Mi Mi Lay ... Barf City. Enough said. If you are under 12 years old, you may get a few shivers. After 12 years you snore after the opening credits. It's just amazing that everyone spent a penny on this movie. And to think it is considered a "cult" classic. YUK !!!!
