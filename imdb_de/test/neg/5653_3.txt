Miranda Cosgrove is known for her debut in "School of Rock" with Jack Black and her role as Megan in the show "Drake and Josh". She's a fan favorite among the Nickelodeon viewers, so it's no surprise that Dan Schneider would create a show just for her. Unfortunately it is as bad as "The Amanda Show" in the end. <br /> <br /> "iCarly" is about three friends, Carly, Sam and Freddie, who have become idols to Junior High Community through a webcam show called "iCarly". Carly and Sam are the hosts and Freddie shoots and puts it on the internet. Carly also has an older brother named Spencer, who is played by the weird Jerry Trainor, known for his work in "Drake and Josh" as Crazy Steve. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you that. Do not believe in the 8.3 out of 10 that got this show because it is pathetic in almost every way. Dan Schneider probably studied about 5 minutes to study adolescent interests because I just see him saying, "iPod? IPhone? IHome? Aha! Teenagers love everything that starts with" I! " and a majority of the gigs that were used in "Drake and Josh", if not, then it's just really dry and enforced jokes that do not even expect a giggle of generosity, like 60 degrees? "No, we want you to set it up to 60 pickles!" Not only that, but if you look closely, almost all sets were used in the shows in "Drake and Josh" and "Ned's Declassified," which were just splashed with random stuff to make it look different. <br /> The scenes in which the program shows a broadcast of the iCarly network are just as horrible as the entire series itself. The dialogue in them is cruelly bad, which can be accepted by some as only two Playing with friends in front of a camera, but what's the deal with the weird, humorless antics that they like "Random Dancing!" To like? And from then on it only gets worse. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, Miranda and Jennette are far from the best. Nathan Kress, who played Freddie, is sometimes unbelievable, but he does a good job. The person who really steals the show is the humorous talent of Jerry Trainor, who fits in very well with his role as a "protective older brother" and can create some pretty funny segments through his wide-open, blatant spectacles. Too bad that they are not common because in my opinion the show would have given an extra star. <br /> <br /> Dan Schneider must have done this show just to give Miranda Cosgrove her own cable-born playground to jump around and spew listless jokes and pathetic cue-card lines in all directions, because all others have extraordinary talents among them badly written script and the weightless spectacle have buried. Dan Schneider did a great job with "Drake and Josh." It's a real disappointment that "iCarly" is such a failure. Jerry Trainor's drama saved this show from a rating of 1 in 10, but he alone can not prevent "iCarly" from being as awful as it is.
