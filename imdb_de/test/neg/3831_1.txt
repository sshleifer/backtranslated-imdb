I was at the premiere last night. The movie started with a bang (maybe because of the excitement before the premiere). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, then most of us spent the rest of our time fending off sleep. This movie can not be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any work by Guest, unless you want to say that _Sons of Provo _ is a wish-madness. It just fell flat, it died, it was painful. The story went nowhere, the jokes were boring, even if you were a Mormon and could get all the inside jokes, it felt like a waste of time. There were two redeeming qualities: Kirby's acting was just right! And the songs were very smart (for a LDS audience only). So, my recommendations ... Avoid the movie. And if you are Mormon, buy the music CD.
