This is by far one of the most boring movies I have ever seen! And if you do not believe me, look at this. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, the plot makes no sense at all. Fighting people makes no sense. I could not understand what they were talking about during the movie (in most cases I did not bother). It does not help to watch the movie, the only plus would be the cinematography. New Zealand looks fantastic. Everything else is just shit. <br /> <br /> The actors are trying their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately you will go to sleep instead. <br /> <br /> Do us all a favor, even if this is the case, go on "On Demand", WATCH IT DO NOT UP!
