SPOILER!!!! Mind Ripper hmmmm ... I had just seen the nightmare in Ulmenstrassenfilmen and just heard from Giovanni Ribisi. I thought Giovanni Ribisi was not scared, so I checked. I saw "the Outpost" (Mind Ripper). I checked my Tivo for it. There was a broadcast on Sci Fi. So I was hired. I finished my popcorn and put it on the couch and what the hell is that? A freakin bold guy in blue tracksuit pants runs screaming around! Nothing is scary in this movie! If something is funny! Funny how low the budget is, funny how predictable it is, funny how bad the drama is and weird how much money it did NOT deserve. Ok, Giovanni Ribisi is a good actor, but this movie is stupid. It is so stupid. They killed him in the end and then they get on this plane and the "monster" is on it. They shoot him with a shotgun in the head and she falls far to the ground. And <br /> <br /> -GASP- The killer ends, it's still alive! WOOHHH! Creepy! woooohhhh! Sucky fat sack full of crap of 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: You have a place to go and you have to kill some time. Mind Ripper is not the suggestion. I would rather sit naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time. <br /> <br /> TOTAL VALUE: F- - - - - - - - - - (ENTERNAL)
