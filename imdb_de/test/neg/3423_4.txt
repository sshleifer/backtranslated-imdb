Macbeth is one of the most talked-about stories in the cinema and has often been translated into numerous theatrical and celluloid environments. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, Macbeth tells the story of treachery among kings and a man's quest for power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) attempts to update Macbeth by placing it in the contemporary underworld of Melbourne. In a movie in which the characters replace swords for weapons (alias Baz Luhrmans Romeo and Juliet) and royal vassals for gangsters, Macbeth is a beefy, violent, but critically flawed film King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After being raised by the king to the Thane of Glamis (as prophesied by three witches of Macbeth), Macbeth begins to contemplate the throne. One night the king comes to Macbeth's house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) persuades him to kill the king to take power. Macbeth kills his master and then takes his crown. But success is a drawback, as Macbeth soon finds out, when he has to make ugly efforts to protect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> OK, the first things first. The biggest mistake of the movie is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of Macbeth is in one word ... boring. I honestly did not care about Macbeth while watching the movie. I was more sympathetic to Lady Macbeth of Victoria Hill because she at least took the trouble to act. Worthington sits the whole movie with grumpy and wooden faces. I felt he made his best impression of Johnny Deeps George Jung's character from Blow ... but without the charisma. I've never seen Worthington in a movie before, so I'm not sure if it's up to him or the director, but in both cases, the glue that should have put everything together in a coherent unit is weak. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good, but if it goes with Geoffrey Wright's Australian gangster motive, it seems a bit out of place. Frenzisch tuned action sequences, mixed with long Shaksperian considerations, generate a step fight in the film. I understand that this is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialogue intact. But tough, fast action scenes after a three-minute interview become annoying, if not a bit presumptuous. <br /> <br /> The camera work is very stylized and works mostly well. What bothered me was how the camera almost constantly bumped back and forth. I do not mind that recordings are simply overkill. It goes beyond the field to be cool and stylish and instead gets irritating. Apart from that, art and cinematography are pretty well done. <br /> <br /> For all the good features Macbeth has; stylish directing, Shakespeare dialogue, a strong soundtrack, supernatural naked witches (the crazy sisters) and good support of brutal, bloody violence. All of these strengths are forgotten, considering Sam Worthington's uninspired representation of Macbeth. The role of Macbeth was essential to connecting everything together. In this regard, Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed miserably, making Macbeth an unforgettable foray into Shakespeare.
