The only redeeming factor of this film was the fact that he was on television for free and probably helped the Romanian economy. Besides, Hallmark must reassess this division of her empire and possibly focus her films more on bizarre love relationships between cancerous hemophiliacs in Mississippi. If you delve into the question of how pointless this movie is, you would be honored to be remembered. It was not. I remember the act as I watched it, there were vampires (some of them were teenagers) and some very bad dubbing. Anyone involved in the dubbing of this film has to be transferred to another sector of society ... perhaps a meal service for the deaf. If you have the chance, watch this movie just because it makes so many other really bad movies look Oscar-worthy in hindsight. If you've actually landed on this movie, I can imagine it might be too late ...
