The movie starts with the son, who is interested in a teenager of his age. Clayburgh's shy husband is killed in a car accident as she prepares to go to Rome and sing as a diva. Matthew turns against it. He rejoins the girl, but this time Matt cocaine. His great voice, lovely, impetuous mother, is in the limelight. She does not know how to handle Matt's addiction. The film moves on in search of an action. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had his head in the moon as he directed the picture. The moon has a great symbolism. Save time. I'm maybe too generous with 4 *.
