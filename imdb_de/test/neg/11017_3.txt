I really wanted to have this movie, but after a few funny openings I barely smiled. I agree that there was no chemistry at all between the two leads and the other characters were cliched. The script has completely squandered the talent of Bud Tingwell and Kim Gyngell. <br /> <br /> It has to be said that there was a lot of laughter around me and even a little applause at the end. Maybe I just could not deal with it enough. I'm just glad that I bought cheap tickets.
