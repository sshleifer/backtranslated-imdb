This movie was Flippin Awful ... I wanted those hours of my life back. For God's sake, at any cost, far from this horrible crumb-ball movie. It's not worth mentioning the title, but the reviews in this movie are quite generous for such a movie of vomited scum. And where do I start? The stupid A ** kids in the movie ..... The Zero Action or Story? Or the VERY ill-played teenage fear allusion? $ # @% @! My God, it NEVER ended! ..... I remember, I would have thought, I would rather have kissed the floor of the cinema, then I would prevail again. <br /> <br /> But what do you expect? Most people who have the brainpower to look up ratings will not be the target audience at all here - that's GO SEE Pirites 2 or the Jet Lee-One, when you're debating with yourself. Look, this movie will only cost you your soul, your money, your energy and your brain cells. OBSERVE THE WARNING.
