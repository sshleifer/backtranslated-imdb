Well, <br /> <br /> First of all, as many reviewers have pointed out - this is a rip off of Martin Cahill's story, first represented by the BBC and the John Boorman movie "The General" A great movie who is far superior. <br /> <br /> As a native Brit, the side cast of Kevin Spacey was really good in terms of British and Irish acting talent, especially Peter Mullan it was totally wasted. The characters were c ** p! As for Kevin Spacey, I did not think of him as an amiable villain, but as nothing really substantial or significant. <br /> <br /> Not much to save this movie. The best pieces are the gags and tricks that were torn from the other films. Compare the notes to this movie and "The General" - I'd like to know what others think. <br /> <br />
