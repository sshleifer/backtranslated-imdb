After big budget catastrophe movies like The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact in America, it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale like Flood. <br /> <br /> With mostly unknown actors and actresses focusing on England It was a welcome change when the Empire State Building was demolished. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not a strong movie. While it is quite shocking to see all your favorite London landmarks torn down by a very fake CGI storm surge, Flood does not really bring anything else. <br /> <br /> The performances are bland and are rescued from the hell of hell by David Suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as Deputy Prime Minister. He may be a bit too quiet for what's going on in the movie. All the fake water gushing in London pretty annoyed him. <br /> <br /> It's understandable that the effects would not happen As good as TDAT and DI, but the CGI was at best average. <br /> <br /> Fad, disappointing and sometimes even tiring. Watch it if you have to, but then see something else directly afterwards.
