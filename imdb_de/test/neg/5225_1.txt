I rated this movie 1 because it's by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This movie was made in 2003 and I've seen movies made in the 60s with better special effects. I wish I could go into detail, but words can not describe how shitty this movie was. I could have done better with a home video camera and $ 20! I pray that Chuck Norris will never make a movie again. If you think I'm going to do this movie because it has a Christian theme then you're wrong. I like the fact that IL 'Chuck decided to shoot a movie that at least tried to make God look good. This whole movie can be summarized in 3 words: RE DAMN DICULOUS.
