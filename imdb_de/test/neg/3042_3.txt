While babysitting in an isolated Colorado house, a teenage girl is terrorized by an elusive killer on the phone. <br/> <br /> The remake of the semi-classic horror movie of 1979 basically takes the first 20 minutes of the original movie and it expands to fit a time frame of 87 minutes! So it is needless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin. There is little originality or interest in this film. There's a lot of Camilla Belle wondering in a dark house, wondering who's calling her and finding any kind of false anxiety. After the first 30 minutes everything becomes repetitive and routine, and he never succeeds in building up in the form of tension or chills. Certainly it never reaches the intensity of the original film, especially as the film removes an important plot point from the original. I think we owe it to the PG-13 rating. <br /> <br /> On the positive side there is an impressive set design and a bit dark atmosphere. Unfortunately, not much is going on to save this remake from being subpar. Belle's performance is also pretty mediocre. <br /> <br /> It's just another nondescript remake. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
