The first time I saw that, HORROR had shied away at what was portrayed as a modern, liberated woman. I'm sorry, but I can not relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around unloving sex and the acquisition of Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton labels. The worrying thing is that some people think that career women live that way in NYC. It is definitely not. These women are incredibly flat and materialistic, and as another reviewer said, they look like gold diggers. <br /> <br /> This is not a liberated woman and I am glad that she is gone. 0 stars and just AWFUL
