I saw this movie shortly after seeing Moonlight & Valentino starring Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrow, Whoopi Goldberg, and Kathleen Turner. There are many similarities between the two films. Both have great occupations and good acting. They both have tribal figures of sisters who are very different, an offending stepmother, a friend / confidante, an emotionally unavailable father, a dead mother and a surprise lover. In both films, the characters experience life-changing insights, and both films suffer from a kind of "love conquers all" sentimentality. They both add a bit of nude to Cameron Diaz in black underwear and a partial back view of Gwyneth Paltrow. Both films seem to be outwitted, as if the authors of the works on which the films are based did market research and said, "Okay, there's a market for stories about relationships between women, so I'm having two sisters with an offensive stepmother write?" In other words, instead of the drama that comes from the truth of the relationship, the relationship is invented to suit the dramatic situation. It seems to be forced, the characters do not seem to be real, the relationships are incredible. <br /> <br /> The dissolution of the tensions between the characters is simple with simple excuses that made the yearlong pursuits disappear forever afterwards. It's just not real. Romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> The characters in In Her Shoes are a bit more than Moonlight & Valentino, especially the stepmother part. Sydelle Feller is so angry that it's hard to believe the father would stay with her or even marry her. <br /> <br /> If you like Moonlight & Valentino, you will probably like In Her Shoes as well. Impressive performances in both areas, indeed, the actors bring depth to their parts that go far beyond the invented sentimentality of the scripts.
