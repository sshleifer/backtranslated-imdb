When I saw the trailer for The Comebacks for the first time, it looked absolutely terrible and I had no interest in seeing it, but when it came out on DVD today, I thought, since nothing else caught my interest, I would rent it and give it a shot I saw it today and it really was not that bad. I think it was sometimes immature and stupid, but there were a few funny moments that made me laugh. I do not really watch a lot of sports movies, so I wonder if I might have seen more, maybe this film would make more sense to me, but it's all good. Still, I did not mind seeing The Comebacks. I admit that these "stupid parody" films are lame, but what does a stupid joke do to it? The comeback is not really bad if you give it a fair chance. Coach Fields fails both in life and in the family and in the career, but when given a chance to bring his career back to life when he can bring a looser football team into the championship. But the team is really terrible, how terrible. But with a bit of work and teamwork they try to give everything, even if it gets a bit sadder. <br /> <br /> The comebacks about everything are not the worst movie I've ever seen, I think it's good for a few laughs and giggles. I know that was stupid, but I could not help but laugh when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and he hits the nerd's head against the locker. Only he and the nerd were generally so funny together. If you're open-minded and do not take this movie too seriously, I think you'll have a fun time watching it and expect it to be Oscar-worthy material. This is not the movie for you. <Br /> <br /> 4/10
