Imagine the most clich√©-made horror conspiracy. Add more plot holes than plot. Have it written by a 10-year-old. Let the acting A-level drama students fake really bad American accents (on the Isle of Man!). Add monster special effects that fans of B & W Dr Who appreciate. Result: Duffing film. Please drop Samantha Janus, who takes off her clothes (make a dot on the cover) and you probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!
