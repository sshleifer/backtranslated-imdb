The film shows the relationship of the dying mother and the son who is very attached to her and definitely loves her. What does it show? It shows her life in very bad conditions. It shows how tenderly they "go" (really he brings them). But what are we going to see? After his promenade he walks alone in the same places where they went together. It is not possible. A person who loves and cares for another dying person would do anything to improve that person's life. He would not have a free minute to think about being alone, and if he finds it for a few minutes a month, he would run away from the places he normally needs to be. Something else. The author dedicated the movie Andrey Tarkovsky. We see that he has learned many visual effects from Tarkovsky. But in Sokurov's film they are just effects, they do not support the senses or the mood. Someone has compared this movie with "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). Except for these visual effects, nothing is common. "Mirror" is a great movie and this movie is just a bad imitation.
