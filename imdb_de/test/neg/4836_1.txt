and it's only January, but I'm sure! <br /> <br /> By far, this is one of the worst Swedish films I've ever seen, and to be honest, Swedish films are generally not that good. It has been said to be "original," and perhaps it can be considered as that for people who have never seen an English-language film. For us who have been in the cinema for the past 10 years, Måns Mårlind can not help feeling that Björn Stein was sitting together over the weekend with some of the most successful films of recent years and trying to put everything together in a Swedish package. What can I say, the result can only be ... bad. At first, the story is only faint, worse, if it's not just a bad story, but a desire to combine very bad stories - first a failed attempt to make Swedish action à la Matrix, and then one really bad moral story. And if you thought that it could not be worse, you'll notice all the "cool stuff" that was just thrown in for no reason, rather than trying in a bad way to show that Sweden can shoot Hollywood movies as well can not and should not try. For example, an attempt is made to deepen the main plot by letting teenagers play a computer game called Storm, which has absolutely nothing to do with the story, or, for example, that there is an Internet site about "Storm", while suddenly, all are the main characters Awareness - really, I do not think that even Stein or Mårlind with three quarters of the movie can see a point, more than just trying to show bad effects. For the actors, I have to admit that Eric Ericson does a pretty good job, unless he does the whole movie on the same job. Even the hard Storm tries to be a film about the personal development of DD, which does not change in his film approach. Jonas Karlsson, to be honest, I thought he was a pretty respected actor, but judging by Storm ... he really just needs to be ashamed of this movie, his character and his scar. After all, Eva Röse is uncritical, both in her character and in her acting. The only reason why Storm manages to get a 1/10 is for Eric Ericson and, what can I say, at least it tries.
