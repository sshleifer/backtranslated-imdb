This TV show is a stupid waste of time if you want to see how animals watch the Discovery Channel. If you want to watch Nincompoops on TV, just watch MTV. MTV stands for music television. <br /> <br /> Do not fool-d-listeners preparing sketches left or weeping daring kids. I bet if you like this show, I bet you love Viva la Bam and Jackass huh? I think my IQ dropped ten points when I saw this show. <br /> <br /> This is a combination of two shows of Jackass and the animal planet <br /> <br /> Some people think that this is a good combination. <br /> <br /> I on the other hand I think it is retarding. <br /> <br /> And if you find it's a lot like donkey <br /> <br /> and viva la bam <br /> <br />, just a note, this show is awful
