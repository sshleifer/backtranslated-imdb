I really thought that was a good movie, boy ... I was wrong! For a quick summer: B-Grade Acting-C special effects D-grade for the entire movie. Do not get me wrong, the story was pretty good and no joke so adults are also riding, the "hero" looks good, so most women will like it :-) fight scenes and some blood <br /> <br /> but the way it's filmed ... awful <br /> <br /> the special effects-> would be better for TV-> on a kids show <br /> <br /> and last but not least .. Sent some of the actors back to acting school if they ever attended a class there <br /> <br /> Trust me, there are far better ways to waste 2 hours. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
