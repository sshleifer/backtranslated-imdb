The original WASC is by no means a must in the genre. Without the first 25 minutes, that would be no logical reason to look at it. The remake lasts those 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85-minute horror strip. <br /> <br /> Well, I have nothing against PG-13 horror movies, but the trend that surrounds them is getting lame. If you see the PG-13 rating, expect a movie full of false anxiety, teen t.v. or music stars, and an action that has been used several times. Do not even ask for blood or violence. <br /> <br /> I know that it is not right to compare both the original WASC and the remake, but I think it is necessary to do so since the whole idea of ​​the new one at the beginning of the Originals lies. The tension felt by the first movie is by no means present in the remake. Not even with the amazing settings or the great use of lightning. No tension, tension, thrill ... nothing. The movie becomes too slow before it becomes "interesting" and then the stranger appears. The chase sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least it feels like, "What will happen next?". But that's it. The situations that come to a head are predictable, boring and lacking excitement. The original has merit in creating excitement in key scenes, as well as a deterrent highlight to the film's most important scene. <br /> <br /> Well, I understand that this is a horror movie by PG-13, but if you pay tribute to the original. Why change, it is the most important situation? The children should not survive! After the end, I felt that this movie was pointless. So the babysitter played cat and mouse with a wacko ... that's it? Then the sequence in the hospital was just stupid. And the worst part is that a sequel might be on the way. <br /> <br /> Camila Belle is the best of the movie. It delivers a cute, believable performance. She has to choose better projects, though this role will benefit her thousands of teenage fans. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie. Some people say, to support the horror genre, we should support any movie that comes out. I do not necessarily agree. If we ignore movies like WASC, the producers of horror movies will understand that we will not accept CRAP. We want good horror movies, no lame flicks full of false anxiety. <br /> <br /> Instead, look at the original "When A Stranger Calls" because the first 25 minutes are better than the whole (pointless) remake.
