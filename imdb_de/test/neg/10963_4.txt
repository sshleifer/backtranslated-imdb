After all, The Quick and the Undead is the first movie to nullify its own plot. Essentially, this is a gigantic action hole. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the acting was pretty bad, the motivations of the characters were absent or unbelievable and there was not a single character worth hanging up our hat. The most interesting actor (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) was stolen halfway through the process. <br /> <br /> What the fast and the undead do is a great example of how to do good color timing. It looked excellent considering the budget. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems like a man has gotten hold of a hundred giants and a few Westerns (especially The Good, The Bad and The.) watch Ugly) and then just threw some elements into a movie ... "You know, they have movies where the characters do that! Does it fit here? No, but who cares? They do it in other movies, so I should do it here!" <br /> <br /> Maybe a good prospect for aspiring cinematographers and colourists (film students in the first year). Otherwise a must.
