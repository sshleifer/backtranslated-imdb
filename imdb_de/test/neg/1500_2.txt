This is an interesting way to handle a camera, <br /> <br /> accompanying a DTV movie - the version I saw was full screen <br /> <br /> - the Scenario Department but it is missing. First you have a conversation for about 20 minutes, talking and talking in a "limping", post-"trainspotting" way, then it's Slasher City. And then <br /> <br /> comes the most dishonest trick I've ever seen, much worse than <br /> <br /> "April Fool's Day" - where at least it made sense. Everything in <br /> <br /> is all the old song and the dance: The interesting director tries <br /> <br /> hard, but deserves a better movie. Funny: Usually it's the actors who desperately need something better. Skip it for your time anyway
