This film would have been fine, probably even excellent, if the directors had separated the interviews and the concert material. "Into the Void" is a great song and I hate to be cut off for a mumbling interview with Ozzy Osbourne. That should have been at the end of the movie or in a special feature. The best thing about a concert DVD is to hang it up and play the music, but "Black Sabbath: The Last Supper" is hard to beat and easy to play because the music is constantly interrupted. Still, there are some strengths in this movie. The concert material, if it plays, it is excellent. Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long break without Osbourne, and this movie does it well: The Sabbath rocks the fans. Of course the fans have a sweet edge in the movie because of course they see the band live, but they also do not have to settle for the incessant interviews that burden DVD viewers. Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) because they did that for the movie! Pity for Wyatt Smith, too, that he edited the film that way.
