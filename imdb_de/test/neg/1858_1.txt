Jerry Angell, owner of Zombie Horror's finest mullet, returns to other undead in the sequel to Todd Sheets' gruesome, homemade Gore festival Zombie Bloodbath. This time around, Jerry plays a sloppy, sloppy thug confronting carnivores next to his equally despicable criminal, some escaped prisoners, several teenagers, and a bunch of screaming girls with a horde of confusion. <br /> <br /> Since Sheets has obviously learned to teach Zilch how to improve his craft in the two years since Zombie Bloodbath, Sheets provides another mess of a movie that somehow manages to be even worse than the original. An achievement that I thought was almost impossible. The acting is uniformly bad, the effects amateurish and cheap (most of it seems to be just a selection of waste, slaughter and blood from the local butcher shop), the story is incomprehensible (as far as I could fathom the zombies), resurrected from the dead, because a scarecrow orders them !!!), and the direction is frustrating with cheap video effects and pointless cuts in black and white. <br /> <br /> And as if that were not 'To convince you of the film's utter lack of redeeming qualities, this simply stunning, feeble-minded ending should do the trick: the few remaining survivors stumble across an abandoned truck, conveniently carrying a supply of carnivorous bacteria on the front passenger seat - just right to dissolve the undead (but strangely enough, not harmful to the living at all).
