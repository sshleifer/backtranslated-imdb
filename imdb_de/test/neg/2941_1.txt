I saw this movie in blockbuster and thought it might be a good Sunday evening movie when there is nothing else to do. So I bought it, 3 DVDs for $ 25. Although it was cheap, I would have needed to spend my money on a nail to get through my foot. <br /> <br /> The movie started well. A bit dark and mysterious. I loved vampire and samurai movies when I was a kid. I thought the combo was really cool. The first fight scene was pretty cool. I was curious about the rest of the movie. Then the movie made a serious dive. <br /> <br /> I understand that this was a great success in the East. I think because of the twins. I do not see it. Apart from the first 10 minutes, this movie was absolutely awful. So many movies in this genre have the potential to be great and make it dreadful. This is just another loss. <br /> <br /> Jacki Chan's role in this movie makes no sense at all. Warumyyyyyyy? Complete stupidity. He probably earned a few dollars. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing in this movie is the swords they use. Nice idea. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
