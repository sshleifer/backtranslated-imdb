Do not get me wrong now, I love bad movies ... no, I love bad movies, Troll 2 ... Ouch painfully, Manos The Hands of Fate ... just look like Torgo is going, guru the crazy monk ... is the traffic noise in the medieval background? OK, that's clear, but this is one of those movies that obviously wanted something better, but did not make it. Why not? Well, it would be easy to blame the plot, but he saw worse, there were not too many holes, and I know that there is not much originality, but that does not need to kill a movie. The effects are not bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is fine, the truck is quite threatening. Where did it go wrong? Well, I'd love to blame Harley for the "Chris Moyles" view ... so I'll! Comedy and horror are hard to mix, bad comedy and horror get worse and there is the problem. I loathed this guy from the moment he (literally) craned his head up, the constant caressing of the cocky Adam gets annoying door ... and I thought it was the monster pieces that the director should have trouble getting to convince us. Why are bad movies fun? Well, you have a lot of fun poking holes in them, laughing at the script, all howlers, etc. This movie is not included in the coveted "Worst Movies" category because it's just bad because it's annoying , Do not bother, look at something else, and you will become a better person ... I promise! (To fade songs of Torgo Torgo Torgo)
