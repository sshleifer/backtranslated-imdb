I am and have been a serious collector of movies, TV shows, holiday specials, etc. relating to Christmas for over twenty-five years. Please note my warning and do not be fooled by sterile reviews and media hype about this movie. This is not a Muppett movie as we've met, and certainly NOT for kids. The fact that this product was produced for a large TV network is no wonder given the current state of operation. I can not believe the Jim Henson organization is so bent down to be involved in this Christmas travesty of garbage
