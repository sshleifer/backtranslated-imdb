60s children's show with former Vaudevilliers playing practical men for rent. As you might expect, they are a disaster in everything they do. In the course of the 11-minute episodes (4 minutes for advertising in the 15-minute window) they do things such as: For example, building a fence between warring neighbors, helping a magician on stage and dealing with a found suitcase and wallet / Growing up, I've never run this show (shooting in New York) seems). I thought I heard or saw most of the children's shows of that time, either because I saw them as a kid or at nostalgia gatherings. Until Alpha Video released it on DVD, I was not fully aware if it existed at all. The show runs like the Three Stooges, mixed with Abbott and Costello, as done by the people doing the routines. (In fact, one of them claims to have "slow-twisted" the legendary routine perfected by Abbott and Costello). It's not bad, but it's not good, because everything seems diluted. The timing is often off (though that might be in a bad direction) and the jokes were recycled years before the first show. Probabilities have you seen everything before. On the positive side, it's the sort of thing that would be perfect for introducing very young kids to the magic of vaudeville comedy, but it will try to get their parents through the short episodes as well. <br /> <br /> Only for nostalgic junkies. Everyone else should see an original by Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges.
