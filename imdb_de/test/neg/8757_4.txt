Well, I did not know what to expect from 555. Actually, I had never heard of it until a few months ago. As a collector of pretty much all kinds of horror, I thought I would grab this obscure 80s slasher. <br /> <br /> Basically, the plot has to do with a murderer who dies every 5 years in a row for 5 nights. What the third 5 in the title means ... nobody knows. Anyway, the killings begin when the killer looks for young teenagers fooling around in dark places. He beheads the men and brutally cuts the woman to death. He then rapes the dead body. Police believe she has a head start in the killings, but she has no idea what's going on. How will you find the murderer? Is nobody interested? <br /> <br /> This movie is full of some of the worst actors I have ever seen. No wonder none of these actors literally did anything else. The three main characters consist of two detectives and a "sexy" female reporter. I'm sarcastic when I say sexy, she's as un-sexy as she gets. The two detectives look like Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. One of them underestimates his part and the other could have gone to the Shatner School of Acting. Acting is so bad that you are almost forced to lose your interest in the movie and you almost fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The only thing holding this horrible movie together are some decent gore scenes. For a movie about this budget, the creators must have put all the money into the special effects that are still not great. <br /> <br /> Unless you are like me and need to own every horror movie I would suggest staying away from this movie. 4.10
