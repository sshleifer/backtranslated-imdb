I got this movie in a bargain and hoped for an amusing bad movie. Boy, I was disappointed. (except avon.) See, the movie is awful, but so horrible that it's not even ridiculous. The action, oh wait, there is no action. I think you could say that this is the main character in the ranks of street fighting. At the end of the film, the directors either decided they did not make sense anymore, or rather died and finished a monkey who directed the film. DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THE END! although the end does not really spoil anything. The main character somehow ends up in a room full of mirrors, like La Enter The Dragon, and then gets really angry, has a stupid flashback and hits a mirror. The end. Wheeee. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor of this movie was the scene from Avon. He talks to the rival street combat boss and says something like that: "Do not worry anymore, sir, I cleverly killed him, I cooked him, I ate, we went to a disco, we had And then I killed him. "At this point, the boss says" good job Avon. And Avon says "Number 1! Alllriiiiight! Alriiight!" The scene continues and Avon continues to say "Alllriiiight!" over and over. The next scene shows a dead Avon swimming in a pool. Intelligent? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Finally, I own the "Homeboy" version of this movie, which means that the title on the box I own is "Homeboy". It shows a huge man holding a giant weapon in his hand and screaming. That never happens in the movie. This man is never in the movie. High quality. <br /> <br /> Note - I'm new to this review, but hell, yes, I'll keep it up.
