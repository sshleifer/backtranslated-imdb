There are certain horror directors for whom I have built so much respect and admiration over the years that they can not disappoint me if they know what garbage they choose to make a movie. Lucio Fulci is certainly one of them, but damn, he's trying to disappoint me with his later efforts! You can easily afford to skip most of the movies Fulci shot or produced in the late '80s and instead just watch "Cat in the Brain" because this one track collects and repeats the best and hottest shots of no less than seven other Fulci flashes, including the sickest murder episodes in "When Alice Broken the Mirror." Overall, this movie is definitely one of the weakest and most pointless successes of our director. The script is completely incomprehensible, the basic requirement is absolutely implausible and somewhat stupid, and there is absolutely no reason to be happy. I love the title, but actually it is pretty meaningless. There's a character called Alice in the story, but it's just a supporting role and it certainly does not break any mirrors. I think she could just break that stuff with her voice because she's an opera singer, but she does not. The storyline revolves around a playful middle-aged playboy who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money. Lester Parson cruelly slaughters the ladies (as well as unwelcome witnesses), making steaks out of their juiciest body parts and feeding the remains of his cat. There is also a stupid psychological subplot in which he believes his own shadow is responsible for the murders in his place. The difference between "When Alice Broken the Mirror" and some of Fulci's biggest horror movies ("The Beyond," "City of the Living Dead," ") lies in the fact that he does not bother, a terrible thing The characters, including Lester, are colorless and boring, and the murders are usually portrayed as being the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in the microwave or a car over and over a human body The lighting is bad, the cinematography is super ugly, the clipping awkward and amateurish, and the acting performances are downright miserable, so if I did not know better, I would think Lucio deliberately made a lousy film to defy everything hard Critics who dislike his repertoire, no matter how much spirit and effort he puts into the game, the obvious element is simply the problem Bloody blood and blood because even trying to mix black comedy does not work right swinging around his chainsaw and cutting off women's feet, "When Alice Broke the Mirror" is a modest piece of horror entertainment, but otherwise there's not much to it recommend.
