The female cast of this movie is great: you have Linda Blair (well-seasoned), Julie Strain (who does not have too many spoken lines - that's a good thing), Rochelle Swanson (as convincing as a sweet innocent girl or (evil-possessed girl ), Toni Naples and the most beautiful of them all IMO, the dazzling Kristina Ducati (as the stupid male lead actor Larry Poindexter deserves to get in touch with one of these women remains a mystery.) Apart from being able to enjoy those beautiful ones but the film has little to offer, and the plot is incoherent and only really gets set in motion in the last 15 minutes, and when Wynorski finally creates some tension, there comes a ridiculous "twist" ending, ruined everything.
