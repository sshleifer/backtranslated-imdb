In 1984, The Karate Kid had a certain charm, even if it was just a poor man's Rocky. Unfortunately, producer Jerry Weintraub failed to realize that it was best to leave the story at the point where it was finished, and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make additional efforts to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the final low in the series, but someone must have thought that the series still has potential. What other explanation could exist for the existence of The Next Karate Kid? <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. Next? Yes, Macchio has left (at least he was smart enough to stop at some point), and his successor is Hilary Swank (!), Who plays a troubled teenager (what else?) Named Julie Pierce. Now the girl has family problems. She also gets problems at school. The said school has a sadistic physical education teacher (Michael Ironside). As it turns out, one of his students is actually a nice guy, and Julie falls in love with him. This, of course, puts them in greater trouble than before. Fortunately, she is currently living with Mr. Miyagi (Morita), an old friend of her grandfather, who happens to know how to return to the bad guys. All of these factors are up to seven clich√©s, and that's just a general plot summary - imagine what the detail scenes must look like! The Next Karate Kid is a tired, shallow and boring marathon of idiotic lines and setups from start to finish. Fortunately, Swank has Boys Do not Cry and Million Dollar Baby boys to overcome this disaster, but why did Morita want to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first film and was quite pleasing in the sequels, but has nothing to say here - even the revival of wax on wax is dead. As for Ironside, he is slightly better in Part III than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith, but that's hardly a stretch. <br /> <br /> Is this picture really that horrible? Not exactly. There is a sequence that achieves a weird beauty, but if the best part of the entire movie is that a group of Asian monks are dancing while listening to pop music for the first time in their lives, this is not a recommendation to see the rest
