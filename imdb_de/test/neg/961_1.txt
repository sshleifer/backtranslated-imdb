Great story and great actors (Quaid and Ryan), but the film suffers from bad direction, bad script and bad script. The main actors do their part, but could not save the film style Hitchcock Suspense / Mystery / Thriller.Ryan looked in this case, however, so young and fresh. A good look for big Ryan fans .....
