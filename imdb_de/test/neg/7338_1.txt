What a horrible movie. I can not believe that I really sat down. A very, very, very, very, very pathetic effort, without any redeeming functions. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The so-called "race sequences" are ridiculously horrible and the plot was so bad that I forgot them. Part of the film was made on the Spa Francorchamps course in Belgium, I think, in 1988 during the actual Grand Prix. I was there and am glad that I was not in any of the coupling scenes of the film. It could have been good ... what a pity.
