I had hoped that this would be of the caliber of Das Boot, and reflects the rigorous realism that the acclaimed German director Leni Riefenstahl made in her documentary films. Unfortunately, I was enormously disappointed. The plot is implausible and defies credulity. An RAF pilot is shot down and somehow gets to a hospital in Dresden. Anna, a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is getting engaged to a doctor she works with, falls in love with the plane and they love each other. The next night, the aviator shows up dressed as a German officer on a lavish engagement party and dances with Anna. Although well managed and acted, it is a lower order soap opera for me.
