I love those awful 80s summer camp movies. The best part about "Party Camp" is the fact that literally there is no action. It just drops a faint stack of "characters" in one place and then occasionally things happen. The stereotypes here are limitless (SPOILERS): the nerds vs. the jocks, the secret camera in the locker room for girls, the wanderers who run into a nudist colony, the final contest, the secretly horny camp wardens, and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo scattered all over. The only missing clich√© is the presence of Corey Feldman. This movie will make you laugh, but never on purpose. I repeat, NEVER. One last note, be prepared to take the courage and observe the nonsense that is the "dramatic" scene in which Jerry Riviera and D.A. Share a beer late at night and pour each other out. The dialogue literally makes no sense and acting belongs on the stage of high school. It is a classic.
