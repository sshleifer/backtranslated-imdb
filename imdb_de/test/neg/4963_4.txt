Imagine this movie as a fan service, a wet dream for the Slasher genre lover. We start with a bloody prologue that has pretty little to do with the rest of the movie. Nine months forward and the real meat of the storyline begins: The virgin Mandy Lane is sought after by every jock and nerd in her school and is invited by three guys who want to spend a weekend on a ranch Bimbos obsessed with their weight and size. So ... you have a lot of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night, who do not want to do anything but have sex, take drugs and drink alcohol. The only other company is a big ranch man who may or may not be suffering from the Gulf War syndrome. Hmm ... potential future suspect maybe? <br /> <br /> So, if you are already aware, all the houseguests will be slaughtered in different bloody ways and the black man will NOT be the first to die for a change. However, there are some conventions that can be followed, such as the lightly clad baby being tracked by a car in a field. Or the lights mysteriously turn off in the evenings when our "heroes" unwisely split up to tackle the problem. Apart from the so-called shocking phrase at the end of the film looks like an old horror of the 80s for the nineties, and in this respect he succeeds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also inherits a lot of problems of the films of that time, namely the paper-thin characters and the predictability of the entire company. People are being cut, shot, beaten, etc., but due to their innate hatred of the public and the stupidity of finding themselves in these situations, it is difficult to worry as their bodies become jammed. Someone is murdered, one of his friends is looking for them alone, BANG are brown bread. Rinse, then repeat. Maybe one day we'll get a script with plausible, intelligent, sympathetic characters that make sensible decisions and yet are outwitted by a genius killer. Until then we must tolerate adolescents, where the I.Q of pond-life is deducted from a broken hoodie. Well .. 4/10
