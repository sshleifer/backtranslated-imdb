Can liberals like Alec Baldwin not get it through their heads by losing the 2000 and 2004 elections? That ridiculous. Lame strikes on WalMart, non-unionized workers, George W. Bush, and the stock market, not to mention the deliberate GWB accent used by Balwin's character in the film, makes him look stupid and bitter on screen. During the credits, the sour grapes will be bred, and Ken Lay and other CEOs of Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and IMClone will be "Special Thanks". Let me point out something - if you put all your money into a company's stock, you're an idiot. We do not need this excuse for a movie to tell us. What a waste of Jim Carrey's talent - I was expecting a completely different movie from the trailer - what I got was a 90-minute DNC commercial aimed to get people not to invest for their own future, she said stupid and to make them dependent on the government. No wonder Hollywood is in trouble and can not make a decent movie anymore - maybe you could come up with an original idea and put it on the screen ... although I should not be surprised, as Jane Fonda was originally cast.
