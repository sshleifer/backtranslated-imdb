The film has the potential and prerequisites for a good feeling, a great love story ... the cast is perfect, the visual elements work, the original conditions work, the characters work ... but the story changes from one gambit to the next in a predictable way ... not a single character in the film has depth or depth explained by the director. All we know about the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones is that she is obsessed with her world. No one is allowed in and no one is challenging their world ... that's obvious ... but the other characters have all their own dimensions are really never been explored or revealed ... Aaron Eckhart's character had so much more to offer the story was but not allowed. Abigail Breslin's character is so easy to understand that her performance seems somewhat predictable and unreal. In the end, everything returns to the forced turbulent world of Catherine Zeta-Jones, to which the audience never falls in love. Honestly, her turbulent world is not much more than a depiction of a selfish, self-obsessed, spoiled lady, which most people would not have much time or sympathy for the real world. The director had to make her a heroine and never does ... in the end, Eckhart's character wins because he wins. <br /> <br /> No lousy movie, just a movie that could have been allowed, explained and exposed much better with more depth of personalities. <br /> <br /> Cheers
