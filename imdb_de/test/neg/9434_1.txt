Can there be a worst movie? Even Ed Wood could not find anything so bad in his terrible worst case. Cheesy, stupid, long-winded, absurd ... and those are the good points. I saw this garbage in the early '80s, when I was incredibly bored in the beginning, and I ate through the whole thing without getting out of the way of the brain, though that would probably have been a more enjoyable experience. I actually remembered it because it was so bad. It saddens me in some ways because some of the best directors have started to make television films (eg Spielberg) and it has been a wonderful opportunity for them to bring their source material to the public.
