It's the only thing I've ever seen. It's sad how much he tries so hard to make a good joke, and all he does is curse and thinks his disgusting vulgarity is funny. He is the bitterest person I have ever seen. Throughout his whole act, he tries to show how much he does not care, showing just how angry he is with the critics and the people with every taste and sense of humor who rather go through immense torture than look after him. " Show". There are good comedians, there are bad and terrible ones. But this guy is in his own league. I'm sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny.
