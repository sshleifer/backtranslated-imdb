I have seen some bad things in my time. A half-dead cow trying to get out of the waist-deep mud; a collision between two cars; a thousand plates smashed on a kitchen floor; People who live like animals. <br /> <br /> But I've never seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat in my life. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse than Vllad the Impaler, worse than people putting kitties in microwaves. <br /> <br /> It's the most disturbing movie ever, easy. <br /> <br /> I always thought it was a joke, a bit of a clever joke, and that Mike Myers might be a strong cocaine drug addict who loses a bet that has lost a bet or something. <br /> <br /> I shudder
