Danny Glover and Carey Elwes have obviously forgotten how they behaved when they made this movie. Acting is absolutely cruel. The payout is even worse. I'm sorry for Danny Glover, I hope he was well paid for it because he looks completely stupid, as well as Mr. Elwes. An absolute slap for every horror movie fan. Despicable. This is probably the worst drama experienced actors have ever seen. I wonder if they bothered to watch the script, or if they did, it must have said, "Forget everything you know about acting," because it makes them both ridiculous. For two experienced veterans, it's terrible to act that way. I hope the paycheck was very big, at first I thought it was a parody. If you can find satisfaction in this movie, you get more performance.
