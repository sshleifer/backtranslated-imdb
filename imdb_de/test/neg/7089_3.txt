Just listen to the Broadway Cast album and hear the voices of Barbara Harris and John Cullum doing wonders for the wonderful Lerner and Lane music. With this beautiful cast you watch the film with Streisand as Streisand, and Yves Montand read his lines with such a strong French accent that a chainsaw could not cut through them. The best part (for those who are looking for something to look forward to) is what Montand does with the introductory part of the title song. Listen to how he sings: Could any one of us have any idea or suspicion what magical achievements of sorcery and voodoo can you do? (This part summarizes the problem of playing in Filmmusical's "Name Stars," rather than the appropriate talent for the various roles.) I can see Rex Harrison step into that scene, suggesting that Montand can also learn to cater to the beauty of the English language. <br /> <br />
