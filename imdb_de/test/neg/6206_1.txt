This is not a good movie. It is a proven remake of the English movie 'The Hitch'. But the original is insulted. This is hardly a movie you would expect from an experienced director like "David Dhawan" who has good movies like "Raja Babu", "Coolie No.1", "Hero No. 1" ... <br /> <Das The main theme for this film is from "The Hitch" with some changes to appeal to the Indian audience, but somehow the story and the script are not convincing enough. Plus the spectacle from the main roles, d. H. Salman Khan and Govinda, is pathetic. It seems that they need the slightest provocation to take off their shirts to show their bare chest. I do not find that fascinating and least of all funny. What did the director think? In addition, viewers have to bear the case of Govinda's over-acting. It was just unbearable. I recommend that viewers watch them at their own risk. My rating of 2 for this movie could be considered very generous. Instead, I would advise viewers to watch the English movie "Hitch," which is much better.
