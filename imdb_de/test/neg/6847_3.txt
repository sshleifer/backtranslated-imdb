I agree that Mary Woronov (Murdoch's secretary) is one of the only good things about this film. She is my favorite actress of all time, every role she plays is always done so well. Her character is smart, sarcastic, smart, carefree, funny and cunning. She pulls off this role really well and you get a good feel for what her character is about. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pretty bad. The music is the most entertaining thing left over. One of the characters has this really weird radio that she brings with her wearing her tight zebra-striped tank top. <br /> <br /> One thing that was a little bit intriguing in the story was the idea that someone hired these people three college-aged kids to spice up an old, abandoned theater. He gives them the keys and says - go on it. That would be really fun and I wish someone would give me this chance! Imagine going to an old, abandoned theater with two other people, and you can decide how to decorate them and put them in order. You have complete control over the entire building. That would be so funny! Unfortunately, the characters do not see this as an exciting adventure, but as a big task. They walk around with long faces and fight each other all the time. It's kind of a crap. But it's fun to think about the possibilities these people are not even excited about. <br /> <br /> The movie is a pretty good job when you feel helpless or a little spooky in the theater itself. Acting (except Woronov .. and possibly Murdoch, the boss) - just because she makes a really good, hungry, fake smiley business man who's never lucky - is really terrible and you end up feeling dissatisfied. In addition, the random slapstick is a bit cheesy and ruins the reality that the movie tries to create. <br /> <br /> If you have Mary Woronov, the funky 80s Casio keyboard style beats and the thoughts, you can watch this a huge, eerie, abandoned theater is intriguing to yourself.
