I borrowed this movie from my local library and thought it might be good considering I liked that kind of movie and thought about who was there. The drama stunt, the fighting scenes were just as bad and they brought in a few well-known people, but did not occupy anyone with actors who could star in the lead? I noticed that some people gave him a 10. Why would you ever consider giving this horse pile a 10? You can say it's a 10 worth for mere comedy Be a comedy that you can not rate at 10 for the comedy. You have to rate it according to what it should actually be and not for something the director did not intend. Maybe some of you voted 10 because you thought it would be fun if this crappy movie had a high rating so people would go out to rent or buy it because you think it's fun that To deceive people. You play with people time and money to which you have no right. If the film is sucked, give it a bad rating, if it was good, give it a good rating, but do not lie. I gave this movie a 4 and am glad that I could check it out of my library for free because this movie is shit and not worth paying a dime for.
