Well, I have seen and seen this movie due to the rather high score (now 7.1) and some good reviews. Normally IMDb is a good clue when it comes to trimming, although in this case I was very cheated. The film is a recent detective story, starring Vinnie Jones as an investigative journalist who determines the death of a construction worker. Add to this an invented Dickens novel (called The Riddle from the 18th or 19th century), which also deals with a murder story. Both storylines are linked by the discovery of an unpublished manuscript. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? It could have been, but this movie fails terribly in a number of areas: 1) Acting. At best mediocre, but it can be observed. Not worse than the average UK sitcom, although you expect something better for a movie. Especially with a score of over 7. 2) Music. The music used is just terrible, it distracts and is annoying. Especially the pub music and the music that plays in the apartment of the journalist. 3) storyline. That's a big joke. There are gaping action holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny. Without going into every detail, I can say without a doubt that the end is absurd and is one of the worst elements of acting and the plot of the year. 4) Camera work. Sometimes the camera positions and views distract and are not absolutely the "story". <br /> <br /> I'm a bit of a film fanatic and watch an average of 1 to 2 movies per day, but this is by far the worst movie I've seen in months. Do not waste your money or your time with this garbage.
