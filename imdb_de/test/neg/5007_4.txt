What's up with CURACAO (Also known as DEADLY CURRENTS, although the reason for the name change is that I have no idea), you can probably summarize where a woman says to her lover: <br /> <br /> "Keep it down baby, I'm trying to sleep" <br /> <br /> Not the dialogue is the problem or the way it is conveyed, but the fact that the actress has a Central European accent. There is nothing wrong with that, until it turns out that her character is from Philadelphia in the USA! That fascinated me about this thriller when I saw it - The way accents do not suit their characters. Aside from the Philly woman with a German accent, we see a South African with an English accent, a local police chief who looks like an Irishman personifying a Gestapo officer, and worst of all, George C Scott plays somebody who's either a Dutchman or a Brit with an accent that sounds like it could be American with South African. They quickly give up what's on screen, and ultimately focus on what nationality a character has because of the strange way they speak. It is interesting to note that this website has not given this film a country of origin. With so many different actors from different countries, you feel that this has been produced by the United Nations. <br /> <br /> Even if you're not curious about accents or dialects, you probably have to give up anyway after the game because CURACAO plots less. Things happen like a boat exploding, a hostage-taking, and the hero recruited as an agent for South African intelligence, but all you have to do is scratch your head and wonder what it's all about.
