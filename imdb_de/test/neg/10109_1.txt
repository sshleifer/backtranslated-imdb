Well, let's start with: I love horror movies, not even the worst plot or the most horrific drama will ruin the experience, as long as there's a certain amount of gore and tension. Second; This is the worst movie ever. It even beats mean guns and the attack of killer tomatoes. And I'll pay it. <br /> <br /> However, the involuntary humor was just funny until half of the movie had passed. After that everything was so sad. Much to my surprise, the reviews were somewhat divided; and you, who rated this piece of C-Movie crap of 7 and more; I know you're kidding! GOOD !! HAHAHA! Because if there is a reason in the world, and we have just a little bit the same idea of ​​what quality is; They can not be for real. <br /> <br /> Anything worth mentioning about the content has already been summarized pretty well, so I'll leave it. <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> But the scene in which the veiled rubber mask man pulls the woman back and forth through the dog kennel for ten minutes, with such a terrible musical score and the amazing dialogue between the two really does it for me.
