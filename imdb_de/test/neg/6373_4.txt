I was looking forward to that. The Ultimate Avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations, and since Iron Man was one of my favorite Marvel characters, I thought that this production team could do a great job with an Iron Man solo title. The last movie was unsatisfactory. I did not expect them to spend most of the film on paying Iron Man gray armor. The red and gold armor may be seen for about ten minutes. Not a big complaint, but not what I expected from the ads and the box. The worst part, however, was the story, the acting and the CGI animation for the monsters and the Iron Man armor, which were unconvincing. It did not fit well with the cell animation. Even at first glance, it seems stuffy and lifeless. Tony Stark's character arc, as unbelievably slow as necessary, is so compelling and unconvincing. I wanted to see this movie because I love Iron Man, but after forcing myself through the movie, I wondered if they could not find something as good as the Ultimate Avengers films.
