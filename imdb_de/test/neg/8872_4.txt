Of the thousands of films I've seen so far, this is the first one that made me think of the term "wasted talents". I've never seen so many good actors making terrible performances (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein, etc.). The "aging" make-up is pretty awful and to make matters worse, it's lit up wide. The use of music (eg, love at first sight for the young adjutant) is sometimes so caricative that I could smile awkwardly at most of the viewers around me. So far, Antoine de Caunes has been a pretty good actor, but since I've seen this movie and "les morsures de l'aube", I think he should think about quitting. Please, Antoine, give up the "Master of Balantree" project. I doubt you deserve it.
