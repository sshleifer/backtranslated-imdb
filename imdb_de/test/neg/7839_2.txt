This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> I can usually sit down in a Van Damme movie if need be, as they usually laugh a little and do not need much thought. This one has no redeeming features. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of action, humor, acting, directing, etc. A true stinker on all levels. <br /> <br /> I never went out of a movie during a movie, even though I came here very close. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
