You stop making sequels to great movies. The original was a great movie that was outdone with fighting, sex and one of the coolest characters that adorned the 90s screen. The story is believable, as if you were in bars outside the South that you would know. But here comes this piece of garbage Roadhouse 2 Last Call. Let's just hope they take the title seriously and never do a roadhouse again. It has neither the charm of the characters of the original nor is the story really credible. The story is more of an action by Steven Segal, even though Roadhouse 2 is a B-movie, he still does not click, as some B-movie actions still sell the movie, no matter how cheesy it is. The only reason you can not buy this movie is that we finally find out that there is only one more question from the original roadhouse. Patrick Swayze's character Dalton, is Dalton his first name or last name? Well, I will save you the $ 4.00 rental fee. Dalton is his first name as in Dalton Tanner. NEVER MAKE ANOTHER ROADHOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!
