I'm a big Randolph Scott fan so I was surprised and disappointed that he's barely seen in this movie! The film really belongs to Robert Ryan, the hero of the jam, and the one involved in the triangle of love. I'm sorry, Gabby Hayes gets more time in this movie than Mr. Scott !! This is not a problem for many viewers, but I come from the Walter Brennan School for Sidekicks, not from Gabby Hayes ... though I would say that his lines in this film were a bit more humorous than annoying than in many of his films with Randolph Scott and John Wayne. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the movie moving very slowly, with a twisted plot that became even more clouded by the unnecessary romance subplot. By tangled means I do not mean impossible to understand or understand, I mean just too messy for yourself. <br /> <br /> The direction is uninspired, and the two bad guys have the most unsatisfactory in the end. The whole movie looks spurious, unrealistic and badly filmed. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her too short parts of this movie. I'm not sure if it's actually her vocals or anyone else, but whoever it was had a very pretty voice. Ms. Jeffreys also had some nice acting moments. The script needed either much more of her or to completely remove her character. However, her beautiful moments were not enough to help the film. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Mr. Scott. He looks awesome in this movie and is the no-nonsense lawyer who does everything right. Some people complain that his characters were too good before 1950 - perfect, but that never bothered me. I take him goody-goody before 1950 or hard and fierce after 1950 ... Randolph Scott was definitely a true western hero. <br /> <br /> It makes me sad to have to say it. But I would recommend passing this movie unless you are a hard-core fan. There are so many better Scott movies that this movie will not be missing.
