This is undoubtedly the worst movie in the Hamilton saga and the worst actor Carl Hamilton has to deal with. Peter Stormare just can not make it, with his psychotic look and no style "Fargo" or "8mm", but in this sort of role he is just useless. <br /> <br /> Lena Olin's presence did not use this movie. She could not save her for what she is: an Americanized copy of big budget action movies like "Goldeneye", "The Hard 3", "Broken Arrow" etc. This movie has no Swedish actors except the actors br /> < br /> Mark Hamill's presence is just ridiculous. 2 out of 10
