This is the only film that I can think of, where after my end I was cooking from the waste of time and money on myself and all those involved. No wonder Alan Moore had nothing to do with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal film) after this debacle. <br /> <br /> It's not bad in a fun way, like showgirls. It's bad in a way that you want to scratch your eyes out. Plot holes the size of planets. The worst script in memory. Terrible spectacle of decent actors. Visuals should be great, but somehow flop. <br /> <br /> It could have been so good ...
