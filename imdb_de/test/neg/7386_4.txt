Although this is the first movie of the broken lizard group, it's the last one I've seen. After enjoying Super Troopers mildly and having managed to sit through the crap that takes place in the club and beer festival, I was surprised to hear that they were making an earlier movie. Now I did not sit down with high hopes, but hoped for a fun campus hype. My friend asked me to remember that they are younger (obviously) and it's their first foray into the movie. I did and was still disappointed. They did not take the drama and comedy skills of the BL guys, they were fine. The whole movie was boring, clich√©d and boring. Some of the other actors in the movie were really bad at acting. And the rugby game did not even resemble rugby. Bad appearance. They have improved dramatically with Super Troopers and have dropped since then. Let's hope they get in shape again with Super Troopers 2
