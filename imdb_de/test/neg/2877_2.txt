The basic storyline of 'Marigold' features a romantic comedy in which the film industry is taken as a backdrop. An American actress Marigold, played by Ali Carter, gets stuck in India. Worse, she has no money. She decides to play a small role in a Bollywood musical so she can earn enough money to return to her nation. Here she meets the Indian choreographer Prem, played by Salman Khan. Basically, the movie fails at the script level. When you call a movie, a Hollywood project does not guarantee a quality cinema. Marigold is the best example. The art direction is weak and outdated. Musically, Marigold proves to be a dude. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loys is far from being recognized as a decent ear. In this regard, Salman delivers his most amateurish achievements so far. Ali Larter is good and has a huge screen presence. Also in terms of performance, she is good. <br /> <br /> Good ratings for this film can be found at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310
