The nest is really just another horror movie that fails because of the low budget. The acting is fine and the scenery is great, but somehow the whole movie just seemed a bit boring to me. The Gore effects are not the best I've ever seen, but they're fun in a cheesy way. The cockroaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite humans. The nest reminded me of a much better movie called Slugs. If you liked The Nest then Slugs is a must, because it's ten times better. Worth noting is that Lisa Langlois, who plays Elizabeth, was in another movie called "Nature Run Amock" called Deadly Eyes (aka The Rats), which is about killer rats, as you might have guessed. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of horror movie, you might want to watch a clock, but you should see much better slugs, which is much more interesting and bloody.
