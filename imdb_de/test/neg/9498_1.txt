Apart from the shiny look, this show had little to recommend. The writing was patronizing and interwoven. The characters were invariably flat and unsympathetic. The female characters had gone through the worst ... reduced to spoiled, selfish airheads whose ambition was to walk around in slips and stilettos trying to sack a man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious, as the series was produced by two women! The acting was mostly boring and humorless, as the actors played one-dimensional characters who attacked each scene with the same note. That's not the fault of the actors. Had they spent more time developing the characters and the storyline, adding some style and humor, MVP might have been a hit. What stays with us is something flat and something unpleasant.
