This movie may very well have been a propaganda film for the North American Falangist Party - or a similar group ... The strong man (Kersey) is above the law (but not outside the law) and frees the citizens by killing worthless trash , The only thing that I thought was not done by the KKK was the fact that a Jew was a good guy ... Try again, if you think of it as a propaganda film for a far-right group - and you see What I mean ... <br /> <br /> It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page has actually made music for this movie ... :(
