I have not figured out what the chosen title has to do with the movie. This is another gathering of monsters as well as the HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Not exactly a masterful act, but Universal had to capitalize again. <br /> <br /> Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is either very ambitious or exaggerated in the ego department. He is working on healing to prevent Larry Talbot from becoming a Wolfman. Somehow, Count Dracula comes over to fix his vampirism. The good doctor's experiment is rounded off by restoring the energy of the Frankenstein monster. The kind-hearted doctor's blood is on the way with that of Dracula stained. John Carradine plays Dracula again. This time he is more convincing. Lon Chaney Jr. is as always the soulful Wolfman. Glenn Strange is the Frankenstein monster that has little to do with this trip. Noteworthy roles include Lionel Atwill and Martha O'Driscoll.
