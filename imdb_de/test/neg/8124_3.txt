I remember well when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In a strange, surrealistic way, the cartoon has captured the stupid actions that, in my opinion, every boy grown up in America is taking part in. I'm shivering now about burning a crippled grasshopper with a magnifying glass, but it was interesting for some reason then. When we grew up in the 1980s, we all knew Stoner. These were the kids who wore Iron Maiden T-shirts at school, sprawled their hair, had unripe mustaches, and were at least two inches taller than anyone else because they had failed one or two grades. We laughed at them because they were so stupid, even if they were not stoned. So it was easy to understand Beavis & Co because we already knew her, some of us were even her. To the extent that GenXer, like myself, spurned the excess of the 1980s and embraced the grunge movement of the 1990s, Beavis & Co was a weird postmodern hymn to us. Strange, because like Beavis & Co, we did not care if we had a hymn. It was just an inside joke that we all got right away, even if it was awful.
