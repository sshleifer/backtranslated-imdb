It's embarrassing that I spent about three minutes en route to a job to stay in the video library, and it was two nights for one night, and I was really mesmerized by the half nekkid pic of the "star." <br /> <br /> I think this movie shows what the New York film school and Sir Daddy's fortune - measured by the biography of this clown at the top - can do for you and you and you because it's about what We have here and in addition a photoshop image of the main character with the body of another person in a still image, which does not appear anywhere in the film. It's a strange reason in so many ways that money has been thrown at him. Obviously they have little money, but from the beginning, when all the extras laugh in their scene of horror, it's not good that she might have had a certain charm if she had been done for 2 cents! Shortly after, I skipped scenes and quickly forward to see the picture on the box, which was all that really interested me. strange, why do not I just lend a porn or something? But wow, there is bad acting, that's funny, I think, and bad acting is just bad. robert englund is pretty pathetic in this together with everyone else. It makes you appreciate that not so directly on video horror that there is. , , Bla, which I would not care about the most. shoulda saw uh hellraiser 3 if I wanted to pack a 8! I would imagine that horny old gay boys with 2 minutes in the video library will be the main tenants and they should start a class action suit!
