A few shrewd children unknowingly unleash an evil that has slept slumbering for the past twenty years, and must reap the misfortune that goes with it "was alright." Why is "Demon Summer" so incredibly bad? I really do not know it's better than their "Splatter Rampage Wrestling", but not so much, because the stage level of acting is scary, and if a "horror" movie is as talkative as this one, that's not a good thing, the story has been better in many others So, why waste your time on this movie? <br /> <br /> My Note: D-
