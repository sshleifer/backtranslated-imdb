I was invited to an early screening of the movie about four months before the release. I had to watch the movie and later fill a packet with my thoughts. It was the hardest thing to do on Earth. The show crawls by and you wish fast, you'd be dead. The thing is, there are two types of Mormon movies. The good ones with really good stories and the shitty ones who just stink. Saints and soldiers, now there is a good movie. But with these would-be comedies, the writers and actors simply try too much. Basically, they try to be funny when they are not. No wonder why the movies are so small. They are filled with "inside jokes" that are not funny at first, and they just try to have fun with average stuff. It's the story that makes the movie, and the stories for those movies are just weak. I bet you can guess what my package looked like when I was asked to fill it out after the movie. ;)
