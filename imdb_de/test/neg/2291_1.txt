Actually, I want my review to be that one word. My friend, whose views I almost always trust in films, especially horror movies, warned me NOT to rent this, no matter how in love, bored or desperate, a new horror film was to be seen, because it was a waste of time. Unfortunately, I have not spoken to him for some time, and I was in a hurry to pick a movie and thought, "What the hell, how bad could it be?" WHY do not I learn? What did I think? Would I have thought that magically, it would become a better movie if you sat on the shelf for years, waiting to be hired? <br /> <br /> The "plot" concerns a man working on films for a business. His boss is an idiot. The guy who had the job in front of him went insane and blew himself up in the pre-credits sequence. For some reason, the boss chooses nerdy 'Ed' for the special project of editing "Loose Limbs" Splatter movies. He never says what Ed should do, but I think that does not matter. Ed is annoyed at some of the clips he's working on all alone in this house, whereupon the boss has decided to relocate him for no apparent reason. He asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss does not care. He begins to go insane, allegedly from the clips, and wants to do the bloody murders in real life. Or has he always been like that? Please note that I make this action sound much deeper, more interesting, and more coherent than it actually is. <br /> <br /> We do not care about the characters or take pity on them or even just hate the bad guys The plot is really boring and predictable. The splatter is not even so cruel or creative - it's not worth it just to see the pile because what's there is not interesting or original. <br /> <br /> All "tributes" to Sam Raimi Get rid of a bad rip-off, and no one in the movie will ever look as good as Bruce Campbell, so you can not get distracted by that. I think an "Evil Dead II Dead by Dawn" poster is prominently featured in only one scene in the hope that Sam Raimi will be flattered and will not consider legal action. A trained chimpanzee could have written a better script. Every time I line up, "Do we have fun ... already?" (which even the Re-Animator's bride could not do without wincing) I feel like I'm looking for a deadly weapon myself. Characters just pop out of nowhere without explaining that they're just getting there to get killed. This might be fine if the movie was even entertaining or entertaining remotely, but I could do anything to avoid rushing through most of the time. Fortunately, I decided to pay some bills and play my checkbook at the same time as the movie. Trust me, it did not demand my full attention. I still had the feeling that more than 90 minutes of my life were wasted just because it was in the background. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it, no matter how you try it You are-you'll hate yourself for wasting your money. Horror fans will be completely annoyed by the incompetence. Even those who have not watched too many Splatter movies should stay away, as there are so many movies you could rent that are more worthwhile. If you want something brainless, low budget and fun, rent something else. Complete waste of time without any redeeming qualities. Be smarter than I was at the time, and do not be fooled by the warning "Not for the faint of heart" on the box. They were warned! <br /> <br />
