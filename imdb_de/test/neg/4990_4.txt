They did it again: demolished the title of an old show and then destroyed the nostalgia with boring "newly invented" stuff. The '60s cartoon was one of the funniest of its time, a good-natured satire of superhero comic books. The figure was drawn halfway between animal and human, just as Mickey Mouse is. Here they use a real beagle. it's like making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real rat. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks much of the clever game that made the original show funny. Instead, we get an awkward police ex-dog, even stupider than Cad. And some pet owners who do not add anything to the story. Cheesy effects (the animation with the dog is embarrassing). Bad Scripting A stereotypical dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The gravel noise type they've hired to say underdog is painful. They would think they at least got a vocal Impressionist to approximate Wally Cox's humorous distinctive voice for Underdog. But no. There are at least some affectionate references to the source material (such as the rhyming lines) that set it to 4. <br /> <br /> Only small children who love dogs can enjoy it. Everyone else should get a DVD of the original animated series. Just watch this in despair.
