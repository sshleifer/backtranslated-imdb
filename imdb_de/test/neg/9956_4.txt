First of all, I have to say that I am generally not a big fan of werewolf films. It's not that I do not like her, only that I do not like her very much. There are some that I have enjoyed ... werewolf of London (1935, Stuart Walker), an American werewolf in London (1981, John Landis) ... and some that I thought were alright, but Nothing special ... The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner), The Howling (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are just a few examples ... but overall, the werewolf's underwolf is not my favorite. But I had this piece in one of those 50 movie sets, so I thought I'd see it and see what it was like. Spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> The Mad Monster is a story of werewolves, but the werewolf is mainly made by a mad scientist, Dr. Ing. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco), used for revenge. Dr. Cameron has found a way to turn people into beasts, especially wolves, but has been ridiculed and ostracized by the wider scientific community. Forced from a prestigious position, he goes crazy and takes revenge on those who mocked him in an old mansion, where he lives with his daughter Lenora (the lovely Anne Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glenn Strange) with limited mental abilities. With his serum, dr. Cameron Petro into a werewolf and sends him out to kill his old rivals. Eventually, the werewolf Petro gets out of control and both the crazy doctor and his creation are killed. The film also plays something as a murder / crime drama, with Lenora's journalistic admirer (Johnny Downs)) investigating the doctor's strange behavior and the murder rash. The story seems to borrow many elements from other great pictures that came before it. There are memories of Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) creating a rampage and the creature killing an innocent child. Also the visions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931, Rouben Mamoulian or 1941, Victor Fleming's version) and The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner) come to my mind. And that's one of the problems with this movie from my point of view - it seems like a mediocre fusion of some great movies. It does not contribute much to the genre. <br /> <br /> There are some redeeming qualities. George Zucco's performance was convincing, and the scene in which Dr. Lorenzo has spoken with his visions / hallucinations of his tormentors, is good for me to show his madness. At least in the case of his character, a certain character has built up. However, Glenn Strange's character is not convincing and seems to have this comic quality - whether intended or not - I'm not sure that just does not fit into the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> I seemed to like it more than most IMDb users, based on my rating of 4/10, but it was still a below-average movie. Maybe worth a look if you're a fan of early werewolf films or a big fan of the horror movies of the 1930s and 1940s, but it's unlikely you will appeal if you are not.
