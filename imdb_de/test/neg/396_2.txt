Kazuo Komizu, who has not yet made a decent movie, directed this "infamous" shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit at his Japanese release. <br /> <br /> Yes, it contains scenes of rape and blood and dismember, but something like that? It has the style of a bad American porn movie shot and badly photographed by Ed Powers ("Dirty Debutantes") and is incredibly slow. <br /> <br /> It seems to have earned its fame. Social Acts. <br /> <br /> There is a big difference between this and horror that is well produced. <br /> <br /> Just because someone likes his movie a bit wet does not mean he accepts crap like that. On the contrary, this type of fan (myself, for example) tolerates even less crap than the average fanatic out there, because he has seen so much and become too critical. It's a shame production companies do not recognize that. <br /> <br /> A reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) commented that the movie's "almost obsessive obsession with gang rape" is one of the factors that has killed him. I do not agree with you. The topic is never the topic. The question is how this subject is treated. In ENTRAILS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN it is treated so uninspired that it is boring. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like graphic representations of psychopathic behavior (with a fascinating context) when the material is well-directed, freshly photographed and taken aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror / pink hybrid is sad.
