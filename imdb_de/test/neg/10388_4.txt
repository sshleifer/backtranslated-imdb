I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although Kristin Erikson played the obsessed girl very well, I do not think Isabelle, the character she played, was obsessed. I've seen people have psychotic breaks because of sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether their father actually abused them or not. I also had to watch some parts of it again to make clear what the letter said, what the names of the characters were, and I'm still not sure what happened, whether they were real or not. I try to find the "original" story it is based on to compare facts, but I do not seem to find anything about it online. <br /> <br /> It was not a bad movie. but part of the dialogue was unbelievably cheesy. As far as the special effects are concerned, the film was pretty bad for a Grade B, and these owner scenes paid off if you had nothing better to do. LOL
