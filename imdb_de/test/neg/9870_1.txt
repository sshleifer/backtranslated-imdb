This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. This movie is more than ridiculous. It's as if the director were being sued by the actors because he falsely portrayed their roles as the fantastic Four, I think Should have been published in comic bookstores so you can only say desperate geeks who are not getting enough cheese and want to see more and more crap films. As a conclusion to my paradoxical statements and my thesis, I believe in this film had major disadvantages for the future of the cast members of the cast, with the exception of the character of Jay Underwood, in which I believe that his best performance was, if you like roles consider not quite human films in which the story is told in a way He has no character. He can not act and people have made good decisions not to see his films. Therefore, he is unlikely to play a major role unless he does his career in a rare but interesting way.
