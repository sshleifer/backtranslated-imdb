As a fan of ZaSu Pitts comedies, I thought this was worth a try. I was pretty disappointed. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was on TCM, but it was just Niagara Falls, the movie Miss Polly was not there.) was wasted on one of the stupidest stories I've ever had when I was blown away unhappy. Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me because he was the strongest actor on the show, but the limelight is attracted by Slim Summerville (Sam Sawyer), who, if he has a talent, has not demonstrated it here. <br /> <br /> ZaSu Pitts (Elly Sawyer) is awesome but does not have much to share. The biggest laugh in the movie is when it lands under a table under Sam. <br /> <br /> The only one in the movie that makes any sense is Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is generally unreasonable. Although she is physically very attractive, she is totally undesirable because of her personality and attitude. Elly, Sam and the hotel staff are just fools. <br /> <br /> Sam and Elly spend their honeymoon suite in the crowded hotel for Tom and Margie. But then they take it back. Sam ends up locking Tom and Margie in her room. Most of the movie is that they try to break out, but Sam keeps putting them down with a gun. <br /> <br /> The worst part comes towards the end. Tom, who is about to end his escape, meets a minister on the lower floor of the hotel. Well, the guy who, as I said, is the only one in the whole movie who has a head on his shoulders suddenly and for no reason decides to marry Margie! <br /> <br /> He pulls the minister into the room he just escaped from, but Margie does not want to marry him. He gives her a kiss, and now, after a kiss, she feels compelled to marry him. After all, Sam's got the nerve to tell Tom, "You fooled me," when he was practically the only line Tom had to say to Sam earlier, "We're not married," to which Sam replied, "Do you think I would believe that? ? " <br /> <br /> Idiotic.
