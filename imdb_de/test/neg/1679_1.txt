I have not seen the first entry in this series yet. Fortunately, however, I have been able to follow the complex and complicated conspiracy with all its unexpected twists, and I welcome them for the absolute originality of the concepts contained herein. If there is any confusion, I would like to leave no doubt that everything I've just said is covered with pure, carefully cultivated sarcasm, a species that blooms and exponentially grows when exposed to such crap. A clear sign that this is not impressive is that it was led by a visual effects creator whose only other merit in this area is a Henry Rooker movie that was not well received. Acting is, at best, average, and I can not oppose anyone ... the Scottish computer woman (well, what about that last name?) Russia's accent ridiculous and / or irritating. There are one or two stylization attempts, and they are reasonable. The action is not that bad. Cinematography and editing are fine. The music is cool enough. Language is rare, though. Violence is pretty bloody. I only recommend this for fans of B-movies, and I can say that you can make it worse. 1.10
