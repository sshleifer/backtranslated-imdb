I like science fiction as much as the next man? but what the hell was that? Apparently only filmed for three days with excess footage from his previous film "Nana (1926)," these Jean Renoir shorts are a confusing futuristic satire produced on a budget that could not be more than zero. After a major war, Africa became the most civilized region in the world in 2028, and the former Europe was referred to as "Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land)". An African explorer? played by Johnny Huggins, a black man, disguised as a white man, dressed as a black man, if you follow me? travel with his spherical plane to the ruins of Paris and land in front of the shelter of a wild Parisian (Catherine Hessling, the wife of the director) and her primate mate, perhaps the scariest monkey man costume I've ever seen. The Wild begins, as part of a bizarre sexual initiation ritual, to show the discoverer the Charleston Dance he likes to learn by himself. <br /> <br /> It does not help the film that Hessling, who was wonderful In Renoir's "The Little Match Girl (1928)", the following year is not a great dancer, though the use of slow motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony , In addition, I'm pretty shocked that Renoir exploits his own wife as such an obvious sexual object. It's no surprise to hear of her divorce just three years later! On the positive side, I liked the general sci-fi concept behind the film, and the reckless satirical touch of reversing the racial roles typical of such stories. Why Renoir decided to disguise his black actor as a minstrel remains a mystery forever. "Charleston Parade (1927)" is a stupid, ruthless and utterly meaningless film that is considered a curious curiosity by one of cinema's most respected film directors. Maybe he is an effort he would have liked to forget. The DVD version was without a musical soundtrack, but I chose a selection of pieces by Dmitri Shostakovich.
