Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this movie. If you can even call it a movie. It looks like a first class art project that has been hastily cobbled together. <br /> <br /> The "talents" here will subject you to a painful mix of under- and over-negotiation, and virtually all the scenes were terribly fictitious and presumptuous. <br /> <br /> The film in no way reflects the Malaysian culture or social conventions - no one is talking like that at all. I live in Malaysia, BTW. <br /> <br /> Spinning Gasing seems to be tailor made to win a prize in the foreign film category of a Western film festival. And unfortunately this trick seems to have worked. Some reviewers would undoubtedly refer to it as "exotic," but a more specific word would be "cruel." <br /> <br />
