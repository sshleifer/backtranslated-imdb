It is a mystery to me how this script was sold, much less produced and distributed. The dialogue was so bad that it got sick. The train and helicopter scenes seemed to have been made by students on flashcards. Lou Diamond Phillips must have hid under his seat when this --- this "movie"? was shown at a private screening, after which he most likely walked out the back door. The only feeling that aroused in me was compassion for the cast, they had to "bite the bullet" to get through it. I could not bear to see everything, it was so predictable that it was funny. Who knows, maybe it will be taken up by one of the networks as a situation comedy.
