Great production and a good comedy performance by George Clooney can not save strangely distanced, occasionally awkward quasi-comedy by Joel and Ethan Coen. The story of the streets of depression was yesterday with three escaped inmates looking for a hidden fortune, unintentionally becoming country stars. The film continues to meander, but it never gains momentum. Clooney's charismatic Gableesque raid, the artistic direction and the lively music of T-Bone Burnett provide a great boost. Otherwise, the screenplay (by the Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, and the supportive cameos of John Goodman and Holly Hunter do not get a boost, and the second half of the film slips precariously into self-desire. ** from ****
