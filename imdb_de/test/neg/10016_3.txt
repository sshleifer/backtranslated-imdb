A lot of people are standing in front of the house and some women are crying ... Men are standing in close groups and talking in a subdued tone ... a few guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today. Soon you know that someone in the house has died ... The dead woman's wife worries about preparing food for so many people. Her friend sitting next to her gives the idea of ​​making it easy by preparing simple roti sabji. The son of the dead man talks to someone on the cell phone. The daughter is busy with her make-up ... Her mother suggests that she wears salwar kameej, but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people visit her house so he prefers to wear jeans and a T-shirt as Salwar Kameez ... another son asks her mother to stop all kriyas and also tells her not to come out of the office too soon ... then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person ... that white cloth over the face is slightly shifted due to the wind, he reveals the face ... His Anupam Kher ... suddenly sounds an alarm and he gets up from bed ... Is it his dream or a retrospective? You will not get an answer until the end of the movie ... Well, this is a joke comedy for director Dibakar Banerjee !!!!! Later one learns that this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie, and thus makes everything clear that the previously described was still a dream. Is this a movie comedy? Well, it should belong in this category ... But not really !!! There is nothing that can be connected with the comedy removed in the movie !!! In addition, the director gives the message that no one from the police will get justice !!! So everyone has to cheat the cheats !!!! or forget the justice !!!! Music by Bapi-Tutul & Dhruv Dhalla is alright ... There's not much to say about other areas ... Bad script destroys everything ... Not even Anupam Kher's performance manages to turn it into a Paisa Vasool. ..
