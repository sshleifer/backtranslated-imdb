Pooh. This film has so many incredible powers of action that it has turned a good movie into a hideous mess. The story is reasonably decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally ridiculous. We are supposed to believe that the intelligence service would contradict all common sense and expose the president of the United States to an incredible risk. If this is an indication of the way of thinking that is valid among the Presidential protectors for good judgment, then we are all in trouble. Roy Scheider performs well as a president, but unfortunately is offset by Patrick Muldoon's truly vicious acting (who somehow still gets jobs in Hollywood due to his good looks and uncanny skill, despite every opportunity to grin) Script requires a grin). Maybe someone will see that and be inspired to make the premise a good movie - or maybe someone will see it and say, "Hey, if they can make such a bad movie, maybe I can too!"
