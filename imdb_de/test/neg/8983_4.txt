'Carolina Moon' is an appropriate television movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the city where she grew up and murdered her best friend of her childhood. It turns out that every other day a young girl is murdered on the same day and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, has to solve the puzzle before she is dead. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is the female lead and does a good job, supported by the more delicious Oliver Hudsom and a still-sparkling Jacqueline Bisset. Adapted to a Nora Roberts novel, the script complies with the Moor standard and the plot is boringly predictable. But that contradicts, as I said, the rather delicious Oliver Hudson.
