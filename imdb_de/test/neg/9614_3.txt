Not even a "minor" hitch, but just a bad movie. The cinematic equivalent of a dirty old man. Ugly in every way: uninspired writing, static vision, rotten clothes, ghastly hair, unusual actors and a really pointless rape scene. The director's perverse humor is there, but not consistently applied; The movie only comes alive in its cruelty. The women are particularly bad; "Frenzy" could be used as proof that the director was a misogynist, though it is a better explanation for me that he may begin with his TV series and "Psycho" - which he himself described as an exercise in frugality, an experiment to see if a television looks like Crew could turn a passable feature - Alfred Hitchcock had pretty much given up on art and decided to trade. In 'Frenzy', the great master seems to be bowing to convention, trying to cope with the times and give the audience what he wants, in the form of uninteresting nudity, nudge-nudge wink and general malice. I do not give an old man his rest, but I do not want to remember that he is tired and lazy and has time to see Vertigo again!
