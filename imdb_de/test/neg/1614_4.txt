A friend of mine, who is even more in the cult movies of the 70s than I, has recommended this film to me and actually gave me the copy of it that I have looked at. However, I was not as enthusiastic about the result as he was? or Michael Elliot? was. The film is a hybrid of HOUSE OF WAX (1953) and THE Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974): I would really say that it served as the basis for the 2005 remake of First 2005, much more than the "original"! So we have a remote and abandoned wax museum with incredibly realistic dummies (guess why that is) with a seemingly innocent curator (a hammering chuck connors) of the teenager stranded by the compulsory group (including Tanya Roberts) " is attacked ". He also has a crazy brother? PSYCHO (1960) was built in for a good deal, except for the same twist. Who should be a mechanical genius (presented in a "poltergeist" who inexplicably accompanies the first murder). The film benefits from a Pino Donaggio score, but since it's so distracted and not well done, it's basically just a superfluous (and rather jumbled) genre effort.
