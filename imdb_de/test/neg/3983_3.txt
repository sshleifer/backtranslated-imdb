At the beginning of this film, I had doubts that it would not be much more than a typical B science fiction movie. But as it progressed I became interested and I saw the whole thing through. The premise is interesting, original and has the makings of a classic. Unfortunately, it ended up in a mediocre movie instead, influenced by the usual factors that make a potentially good movie a bad movie (bad drama, low budget, etc.). I'm curious how this would develop if it were restored with good actors and a big Hollywood budget.
