Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very verbose KOMODO VS. COBRA. No guess here. A huge CGI Komodo dragon - it looks like a dog minus a coat - picks up a huge CGI king cobra, with a row of tree huggers and others in between. The Baumhuggers get Captain Michael Pare (who else?) To take them to an island outside the borders. An experiment by a mad scientist growing very large vegetables has become an experiment in growing very large creatures, thanks to our nutty military. Now only the very big creatures and the little, shapely daughter of the mad scientist remain on the island. The group meets them in the old plantation lab, the monsters arrive and the hunt is on. If you see enough Wynorski / Sci-Fi channel strips, you will see some sets and locations on many other films. Action does not exist, as does action. At least you can enjoy watching the badly animated compo / dog pounding on its intended victims before stalking them. The cobra strikes and swallows. No imagination at all.
