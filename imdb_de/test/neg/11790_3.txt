I'm sure every legitimate submarine driver would happily land on the USOS Seaview (yes, SOS ...). Why could you play full basketball in the torpedo room? He's so tall. And how about the bay windows in the bow, the better to see huge squid or minefields appearing out of nowhere? Did I mention the colorful mess with the parrot on the shoulder? And the admiral's cabin with a seeming attic? Big beeping under ... <br /> <br /> OK, OK ... it will never win prizes for authenticity. And if the submarine is ridiculous, the plot is even worse. Somehow, the Van Allen radiation belts that have "burned" hundreds of miles in space have made global warming look like a small roast. The pompous admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon) and his buddy Lucius (Peter Lorre, who looks somewhat uncomfortable) make a plan to extinguish the fire by firing a rocket into his midst. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of intrigue (sic) along the way, with a born-again survivor (and his little dog!) two "dames" who can never be alone enough, a twist of "red shirts" which are dispensable, and drill holes large enough to go through Godzilla. Get inspired by the Seaview being hunted by another submarine at 60 mph - you do not need advanced sonar if you can follow aft from 100 feet. <br /> <br /> The film is carried by a cliff hanger to the beach Another one; The payoff is so anticlimactic that it makes no sense to be worth the wait of 1 hour and 50 minutes in any case. <br /> <br /> The technical adviser for this shipwreck must have been a 14-year-old boy with a stack of popular mechanics magazines. Worth seeing, if only to the reef.
