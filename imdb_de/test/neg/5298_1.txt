Travolta and Thurman have earned a better movie. This is very secondary in all aspects, not a single fresh idea. But the biggest problem is the ridiculous philosophy of this film. A gang of black rappers, after all their criminal activities and even killing people, are almost becoming Mickey Mouse-like heroes who perform on stage and award prizes at the ceremony. Maybe that fits in with real life. But to show it as a normal "happy ending" is beyond my imagination. "What's wrong with shooting some bad Ukrainians if they are not politically correct?" - The show must go on! This makes me think that Hollywood writers have a big problem separating good and bad, even if the genre is supposed to be a "black comedy."
