The nun is a revenge image in which a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer garbage cans and comes back years later to avenge herself when the adults now attend their old school. The story is predictable in spades and holds no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end. It is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average screenplay and screenplay. Many of the special effects are low and there is almost no credibility in the final battle. But if you drop by, there are some exciting and theatrical gems. If you like pointless cookie cutters you will like this, otherwise you should fit.
