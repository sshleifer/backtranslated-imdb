How can you summarize all sorts of stereotypes and stereotypes that exist in the horror genre and then put them into a lousy movie? The answer: "Lagerblood". This is amateurish slasher nonsense made on a micro budget and a bit too obvious, inspired by "Friday the 13th". Four of the most unbearable teenage characters you'll ever see? they are like a combination of ugly, stupid and annoying? go camping and quickly find a murderous madman in a clown suit. Do not even ask me about the murderer's motives or even about the person, because when he was shown in the movie, I totally missed him. This is one of the worst movies ever made without any inspiration or artistry. The production values ​​were so unfortunate that there are actors who play multiple roles without even bothering to obliterate them. The only reasonably decent and worthwhile sequence in "Camp Blood" is the opening, in which the impressively voluptuous Meredith O'Brien with her geeky boy scout has sex in the forest. Yes, I am fully aware that this is a completely superficial remark, but this again is a youthful and backward film, so who cares?
