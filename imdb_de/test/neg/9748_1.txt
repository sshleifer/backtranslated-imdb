This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. It's been a long time since I saw it, but the jokes are NOT funny, the plot is painfully predictable. To call the main characters stupid is to significantly improve their intelligence. I just wanted to beat Tom Arnold and make him cry because he wasted two hours of my life when I finished watching that filthy filth. I do not even know why I ever wanted to see it, but remember, when you watch this movie: DO NOT SAY THAT I DO NOT WARN. <br /> <br /> PS movie titled "I'm my own grandfather." Nuff said.
