Spoilers in front of JEEEEEEEESUSSSSSSSSSSSSSS .... I have a saying: "Insecticides Kill Insects and Moronicides Kill Idiots ..." Some of the people who are killed in this movie are actually THINKING to be killed by walking in abandoned homes , Follow ghosts, etc ... <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely strictly cinematic. The three storylines are presented as parallel and suddenly we learn that they are separated by a few days. It's a cheap shot ... <br /> <br /> Even the "thrills" are so cheap, they're ridiculous. Even "Nightmare on Elm Street" has not sunk so low that someone is being attacked by its own sweater ... it's pathetic a grudge against the filmmakers ..
