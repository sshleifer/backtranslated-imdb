One of the last horror movie heroes - Conrad Radzoff - dies and places his body in a mausoleum with deathly televised footage of the great Conrad welcoming you on your visit. Unfortunately for him and his kidnappers Conrad's body is "lent" by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge mansion where they drink with him, toasting him, dancing with him, laughing with him and then laying a casket that happens to be in a room above. The news of the missing corpse reaches Radzoff's widow and her boyfriend (who happens to rule the black arts) and she organizes a kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so that he can, in his own words, "get an eye out for a man's eye "A tooth for a tooth." Well, Frightmare is an interesting "bad" movie. It is certainly cheap. The sets look like they're on loan (which I'm sure they were). The special effects as well as blood and offal are carried out generously and with little credibility. Trading is, with few exceptions, average to below average. Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator's fame is in tow, but in that rather ungrateful role as a horror-obsessed teenager who has to steal the body of a dead man for kicks, he does little. None of the "kids" except the pretty girl Meg plays is good. Nita Talbot plays with increasing interest the "girlfriend" of the Radzoffs. Also look for the big - I mean big - guy who plays the cop. This is Porky himself of Porky's fame. But fortunately for us all, a performance rises above the material. Ferdy Mayne, an often overlooked German actor who played Christopher Lee as a vampire in the Fearless Vampire Killers, does a more than commendable job as an aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life. Conrad Radzoff is a bad guy in life, just living for his own pleasure, and we see him kill twice before he's even dead (obviously not a swinging teenager at the time). Mayne can look very regal, speak very elegantly and easily pose threats. If for no other reason, you should see Frightmare for his performance. I do; However, they believe that when they showed Radzoff black-and-white clips, they used Christopher Lee footage (does anyone have any thoughts?). You can definitely guess what happens and that's what it actually does: Radzoff goes out and follows the kids who have disturbed his rest. Again, the formula is banal and overused. The spectacle is for the most part anemic and the direction oh so ridiculous. But Mayne shows a good performance in a sea of ​​disability. Definitely worth a look. Watching Mayne show up on screens in his mausoleum always made a wry smile on my lips.
