Today, on President's Day, my wife and I had the DVD "The Notebook" in our local library. It's a movie that was released in 2004 and fell under our radar because we are big moviegoers. I am a published author with the hope that my first book will appear on the screen. I've seen references to "The Notebook" on other films, which is why I've been talking about "watching," and this morning I had the perfect opportunity. We both really liked it. It made my wife cry; We could relate to many things with our own ongoing love relationship and even I resisted being suffocated. <br /> <br /> This afternoon, after many chores, gardening and eating, we decided to actually catch a matinee. When we got to the theater and saw most of the latest movies, we decided on "Victoria Day," which for some reason was not in the theater, though both IMDb and my mobile movies showed it there. Instead, we looked at the poster for "Dear John" and it was written by the same author as "The Notebook", which is the obvious choice as we enjoyed 'TN' so much. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same credibility or empathy as 'TN'; and we commented on all the similarities - two dozen or so - and quickly realized that this movie was nothing but another reviewer said, "A poor man's notebook!" It had a real 'Cash Cow' feeling, which means the Sparks just hurled a story based on the exact template of 'TN' just to make a quick buck. And not only that, after the "bug-eyed" rolllop, which was unlikely to be "Dear John's-John" for the eyelash cancer patient, we ridiculed the movie with everyone and floated thick soapy lines to the end. We were only about 6 of us in the theater this past Monday night at 4:45 pm, and my wife even told me to keep it down so I would not ruin it for the others ... it was so bad. <br /> <Since this was on the heels of 'TN', it was ensured that the Abzackier similarities were vividly recognizable and Sparks blatant, cheap attempts to write templates were painfully obvious. We only wish we had seen "Victoria Day" instead ... no matter how bad it might have been after seeing this bad movie attendance. And oh ... I've always said in the last 30 minutes, "Do not give this cow any coins ... do not give this cow any coins?"
