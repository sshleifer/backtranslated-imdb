As far as I remember this movie, he was not good. I always say that if a movie is good and you can maintain the attention during the most difficult moments (example: Tylenol Cold & Sinus was) then there is a movie that has done its job. The fact that I slept for most of this movie proves only the fact that he could not keep my attention and therefore did not complete his work. Why did I fall prey to Tylenol Cold & Sinus when I had a movie in my arsenal? <br /> <br /> At first, Committed made no sense. The acting was bad and the overall story left more doors open that simply could not be closed. I think of the moment when I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this movie) kissing. That made no sense. Then there was a scene with Affleck and his roommates that indicated he slept with one of them and nearly broke a perfect lesbian couple. I suppose this should show that most people are not as involved in a relationship as Graham is, but for me it was nothing but a filler. I have the suspicious feeling that the director of this movie slept with Affleck. His acting in this movie was cruel. I mean, I've never seen him play "good", but that was by far the worst. Oh, I just had another moment in the battle that went through my mind, and I confirmed it with IMDb.com ... What did John Stewart do in this movie? That was another moment when my eyes were opened for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to take forever. <br /> <br /> And frankly, it's Heather Graham - we could not take care of her after a while. She just is not interesting - she is just boring and boring and basically stops acting after a while. While they are desperately trying to put crazy characters in the mix to revive the movie, it just does not work and instead of calling it just a tag, they're throwing more characters into the mix, making it weird, boring, boring and real is. really long. Luke Wilson's slow style of playing slows down an already crawling movie - why exactly were these two married? Committed is a really horrible movie - the kind of "hip comedy" that makes you feel down and bored. <br /> <br /> Note: * out of *****
