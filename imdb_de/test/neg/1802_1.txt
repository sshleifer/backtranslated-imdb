The production of Heart of Darkness from the year 1994 could by no means do justice to the excellent book. The film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer rather than understanding what was going on. The director was obviously not experienced, and if he did, he did not show it. In addition, scenes from the book were left out or altered, scenes that were pretty important. The movie left me pretty bored and was a complete waste of time. The characters acted as if they had no idea what was going on, and the actors did not show the feelings that Marlow and the rest revealed in the book. Overall, the film was awful and lacked the tension otherwise necessary to make it interesting even from a distance.
