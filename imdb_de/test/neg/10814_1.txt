The movie "The Cave" must be one of the worst films I have ever seen. There was no plot, no story and the lighting was terrible. For most of the film, I could not understand the scenery because it was highlighted by flashlights. The stubborn "gray" rooms throughout the movie were annoying. The only scene that really got through was the cave, lit by a seemingly bad simulation of the conditions in hell. All in all, the movie was not really worth seeing. If the producers do not come up with something better, they should find another profession. The underwater scenes were particularly horrible and consisted mainly of bubbles and flashlights, occasionally watching the actors. In summary, a really terrible movie with low light conditions and strange flashes.
