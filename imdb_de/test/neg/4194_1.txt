I completely agree with other reviews. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked up the review on another page and found that it's not even a real sequel. This was after I slowly withdrew from the TV with the remote control in my hand and my mouth had fallen lower and lower. <br /> <br /> The quality of the shooting exceeds the low budget. It does not even look like a crazy movie. When I watch "home videos" from a documentary, I would expect it. <br /> <br /> In summary: Avoid, avoid. Boooo Lion's Gate! <br /> <br /> I am completely ashamed that I have been watching for 5 minutes and I hope I have saved others from renting or owning them.
