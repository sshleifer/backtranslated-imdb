This movie was basically made to fail by the studio. One, Anne Rice (author of the book), offered to write the script, but was rejected by the studio. Second, they tried to stuff two incoming novels into a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> I claim that these two books - Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned - would work in a live-action form going through a miniseries. The vampire Lestat takes place mainly in the years 1700- 1980 and has a wealth of character that is crucial for the understanding of the main character Lestat. The entire book Vampire Lestat sets the events of the second part Queen of the Damned. Without this understanding, the premise of a movie is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Lestat was not cruel and vicious to all, he did not want to keep up with Akasha's plans, Marius did not make Lestat, Lestat did not love Jesse or make her, Lestat could not be left intact by the light, Marius was neither behind David and vice versa, each character was completely misrepresented, in principle, they called different stories. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a vampire movie, well. Even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, it's good. But Piggie does not go back to cinemas to forget about the success of Rice's great novels and characters just to destroy what their loyal readers love. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the books, you will not do it, really understand the movie, if you have read the books, you will be insulted. Apart from that, I'm such a big fan. I had to watch the movie and knew that this would be the case, and went on anyway. Fang 22 must see it, it will hate.
