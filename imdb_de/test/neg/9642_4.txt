Deliberate, cumbersome, full of speeches, preaching, stylized on the nose, and moreover, in a manner that could only be blamed on MTV, stop-loss is agit-prop garbage. I've come to expect a lot more from talented young actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but scriptwriter / director Kimberly Peirce's mission is to portray the negative impact of the war on American youth. I'm sure she researched something about the Iraq war and the young men who fight in it, but you would never guess if you see stop loss. In many ways, this confusion reminded me of Catherine Hardwick's Lords of Dogtown, an equally incapable, overly stylized, television-movie-like waste of solid objects. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
