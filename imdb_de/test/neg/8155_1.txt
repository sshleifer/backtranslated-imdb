This movie was in a box of 20 others, of varying quality, and I can safely say that this title was at the bottom of the pile. <br /> <br /> It's pointless to go through the plot, which I did not have all day time and life is too short, which reminds me that I've just lost about 85 minutes of me, when I saw this threesome. <br /> <br /> The acting was devilishly bad in a way that it was funny, if only just, while the comedy elements like the two idiot policemen had to make all the Laurel & Hardy fans moan. One of the few, barely strange moments was when the lead actress made a joke about her former plastic T-shirts, which would have been fine if I did not have to watch her wiggling while waddling on the screen. > <br /> The lowest I can give is one, and it probably deserves that Heather Thomas is there, since she was definitely sexy and shapely, though her acting was as bad as any other.
