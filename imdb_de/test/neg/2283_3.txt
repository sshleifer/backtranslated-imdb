I bought a tape from this movie based on the recommendation of other IMDb users, and I have to say that I was very disappointed. I'm a college professor and have shown this movie to my class; They agreed unanimously that it is a horrible movie. I think if you like the old Dark Shadows series you might like it. (I liked Dark Shadows when I was a kid in the 70s, but now I think it's just awful). The first half hour has at least the advantage of a certain fidelity to Wildes novel. After that, the story, at least compared to the 1945 MGM version (which won two Oscars), turns away from the course. Nigel Davenport as Lord Henry is really the only thing that can be seen throughout the production. Many of the other acting are bad, the music is melodramatic and the look of the movie is terrible. Actually, it is not a movie at all - it was obviously shot on video and has the characteristic claustrophobic BBC on it. The opening scenes are particularly ill-lit, the women's costumes are awful (the men look good), and many of the characters - including Dorian - seem to be more 1970s than Victorian hairstyles. The film is well suited to capture much of Wilde's dialogue, but the voice-over narrative in Dorian's voice contains a lot of trash that directly contradicts Wild's character. I'm a big Oscar Wilde fan, and I'm afraid he must have turned violently in the grave when this monstrosity was created. The only improvement on the 1945 version is that the homosexual subtext is definitely more obvious without being awkward. I have not seen any of the newer versions, but if you're interested in seeing the story well told, I'd recommend the MGM in 1945 in black and white.
