The only reason I gave this episode of "Masters of Horror" a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two main actors are good and did not shoot on VHS. The story, the dialogue and the plot are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Talking / driving zombies coming back to vote and influence the political tide against the war! Give me a break! What next, zombies coming back for parachuting? Maybe zombies coming back for QVC shows? <br /> <br /> I never supported the Iraq war, but I support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces. and "Homecoming" was disrespectful because it mocks the true horror of war. <br /> <br /> With the mass production of zombies in the market today ... this is the SPAM of zombie-related entertainment. I do not care how "Homecoming" made it to "Masters of Horror".
