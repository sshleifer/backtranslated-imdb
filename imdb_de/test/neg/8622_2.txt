Most American remakes of European films are pretty bad, but this is in its own league. In fact, this could even be the worst movie (Sandra Bullock) ever made. I dare assume that I would have spent it as another harmlessly bad Hollywood thriller if I had not seen the Dutch original SPOORLOOS. The changed ending here is stupid enough (and performed with particular inability), but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that characterizes the original as a classic. The real horror that can be found here is the fact that the same man who led SPOORLOOS is responsible for this cruelty. Will the real George Sluizer get up?
