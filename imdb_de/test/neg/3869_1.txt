"You know, I was in some cities where the girls were not very pretty, in fact I was in some cities where they are downright ugly, but it was the first time I was in a city where I was There are no girls "I am sure that the fans of the great classic will remember this phrase that belongs to Vin ... one of the truly magnificent Seven (from the first film) ... <br /> <br / > Well, I want to reformulate it here. You know, I've seen some movies where the plot is not that good. In fact, I have seen a few films in which the plot is terrible, but it was the first time in my life that I saw the movie where there is no action at all. <br /> <br /> OK. Maybe my above statement is a bit exaggerated, but honestly ... how to call the plot a crap that goes into this movie. The villain (oh, I do not ask you to give his name to me because I do not remember and that he is not even near Calvera, whose name and character are unforgettable ...) tries to name the church in the name build his deceased sons who were killed in a battle, and this villain kidnaps poor villagers to force them to build the church ... <br /> <br /> First of all, how big the church must be to get them Forcing hundreds of villagers to build it ... is it an Egyptian pyramid or something? But let's stop here about the conspiracy and the absolutely forgotten character of a bad guy and say a few words about The Seven itself ... <br /> <br /> Yul Brynner's good old Chris, always calm, always quiet, talking less but talking is (unfortunately) gone. Oh no ... he's as calm as he was ... but now he's so fake that you just can not buy it. (Imagine he meets a good old friend Chico, whom he has to save after so many years, and there are only a few "hello, hello" and not even a handshake (as far as I remember)) ... honest, It looks more like a meeting of two strangers in an internet chat, rather than a meeting with Chris and Chico. That makes "new Chris" more like Robocop or Terminator than our beloved smart Quickgun ... <br /> <br /> I will not stop talking about other characters here. There's just NO ... (Imagine, if a strong actor like Yul Brynner is so much fake, then other characters will look like that). There are still some attempts to give us a backstory for each of them ... for example, one is the favorite guy of a woman, the other is a man with a dark past, whose wife was raped and killed by Indians has been. Since then, he kills everyone and everything that moves ... But none of these characters makes sense, or none of them can grasp your heart. <br /> <br /> I remember that I was a little kid and when O'reilly (Charles Bronson's character) died in the first movie I was crying. Here I just did not care for any of them ... Even if all of them would die with the entire crew of the movie, I do not seem to care ... <br /> <br /> So, please go and SEE YOU THIS FILM ... I recommend it because you do not have the other chance to see something worse than it.
