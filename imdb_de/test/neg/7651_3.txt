When my parents rented this movie, I expected a very funny movie because Randy Quaid is very funny in comedy movies. However, this movie is not so funny and it is also a bit boring. You can see the surprise that comes a mile away, and it takes a long time for a movie that supposedly lasts only eighty minutes. So I can honestly say, it's not a movie that's on my favorites list. It may work for some people, but it just did not work for me. It turned out to be quite slow in construction with virtually nothing that amused me throughout the movie. Randy Quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very sober actors and actresses. The premise of the film had potential, as well as the casting of Quaid, but everything is just seething and the inclusion of the horror element just seems to be superfluous. Granted, the only dream sequence that the boy had when he jumped on the bed and suddenly became a vortex of blood was very well done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure horror instead of in one who performs comedy as the first genre.
