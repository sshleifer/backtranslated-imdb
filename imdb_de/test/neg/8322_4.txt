This movie is terrible and does not blame Jesus Franco because it's not his fault. <br /> <br /> This movie was filmed by Welles Silently for many years when he got the money to bring together a crew and the actors to take some shots. How much film Welles actually shot is not clear, though not the entire movie or all the sequences here are because several "key sequences" like Quixote are in a movie theater in the hands of collectors or backers who would not do this Give up. The movie here is under two hours and I could hardly imagine that it ever really works permanently. I think, based on several comments Welles made before he died, that he never really wanted to publish the film, but put it together as a personal toy. What exists here is, for the most part, well shot but dramatically dead. Except for Quixote and Sancho, who roam the countryside, very little happens in the first hour. Boring would be a nice description of the material. In the second lesson Quijote ends in modern Spain and deals with a series of not very good sequences with everyday life. That's not to say that there are not a few nice moments, the windmill and the chicken kills are pretty good, but mostly this is a huge waste of film and time. Jesus Franco, who was Deputy Director of Welles in the superior Chimes at midnight, we have a lot of film fragments put together as well as possible. Many people have crucified Franco because the film stinks, but honestly you can not make a good movie out of crap material. One reviewer noted when he saw a different movie clip in the 1970s, which meant that Franco had created and ruined this version himself. While this may be true, over the years I've come across stories where Welles cut and rewrote the movie many times, because he could never do it right. <br /> <br /> This movie is awful, no matter how you slice it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I wonder how good a filmmaker Welles was. Apart from Citizen Kane, almost all of his films were plagued or hindered by budget constraints, so we have the excuse that many of his films "would have been better, if only ...". How do we know? How can we know? Maybe Welles was a man of less talent than we thought, and many of his frontier movies are just not that good and never have been. While this is no place to discuss the place of Welles in film history, the surviving material of Don Quixote, if he accepts what Welles intended (I think it does), is a good reason to rethink, like us to see the man and his work. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for the good sequences (though 2 out of 10 are probably closer to reality)
