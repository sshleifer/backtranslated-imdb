If one of the stars of a movie is called "Sticky Fingaz", you should know enough to stay away. Stay away. HOUSE 2 is just more of the same, this time with zombies crossing a college campus (man, how must have saved the money). As usual, no direction is given to the "Zombies" and only little make-up or costuming is offered. They look like the zombies in one of those endless Italian zombie minions of years. That is, they do not look like zombies we know and love about George Romero and Dan O'Bannon zombie flicks. The people fighting the zombies are all non-actors who can shoot weapons and do little else. Some who have written here believe that the sequel is a bit more focused than the original. All I have to say is that I am glad that the director of the sequel has given up the 360-degree panning that destroyed the first movie. HOUSE 2 is still the same, which means nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes. There is a set piece where soldiers fight with a zombie football team, which could have been funny at least. It is not.
