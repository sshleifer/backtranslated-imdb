George Sluizer of THE VANISHING (He made both the haunting European original and the Hollywood remake) led CRIMETIME. He should not really be blamed for this confused, bad movie, since all the problems lie in Brendan Somer's screenplay. It's badly focused and lazily written. For example, in a nightclub, the murderer is waiting for a victim, a victim, and starts talking to a teenager. To the next scene where she tells the villain: "I told you all about me, tell me about your life?" Unfortunately, the girl told the villain his life story in front of the screen and is a terrible example of how the scriptwriter is unable to bring a character to life through dialogue. I know exactly how damn difficult that is, but for a script the author produced, he would have had to go to extra lengths. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to explain the message of the film. In some places, it feels like he's trying to be a British NATURAL BORN KILLERS that illustrates the voyeurism of the media with crime (maybe even the infamous MANHUNT videogame), but the script is not funny enough to support this betray. If you have a sex scene that does not further develop the storyline, the characters, or a reference to subtext, you know you have a poorly written script and CRIMETIME is a poorly written script
