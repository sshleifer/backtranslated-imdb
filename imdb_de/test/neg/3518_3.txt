Hungary can not make good films. Fact. This is a great example of this. <br /> <br /> First of all, the term "plot" does not exist in this movie. It is seriously weak. Even if many people would argue with me about it. Sure, it's a taboo, but that's about it. There are endless possibilities that would have been really great if they were used, but they skipped almost everything. I think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures that are the only decent things in this whole bunch of awfulness. <br /> <br /> The acting is just shit. There are not many lines, so you would think the actors have great facial expressions or imitation skills, but no. In fact, they suck 86% of the time. And then they say nothing. If you say only one word, you tilt your head and say, "That's damned unrealistic." However, this is partly the fault of the letter. There are also no emotions in most dialogues. <br /> <br /> Editing is sometimes OK, but most of the time it's illogical and it worsens the whole picture. There could have been an emotional boost, but it seems the cut here is about putting cuts in a row. Someone, please explain to me why critics say this movie is a masterpiece. If we call that "art," it does not get better. Sorry Mundruczo, but you failed. Live with it. Even if you're probably not interested in my or other people scare your "kid."
