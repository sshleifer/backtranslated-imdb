yeah..this is what the disclaimer of the station says after the commercials for this show: "Some scenes can be annoying for some viewers." The reaffirmation of this overall portrayal of ego framing and chauvinism lies in the fact that it lies on the COMEDY channel. Yes ... a comedy that is true and true. A JOKE. To see how these "Playas" go through their rigid charade really clarifies what is wrong with society. Especially the meat market bar scene. Both sides, the male and the female, are equally weak and desperate to mingle in this superficial atmosphere. The club is obviously one of those plastic coke scenes sponsored by Cigarette Corporation. These people have a choice and that makes it even more fun. <br /> <br /> These slicks are trying too hard. They glitter with their own groove fat. No problem. It's a lesson on videotape for the new generation NOT to focus on a potential heart's interest. Hopefully, this facade will crumble along with the Bush / Harper administrations. The problem is, who is lined up after fading these characters? The bastard children who stand one night?
