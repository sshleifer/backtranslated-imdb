This fourth movie in the "Angel Guts" saga, which lasts only a few minutes over an hour (it just feels much longer), is also the shortest, which may be as good as the most indissoluble in the series. Nami, a department store merchant, is interested in another part-time job. Her colleague in the department store introduces her to modeling for a porn magazine called "red porno". When her other employers learned of her naughty pictures, they decide to fire her. And she gets an unwanted admirer. Oh yes, and she loves to masturbate ..ALOT. Use of various household items. The wall-of-wall sexcapes hide a lack of recognizable conspiracy and push it too much into the exploitation area. Not surprisingly, though Toshiharu Ikeda ("Evil Dead Trap", "Beautiful Prey") is the director of this movie. Maybe his sensitivities were simply not suitable for a Angel Guts movie. <br /> <br /> My Note: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Comment by Jasper Sharp; Bio / filmographies; a 36-minute interview with Toshiharu Ikeda; Original sleeve art; and trailers for this and 4 other Angel Guts films (High School Co Ed, Red Classroom, Red Vertigo & Red Porno) are all available in Artsmagik's boxing set, but for some reason there is the 6th movie "Angel Guts: Red Flash "not in the set
