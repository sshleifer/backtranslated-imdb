This is a terrible movie. Angie Dickenson is a classic and always doing well, but she does not get many roles anymore and she needs some money to make this film. By the way, she is on the screen for less than 10 minutes. Oooh, wait, there is a redeeming feature in this movie: Meg Foster has a small role in this movie. Well, Meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not great, but she has the scariest eyes of actresses I've ever seen. You probably do not know them by name, but a look at their eyes and you will recognize them. In summary: Acting is terrible, the story is bad and even the filmography is terrible. A screen that turns black every time the director wants to change scenes is pretty feeble-minded. Look at anything but that, even Mr. Ed repeats!
