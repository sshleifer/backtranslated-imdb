This movie comes from a long running ITV sitcom of the same name. The sitcom lasted about half a decade and brought Rigsby, Phillip, Alan, Mrs. Jones & Vienna on our screens. Then in 1980 movie version came to the cinemas. Unfortunately, Richard Beckinsale died and was replaced by Just when I laugh at actor Chris Strauli. I preferred it if it was not filmed because Richard was a key figure. It would be like having the Breifilm without Godber or Mackay! Vu! Many parts were previously seen in the TV series. Well, if you had seen the movie first and not the series, you would have a different feeling than the serial fan! <br /> <br /> If one says that Leonard is definitely in top form and makes the film, just like on television series. The film was recently reissued on DVD and is usually seen on a quiet weekend on Terrestrial. It's a good movie, but for Rigsby fans you might feel like you've seen it before. > <br /> This is indeed a buy / worth watching <br /> <br /> 7.8 / 10
