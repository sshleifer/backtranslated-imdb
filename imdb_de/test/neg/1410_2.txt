I was somehow looking forward to the man of the year, a couple of girls at my work said it was a pretty good movie, and my mother said she liked it, so I waited for the rental and saw it last night. I must honestly say that this movie was a big disappointment. I barely made it, because to be honest, the beginning was pretty good and very good, but then it got too dark and not in the movie I saw from the trailer. It looked like a good comedy, then it became a very dark drama that was not even that interesting, considering how many of these types of stories we had about the conspiracy of governments. <br /> <br /> Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a top-notch show and has an act where many people want him to meddle with politics just because he has the impression he is should improve. He does so, he is running for the presidency, but many people doubt that he can win because he is a comedian, but he wins! But Elenore Green, who makes sure all votes are taken, tries to fix a computer error, but when the government tells her not to fix it, they try to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> The acting was ok, the direction was OK, it was just the story that I did not think worked. As I said, it's been a dramatic shift in genre, because if you watch the trailer, you'd think it was a comedy, and when you start to see it, you get it, but then it becomes one very dark and a bit scary drama. I would not really recommend this movie, it was one of the biggest disappointments I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> 2/10
