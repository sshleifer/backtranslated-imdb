Good actor, good director, good actor, good director, but ... where is the movie? Did you have a script or did you improvise everything? At least it is a short film (only 80 minutes including credits). Nothing seems to happen in this movie, nothing at all. A few small drug dealers have run out of time, but you never get a clue what's going on or what they're talking about in some of the movie's sequences. Tons of "f *** s" and "motherf ***** s", but nothing else ... <br /> <br /> For the people who love Abel Ferrara's films like The Funeral. Christmas will be a big disappointment as it has been for me. What was he thinking about? Did he really think that this is a good movie? And if not, why did he do it?
