I usually search for good movies, even after the bad ones. Unfortunately, this movie is one in which I miserably fail - and the fact that there is hardly a positive review on this board shows that many IMDb reviewers share my pain /> I usually do not watch sequels, but I had to I can only see that because I love "Rosemary's Baby" so much. What was that mistake. It just reinforces my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy - though fortunately few are so bad. In my opinion, this is not really a sequel, it's a satire about how bad a sequel can be. Film highly recommended for non-viewing at any time.
