As a big fan of most modern fantasy movies, I was really looking forward to it. I was not familiar with the character, although after hearing some general stories about the style of the comic and the good reviews of the movie, I thought I was in real enjoyment ... <br /> <br /> From The moment the main character began to speak with his forced, hoarse voice, I could tell right away that I would not enjoy this movie. I found the story weak and predictable, the acting bad, the impact was very good for a movie on a budget, but did nothing for the overall presentation. <br /> <br /> As a fan of comics, you might have a little more, otherwise I'd suggest you skip it and do not waste your visit on this boring adventure.
