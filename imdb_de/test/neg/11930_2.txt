In the animated series: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel who was completely detached from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, funny, corrosive, self-assured, sarcastic, deadly, untamable, suddenly ambiguous. The original aeon had layers on depth. She almost never let go of her personal feelings. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought-provoking. You could never say what Aone's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist, while Trevor was a radical idealist, so they could never have a stable relationship. <br /> <br /> In the movie: Aeon Flux works for The Monicans and their political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was pretty, affectionate, vulnerable, easy to tame, emotional and very predictable. The aeon in the film had at most one deep layer. The plot was obvious and invented. Everything is designed for you right from the start. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophy. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides. <br /> <br /> The movie was a terrible disappointment to me. I felt cheated. They embraced the idea of ​​one of my most beloved cartoon characters of all time, expressing their depth and personality and pumping them full of Hollywood clichés. The essence of the cartoon was lost in this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give this movie a "1" is because the visuals were incredible. It was nice to see some of the well-known animated scenes, like the CGI fly in the eyes.
