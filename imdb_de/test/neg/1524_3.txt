I loved all the other Don Knotts movies, but I've never heard much about How To Frame A Fe. Now I know why: I can not imagine anyone who thinks it is pleasant. This film seems to appeal to 9- or 10-year-olds, but even most of them would be keeping their fingers crossed. At best, there are short moments of mild amusement, mostly by Don Knotts, who plays the same nervous, underground personality that made him famous. After the movie was finally over, I was curious if my teen could understand the film's deadly mistake. We were in complete agreement: the Prentiss Gates Sidekick character was even stupider than the Don Knott character. <br /> <br /> Be happy to see the films of Mr. Limpet, Reluctant Astronaut, Shakiest Gun and Mr. Chicken.
