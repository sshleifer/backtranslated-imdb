I loved the first grudge, I saw it in an empty theater and, quite frankly, I was freaking out. Never before had I heard the unique sound of cooling sounds, it was really captivating. <br /> <br /> However, the Grudge 2 had a few good jumps, but the story was really messy and not believable. and everywhere, with a few scenes (like a woman urinating out of fear or another from a young woman drinking a jug of milk and then vomiting everything again), which really did not make sense and did not help, the creep factor of To improve movies. During these scenes and in some other scenes, people from the sold-out crowd actually laughed loudly. That was a good indicator to show that this film had no thrills, chills or goose bumps. The acting was decent, the emotions depicted were credible, so apologetic to the actors, but the crowded plot and its lack of direction was something that I could not shake off throughout the movie. I was more annoyed than anything else, the same old reluctant choking noises, a few unexpected scenes that made me jump, but overall I was very disappointed.
