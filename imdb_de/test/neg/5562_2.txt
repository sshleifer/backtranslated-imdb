Yes, absolutely terrible, and that comes from someone who loves bad movies - but there is a limit. I like all kinds of horror / suspense movies and have seen wonderful works by European filmmakers. Unfortunately, Broceliande is not one of the wonderful films. The camera work is worse than amateur. Not the fashionable, shaky cameraman from MTV "Cameraman needs Ritalin", with which so many filmmakers disguise their lack of talent. This is just a bad picture composition and a horrible picture composition. The spectacle is a farce if it is not completely two-dimensional. The dialogues are stilted and unnatural - even more so than your usual horror / suspense movie, which deals with pseudo-mysticism. I think what scared me the most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film. These were bad to the point that they were ridiculous. I've seen what a small budget can do and it can work wonders. That was just bad filmmaking. Very very sad.
