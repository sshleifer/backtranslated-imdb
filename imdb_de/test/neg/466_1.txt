I had high hopes to see this because I always appreciate Paul Bettany's ideas. I thought he was very good as Darwin, and did his best, considering he was dealing with this horrible material. <br /> <br /> Darwin's book "About the Origin of Species" was one of the most groundbreaking, controversial and innovative publications ever, but you would never think it's based on this boring movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. Darwin's five-year voyage on The Beagle to the Galapagos Islands has virtually nothing, which is certainly of paramount importance to the story as he began to formulate his theory of evolution through his wildlife research. <This is just a long, dreary, domestic drama, with Darwin as an eccentric eccentric who sees visions of his dead daughter everywhere and gets a cold shoulder from his emotionally clogged wife. Jennifer Connelly's portrayal of Emma Darwin is downright horrible and has little relation to historical descriptions of real Emma. There might have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on Earth, either by Emma or the local priest, as played by Jeremy Northam (a winking part that is a complete waste of a talented actor) as a counterbalance to Darwin's Views, but it was not taken up. <br /> <br /> The story was too focused on the endless mawkish sense of Darwin's mourning for his daughter Annie, and too much time was wasted in Darwin, wondering if he should write his book or not. At some point I was so bored that I found it hard to be interested. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was like making a movie about Picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him, arguing with his girlfriend and not to mention he's one Artist is.
