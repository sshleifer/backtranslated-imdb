I tried to like this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as "Big Brain on" Brad in Pulp Fiction. But the characters just did not matter to me. Kevin Spacey is a sting through the movie and has even figured out some awful things that have happened to him. Especially the end - that made me hate him even more. It was like watching a bad car wreck. Spacey played a Stecher well (he does well), but otherwise I do not recommend it.
