This is a rip off of already crappy Hollywood movies like Scream and I Know What You Last Last Summer. The story is classic, some high school students try the asthmatic trick of the class, but things go wrong. Terribly Wrong When you watch the movie, you know what's going to happen before it happens all the time. Not good when a movie gets scary. The actors are pretty ok and the girls are cute (after all they are Asian), so I give two out of five on the mojave'o'meter.
