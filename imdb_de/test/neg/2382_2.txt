Pooh. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. None of the characters are likeable from afar, which makes it difficult to watch this movie. They are all unhappy thirty-year-olds who take no responsibility for their miserable life. I could only go through half an hour of the movie, so there's a chance things will get better after that, but I doubt it. I can not imagine five people feeling so selfish as they would be able to be friends for ten years. Three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing as they had no relevance to the plot, and it was clearly a hopeless (failed) attempt to give some life to this otherwise boring movie. <br /> <br /> Save time and money and skip this movie.
