Sometimes intentionally campy, sometimes unintentionally stupid (as in the opening scene, where a woman is "informed" that she was raped and her family was slaughtered for presentation purposes only), this film is ultimately not funny enough or competent enough (as uncomplicated adventure story) to really have fun. I leave you to decide which of the highlights might be, but the low is probably the fight with a stupid metallic dragon. Brigitte Nielsen was a great choice for Sonja (with her fresh face and firm, slightly muscular body) (and I think her dark red hair suits her perfectly), but Schwarzenegger gives one of his few colorless appearances as Calidor.
