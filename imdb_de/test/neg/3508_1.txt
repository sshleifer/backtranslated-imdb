The slogan of the film is "You think you know who you are, you have no idea." I reject both the suggested idea that I have no idea who I am and the conclusion that this film tells me who the people really are. If people really are like that in real life, we're shitty. <br /> <br /> A movie I went in late and left prematurely. A movie whose goal it is to become The Race Movie of All Time is so strong that it loses the tools a movie needs to use. <br /> <br /> The rules of Hollywood are: If you show something In the first half it has to be used in the second half. So the gun the daughter is worried about buying her father will somehow go down in history in the second half. The rules of Hollywood are to make the dialogue "real" - a concept that changes every decade. Is this "real dialogue" any less ridiculous than the "real dialogue" of Kevin Smith ten years ago? The rules of Hollywood indicate that we are setting the scene, and as the action picks up, the camera moves closer to the faces - in this movie, above all, so that we can see the supposed shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings are rising, the frame rate is slowing, and our heart is about to break. <br /> <br /> This film is as blatantly manipulative as it is dull. I have my own biases against L.A., which I have to admit. To combat this prejudice, I do not want to say that this is a natural situation that depends on the location, but probably the author and the director. The writer Paul Haggis showed in his Million Dollar Baby a sense of polemic about humanity that at least had a director who knew how to make the film's vision produce the best ideas of a screenplay. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands on the camera, it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write a true, natural human drama, he also does not know how to photograph or control it. Paul Haggis comes from the land of television. Let us not forget: the land of diminished expectations. <br /> <br /> Everything is as obvious as a TV movie that is only presented to simple minds - Haggis drifts past us and over and over again, that people on the surface are terrible, hidden secret pain. This is a nice idea, but so lightly presented that the whole juxtaposition of bad / good has an amateurish feel. Structurally, the film is broken in the tradition of Magnolia and other earlier films. The cut is as typical and conventionally "cinematic" as it could be. When dramatic movements such as opening a door or passing car between subject and camera arise, the editors use this extreme movement to achieve the cut that takes place there, a kinetic quality. The problem is that besides the desire to keep things moving, there is very little intelligence and ulterior motive behind the cuts - everything is kept in the books. Not only are the dolls of this vile breed doll and judys inappropriately handled, but even the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence. <br /> <br /> The film is desperately trying to present reality, but there is no talent. Some of the actors are good, some of the actors are bad, and the overall performance is squeezed by the film's low, low aesthetics. We have cinematography that is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what's going on. Cinematography, however, is not just inconspicuous, but also thoughtless camera work and framing that believes it is actually inspired. The result is little stylistic flourishes that are recognizable, but add nothing to the drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - when a father holds his dying child in his hand (the father could also be shot, I was not going to find out), the camera sees his face and gives us the famous Vertigo track / Zoom. The Schwindelschuss !!! At that point the movie became hysterical and I just had to go. I had to go because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a crowded theater and wanted to tell the audience that I was fed up with Hollywood's empty art that is full of sound and anger and meaning nothing (in the bard's own words). I hate to waste such good Shakespearean references for something so remarkable.
