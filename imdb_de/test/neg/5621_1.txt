If you look at the documentary in addition, you will find that the director is completely inexperienced and actually was a staff member of Quentin Tarantinos in a video library. Put two and two together and you realize that Quentin is doing his old bud a favor, even though the bud is rather talentless. Was that hard? Watch this movie and you will find that this is not the case. Too slow in the beginning, too nonsensical in the middle and too slow to finish. That roughly sums it up. Eric Stolz & Delpy were the only ones showing some charisma. And Kemp has actually performed well. But the rest was really bad. An example of the stupidity of the conspiracy was when Lead Robber accidentally removed his mask during the robbery. So what happens? Well, the other robbers decide that they could also remove theirs! What a great thinking. The violence was relentless and crazy. But not "cool". Rather like a farce. I wondered if this should be a comedy. More fool Tarantino for his good name associated with this garbage. More deceives me because I saw it.
