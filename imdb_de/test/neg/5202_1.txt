This is a terrible movie from almost every perspective. Since much has already been mentioned in the previous reviews, I would like to concentrate on "Serbs" and "Delta Force" in this film. <br /> <br /> 1) The uniforms that wear "Serbs" are not Serbian. And helmets are wrong too. <br /> <br /> 2) The actors who play "Serbs" do not speak Serbian, not even a language close to Serbian, as opposed to "Behind the Enemies", where the Czech actors did best to speak the language and give the film a bit of credibility. <br /> <br /> 3) The gray-haired "Serbian General" looks and acts like an idiot and fires his gun whenever US soldiers call him Name: <br /> <br /> - US Soldier: " Gravic! Give up! " <br /> <br /> - Grizzly General: (fires his AK47) <br /> <br /> - US Soldier: "Gravic! Come out!" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (fires his AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! you're surrounded" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (fires his AK47 off) <br /> <br /> - Prop guy: "Excuse me, Mr. Gray-bearded, crazy general, look, we're empty and I'm sending the boy to buy more, but he's not back yet .. . "<br /> <br /> - GBMG: (click) <br /> <br /> 4) Since when does the army of the Delta Force issue AK47s? I think they could not find enough M4s in Bulgaria, but there were a lot of old AK47s and practice holes;) Maybe they should have afforded a few airsoft's, they are cheaper and would not have hurt the credibility of the movie anyway. .. <br /> <br /> 5) In the scene where a DF officer hangs on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he keeps his finger on the trigger. That would not do a sensible person with weapons training or simple common sense. I suspect the actor found that the longer he holds the weapon, the more his coolness level increases. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to common sense.
