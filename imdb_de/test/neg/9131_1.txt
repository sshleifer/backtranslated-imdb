There seems to be a spectrum of cinema. On the left side are films that were created mainly for entertainment and / or commercial purposes. In the middle there are films that are both entertaining and artistic. On the right side are films that are not so commercial, but are more focused on cinema as art than cinema as a product. I'm not here to say that part of the spectrum is better than any other, but when a movie goes too far, it's rarely good. This is the case with Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what to expect when I applied it. A few friends went and asked if I wanted to come. None of us knew what to expect and in the end none of us was satisfied. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are stunning pictures. Yes, I'm amazed at how long the filmmakers have been searching for archive material. Yes, the soundtrack is pleasant to hear and probably the best part of the experience. The thing is, that goes so far to the right side of the spectrum that I've mentioned that I can not say anything good about the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> It's preaching. It's a mess of symbolism and obvious morality. It does not say anything new and forces the viewer to examine life in a new way. It only tells us things we already know (that is, whether we can even figure out what it says). <br /> <br /> This movie is just art for the arts. An attempt to say, "Look how deep and thoughtful we can be through montages!" When a movie looks more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than about its subject matter, it is no longer a movie and simply becomes celluloid masturbation.
