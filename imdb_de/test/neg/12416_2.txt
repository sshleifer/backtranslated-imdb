Probably the greatest thing about Wild Rebels is that it hurts the most, the hero. He wrote LOSER over himself, but that does not stop him from "getting the girl." Probably one of the worst racers in the world he can imagine, he decides to end his race after an accident. Well, his new job is still in racing as a number of biker types choose him to drive their getaway car while committing crimes. There is nothing that you really would love to Rod, even the situation in which he was thrown is quite stupid. At the end of the lighthouse scene you wish Rod is killed with all bikers. Get the following: He is shot twice, once in the arm and once in the leg, and he still manages to crawl up the stairs a little bit. If only Jeeter has a better goal ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this goal, unless you see the MST3K version.
