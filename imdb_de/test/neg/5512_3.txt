This film is a desperate attempt to participate in the Rocks of the success of Star Wars movies. The film uses recycled material from "Battle Beyond the Sars", another Roger Corman sci-fi Turd device, but at least this one is better than "Battle Beyond the Stars" - in this movie there is no real show (but it is a Roger Corman.) movie-what did you expect) Again, the entire soundtrack was recorded on a keyboard / synthesizer, the sound effects are recycled by "Battlestar Galactica" - there are no special effects, as it is recycled / rearranged space scenes from one costumes look like something out of the 1981 Rescue Army. - ironicaly, the little boy in this movie gives a hell of a performance, and he would reappear to play "Over the Top" in Sylvester Stallone's movie - I give this movie 3 out of 10 stars
