Well, in the beginning I'm as black as I can get, and I can tell you that it's very sad when black people think that a "black movie" is shit. I can not say that I've ever seen a movie that was filmed so badly or a worse story. Snoop is my buddy and everything, but he did not feel this movie at all, I do not know. I know how much they've paid to be in that bucketful of crap called a movie, but I hope so is enough to rinse off the smell bad, really very bad. It has blown Chucks in every way, no real plot, no story, the cast could not work and the best was the whiteness! <br /> <br /> I almost demanded a refund on my way out the door of the theater, half of the spectators and even before it was over, I still wished I had done so. Save yourself some pain and see something else, everything else ...
