Okay, first I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I missed the credits and the stuff. SO, when I finally made it, I was like, "Who the hell is this guy?". I found out that it was like hours after watching the movie Flex. <br /> <br /> Flex did not look like Michael Jackson. Not a little. He could not dance like he did or move like him, the only thing he almost had was the voice. People have commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I can not really comment on that because I do not know much about them. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was like crazy. The dialogue was shitty. Cinematography - if you can call that sucked. The soundtrack was shit. The acting was shit. Yes, Flex too ... I'm so mad about it. I did not want it to suck. I'm so sad that Flex has been told he can get away with it. But the whole thing looked like dressing up. You know? It looks like no one else but Joseph Jackson looked like they should have. <br /> <br /> The concert sequences are just shitty. I'm sorry, but Flex just can not dance like Michael. I mean, how the hell did VH1 think? The make-up was not as good as the time of everything Michael went through. For example, he was still dark in the movie when Neverland was attacked for the first time. In real life, MJ was as white as hell. There was a kind of stupid delay in his skin discoloration. <br /> <br /> The movie was not boring, it was not good for me. It was really nothing. I was just so excited about everything wrong with that. I wanted to see how it turned out and if Flex could redeem itself. He really did not do it. The only part that I found more interesting was the whole thing of Lisa Marie. If they fell in love. That was great. But I had to turn my face away when they kissed. Heh. And only two parts made me collapse with laughter. The first time she cut Michael short-haired, you know, from the thriller era, to Michael with long flowing hair from the Dangerous era. That was funny. The second time I laughed was when they showed all of Michael's posters and memorabilia, but instead they had Flex's face! It was so funny. Overall, this movie was cheaper garbage. It was only two hours dressing up and could have been so much better. But no, VH1 is cheap. Take care if you want. But this movie is not funny, considering how ridiculous it is. I came out angry. And when I found out that it was Flex, I felt so bad. So ... watch out if you want.
