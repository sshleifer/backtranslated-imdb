The crucial scene for this movie is when the fat guy stops, but the evil doctor just gives him one more job, check out the dinosaurs. Remember that he no longer has this job and is therefore not paid for it. So remember, it's a goddamn dinosaur and the doctor he's supposed to trust is evil and does not like him. But he is still like, okay. This has just defined the stupidity in this film I can ride between the two on mountain bikes, but apart from that, the people in Paraguay are very nice. Eric Roberts gives his absolutely worst performance. It's not an adjective to describe how boring he is In the meantime. Corbin Bernsen is rescuing what to save and you're starting to root for him, but of course you have to stick to the formula. And I wonder how much annoys your life if you play like this, one of the army forces here? How deep can your acting career go? The special effects are so embarraous You expect a sign saying "Studio 3" to get into the frame. It's not even honest mush, it's all from "Carnosaur", which was even sucked by itself. And then I wonder why someone just made a movie.
