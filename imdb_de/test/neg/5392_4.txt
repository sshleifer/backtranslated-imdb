Dear sci-fi channel: how were you? How was your summer? I was fine, but I feel that our relationship is not the same anymore, and we are growing apart. I do not understand why you no longer love me. I just watched your sci-fi channel "Skeleton Man" and once again showed my respect for my feelings by turning off every hot girl in this movie !!! I mean, I understand that you are here only for instant gratification. All you care about is producing a movie in which people are cut by a Native American spirit, a creature, a legend, or whatever. So you really do not have time to worry about something else and to care about something else - for example, find a costume for Skeleton Man that does not make him like the gay lover of Skeletor of "He-Man". Seriously, his robe looks like a quilted blanket and his skull is as smooth as a baby back. He almost looks like a killer Halloween costume for 6-year-olds as he marches on a murderous battle through the wilderness. That's why we throw a punch on you because we're not looking for Oscar-winning performances, interesting plans, or realistic character responses to each situation. Because we recognize that Michael Rooker, Caspar van Diem, and all girls are trained Special Ops agents, they are all mysteriously turned into Keystone Kops who can not always shoot or see whenever Skeleton Man appears. And we also expect that nothing - bullets, explosions, electric shock, nothing - can kill the Skeleton Man until a minute is left in the film and we have to find a way to get things together neatly. We expect blood and guts. But you have a talent for taking the least attractive actress in the entire cast and making her the only woman who survives. And honestly, I think you just do it to attack me. Because this movie, stupid as it is, has the potential to be a classic that is so bad that it simply destroys all the hotties, it ruins everything - and forces me to lower its rating. All I ask is that once, just once, consider my feelings and let the sexiest girls survive the movie. You're welcome.
