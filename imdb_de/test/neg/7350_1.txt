Free Willzyx (the dumbest name / title ever) is the worst episode of ALL TV shows I watch. These include X-Files, Alias, All 3 Law And Orders, All CSIs, Family Guy, Simpsons, Chappelles Show, Colbert Report and more. South Park has been my favorite comedy show for a long time because of its shockingly obscene content and disturbing black comedy. Willzyk does NOT have the content I mentioned earlier. It was so tame, so unofficial, that it was probably an episode of Sesame Street. Kyle goes to Sea World, where a few workers play a joke and make him believe that a whale is talking to him. HE WILL REFRESH THE WHALE, BEFRIENDS IT. Hello? This is South Park! the same show that brought you "Canceled", "Chickenlover", "It Hits The Fan", "Death Camp Of Tolerance" and so many more! Not SpongeBob Squarepants! Pooh. I actually watched the whole episode. That's 30 minutes of my life, I'll never come back. Anyway, I was extremely disgusted with this episode and I can not believe the shocking quality loss of Matt & Trey's work.
