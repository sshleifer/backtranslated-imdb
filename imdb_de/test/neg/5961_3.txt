The back of my DVD describes the plot of "El Chucabra": After his capture in the wilderness, the legendary bloodthirsty creature Chupacabra flees into the city creating chaos and panic. As they pursue the deadly animal, an animal control officer and scientist Starlina Davide realizes that a Vigilante, with his own suspicious plan, is also pursuing the elusive killer for a mysterious research facility run by the diabolic Dr. Goodspeed is operated. This rotten horror movie is a bit amusing when viewed under the influence of alcohol. The script is completely stupid, the acting is unimaginable of wood and the direction is amateurish. Two rubber Chupacabra suits are simply the best thing about this movie.3 out of 10 and that's extremely nice.
