I will not even comment on what garbage this movie is, since it is already established. When we saw this with my friends, we all laughed loudly as the head girl made a reference from Shelley Hack while phoning. We sat there and tried to figure out why the writer would throw them in the mix. We can only assume that he suddenly had a fix from Charlie's Angels. Based on that reference, we assumed that this movie was filmed in 1979 or 1980 for their Charlie's Angels run, but from what I read here, it was made around 1987. It looks like it was made by a college student for a movie class. And though I would not expect a cheap garbage festival like this to be politically correct, the rednecks in this movie certainly direct derogatory gay comments to each other. Nevertheless, I would call this only the second worst horror movie ever made, just behind "Nail Gun Massacre".
