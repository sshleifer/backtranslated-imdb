That was on TV last night. I pushed through painfully and barely managed. Above all, except Leroy, Hilary and possibly Coco, NOT the other students we should be interested in have a recognizable talent. It's as if HSPA has no standards, just sign the dotted line and you're there. <br /> <br /> The storylines were grating and obvious. Doris was just incredibly awful. The gay guy was such a discarded stereotype (weird how this school had only a gay guy, right ...) I liked the leroy character, but if you call your teacher an obscenity and then vandalize the school, Leroy would have the packing cleverly. Lisa looks like she would rather be somewhere else, and since she was not a talent, I wonder why they kept her. <br /> <br /> I would have rated this star (terrible), but the music was not so bad, and I liked the premise. It would have worked a lot better if the students had been attractive and actually had talent.
