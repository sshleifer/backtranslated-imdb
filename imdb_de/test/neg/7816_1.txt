This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is so much in the house that something goes wrong, that would not happen, it's not even funny. Granted, this is a movie that means that things happen that will not happen in normal life. However, this film is far-fetched than theories that no abandoned child works. All these people are in the house and no one has noticed another, not to mention the damn owl that seems to be everywhere except in their cage. I could handle an owl joke the first few times, but after an hour I can not stand it, I'd rather kill myself than see that damned owl again. Did I laugh during this movie? No. Not once? No. Terrible, terrible, terrible. The fact that this pile of rubbish is covered and Ashton Kutcher bows his boss and takes off his pants in front of everyone makes this movie even worse. But wait, the day is saved because the damn owl can fly. WOW GREAT! However, I give this film some recognition, it is not as bad as Epic Movie .....
