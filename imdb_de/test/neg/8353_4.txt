If I had never seen an episode of the original Avengers with Blackman, Rigg or Thorson, I would have appreciated this series more. While the performers did their best to maintain the action and interest of the scripts, I was just caught comparing the episodes with the original series. Steed was expected to be more involved in battle scenes, and the continuity seemed like the writers had difficulty keeping up with the actors. To be honest, I can not blame them for trying to revive the fans from the original series, but it just did not work. Watching Steed's work in this series reminded me of General Macarthur when he said, "Old soldiers never die, they just fade!"
