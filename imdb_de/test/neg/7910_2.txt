After a humiliating plane experience, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sues the airline and uses the money it earns to set up its own full-service airline. Its difference is that there are sexy stewardesses, an on-board dance club and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit. Soul Plane is a very racist comedy, unless it is only occasionally funny. Soul Plane was described as an "urban" version of Airplane. The problem is that Soul Plane does not nearly reach the laugh of the plane. The jokes in Soul Pane are too offensive and mostly unoriginal. I would be lying if I said I did not laugh as there were some funny moments. However, I expected more and left the theater disappointed. <br /> <br /> I would compare Soul Plane with Airplane 2. The latter was just a repeat of the first film, while the former was just a repetition of outdated, rude jokes. There is really no creativity behind the film, and there are few funny spots. However, I do not think that Soul Plane "bottom 100" is bad. At the moment the movie is in 82nd place and that's a bit tough. I'm not saying that this is a good movie, but it's not terrible either way. The running time is only 86 minutes, so it's not too painful. For stupid comedies you can do a lot worse. <br /> <br /> Nobody in the cast is very good, but everyone seems to have fun and that helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying as Nashawn. He had some funny lines, but he is a very poor senior man. Snoop Dogg, who was a bit weird in Starsky and Hutch, is totally bothered here. Tom Arnold was actually bearable and that was the biggest surprise of the movie. The most annoying person in the movie was Ryan Pinkston. He was not funny at all and will never be funny. The funniest performers were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best lines and made me laugh the most. In the end, Soul Plane might fit if you're looking for a stupid comedy, but it would probably be better if you just skipped the movie. Rating 4/10
