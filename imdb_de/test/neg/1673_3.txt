Like another reviewer, my wife bought this movie as part of a 20-movie family package. I think you could say that this was a decent TV movie for 1980, but it's super predictable and acting, except for Robert Conrad, is generally below average. The football scenes are nothing special and seem to serve mainly as a film filler. The movie is now very outdated, but a decent remake could probably make it a good movie. Is that really necessary? I mean, how many "underdogs" sports teams work together for the big game with the unbeaten boys movies we really need? This is probably a good movie for your younger kids if you find it in a bargain basket, but a sports fanatic will miss it.
