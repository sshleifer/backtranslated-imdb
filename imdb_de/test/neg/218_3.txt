Incredibly disappointed The pace was slow. The characters are incredible and leave me bored and unfulfilled throughout the movie. There was no real action that could make you film the movie and interest you. The robbery itself never provided any excitement and did not seem to be very good. <br /> <br /> There was not enough depth or background for each character and Laurence Fishbournes character was one I was eagerly waiting for, unfortunately, Laurance has no idea how to play the brutal breed and is favored as a sympathetic character. Columbus, one of my favorite actors (at Stamp the Yard), failed me with his performance, his character was dark and you could barely see what his argument triggered. The movie was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes). Although his character is quite small and insignificant, I think his touch contributed to a thoroughly boring movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Buy the DVD if you want to find a new way to waste your time.
