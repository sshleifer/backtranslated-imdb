Do not buy this movie for a comedy worth like me, I did not find it a bit funny, but it's so damned and miserable it's unbelievable. I gave it to a friend for Christmas, which was pretty funny (on my side). I heard recently that he saw it and told me what a hole I am! <br /> <br /> There is nothing more frustrating than watching an overexposed, extremely dramatic, poorly recorded scene in which the camera sits on a tripod and does not move ... the film work is really pathetic and I can only say they do not see this movie !!! !!!!!!!
