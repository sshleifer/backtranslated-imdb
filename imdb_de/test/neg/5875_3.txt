A conversation about how Jan-Michael Vincent is so generous has led me to stupidly visit this DTV entry in the mid-90s. A child is traumatized when he sees an Ice Cream man shot down in the 1950s and grows into a psychic Ice Cream man (Clint Howard). Something happens and people disappear and land in the ice. Bla bla bla. <br /> <br /> Director Norman Apstein (called Paul Norman) made a career in the porn section of this profession and went straight back afterward. That's what you get for all murders off screen. And thrown as a skinny kid as a skinny kid and made him wear a thick suit. Just throw a fat kid! There is also a scene in which Vincent reacts stoically to a group of escaped loons who surround him. He was either totally drunk and was worried about his life or the filmmakers took his "Did I really sink so low?" pity on. Although these are low-budget trash, these were some of the good names, including David Naughton, Olivia Hussey, David Warner, and Doug Llewelyn of THE PEOPLE COURT. How to make a boring slasher with this cast is a mystery to me.
