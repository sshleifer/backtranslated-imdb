I admire the secret admiration of Love Thy Neighbor's original TV series - mostly because they have the exuberant power and bad taste of so many programs of their time - but I would be through my teeth (very uncomfortable Position). If I pretend that this radiance on a big screen is anything but an abomination. The opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only meaningless, they're also confusing - it's never been explained why the film begins with a tracking shot of people throwing each other away - and nothing improves from then on. When the film discovers the oldest joke in the book - the terrible dragon of a mother-in-law appears unexpectedly - to stay - the abruptly obvious revelation that she is developing a weakness for the black neighbor's father and she moves the most bigoted son into more and more self-righteous depths Ignorant anger will have turned off most demanding viewers. Take this as a warning, unless you are interested in cheap offshoots with horrible spectacles, static orientation, and all the comic flair of a burning orphanage.
