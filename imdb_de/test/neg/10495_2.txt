I rate this movie Vampire Assassin's "2" mainly because he had neither sex nor nudity. Besides, I'm not sure why it was ever made. It was more of a training on how to make a movie on a very limited budget. The characters Derek and Slovak were the best actors. The "biker dude" with the pleather pants and the silver belt followed closely. He was fine too. The film was mostly shot in a distribution warehouse. If you're tired of watching the Kung Fu Kickboxing Stunts, you can try the packages with Scott Handkerchiefs, Windex, and other cleaning products. You will have plenty of time, trust me. I almost started to make a list. The dialogue and kung fu stunts were extremely slow. They talked slowly, fought slowly, etc. I do not know why. At least with the particularly slow delivery of the actor lines you could hear everything very clearly. I try to find good stuff for this movie. We saw it to the end to see if it got any better, but it did not work. We could never decide if the actors really knew the martial arts or acted just as they knew the martial arts. You can observe and decide yourself. My favorite line was something like (vampire speaks :) "What are you looking at?" Another man replies, "Your bad teeth work."
