OK, here's the short film ... this movie is full of cheesy dialogues, exaggerated acting and a worn screenplay. <br /> <br /> There are moments that are supposed to be very dramatic, but just funny because of the exaggerated and poorly written lines. I could not help but laugh at moments that should be very serious. The bright spot in this movie is the circus. To see the circus in its heyday was certainly a pleasure. <br /> <br /> There are moments that turn out to be good. But then it's off to the B-movie area again. I was tempted several times to stop looking at it. <br /> <br /> But I do not know how it got the best picture. It must have been a slow year!
