Greetings from Lithuania. <br /> <br /> This is the first question that arises after watching this "movie". <br /> <br /> You know, I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but after looking at them I only had two questions: 1) Is this just a parody? br /> 2) How can people do this? <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this "movie," you REALLY do not know what a really bad movie is. I mean bad The script - are you kidding? Acting is so horrible that I do "the actors" where it just has fun in this movie. I know that's "B" movie, but come on ?? Does that have to be a reason to be such a garbage? <br /> <br /> Oh! And what an end !!! One has to miss the end! Just when you think that this is the worst thing you've ever seen, wait until the end - because you've never seen THAT kind of end (and I hope you'll never see it). <br /> <br /> Thwarted this "movie" at all costs, and do not say I did not warn you ...
