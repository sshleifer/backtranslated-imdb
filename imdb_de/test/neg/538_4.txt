It's perfectly okay for people to die in an animation, but there are just too many deaths in this animation. Start from the beginning, it's about fighting, fighting, death and revenge. It always takes an hour and a half. It was interesting at the beginning, but I got very tired before the show was halfway over. Unlike other animations, this is a lack of humor. There are not many interactions between the characters. The good thing is that the sword fighting scene looks pretty good and the characters look good.
