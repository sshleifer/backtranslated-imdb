This is a fun movie. I suggest that you rent it, buy a few liters of rum and invite the entire crew to join you. My favorite parts were. the shootings were so well choreographed that John Woo himself was jealous, .2. The wonderful special effects .3. Oscar winning actor and .4. The fact that every single gangsta in the movie seemed a bad "scar face". I mean, Master P as a Cuban godfather! This is a groundbreaking area. And with well written dialogues like "the only difference between you and me, Rico, I live and your dead", this movie is truly a masterpiece. Yes exactly.
