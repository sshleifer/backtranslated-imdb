If you want to pursue a sad, lonely and listless hack comedian trying to keep the masses pale and half-hour tired of social distractions that your backstage cousin commented on the Thanksgiving dinner table, this could be the show for you , This is a weird comedy, my friends, but honestly, Tim Allen looks like Richard Pryor.
