Sure, most of the slasher movies of the 1980s were not worth the celluloid they were shot on, but this video nightmare might be the most boring movie. <Br /> <br /> Six horny smoking students opt for camping. Of course, <br /> <br /> and you know that already, they are gradually being killed by a <br /> <br /> unknown stranger. The highlight is a forest guard who tries to get to the adolescents in time before the last sweet girl buzzards. <br /> <br /> bait. John Carl Buechler, my least beloved B-movie guy, made the lousy <br /> <br /> make-up effects here. The cast includes Carel Struycken, The <br /> <br /> Witches of Eastwick, and The Addams Family Movies. Unfortunately, he does not appear until the end of the film and is treated in make-up, which makes him unrecognizable. Steve Bond (can anyone remember him?) Is here in an early role as a victim. <br /> <br /> Brown's direction and the script he performs as a cowrote, both smell of the <br /> <br /> brown bear in the woods. He fills the movie with so much wildlife footage that I thought I had accidentally rented a special episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Much of the <br /> occupation is sitting around the campfire and eating, then walk and sit again and sit <br /> <br />. The Ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever played in a Slasher movie: He tells a joke about a wide-mouthed frog to a baby stag. Jackie Coogan, who must have forgotten that he once worked with the legends of the silent movie, has two scenes and is involved in the second strangest scene ever put into a slasher movie: he and <br /> <br /> the big forest rangers have a talk about cucumber and <br /> <br /> cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread ... yeah. <br /> <br /> There is not a minute of tension here. The killer, a forest fire survivor looking for a companion, watches the students behind the trees. We know it's the killer because the filmmakers have dubbed it into a heartbeat sound effect that serves to wake up the viewer every few minutes. Skip this pile of pine juice and rent <br /> <br /> "Halloween" instead. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, mild gun violence, Gore, <br /> some obscenity, short female nudity, milder sexual content, sexual cues and substance abuse.
