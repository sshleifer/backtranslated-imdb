It would be a shame if Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval ever saw this film, as they are likely to be associated with it in the coming years. "Oh, yes," says the public, "Comanche Moon," this is the miniseries about the Texas Rangers and the Comanche Indians, which featured Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval.

"That would be such an injustice, since the original" Lonesome Dove "was a true Western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and Jones and Duval will be remembered.
