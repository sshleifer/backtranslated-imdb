Dark Reality is a saw-like movie that is a bit decrepit. While the storyline and the story are good, there is a bit too much unnecessary nudity. While I felt that the movie was technically good, the acting was spotty, it was just a bit too dark for my mood as I watched it. The IT basically says that there are many missing persons who are never found and may be tortured by ill whackos. I feel that some information about the kidnappers and their reasons why they were so sick would have helped some people. It was a snuff film made just for the violent content. If you want to see women beaten, tortured and killed, then this is for you. If you are looking for something literary that is more meaningful and meaningful, skip it.
