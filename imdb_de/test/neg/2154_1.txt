I'm not sure who has more fun, the people who wrote the reviews, or the director of the movie. I could not read these comments or watch this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I can see a western movie created with a lot of dedication and attention to detail, but a garage with Art Deco lettering, pastel colors, actors who seem to fall asleep because of that The screenplay is so boring and the boom is on the camera's way every two scenes, that's definitely not my definition of "one of the best western movies produced in the new millennium". <br /> <br /> Please, if any of you had friends in the movie, just say it!
