This film was a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town. I now have many friends who are guards at Dixon Correctional, and I myself spent three years working in the SuperAmerica store next to the Krogers store where the old lady was. However, this is still the stupidest film ever made and should be presented by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer, if not already done. A little Trivia, Illinois does not even have probation sentences, and Dixon Prison is a medium-security facility that houses burglars and vandals of vending machines. The classic clucking / seduction scene is perhaps the most amusing piece I've ever seen, especially with the exciting buildup
