This is the most horrific abuse of the word comedy ever seen. It's just not funny and the scriptwriters obviously just tried to use the name of the TV show to make a few pounds at the box office. This film makes a procrastination subtle as far as the sexual innuendo is concerned (no triviality), and has the charisma of a corpse with Rigamortis. I fear a complete washout !!
