The film is doing pretty well, but the acting, directing and editing leave much to be desired. The characters are largely lifted from other films and the Vinnie Jones lookalike is gone in 50 seconds from nothing. The comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have a lot of contrast, the stupid dealers in Lock Stock and the shootout, where everyone is dead. You should never really know if you should laugh or just sit in shock. This movie had the right elements, but it's too easy to sit there like a person knitting and sitting at the little details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line. Too bad, because it was a brave attempt and although Clint Eastwood is famous for being right for a scene, he puts in the work before he shoots and he is Clint Eastwood. Here a little more imagination with the camera and a little more coaching and repetition would have made a big difference to the delivery of the lines.
