It's funny how instinct warns you about something. Once, for example, Nu Image was read by Nu Company, I knew instinctively that I had seen a really shitty movie of them somewhere before, but I could not remember where. All I knew was that JUDGE and JURY would be crap and that was it. Maybe I'm psychic? <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening is quite violent. Several people are blown up for no other reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I do not know about you, but today I'm a little fed up with exploitative screen violence and poor language, especially when it's injected by such bad actors as the one in this movie. In any case, the plot revolves around the bad guy who is executed and returns to avenge the man who shot his wife. Oh, did I mention the bad guy and his wife murdered some people on the wedding night? Yes, he is a heavy coward. In fact, he is so bad (and I do not mean acting - I'll go right into it) that he can not possibly be taken seriously and this is before he is executed just to return as Elton John. Elvis, a French boss, etc. I wonder if Keith David was paid for it? Because he looks like that, he has so much fun on the screen, that's why he plays the role. What a pity that this reviewer did not enjoy watching JUDGE AND JURY at all. Hey, maybe the producers could send me Keith's fee? Gawd just knows that I deserve it. <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie as much as you did not think, and my main meat is not with the stupid plot or the cheap production values, but with its attitude to violence. If, like me, you've blown a bottle of wine over your head or kicked your ribs hard several times, you'll know that violence is an obscene, painful thing, but JUDGE AND JURY will make you believe if you're thrown through a window Throw yourself through some railings and fall to twenty meters on a table. Not only will you be uninjured, but you can also overtake some rabid devil dogs. Of course, you could say that every film starring Sly, Arnie, or Bruce suffers from the same dishonest demonstration of violence, but with JUDGE AND JURY, he tore my chain
