The reputation of this movie really surprised me. I never stopped watching a movie in its entirety because $ 3 is good money for renting a movie, and damn it, I should at least look at the whole thing and make some money. I got through about 30 minutes of this absolutely crappy movie when I thought I was a little stupider now after watching this movie. I can not believe that the director and the actors in this film actually had so little respect that this could be published! <br /> <br /> There's nothing I can say that was not said by the other reviewers, but even in the worst movies, there's usually one or two proper gigs ... not in that pathetic garbage. I have seen better spectacles in high school plays. Everyone, and I mean, every "actor" is incredibly bad, and what's really amazing is the uniformity of wickedness. Gosh, it must have been the director. Where did you get these people from? <br /> <br /> This is possibly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. Although entertaining in places because of the laughable script and even weaker acting, and I use this term very loosely, it is unfortunate that this film was not sent for all eternity in the B-movie hell. What could have been a good idea was ruined by an extremely low budget, poor sound and effects effects, and actors who have probably earned their wings on children's television, and poor children's television. <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this movie. Not even worth a minute of your time.
