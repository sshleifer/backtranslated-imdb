My friends and I hired this movie and confused it with another about skateboarding. Seeing Steve Guttenberg as an action hero is funny. The movie is so unbelievably predictable and exaggerated that it became a laughing feast. Although I gave it 1/10, this movie should be seen especially if you can see it on TV somewhere.
