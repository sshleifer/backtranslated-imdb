** Possible Spoilers ** "The Love Letter" by Dreamworks and director Peter Chan is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque seaside village in New England, where single mother Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a quaint little bookstore. One day at work, Helen passes an anonymous letter (the "love letter" of the title), which is somehow under the covers of a reading sofa. When she reads the enamored prose in it, she believes it was written to her, deliberately put on the couch to find her, and believes for her own sake that she knows the identity of her secret admirer. Unintentionally, however, Helen omits the letter where her clerk Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds him, believes it is for her, and, of course, believes she knows who wrote him. The circumstances then bring him into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks Helen wrote him the letter. And before everything is clear, you can only imagine the strange situations in which everyone involved was thrown. And I mean, imagine, because the way this movie is played, the audience gets a little more than what they bring with them. There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably: it's just not very romantic and not funny. and that's a strong combination that causes this movie to practically misfire from the opening credits. As soon as the shot and the main character (Helen) are set, basically, there's nowhere to go for the next ninety minutes. When you finally find out who actually wrote the letter and who could not care less about it. The cast is completed by Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It's a shame to see that talent is wasted by such a clap as this and looks bad in balance. Kate Capshaw, who normally only lightens the screen, looks tired, while Selleck seems to have just come from a three-day bend that lasted a week. Ellen DeGeneres actually looks pretty good. It is said that the journey is often more intoxicating than the destination. In the case of "The Love Letter", however, it would have been best for everyone involved if everyone had just stayed home. I rate this with 1/10.
