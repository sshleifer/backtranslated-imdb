Enter the Ninja (1981) was the first of Ninon's films that Cannon starred with, or with, the Japanese sensation Sho Kosugi. The star of the first "Ninja" movie, however, was the legendary, tough guy Franco Nero. Unfortunately, not even Mr. Nero or Sho Kosugi could see this movie. If you have two bad guys in an action movie and can not see it or have fun, then something is wrong. But I digress. Skip this chapter and watch the next movies in the series. They are more interesting and a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Next is Revenge of the Ninja. Instead of playing the "evil oriental" (I use this term "tongue in the cheek"). He is the star! Strange for a western movie. Instead, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for the tough Sho Kosugi fans or Cannon movie fans.
