I'm not sure why, but I saw that with a sense of expectation. Unfortunately it was out of place. First, this is not a horror, it does not scare you and (unless it was worse than I said it was - what's possible), do not try it. It's a trashy comedy and the fact that I once smiled means I gave her a 2 and not a 1. This film rips from Gremlins in a very special way. I can not say I've ever seen a movie that's more dedicated. Very, very bad - avoid it.
