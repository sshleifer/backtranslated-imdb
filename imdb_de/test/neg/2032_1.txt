This was the least interesting horror movie I've ever seen. The premise is forgotten after about 1 minute in a clear way. The spectacle is terrible. The scariest thing about this movie is when the two boys kiss, yuck! What did the judges of the film festival think when they gave this garbage a 'best movie notation'? The only reason I did not turn off this movie was to see what you should NOT do as a filmmaker, and if the paper-thin plotline could go on as it is. I was not disappointed with this latter idea. There was not even a single bit of nudity or thrill to interest the kids! I also found it sticky to use "Resident Evil 2" in the movie for about 3 minutes ... Was that actually a filler? Because it was the most beautiful and interesting part of the film.
