I do not recommend this movie. It's a movie in which a movie is made without addressing actors and actors. The sex scene at the end of the film, which explains the aversion of the actress (played in the movie) with the actor (who is being played in the movie) in it, is a dull repetition of the same scene in the Breillat movie Fat Girl. Everything was played with more delicacy, if you can combine such a sex act with delicacy. A typical French term for the thing that happens in sex is comedy: Oh la la! There is also sensitivity in Breillats Film Brief Crossing. In Sex is Comedy, I do not see any real sensitivity, and even a clear plot for the movie is not developed, so there is a rather loose story with the disillusion of the end.
