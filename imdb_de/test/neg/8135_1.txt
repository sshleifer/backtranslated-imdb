I went to Heart Of Gold and thought I would see a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a self-serving tribute to the arrogance of aging baby boomers who have lost their edge and forgotten their roots. Heart Of Gold is rated highly by older Baby Boomer critics and run and listed by more and more aging Baby Boomer artists. Neil Young and his crew have long lost their lead and want the rest of us to sit on a padded mid-range rocking chair. What happened to the slippery guitar of his previous solo effort? I suspect all his fuzz boxes were rusty and his over-powered vacuum tubes exploded in the hot air of his generation. As for Demme, is this the daring director of Something Wild & Melvin And Howard? A student filmmaker could have made a bolder movie than this poorly visualized film about surface performance. Do not waste your $$ with Heart Of Gold and go directly to The Last Waltz and Gimmie Shelter. And if you really want to dive deep into the personality of a Rock'n'Roll icon, find a copy of Chuck Berry: Hail Rock And Roll, which is unfortunately out of print. And baby boomers, do not worry about how this review gets dulled by a younger one. I'm also one of those baby boomers who listened to Cinnamon Girl for acidity and danced on the street to Stones Street Fighting Man. Go back and do not look back or Gimmie Shelter and then come back and tell me that Heart of Gold has value as a document.
