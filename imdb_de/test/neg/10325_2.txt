I give 2 - I reserve a 1 rating for Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen movies. We can not even remember what this movie was about. The only thing we can remember is a shot scene where the actors fall to the floor, roll to the other side of a hallway, or shoot like that and then again. It was like watching 80-year-olds with two broken legs trying to do the "stunts". Even though the characters drove in a truck, the engine noise disappeared (or the radio can not remember) when the actors spoke the Sandra Bullock front page. very sad, very bad.
