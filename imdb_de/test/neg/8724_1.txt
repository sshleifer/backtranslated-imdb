This is the "Battlefield Earth" of the mini series. With a few exceptions, there are all the catastrophic ingredients that have doomed this film to failure and will follow up to the grave in the turkey cemetery. Both are adaptations of books with an infinite number of pages that have been turned into a total mess by a scriptwriter and a director (in this case, they are the same person) who clearly do not know what they are doing, they have both a Messiah as a wannabe who can not really deliver as a hero (In this case, played by a man who looks like Mark Hamill, but unfortunately the power is not with him.) and a number of stupid villains who happily betray life they both contain scenes stolen from better productions, and both are cheap productions that try to look expensive with (often badly made) computer animations. The exceptions that make things even worse are the terrible work that the lighting artist has done, that does not even have the ability to turn on the light in his own living room, and the camera works without problems sometimes. "Battlefield Earth "mode is mostly flat like a pancake, the extremely cheap and too small desert set that contains only a pile of sand in front of a desert painted backdrop that gets very old very quickly because it occurs in almost every scene, and the bad one The idea of ​​the costume designer to imitate the fashion madness of the "fifth element" with the stupidest hats ever made. Stupid Moments to Remember: 1. Any scene with the guild people who look like the observers of MST3K, but with stupid hats. 2. Irulan shows up at the party in her butterfly dress (why butterflies, was he in the shiner with stuffed parrots?) With a matching stupid hat along with a few boys with stupid balloon hats. 3. Paul, the stand-up comedian. 4. Baron Harkonnen in the overdrive and yells "I'm alive". 5. Every scene with the scenery as it fits in the foreground 6. Each scene with the fake religious ceremonies of Fremen, especially the "Water of Life" ceremony. 7. The fight scenes in which the same guys are killed a few times and the same things explode over and over again. It's a lot more, but there's a limit of 1000 words, so I better stop before I get carried away.
