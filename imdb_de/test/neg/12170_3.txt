First, it's NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book, a short story, a novella, or anything else. From the EW website and its review on the show when it first aired, "he never writes down to his audience and never betrays contempt for his subjects." His first original work for television, Stephen King's Golden Years "( CBS, July 16, 9:00 pm) is no exception. "<br /> <br /> The series should (as others have already mentioned) be an ongoing series, which is why we have never seen it before the end of the cliffhanger they left us. But that was never made clear to the viewers, who wondered how it would all end. When the series appeared on videotape, it was announced as an "unprecedented end." "It should have said," The end should never be seen! "<br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> The real end was the only essential part of that Video was changed (although parts of it were left out), and that changed in the end was what destroyed the story, rather than, for example, that our two intrepid FBI agents realized they were now classified as evil guys and Fleeing from the evil Jew Anderson of The Shop (as originally aired), Jude just goes to them ... And they shoot him, Bang, dead and no real emotion in the scene, Ditto on the court with Harlan and his wife While the original end left us with a spectacular cliff hanger, they simply climb out of the Cock-a-Doodie car on the video. <br /> <br /> *** End Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> It was a sad conclusion to a pretty well done miniseries and does absolutely not worth the video to buy it or even rent it. Sincerely, save your money and your time.
