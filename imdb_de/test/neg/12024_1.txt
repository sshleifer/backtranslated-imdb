What do we say to "Dead End Road" ... <br /> <br /> Let's just say that Edgar Allen Poe was so ashamed. The acting, the writing, the effects and everything in this movie was just horrible. That does not even do it justice! This movie was the biggest piece of rubbish I ever had to sit through. That's why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the end, because I personally did not care what happened to the characters. I saw badly, but that was definitely the worst. I was hyping up for this topic because I'm a fan of Poe and that was just awful. Just bad <br /> <br /> What bothers me more is that you can not rate movies with negative numbers.
