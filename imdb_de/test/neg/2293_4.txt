A swedish splatter movie? Has the world gone insane? <br /> <br /> Probably not, but these days with Swedish gore-flicks still is not an ordinary sight the golden days of "Rymdinvasion i Lappland". And this movie seems to have some problems in itself: it's just too much talk, it's still a bit amusing, especially for the good FX, which are great for a B-movie. The script and most of the acting is still pretty bad, but that does not really matter, it's supposed to be a gusset and nothing else, it's going to go awry for some reason. There just is not enough blood to fill the void. <br /> <br /> Anyone familiar with Gert Fylking will have a good laugh about his role as Sgt. even though. I nearly laughed my ass. It's really so weirdly bad. <br /> <br /> Apart from the good parts that I have listed, there is really nothing else to recommend unless you are starving for Swedish B-films. <br /> <br /> 4/10
