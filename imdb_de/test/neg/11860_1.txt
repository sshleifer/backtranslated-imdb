There is a difference between a "movie" and a "movie". A movie is ready for public use regardless of quality. A movie is what a group of friends do with a camcorder over the course of a weekend. In my time as a spectator, I may have seen examples of both. <br /> <br /> On September 19th, I participated in a screening of the writer / director Jon Satejowski's "Donnybrook". Now that I have read the script and seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the "finished" product) of this piece, I can say with certainty that this is a movie. And to a student film. It is competent for lack of a better word, that is, the director knew how to shoot with a camera and take moving pictures. For the most part, the visuals are static and inconspicuous, and dialogue scenes are reduced to mostly long shots, with little to no close-ups possible that allow the audience to relate to the characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film, but some visual flair would have been desirable, and it would have come a long way to keep audiences interested. It turns out that the limited camerawork comes with a well-written, gripping story and some sharp dialogues can be overcome. Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies and Videos" immediately springs to mind. However, this movie has no. The main story is weak and out of focus. When Davie tries to improve his relationship with his father, I feel that this film misses the point. What I found out is that Davies main goal is to "change the face of rock 'n' roll". However, we see very little activity to show this. While there is a dream sequence in the beginning and a spontaneous performance at the end, we only seem to see scenes where Davie hears music or happens to play a guitar. We're just told that Davie played a lot of gigs, but we never see him in full-rock-out mode. Next time, do not tell the audience. Anyone who has attended a creative writing class knows that. Davie does not look like someone who would have been tall in the 1970s glam rock era. He looks like he feels better in the early days of rock 'n' roll and poses as James Dancy's less talented brother. In the meantime, the rest of the movie's happenings seem to run randomly to more clichéd characters and story threads that have little or nothing to do with the sleek main story of Terry's dad). If I want to see a movie with this kind of arbitrary construction, I'll consider "Napolean Dynamite" again, a movie I could barely get through the first time scenes, I think I should mention that there are only a few and extremely far away from each other. Is it too much to ask for characters who speak? I do not think so. When the characters speak, they are short, choppy sentences; Collections of such insightful questions, angry grunts or wild exaggerated outbursts. These characters just do not behave like normal, rational people. When working with such a material, it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film, that of Al Hudson, and that's just because he mimics Sam Elliott for his time on the silver screen. A good director, or at least one willing to challenge a feature film, would have been able to spot these issues and get the author and cameramen to correct them. Since Satejowski is so close to the material, he simply does not see her, or if not, he is not ready to take the necessary steps to repair it because it violates his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to deal constructively with criticism is the hallmark of a selfish, misguided fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. <br /> <br /> At the end, there's another poor high school knock-out from Zach Braff's amazing Garden State, combined with the equally amazing Velvet Goldmine, worthy of two more films of the time. <br /> <br /> Before one of the performers or crew members gets out of the way to hold me responsible for this review, allow me to offer it. The best I can do is to compliment Mr. Satejowski, who had the ambition to make his own film and release it for an audience. However, the hope that this film will be picked up and distributed is a mere idea of ​​grandeur. This is a student movie, nothing more, nothing less. If the film makes a promise (and let's face it, it will not be by acting, writing or directing at this point), then this is the following: If, IF, the people associated with this film are ready, then please study this movie, drop it and use the lessons you learned on your next try. Do not attack your critics or let friends or family do it for you. If you can, the next one may be worthy of dissemination and deserve the name "movie". <br /> <br /> I am your audience and I am ready to watch.
