It would be wrong and reprehensible for me to advise you to see Killjoy 2. You have to do better things, wash the car, throw stones into a stream, but at the same time, it's not nearly as horrible as you might think. It's almost a real movie that can handle much more than most direct DVD muds. Killjoy 2 is greatly helped by Trent Haagas manic turn as the eponymous clown. He throws himself into the role with such feverish devotion that he almost makes the scales in favor of the film, but of course it needs more than a man's shoes. Tammi Sutton gives the most entertaining cameo since Roger Corman in Creature from the Haunted Sea and the whole thing is almost destroyed by the rushing, sugary ending. Everywhere and almost a lot of fun.
