Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ..... WHAT ?! This movie is awful, absolutely terrible. 1. The only reason Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to pine fans, just to break their hearts. He kills a guy, gets shot and dies before half of the movie is over, not to mention that he was only in the first 10 minutes and then disappeared to the point where he died .... 2. Where are the EPIC battle scenes that were promised in the preview on the back cover? 3. It was too confusing, I mean, what's wrong with the girl? She had to tell the movie TRY to get our attention, she failed! 4. If Kiefer dies in a movie, it fails. Now I'll see 24 ..... THIS FILM IS MISSING!
