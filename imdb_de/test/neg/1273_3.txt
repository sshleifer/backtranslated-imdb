Yes, I had the misfortune to watch this movie when I was younger in a friend's house when his mother was a teacher and she wanted to show the film to see if there were any inappropriate scenes against which a parent objected. Apart from the jumbled jokes, I think this was a clear, nude joke and the strange scene where the look of an Ernest meets a girl. Yes, Ernest is thrown into prison thanks to a similar prison and keeps on trying to escape, and there are other things that are magnetized at one point, electricity shoots and can be seen in a very painful finale. There are a few jokes, but nothing too much to mention, except for the soap carved ... I think that's the only scene where I or my girlfriend's mother laughed out loud. This and the camp are the only two Ernest films I've ever seen. From what I have seen in them, I will not track down the other films. Ernest was good in small doses, but a movie is just too much, even if it's as short as this one. I guess even though the movies made money, mainly because Varney and a place and a theme are all, and you have your movie.
