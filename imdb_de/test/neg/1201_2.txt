Without actually disclosing my age, I first saw this over 20 years ago when it first appeared on video (maybe a beta tape?) And I was old enough to drink (barely) and might have had one couple, because I remember how great this movie was! I've seen it sober ever since and have to admit that it's a pretty bad movie. As mentioned in other posts, the plot is absolutely ridiculous and bad action only makes it worse. It's a feeble attempt to fantasize that even teenagers can be "mavericks" (though I'm surprised to find out that it was supposed to be released at the same time as "Top Gun" rather than a bad imitation) But for all that's worth it - I look at it when it works and I have the time. It's one of those movies you watch because it's just ridiculous and so desperately trying to take you seriously. Like this other "great" movie - "Moment by moment" with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin ... do not let me start with that!
