I watched it out of curiosity. I enjoyed Stargate SG1 and saw many other TV shows and movies that the main characters were working on. <br /> <br /> My expectations were not high, so I was surprised that I was so incredibly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is terrible. <br /> <br /> Zero research on the bad science being spread throughout the movie, or about the martial arts (involving several performers throughout the film, although they obviously did not have martial arts training (baton whirling is not a warrior ) make)) Training makes the already implausible action even less credible. The same weapon (worn by Michael Shanks) when shot on a hillside causes extreme damage, but when it is shot down on the wall of willow rifle, it creates a small firework without damaging the willow structure - OK, I suppose, Michael Shanks fans will be sued in Stargate SG1, where a staff weapon either causes a fire on a main character or blows a hole in a section of the castle wall as needed. But still ... A bad CGI snake 'god' eats a believer in the way a dog would eat - snakes just do not behave like that. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of an Amazonian warrior cult on a distant planet is stupid at best. Matriarchal societies have always relied on a lack of understanding that men are needed to spread the species - for example the Picts, who did not discover the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century at this time. The balance of power was moving from women to men. They carry technological weapons and have some knowledge of science - especially medicine. Therefore, the idea that a matriarchal society might exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based solely on the humid dream of the original author. Of course, the few references made to this outstanding science in this film show that the author knew nothing about it (except for some key words he must have heard in other films). Nevertheless, it could have done better - like "you" in 1965, in which the matriarchal society was shown with a certain reverence far more credibly, and even after 45 years it seems fresher than that foul-smelling stupidity. To march on a few women in 'armor', aggressively pout and spit out their lines like a kid looking for a fight in a nightclub ("Come on, I'll do it!"), Seeming too simplistic to be the complexity of a matriarchal culture. <br /> <br /> The cultural references are so simple - "Everyone welcomes the Serpent Mother", pretty much everything. Even the smallest hamlet has more cultural differences. <br /> <br /> There is nothing smart, thought provoking, interesting, visually exciting or remotely featured in this film. The soundtrack is of similar quality. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the few, overly benevolent, positive reviews that this film has received come from winking Michael Shanks fans who are grateful for everything that concerns him. Do not be fooled. Low budgets are no reason for the failure of a movie - cheap B movies can be brilliant. This is not one of them and there is no reason to inflict this movie on yourself.
