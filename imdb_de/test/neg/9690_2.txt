When you're making a movie from a book, make sure the characters match that book. Not only did this film resist the biblical story told to children in one way or another for thousands upon thousands of years, but it has also taken the liberties that no adaptation would likely ever attempt. At the very least, the Lord of the Rings is close enough to the books that people understand the story better when they read the books than this Noah's Ark wanted.
