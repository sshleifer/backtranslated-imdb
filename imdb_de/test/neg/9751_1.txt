Seriously, I do not understand why people are all like, "Oh my god, step up is the best movie ever !!!" It's a bunch of garbage! Acting is ridiculous at first, and let's not even start talking about the dialogue because it was awful ... movies should be entertaining, and that, let me say first, was * no * entertainment. I actually laughed because I was embarrassed to see it. The music and the dance have not done anything for me either. And what about the Channing Tatum "hotness" that all girls talk about? What ever. The movie was pathetic. Do not waste your time - or your money. Unless you're a dancing movie freak, but such movies are * no * movies ... they're jokes.
