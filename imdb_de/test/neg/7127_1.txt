This movie was absolutely threefold. It may indeed be a pollution. The subtle tense atmosphere of the original remake can not be seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar has nothing to do even in her death sequence, but she is still the best performer in this film, and her death is the best, though she deserves a better death. It is the sign of very bad writing and governance. I suspect that she made this movie to end her connection with it because it has become garbage. <br /> <br /> Not scary. Not tense Not funny. Does not make sense at all. And as said earlier, Sarah Michelle Gellar shows the only reasonable performance from the entire cast.
