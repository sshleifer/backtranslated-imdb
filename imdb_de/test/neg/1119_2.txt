The only reason to watch this movie is Sung Hi Lee, the stunning Korean model / actress who plays in this otherwise crappy movie "Muka Laka Miki" (give me a break). <br /> <br /> She gets a pretty big role in this movie and seems to handle it well, though none of the parts are really interesting or well written. Even for a movie by National Lampoon, it's really stupid. Silly humor is one thing, but only stupid is another. I may have laughed once, and probably only me was polite. <br /> <br /> Warning: Watching this movie can be harmful in two ways: 1) It's totally shitty. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so damn glorious that at first glance she might blow your brain out of the back of your head. <br /> <br /> So do not say I did not warn you ...
