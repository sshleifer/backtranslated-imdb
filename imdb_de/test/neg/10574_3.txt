And so it started with "Shreik", a horror movie, and then we had Scary Movie, a really good attempt at a new genre, the illustrious vocals. but .... now we have: Scary Movie * Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4 * Date Movie Meet the Spartans not another team * and many more (really funny movies marked with *) <br / > <br /> and ..... Superhero movie .... the people who make these films still do not seem to understand what makes the send-ups funny. Using the rip-offs from other films in a funny way is fine and right when done right, but not many producers seem to know that. Scary Movie (1) did well, the following sequels were terrible when they tried to outdo the franchise, but it was redeemed by Scary Movie 4. No other teen movie was good because he used the spoofs well ... and I'm sick of teenage movies. This movie, however, runs like a bad version of all this. It relies on batons that make even the three stooges falter and hurt Stephen Hawking's image, and when people get bored (and the producers knew when that would be the case), we get into a tight suit with Pamela Anderson treated. To conclude, Spoofs should be about making a homage-like model of an original movie with an original plot, rather than embedding random prints of legitimate film in the plot of a real movie. <br /> <br /> ... I shudder at the thought of "SCI-FI MOVIE" and get my Seppuku knife ready
