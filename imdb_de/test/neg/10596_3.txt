The DVD case explains the premise, "Three problematic teenagers go to jail," and "It'll be time for Captain Greer to offer them a deal - undercover." The movie opens with definitions of the words "mod" and "squad" so you do not have to look it up in the dictionary. To get a visual definition of "Cool," look for photos of the original trio: Michael Cole (as Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (as Linc Hayes), and Peggy Lipton (as Julie Barnes). <br /> <br /> A black man. A white. A blonde Once she was cool defined. <br /> <br /> The three that make up Scott Silver's version of Aaron Spelling's "The Mod Squad" are twenty years old: Claire Danes (as Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (as Pete Cochran) and Omar Epps ( as Linc Hayes). They can not do much with the given material. Mr. Ribisi's presentation is the furthest "far away," meaning that he deviates most from the original characterization. Ms. Danes loves Josh Brolin (as Billy Waites), who looks like he might be in a reissue of "Marcus Welby, MD". You will not believe that Michael Lerner is dancing with Mr. Lpps "Linc". He explains: "I am not a fairy, I just like to dance!" and asks, "Turn me!" <br /> <br /> *** The Mod Squad (1999) Scott Silver - Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi and Omar Epps
