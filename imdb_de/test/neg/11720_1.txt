This movie not only disappointed the horror / suspense movie lover, it disappointed anyone who sees it. Impressive. I thought that this movie could be funny, because the guy with the huge head. However, it was filled with long and lengthy conversations that were not needed. There was so much sex that I hate women and men now. This movie was not only boring, there was no substance. Impressive. Impressive. In any case, every scene looks like it's lit by a single light bulb, and I think they used the same set for two different lawyers, a restaurant and an airport. This movie is not for movie lovers who love bad movies, because in the end it feels like a waste of time. Watch the movie! <br /> <br /> party
