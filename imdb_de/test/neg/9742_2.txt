How this character was ever hired by the post office is far beyond me. The test post office workers make is so difficult. There is no way a guy who is so stupid can work in the post. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and that's probably the point of the movie. How they go all their lives and can not see a lift is also confusing. I did not take this movie too seriously, but he was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without a key? Many horrible scenes and terrible acting and this movie is not funny at all. It's just a sad stupidity. The dress of the mothers, however, I liked. <br /> <br /> Send it back to the sender as soon as possible.
