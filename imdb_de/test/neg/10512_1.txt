I rented this movie, expecting it to suck, and it did not abandon me. I rented it with some friends as a joke. But what we got was worse than anyone could imagine. <br /> <br /> It starts to suck before you even take it out of the box. It looks like a blade rip-off and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie. It's called a vampire assassin, but is not an assassin someone who kills for rent? Well, this guy kills the will of his own accord, so he does not become an assassin. <br /> <br /> If you actually put the disk in it will get worse. First of all, the menu animation is lame. But when you actually start the movie, everything from set design to lighting (or lack thereof) is awful. You know that a movie is bad when the credits even fuck. Acting is laughable. The action is childish. The writing is elementary. And the director is the worst
