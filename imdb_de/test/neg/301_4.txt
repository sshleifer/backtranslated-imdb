*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I've been reading Dahmer a bit and seeing the new Dahmer movie (of the same name) earlier. This film focuses a lot on the victims and murders, not enough on Dahmer himself. The film titled "Dahmer" had the opposite problem, it was not enough about his crimes and too much about himself. <br /> < I did not find the spectacle to my satisfaction, it had a certain sense of laughter, especially the probation officers. It also seemed that Dahmer's acting became worse every time he played the probation officer. But I could be wrong. <br /> <br /> What bothered me a bit was that some scenes were pretty disturbing, but that the filmmakers tried to try to show "the right thing", which they did anyway. That's fine - but what I do not understand then is why the guy who ran out of his apartment while Dahmer was bringing beer was not portrayed naked, because that's what happened. It's not a big deal, but it only worsens the quality of the movies that such details are left out. What was not shown or not really hinted at was Dahmer's sexual obsession with the dead. I do not mind that they did not show it, but at least they could have somehow mentioned it or put it into the movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think the really good Dahmer movie is still a movie in which not only Dahmer's crime but also who he was and why he did what he did. I think 1.5 or 2 hours are not enough to capture the complexity of the whole. This film was just a excerpt from the Dahmer's life and personality (excuse the pun) and does not give you "almost good" insights into his life or personality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
