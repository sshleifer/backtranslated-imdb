Wesley Snipe's latest direct video is a tangled jumble that is awfully reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is terribly written and does not account for the low budget that exists and tries to be smart. Unfortunately, Snipes has also fallen into the trap that an ADR voice performs a large part of its dialogues and a whole narrative, which occasionally comes through points in the film. It's sad to see a guy from Wesley Snipe's talent make trash like this movie and produce a tired and clearly bored performance that barely bothers to produce his own dialogue. It has become a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact that he does not have his own dialogues, but I would not have expected that from Snipes. Maybe it's the producer, Andrew Stevens, who used to work with Seagal, or the director Po-Chi Leong, who's responsible for Seagally's epically evil Out Of Reach. <br /> <br /> Dodgy government officials participate in the conspiracy, terrorists Train football teams, disks with incriminating evidence, and a hefty amount of money. Oh and biological weapons. Well, I do not know how they are connected, but what I can tell you is the fiendish script that is hard to fathom. Like many of these DTV films, this one likes to take one turn too many. The plot is also narrated uninteresting by playing their cards with people who have dodgy ones in offices and dark alleys etc. It's all kind of "we want to sit down and give some action points to the sad bastards watching this movie!" The tempo of the movie as such suffers because the film has some nice action scenes despite the stupidity of the performances and plot. As an example of how a DTV movie has successfully portrayed a story with a confusing nature, I'll give you Dolph Lundgren's directorial debut, The Defender. This film had its share of twists and overcomplexity, but the movie has almost a single action for the last hour, with Dolph under siege by terrorists. The action points are told in the context of the plot, while the move takes place while avoiding death. The movie does not stop telling us what's going on, it does not slow down the tempo. Although the plot was a bit confused, it was more forgivable because the action never stopped. The detonator, like too many of these films, stops everything to allow us a sinuous run, who is bad and who is not, before he inevitably shifts this round in the spin drawn from the back end. These movies can often cause problems with the tempo. <br /> <br /> Snipes is, as I said, pretty bland. In the beginning, he attracts a camp personality, because he is hidden by some arms dealers. At first it seemed like he was having a good time, but unfortunately the rest of the movie sees him and his occasional voice walking sleepwalking twice. Snipes will only come alive if he is to kick his ass. Here's some nice action, with fast and punchy martial arts and pretty punchy shootouts. The movie also offers a decent chase. Silvia Colloca is one of the leading actresses, and she's not a great actress, but she's beautiful, with a costume that screams, "Look at my cleavage!" The rest of the cast flits with clich√©d and uninteresting roles on and off. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, Snipes now has better projects in the series. He has another team with Mario Van Peebles, called Hard Luck, and then he'll do Chasing The Dragon by director Chris Nahon, who made Jet Lis Kiss Of The Dragon. Finally, Snipes apparently makes Toussaint, a biographical drama directed by Danny Glover. The future looks brighter for Snipes, but let us remember that he was paid extremely well for his DTV films, about $ 7 million per movie, possibly more. It's also funny to think that the Dolph Lundgren makes the better movies and directs of these DTV gods, with the enjoyable defender and the extremely violent and well-crafted The Russian Specialist, and also makes them a fraction of the budget These devilish offerings by Wesley and Steven Seagal produce. * 1/2
