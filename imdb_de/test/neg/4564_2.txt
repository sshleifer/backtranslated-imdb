I usually love teen / high school genre films, but this movie really lacked originality. The only premise this film has is that four friends cheat their way through high school and burden their friendship. There just is not enough depth in the story or the characters to get the viewer's attention for the entire length of the movie. Acting is not so bad, though the actors are not really that busy, as the dialogue is Tripe and Clich√© '... After seeing this movie, you have to wonder how a producer around the world encounters a project could and do you think: "I MUST do this movie." No wonder there was no theatrical release. Andrew Gurland is a hack, avoid or burn.
