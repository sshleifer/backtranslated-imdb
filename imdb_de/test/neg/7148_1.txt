This was shown last night at Sundance to an open-minded, if dumb, crowd. The story is definitely worth it, it's powerful and true, but did the director have to fill every role with a recognizable face? I mean, you spend your time saying, "Oh, it's the guy from 'Armageddon'" or "Hey, it's Easy Rider!" and you lose sight of the story. Maybe it's the only way this guy could make his movie, but it's a bit distracting, like "The Love Boat" or the old Towering Inferno movies that are "Block of Stars". I just made the story with less famous ones Faces told. In addition, the camera work seems pretty lazy, as if not thought of where the camera should be placed to tell the story best. All in all, I thought it was okay, could have been really good.
