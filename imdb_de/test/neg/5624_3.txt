I saw this movie 3 times. Mostly because I kept thinking as I watched it, "Did I miss something here?" Is there a reason why this movie was made? Was it trying to say something and I just missed it? Well, after three visits I did not get an answer. <br /> <br /> I think the worst thing I can say about any movie is that it bores me and I did not finish it. I admit, there is a lot of eye candy and fast editing and hip music to hold my attention, but is that all that a movie should be? <br /> <br /> I'm not against extreme violence, it's almost uninterrupted, but there seems to be some kind of inspiration. Something that is highlighted by it. The word vain comes to my mind, but it's worse than that. In the first part of the film, we get insights into the motivations of the characters. And yes, the 3 principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are absolutely incredible. In the first part we get to know the characters and in the second part most of them die and use sadistic joy to kill others. That seems to be the whole movie. And the first part has nothing to do with the second. <br /> <br /> For example. How could a nice smart guy like Zed join some junkies and amateurs to do such a job? That makes no sense. He is portrayed as smart, but goes on with this suicide mission. The fact that he survives is completely incompatible with the rest of hyperreal violence and chaos. So, what do we see here is a Hollywood romance with a happy ending or a real, extremely violent bloodbath? I remember having the same reaction to two other films this director was involved in: True Romance and Reservior Dogs. <br /> <br /> Unnecessary filth!
