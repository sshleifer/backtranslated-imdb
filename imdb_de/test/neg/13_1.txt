An obvious vanity press for Julie in her first movie with Blake. Just take a look. Where do we start. She is a traitor during a world war. she redeems this by falling in love with herself; their friends (who are probably patriots because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and she ends up as a heroine. OK. The scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons working for French intelligence agencies can not even be described, and Rock's romantic scenes with a woman are not even mentioned. (By the way, when you visit a museum, look at his gaze - I've repeated it on video and it's priceless). Is it a farce or a romantic classic or a war movie? I do not know and you will not.
