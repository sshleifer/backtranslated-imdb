I can only name a few films I've seen that were so bad. This film has terrible everything: the dialogue is hackneyed and clich√©d ', with a few exceptions, acting is mostly bad, cinematography is nothing to look forward to, and the conspiracy is stupid (A fat woman pursuing a suburban family because of her daughter the football team was not made). That's so bad, it's funny to see. If you can catch this during your lifetime, I would highly recommend it as a comedy. I am a serious movie. I'm afraid I have to rate this movie with 2. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you're a serious movie fan looking for an interesting and challenging plot or good action. There is no find. <br /> <br /> Edit: Hmmm ... I think a group of people working for lifetime must have written some wrong reviews and voted out of all negative votes. Do not Believe Them This is a really crappy movie.
