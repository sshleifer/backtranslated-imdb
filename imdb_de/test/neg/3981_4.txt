This is a great prerequisite for a movie. The whole plot is very original, interesting and something to think about. However, a bad production, an obviously small budget, a bad game of the main character and some of the key players who really distract from it, would be classic. An aspiring producer should try to revive this story and give this basically halfhearted temptation a proper liberation.
