This movie was compared to the funny British comedy "A Fish Called Wanda," though I can not understand why. The only connection I can find is the Monty Python (Eric Idle in "Nuns", John Cleese and Michael Palin in "Wanda"). Otherwise, the two are not comparable. <br /> <br /> Idle and Robbie Coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of business before they die, so they decide to bust their boss and go to Rio. If the short break goes awry, the two must seek refuge as nuns in a monastery. What promises a rebellion at first, soon becomes a predictable, average movie with the usual, tasteless sex jokes and mild humor. Once again, there are occasional highlights, but neither cast nor crew manage to initiate events. The attempt of a manic finish of the type "Wanda" fails as well as the use of "men in drag" - humor, which is hardly surprising. When you think about it, men who try to be women are funny, men who try to be nuns are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
