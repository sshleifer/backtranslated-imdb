I know the original psycho was a classic and it was a mistake to make it a new one, especially a shot-by-shot remake. I think, the other comments here have more or less proved. But there is far more injustice in this film than just that. <br /> <br /> The first problem is the color. The original film was shot in black and white, but what few know is that the original was shot after a color film was invented. The choice of black and white film was partly a budget topic, but also a stylistic decision by Hitchcock. That does not mean that the remake should have been redone in black and white, but the colors of this movie are all too wrong. The predominant colors in the film are orange and green, especially in Marion, which should not be a showy character. The bright colors make the movie look like a happy movie, and when horrible events take place in those color schemes, it looks more than anything but a caricature, and the audience tends to laugh rather than scream. <br /> <br /> The second problem is the lighting. This is a dark, dark story that should be highlighted by dim light, but this remake not only seemed to fail, but seemed to go in the opposition direction. Most of the scenes are very bright, though it is illogical to do so on NIGHT! <br /> <br /> Another obvious problem is the performance of Vince Vaughn. Yeah, it does Norman Bate's awkwardness and insanity pretty well, I do not deny it. But there is one element he could not show: the softness. There should be at least a certain amount of fraudulent friendliness in the character that diminishes when we see the truth about him. Apart from being a trait of Norman Bates, this is a recognized trait of ALL PSYCHOPATHS. <br /> <br /> There are some good aspects of this movie. Some performances are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn was very close to showing a decent performance of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Although angry, Anne Heche, unlike Janet Leigh, who was unlikely to be one of the movie's biggest stars, received the final reckoning in the opening credits. A copy of the psycho-novel Gus Van Sant claimed was not a remake of the Hitchcock movie, but a re-adaptation of the original novel. I wish now that I had bought this book and saved the comment because this comment, after watching this movie, is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen. There was no attempt to disguise the fact that this was a rip-off of the original, and it would be far more credible if Van Sant had tried to say that he really was a three-ton monkey from the planet Zafroomulax is. So many shots were copied exactly, without any thought as to why Hitchcock had composed the original recording like this. Like the scene where Sam and Lila talk while their faces are completely covered in shadows. Hitchcock obscured the faces of these actors in the shadows because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their horrible performances, not for any artistic or stylistic purpose. <br /> <br /> In other words, my review is as pointless as the movie itself, because it reflects something that has already been said. Like everyone else here, I recommend that you do not waste time with this movie and get the original.
