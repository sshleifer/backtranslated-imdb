Idiots go camping and behave like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes, Camp Blood (or if you want a horrible, meaner word than a bad pun that fits a worse than the bad movie "Camp Bloody Terrible") , is it really that depressing to look pretty depressing. And it has all the ingredients to be an absolutely bad movie ... <br /> <br /> Terrible acting check. Bad script check. Sticky effects - no originality - double control. <br /> <br /> It does not even try to be different and is interspersed with every predicted clich√©. For example, the movie opens for a couple who have sex in the forest, so of course they are dead. <br /> <br /> One of the most disquieting things is that this movie has actually produced two sequels, how and why only the mind gets confused. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from it.
