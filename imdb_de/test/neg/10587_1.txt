I expected this movie to be absolutely terrible. Like "What dreams come like" or "The Truman Show" or something. Well, they sold it for Â£ 3.99 at my local HMV and it was Giovanni Ribisi on the cover. They can not help but love him, and my friends dared to buy it. and I was sure it would be garbage. Maybe that's the only reason I could sit through this movie because my standards have never been so high.
