Usually, when BBC publishes a television series, a certain satisfaction guarantee is used. Usually the TV series is great. Even if the story is boring, you can count on acting to be worth the effort. When I came across persuasion in the local library, I was looking forward to a nice evening because I read the story. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that I read the story first, otherwise I would not do it up high. In addition, I was relieved to learn that the production date of this TV series was 1971, because until then I thought the BBC had lost it. It's really bad and should be used as a horror movie in acting schools. <br /> <br /> The only positive thought that I have about this series is that people in this film are unlikely to be involved in any form of BBC or any other product in this century except the young Musgroves sisters who apparently took her first steps in acting and did remarkably well under the instructions otherwise given.
