From the English accents to the so unnecessary violence for violence. Show Moses as a murderer. People who actually believe in the Old Testament will just sit there and shake their heads. I am not a religious person at all. But I even felt like the authors of this film were trying to turn us all against God and the Jews. When Moses picked up this stone and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for adultery. I wanted to stone the writers. I can not believe today that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) would try to show such garbage. Do not we already have enough problems in this world?
