"Frightmare" from 1983 is a strange little movie. The director seems to combine the atmosphere of the classic horror films of the 30s / 40s with the shock factor of the then exploding 80s Slasher genre. It is not quite successful (mainly due to the obvious budget constraints and the less qualified young actor), but it still has its moments, mainly due to its stylish performance (more classic than the movie deserves). by the deceased German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an aging horror film from the old days (ala Vincent Price) called "Conrad Ratzoff". At the beginning of the film, we meet the horror star who has just shot a commercial for dentures, and we quickly learn that old Conrad is a bit of a prima donna idiot. Just when you think he could not be more uncomfortable, Commercial Director Conrad says he made a take for the umpteenth time, and the old goat pushes him from a balcony to his death. Beautiful or? Conrad then visits some fans in a horror film club on the college campus. Unfortunately, he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech and ends up in his villa waiting for death. Even with Death, he is still vivacious and manages to dispose of a despised business partner by stifling him with a pillow, before finally kicking himself in the bucket. Conrad is then rested in true Hollywood style in a high-tech neon with video screens above the casket, where personal video messages from Conrad are played even for visitors who come in to pay their respects. <br /> <br /> At this point, the children of the College's Horror Movie Society decide to pay a visit to Conrad's grave after the hours-long visit, break into the grave, and take his body home for a whole night. (Not exactly my idea of ​​fun, but hey, these are characters in a horror movie of the 80's, where Logic has no place.) The college kids spend the evening sitting in a place of honor with Conrad's body posing for photos and even dancing with him in the room before he left Conrad and his coffin in the attic and planned to bring him back to his tomb tomorrow. In the meantime, Ms. Ratzoff, appalled by the theft of her husband's body, called in a psychic friend to try to "reach" Conrad through a seance. You can find out the rest pretty well from here. Since Conrad was not a very nice guy in life, it is not to be believed that he will not be kinder in death. Psychic Lady contacts Conrad, and he awakens in a predictable way. He spends the rest of the movie walking the corridors of the ridiculously large students' home and scanning the young grave robbers one at a time. Here the film falls apart. Endless scenes with teenagers wandering around empty corridors saying, "Hello, is anyone there?" are interrupted with occasional bursts of violence (we get a pretty gnarly beheading scene that is the climax of the movie) before the last two survivors finally find out (WAY, when some half-intelligent people found out the same thing ... but again we're in a horror movie the 80s!) that the only way to stop the mess is to get Conrad's body into the crypt where it belongs. The slow tempo is filled with many strange light and dry ice fog effects, supported by a soundtrack that consists almost entirely of sound effects rather than music (thunder, groans and moans, howls, etc.), which become annoying after some time. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend "Frightmare" to anyone who has not grown up watching cheap movies like this on Late Night Cable in the 80s. "Modern Horror" fans will undoubtedly find "Frightmare" incredibly slow and stupid. If you've come of age in this magical decade, you can get nostalgia from Frightmare. Fans of Jeffrey ("re-animator") Combs might also want to give it a try, because the future Dr. West appears here in an early role as one of the unlucky film students. I'll advise Readers should avoid the version of this movie on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Ward's "Vault of Horror" and sold in dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I was told that the movie about the fine people at Troma got a deluxe release, which seems appropriate. If you are some kind of troma, then "Frightmare" is in your alley.
