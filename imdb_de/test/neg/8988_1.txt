I saw this movie for the horny guy - and he even sucked! He was the worst - well, okay, I also have to give support to this crazy rapist of the cop, he was even worse. The guy was not so sweet in the end, he had the most awful accent and he was the clearest definition of a Hicksville idiot who can not stand his mother for the one he "loves". All in all, and if this makes sense to you, when I picked up movies in the video library, I think, when I read the back of a movie that looks like this: "Well, at least it can not be worse than Carolina Moon. "The most horrible movie and the most awful drama, drama plot - all that was in it made my gag reflexes make flips. It was the most horrible movie I've ever seen, with Gabriela up there too. I hated it and trusted that if there was a number below 1 IMDb for the rating, I would pick it immediately.
