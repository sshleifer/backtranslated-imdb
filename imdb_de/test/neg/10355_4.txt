There is something in this show that makes me look and hope for the future. In writing, the jokes are rare and the stories are boring, so I think it must be the physical comedy and the visuals. <br /> <br /> I like the camera movement, sit down and wardrobe. It is amusingly contrasted with the stupidity that reigns. And I'm pretty sure that every time I laugh, I was because of John or Molly's physical comedy. The two make a disgustingly sweet couple, who wants to make me laugh at the same time. <br /> <br /> So I go back to Kath & Kim's tonight to see which way to go. This production will decline (or, if the case goes, with a positive outlook).
