After all the hype I heard about the Jane Austin novel and different movie versions of the book, I was very disappointed in the movie. I had expected a classic drama, but that was not the case. Let me first start my review with the fact that I love old films, especially mysteries and dramas, but not women-oriented films. That probably makes a big difference, take my rating with a big grain of salt. I found the acting a bit over the top, but that's very common in movies of that era. June Allyson was good as Jo, but I found that every sister was stereotyped and shape-controlled. There were no surprises or too dramatic moments. I hate writing negative reviews, but the movie left me very cold. It has always been my intention to read the book, but after that it seems unlikely. The only warming story was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister. This was a welcome ray of hope in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience. Again there are others who love this movie, I'm just not one of them.
