This movie could have been great, but it was not. Under the wellhead of talentless no-hoppers and friends of filmmakers who wanted to help, there are some mild signs of talent. The main star of the movie plays a good lead role. He convinces and has those scary Italian eyes. He is, however, associated with the worst rejections of actors that has ever met anyone. The opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like gay porn. Luckily, nobody left. The rape scene, which is mentioned again and again, is garbage. The prison sequence was the best part of the film - albeit irrelevant. The soundtrack of the movies (if you can call it that) sounds like a boy trying to use cooledit and some sample CDs first. It's boring, repetitive and extremely lame. In fact, the whole movie is lame. Get out while you can!
