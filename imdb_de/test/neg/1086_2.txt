I am very surprised about the good reviews of this film. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie nine years ago and I still remember how angry I felt when I was sitting in the cinema looking at this mess. I'm a big fan of John Boorman's work. I really like his movies. So I went to "Beyond Rangoon" with great expectations. But I wanted to see a stupid, cheap jungle movie with all the action scenes. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that John Boorman was the director because this movie was made so bad. I think the Burmese deserve better films to illustrate their struggle.
