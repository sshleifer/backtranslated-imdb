The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only "star power", if we can name it, which consists of Joe Estevez. I do not know which is more shocking. The fact that this movie was made, or the fact that some people actually made good comments about it. If you ever see the cover of the video, you can read it. Someone even went so far as to say that the actress / author could be the lead actress of the 90s. Yes! And Joe Estevez could have more money than his brother Martin. If you want to try it anyway, I recommend the MTS version. At least you will laugh a lot without going crazy.
