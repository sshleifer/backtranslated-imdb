This film is an open-ended attempt to target a younger population aged 14 to 24, and an insult to all. I refuse to believe that this age group is as vapid as entertaining this unnecessary "remake". At the beginning of the film one of the characters announces: "I am surrounded by idiots". This is the defining moment in the film, which steadily goes down from there. The film is full of clichés, red herring fear and inexplicable events. The movie is also full of characters who are not exactly spiritual, a formula that's too familiar in stupid horror movies. and the shitty "It's so dark, I can not see it" - scenes that were stolen from the Chainsaw massacre, but only annoying to build no tensions or horror. It's difficult to film in the dark, and sometimes darkness is a great vehicle in a movie that suspects tension. but I feel like the less you see in this case, the better. Maybe he did not want to wait until morning, because he did not mind, it could cost him more money to do night scenes, or he does not know how. Who knows? If you've never seen a horror movie in your life, or are two or three years old, every aspect of this movie is predictable and predetermined. Warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. enough said. All in all, a Blasé Slasher movie that raises the question where the wax is - it was treated like a lost leader. if you get bored and miss out on all the other rentals, or are in the mood for a bad horror movie that's not really scary, or if you'd like to see Paris poke a pole through its head, go ahead and get the hang of it Chance. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but if the producers of this movie want to believe a younger crowd, then I'm praying that they'll be deceived. a for-profit film that seeks neither art nor respect for the genre. You know, smart characters make a scary movie. I think that's Collet-Serra's directorial debut, along with commercials and music videos. 2006 comes out another with the name Goal 2. Hopefully, his goal is to make a better movie.
