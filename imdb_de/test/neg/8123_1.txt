I do not care if this show conveys deep messages about human existence. <br /> <br /> The show is crap .... how can anyone enjoy seeing them? However, it was so well received. This is a sad situation for Joe Moron out there. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch this program when it first came out when friends talked about it. The insane laughter between the two main characters and the pathetic dialogue made me cry. <br /> <br /> It is incredible that people can see this show. But I think the creators had the last laugh. They made themselves wealthy by honoring the very people who would watch such a show all the way to the bank.
