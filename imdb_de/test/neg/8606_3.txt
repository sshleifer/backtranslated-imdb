Have you ever looked at such a terrible thing that you just have to keep watching to make sure it's really as bad as it looks? This is one of those movies. It was criticized by the critics, not least for the way it was funded. I caught it yesterday on TV and made it curious. <br /> <br /> In that case, what's on the box is nothing more and nothing less: low-level humor, cruelty, a lot in the 'go on ...' streak but with 'adult language' '. In fact, it goes back to the British porn industry of the '60s /' 70s, which cheats cheaters by promising real sex and not delivering (tracking down nipples?) It has the benefit of Mackenzie Crook (The Office, Pirates of the Caribbean, and more ) and also from Johnny Vegas. The girl from the chip shop is really sexy. Apart from these unexpected positive effects, I wonder what happened to England. Junk food, low paid work, state goods, desperate lives. As a bonus, there are some nice pictures of the green Birmingham. Foreigners could find information about British attitudes and aspirations. Overall, I still feel incredulous that I have prevailed.
