When I say worse, I mean less entertaining. Todd Sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera treats since the last zombie Bloodbath, making the movie even less bearable. In the last movie, there were no special camera effects, in which we deal with wobbly cam and constant change to black and white. This is also referred to as Zombie Bloodbath, although the zombies are hardly in it. The film begins in 1945 when some Satanists kill a violent burglar and set him up as a scarecrow. In modern times, some children have a car problem and go to a house, to the same house where the Satanist murder took place. Some common people try to rape the kids (or something), and they bring the scarecrow burglar back to life, coming back with a few zombies and now talking like Darth Vader. Mr. Sheets reinforced the language and reduced the violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is, have a look! <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 96 min. Not rated, contains violence and language.
