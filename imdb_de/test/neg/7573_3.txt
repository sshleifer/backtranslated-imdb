This film makes me seriously doubt again whether Armando de Ossorio was a good filmmaker or not ... His BLIND DEAD films are praised by many fans. I can understand that. But the coveted Gothic vampire trick like MALENKA shows no signs of a gifted filmmaker. And that also applies to SERPIENTE DE MAR. It offers horrible drama, a stupid storyline, stupid events, many other things you can expect from a bad monster movie, and also the veteran actor Ray Milland, who does his best to mumble through this movie without much I know what he's doing with it. Apparently, Milland was already very ill when he shot SERPIENTE DE MAR (his last play) and was traveling with a ridiculous stinker like this one. The sadder it is. A recent appearance alongside Peter Cushing in a television movie shot by Roy Ward Baker (also 1984) does not change that. <br /> <br /> But the sock puppet / sea serpent is beholding a scream. Watch as a lighthouse is whirled up and crush it. See how it destroys a harbor with miniature boats. Watch as you tear down bridges and chew in charming miniature trains. <br /> <br /> Good Badness? Yes. 3/10 and 7/10
