A piece of garbage, if there had been a 0, if I had. Animation is good, but not good enough. Storyline is absolutely THE most ridiculous I've ever encountered, and that says a lot! This "movie" tried so much to be interesting, but failed miserably. It's almost as if the author had started a story, then got another idea and tried to connect the two together. Do not waste your time with it; Believe me, you're just as choppy as I am. The only actor on this note was James Woods, and his part was peripheral at best. I'm all in favor of doing things that are ingenious and pushing the envelopes, but that just did not cut it.
