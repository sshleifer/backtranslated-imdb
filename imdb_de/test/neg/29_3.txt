Like 'Singin' in the Rain '' Cover Girl 'has a trio of two men and one girl. In "Cover Girl" Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. He's the same as Donald O'Connor's funny man song in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in "Rain" it's Debbie Reynolds. Here ends the comparison. <br /> <br /> While "Singin 'in the Rain" is a classic American film musical, "Cover Girl" is mediocrity. The story is not very complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth)) is a dancer in Danny MacGuire's low-rent nightclub in Brooklyn and decides to attend a Cover Girl contest sponsored by wealthy publisher John Coudair, who years ago was an unsuccessful play for Grandmother made by Rusty Who makes you a star? Danny feels downcast when Rusty arrives late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club and take the troops out to the street with his buddy Genius. At the last minute with Rusty At the altar with Noel she recognizes the error of their ways and runs back to Danny. They live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly has the least developed part of the movie. All we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is in love with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton seem like degenerate teenagers to Rusty, and Phil Silvers delivers a thoroughly stupid but not funny thing. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth is the scene in which she gets drunk. This shows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read his biography will learn that she disliked Hollywood, aspired to a normal home life that she could never achieve, but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown Alzheimer's patients in the final years of his life. <br /> <br /> Almost all the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very melodic. Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and this is the scene where he dances with his alter ego. Previously, the trio had a different number, which is a pale forerunner of 'Make em Laugh' from 'Singin' in the Rain '. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way Rita plays Hayworth is on a podium. A few decades later Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in her career were always looking for scripts that showed her acting skills. They wanted to be called "actresses" and not "pinup girls". Unfortunately, "Cover Girl" is an example of how Hollywood exploited women for financial gain.
