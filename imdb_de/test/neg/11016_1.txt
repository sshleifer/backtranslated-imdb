I'm glad I did not pay for The Wog Boy. <br /> <br /> I sat there hopefully waiting for something original and / or funny to happen. <br /> <br /> It reminded me I have a lot of these predictable English comedies of the 70s. <br /> <br /> I will not deal with a summary of the plot, I suggest you do something else for 90 minutes. <br /> <br />
