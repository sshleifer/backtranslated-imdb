I miss the words for this horrible waste of two hours in a person's life. The story is designed to be completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The acting is lead-free and so much of it is ridiculously horrible. Vinnie Jones - so wonderful in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels - is as Mike Sullivan, a journalist, unbearably awful and unbelievable. It is only worthwhile to pay attention to the frightening continuity losses. After Jones has received a huge beating, he appears without scratches. His girlfriend annoys him with a drink and he follows her as he emerges dry from the pub. It's pretty awful, it gets worse from the talented actors who appear in it.
