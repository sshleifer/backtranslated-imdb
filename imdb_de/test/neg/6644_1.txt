To date, I have never seen Elizabeth Shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. Poorly played, badly plotted and racially Neanderthal, it took place in a Chicago where every black man evidently lived in a blues club. , SPOILER FORWARD. , , , , .. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: Her "blues" solo was even more painful than her unsuspecting acting and the intro in it - "No one leaves without singing the blues" - was as stupid as a sentry. The children, whose figure had babysitting, were unbearable and long before the movie ended, I wished that something terrible would happen to everyone. <br /> <br /> I have to say, there is a special thing about this film; a movie needs me a lot to insult me, but that smoldering bit of Tripe did what Chopper, the Phantom Menace, and Catwoman could not - which would make me sick.
