In this unnamed sequel to the classic ROADHOUSE, a DEA agent (John Schaech) will come to the aid of his uncle (Will Patton) if the uncle is badly beaten by a local drug group led by this wooden Indian actor Jake Busey. The gang wants to take over the poor man's bar for poor reasons. Patrick Swayze is very much missed here. Schaech is an indifferent actor and does not convince as a committed lawyer. The battles here are temporary and not nearly as powerful or vicious as the fights in ROADHOUSE. The final is just as weak. Some good-looking women keep things a bit afloat. There is a grandiose battle between a Daisy Duke type that comes in handy with both fists and weapons, and a wicked-looking Busey baby who comes in handy with sharp tools. At the beginning there is also a scantily dressed girl who is an agent of Schaech, but unfortunately she never appears again in the movie. Too bad. She does a short lap dance for Schaech, who had my full attention. ROADHOUSE 2 begins with a strip club scene that is very close to a real strip club, which is a rare occurrence in any movie. The rest is slumber time.
