I have seen all 3 now. I just can not believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not compared to the others, but simply because of your own merit or lack of. <br /> <br /> I can not understand that the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 films 8 out of 10. They were perceived as stimulating and beautiful. I gave this movie a rating of 1. If a 0 or negative number were available, I would have given that rating instead. What a total waste of time watching this movie. I thought after the first 30 minutes that I should turn it off, but then I thought it was just a (very) slow startup movie. I thought the same after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. Then I realized that it would not get better. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to look at and without redeeming qualities. Do not take my word for it, look at it yourself. Make sure you watch the first two movies before this movie. If you see this first, I can almost guarantee you will never see the first two, but they are definitely much, much better than this "piece of work". <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is when the credits are at the end. Then your penance on this earth is over and you can pass 89 minutes in purgatory on the suffering that you had to endure by watching this "movie". If God is truly merciful, he will be more generous.
