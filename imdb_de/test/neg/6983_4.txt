Yes, I know that his character should be a drunk, and he just played stupid. But something tells this critic that Mr. Pleasence has really drunk a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes in the movie. Basically, everything he says is indistinct and often incomprehensible. Or maybe it was just the bad product values ​​... hard to say. <br /> <br /> The race for the Yankee Zephyr is a movie that just does not work. That's too bad, because the movie has a great opening and a generally interesting storyline. After all, the production values ​​are simply too low and the action for the New Zealand adventure to deliver the goods too sparse. The story is about a US warplane filled with gold, money and medals that plunges into a lake in New Zealand in World War II. The plane is lost for about forty years until it somehow flushes ashore and a drunk (pleasence) literally stumbles upon it. First, he collects all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in the city, actually receiving $ 75 each! He does not know that the local jeweler will answer the phone as soon as he sells it and tries to locate information about the plane. Before you can blink, all the attention brings a wealthy scumbag (Peppard) and his followers into the city and they quickly try to force the old man to abandon the plane's position, knowing that there are more than just medals , The business partner of the old drunk (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then run out to win the luck before the bad guys can do it. The resulting action is just not as funny as you might hope. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty awful, apart from Pleasence. George Peppard tries to make an Austrian accent, but that hardly convinces. Lesley Ann Warren is not that bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He basically makes his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And that says something. I hope he made enough money with this movie to repair his front teeth, which looked a bit awkward. I can not remember if he had already straightened her in Wiseguy. The rest of the cast is pretty untalented. Mostly locals, who usually never did much. I think the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the film and the lack of danger. The bad guys are just too nice and stupid to be taken seriously. And honestly, there are NO helicopters in the movie that are similar to those on the DVD cover. And none of the boats in the movie also painted teeth. <br /> <br /> But the film has its strengths. The beginning, which starts as a newsreel and then becomes part of the story, was a nice touch. Brian May's score sounds a bit too much like Mad Max 2's, but he did put in a nice little march they play for Pleasence in some scenes. Sounds exactly like the one in Great Escape! There are some nice helicopter stunts and a great boat hunt in which three stunt men were apparently killed during the shooting. The landscape is still very beautiful despite the grainy appearance of the picture. The thing you'll remember most is the drunken antics of Donald Pleasence. He was almost enough to save this movie. Nearly. 4 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
