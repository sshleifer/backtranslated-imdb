Wait until you look at this ... I mean, even after reading this review. No other movie to date has sucked more than this ... One thing I will not understand is that if you tear down an English movie, why then add your own creativity? With the amount spent on producing this film, producers should synchronize the purchase rights for "Cellular" in Hindi and release the film. Maybe they made profits that way, I think. If there was a chance to score this movie with a 0, I would have done so, and the most miserable performances come from Tanushree Datta and the girl who played the sidekick to Aftab. I do not know if my problem is that I've seen Cellular much earlier than in this movie ... but that can not be a reason to support this movie ... I could go on for hours, but I do not have time to argue about this useless crap of a movie. I do not want to remember those awful scenes from the movie. <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this movie.
