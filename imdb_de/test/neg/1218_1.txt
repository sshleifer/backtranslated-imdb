This is the worst Italian film ever, possibly the worst movie ever! Of course, Joe D'Amato is not a cinematic genius, but many of his films are interesting and worth seeing. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. It's cheesy and boring ... waaaaay boring. If you want to make a movie on MST3k, get Troll 2, if you want a movie to put someone in a coma, you get deep blood!
