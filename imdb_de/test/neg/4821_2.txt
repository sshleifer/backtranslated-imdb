Royalties to look at this garbage and pay with hard-earned money? Humorless, not a hint of laughter, God knows how a BAFTA won it! <br /> <br /> We have been exposed to Eastenders for twenty years now. When, oh, when will the British public see this horrible soap as it is? Crass Pap! This program represents the reality in London's East End no more than everyday life in Beirut and has never done. <br /> <br /> The Eastenders I know (the real ones) are nice, brave, hardworking and loyal. And one of her biggest attributes is humor. It was the Eastenders who suffered the worst of the London Blitz, and Hitler still held out two fingers. And what do we see on our screens five days a week (including the omnibus)? Nothing but a bunch of groaning, wailing whimpering "tottering up the neck," who seemingly do nothing but sit in a bar all day and attack each other. What a great advertisement for the UK that is !! Do the authors really believe in this garbage that they drain? Obviously, it's the woolly-minded part of the public, but then I've heard that apparently everyone can be brainwashed to believe anything.
