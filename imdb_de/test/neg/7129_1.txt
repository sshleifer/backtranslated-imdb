Do not waste your time or money when you see it or even rent it. It's by far the worst train I've ever seen. It's two hours (too long) of your life that you'll never get back. If you are afraid, look at something else. We were with someone who still has nightmares about the Gremlins and she was not afraid. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make this movie an unbelievably bad attempt at making money. Before I start, I want to say that I loved the first grudge! The second, however, is a different story. The plot is very detailed and complicated. In the end, you wonder, "what the hell was this or that." Acting would be considered bad in a B-porn movie. I could give a few examples, but I do not want to ruin it for those who are glutinous, but I can summarize two terrible hours in two simple words ... it is spreading.
