I would hate if someone saw this "true story" movie and I would draw any conclusions about the true event. Few things that did them right were overshadowed by things that were simply not true. Ed Gein did not drag anyone behind a car, never met anyone in the cemetery and killed him, no proof that he had returned body parts to the cemetery. The things he did were terrible enough, why would he make it worse? <br /> <br /> This film is one of my 10 worst eye smears. "In the Light of the Moon" is a much better film on the subject, it is more factual and acting is in contrast to this superior.
