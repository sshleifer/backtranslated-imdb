This is a family movie that takes place in the '50s of rural America about a boy whose uncle kills sheep against his dog drum, not only disputing a family feud, but also a disagreement in the community as their city begins to party This is a movie that tries to be very touching and sweet. His biggest weakness is that Scott Bakula (defender), Ron Perlman (father / drums owner) and the dog were the only people who could really act. (John Shuck and Kathy Garver, "Sissy" from the original "Family Affair," since the uncle and his wife were fine.) The kids were not that good (basically they looked like they were acting), and that It's a Problem When The Movie Really Turns Around Them (Aaron Fors, who plays the bully Donny, makes me think of what actor Russell Crowe must have liked as a child, but without talent, but a lot of ham) , <br /> <br /> Favorite line (spoken by the prosecutor after Scott Bakula's closing speech at the conclusion of the trial): "We're lucky if they do not lynch us." <br /> <br /> Ron Perlman's favorite line (after his son beat the bully): "Now make him your friend, that's going to be the hard part." <br /> <br /> Nice enough to rent / buy used.
