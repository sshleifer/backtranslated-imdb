I completely understand why this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible movie - a cruel thriller with a great story and a high jump factor ... What I do not understand is why THIS movie was made ... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to his role as Hannibal the Cannibal to repeat in this terrible and unsatisfactory movie. <br /> <br /> There is no way to spoil the movie further than to see it, but for those who prefer to waste their money, read on. The movie is absolutely terrible. It is so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes the subject. <br /> <br /> The only way to really enjoy the movie is to stop the clock and leave the theater exactly two hours before the movie, because until then it's a pretty interesting thriller. The repair between Moore and Hopkins is similar to Hopkins and Foster, and the achievements of the other characters are pretty good. But literally after two hours, the movie breaks down into nothing more than a cheesy D-grade horror movie ... he's sick and it's stupid and almost as if the crew has no time to film and ended up on a day together shooting. <br /> <br /> The initial excitement about the unsatisfactory and bizarre ending to Thomas Harris's book prompted director Ridley Scott to order a transcription ... and, frankly, the movie and read the finale of the book, me I do not know, which is worse. <br /> <br /> Please - do not waste your money OR time for this movie unless you are ready to leave exactly two hours later because you are doing this ONLY I will deal with the story of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter be pleased ... with the continuation of the puzzle that made the first movie, and the waiting for this movie.
