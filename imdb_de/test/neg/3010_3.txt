A professional production with quality actors who have never touched the heart or the funny bone, no matter how hard it was tried. The quality of the cast, the stark environment and the excellent cinemetography let you hope for Fargo or High Plains Drifter, but the soup had no spice ... or meat. A 3 (out of 10) for effort.
