This must be one of the greatest horror films of all time. Charles Band has made the best movie of 96 in this little gem seen. Very realistic and incredibly stylized - with a visual flair - David Fincher would be jealous. It's not hard to understand why band classics like Killjoy 2: The Deliverance of Evil, the Regina Pierce Affair and Virgins of Sherwood made Forest 'and' Timegate: Tales of the Saddle Tramps'. <br /> <br /> With a sophisticated history - a tiny body with a big head, a family of crazies performing experiments on naked women controls this movie a little too much for younger audiences and is only for the most educated Spectators think, but for those who see it, Band's masterpiece can convey subtle messages about the human condition. The head is a symbol of lost love and yearning for the inner self that we all need to encounter at one point or another. That's why I was able to engage in this film on a deeply personal level. Although many former critics have compared the film from tape to re-animator and other, smaller works, this is superior to others. It is gorier, but not meaningless. The blood in this movie is well done and used to enhance the plot rather than just getting a cheap scream from the audience. Also the special effects in this movie are absolutely top notch, the best work that has ever been done in a horror movie since ... well ... ever! The work in this film makes Savini's effects look like the work of a blind, limp hobo. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this film is the abundance of frontal nudity that was ultimately not needed. The goal of the composer is to create a timeless epic that may be the greatest Movie of all time would go down in history. Without this little problem I would have given this movie a perfect 10.
