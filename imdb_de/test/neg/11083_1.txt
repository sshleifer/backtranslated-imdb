Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. The person who shot this movie probably never learned to film directly in a bright light. You can not see anything in this movie. It is too dark. The spots where you can see something that the camera is pointing at are aimed directly at a light source, giving you great lens effects. So you still can not see. This movie should have been a radio play or something. Some parts of the movie are actually turned upside down for a crap effect. Low budget movies can be done so much better. And the low budget is no excuse for it. An editor should have said something when he started editing and saw that you could not see anything. Maybe the creators should spend part of their low budget on a preview monitor so they could see what they were shooting. The only good thing about this movie being so dark is that you can not see the horrible spectacle. It also obscures the crappy sfx. People at beginner schools make better films than these. Movies recorded with practical cams look better.
