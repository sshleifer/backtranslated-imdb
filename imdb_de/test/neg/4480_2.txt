OK, it can be seen if you're sick in bed or have nothing else to do. However, the suspension of unbelief necessary to go through this film is important. First, do you believe in today's modern society that college students commit to doing so in such a short time, even if you are a "virtuous" habitat volunteer who likes autistic children? And the two-week romance flourishes in an exchange of letters that leads to John's "conflict", whether it should be resumed immediately after 11.11.2001 ... REALLY? He asks her what she should do. Every guy we know would NOT sit on the brink after these towers had fallen (my husband was one of them and I love him and I'm proud he left). John's character is so flat. He is almost expressionless throughout the movie. He's good-looking, but not a specialist ... he seems to be insecure, not confident, quiet instead of a hellbearer, no tattoos, gets into a "fight" with the dapper lads, which is nothing more than a pushing match all around Film around without headgear ... and there are military technical defects (epaulettes on the head?). The war scenes are stupid ... John and another guy who went off alone ... huh? Then another one is shot and John pulls him up 10 feet and starts helping out before he gets to the area or the arrival or you've got your back against the ceiling ... it's a shootout for God's sake, you do not stop fighting until it's over ... the hell I wanted to shoot John in the back. At home, when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine ... we hated her because she had taken off her shirt in his presence ... WTH? break his heart and THEN tease him to adultery? She is a thug troupe. The best part of the movie is when he drives away from her ... at least he had some self esteem and honor there. All in all an incredible story and we did not generally care about these characters or their love. Dire!
