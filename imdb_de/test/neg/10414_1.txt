This film has attracted me with its unconventional, unobtrusive, real life story. That is, a man of twenty flops in the Big Apple and comes home to live with his parents and a still-weaker brother. Maybe it worked, but there is a problem. And this problem is called Casey Affleck. <br /> <br /> Casey Affleck is almost catatonic in this movie. His acting mantra must "always exercise as little effort as possible". Or "why talk if you can mumble?" Or maybe "put yourself in a coma as soon as the camera rolls". Lips move while speaking? Barely. Facial expressions? None. Muscles in the face? Does something atrophy something? Nothing. Something? Post Code.
