I did everything to get this movie and was fortunate enough to have it on VHS. As a great Gloria Grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Besides, I really can not say much to recommend this picture. The storyline is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is to see Sterling Hayden getting into deeper trouble with his own department. Ms. Grahame always enjoys looking at her (if you like her, like me), but dubbing her song hurts that picture a lot. She works in a dive, so let her use her own voice. It can only contribute to the atmosphere. I have to agree with a previous reviewer. The end is borrowed heavily from THE BIG HEAT. To the point that distracts from the end. I have seen worse movies with Ms. Grahame (MACAO), but I will never take the opportunity to see her on the screen. If you have a movie night and are looking for a second feature film, this is your movie. Enjoy the picture.
