I admit I did not pay much attention to this movie, but honestly I do not think it played a role. In essence, City Council Sidney Fiddler (Sid James) persuades Firecombe's incapable mayor Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) to hold a beauty contest to enhance the city's image. They face opposition from women's liberation expert Augusta Prodworthy (June Whitfield), who is trying to sabotage the competition, but they have an advertising agency Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) and the owner of the Palace Connie Philpotts hotel (Joan Sims). Soon, the young, beautiful wannabe models, including Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor), Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon), Dawn Brakes (Goldfinger's Margaret Nolan), Debra (Sally Geeson) and Ida Downs (East Richard's Wendy Richard) appear. When the girls do cat fight, regular residents move away, but after a while, when they're not making such funny allusions, and William (Jack Douglas) has excessive twitches, he finally reaches the competition, and it's just after that could not be disturbed , Also with Patsy Rowlands as Mildred Bumble, Peter Butterworth as Admiral, Joan Hickson as Mrs. Dukes, David Lodge as Police Inspector, Angela Grant as Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley as Councilor Pratt, Robin Askwith as Larry, Patricia Franklin as Rosemary, Jimmy Logan Als Cecil Gaybody and father's army Bill Pertwee as fire chief had obviously denounced Charles Hawtrey's carry-ons, but where is Kenneth Williams? I appreciate watching Babs and the young, pretty-looking Pauline Fowler in bikinis, but as a comedy, this fails miserably, and the overuse of the swanny whistle gets on your nerves. Pretty poor!
