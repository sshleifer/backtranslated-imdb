Alain Resnais conducts three parallel stories that deal with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. One of them is a kind of opera bordello story in which a rejected architect tries to manipulate a group of people into happiness - only his attempt misses his only goal, the woman he is thinking. In the same unfinished castle that he built, a group of teachers in a more modern history seeks love, as a woman believes in the role of romance inextricably, and the cynical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson by giving her the biggest jerk In the meantime, a few children fantasize on a George Melies-like adventure of a prince who rescues a distressed girl from swamp creatures and then kills the evil king who brings the kingdom of love. The two main topics? Life is a fairytale, and life is not a fairytale. <br /> <br /> What sounds better than the movie actually is. Resnais is the kind of director where the concept is often good or bad, but the portrayal is what matters. The concept is great here, but the film is extremely painful to watch. Sadly out of tune songs, bubbly characters without an ounce, with no trace of pastels - instead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone, Resnais drowns it in a bucket of icing. Add some French philosophy, and you get a strange witch's brew that does not cause any blistering troubles and problems, but just somehow sits wrong in your belly until you pick it up again. Resnais is a risk director, and even in his worst case, you can see that he is trying something that may not work with complete confidence. In I Want to Go Home, he manages to get past annoying characters and somber set pieces by showing some real changes and having some moments of rest to catch his breath. Here he dives right into a fantasy that does not really reflect the imagination, just the wallpaper reference of the baby. The biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie more extravagant than a pop video of the 80s and more kitsch than the musicals of Golden Era Hollywood. The fantasies are more than childish and na√Øve, but the film (with nudity and obscenity) is definitely aimed at adults, a goal he has definitely missed. <br /> <br /> However, he keeps close to his subject and never to back pedals. If anything, this movie is just impressive because it is not excused. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
