Final Draft - A screenwriter (James Van Der Beek) locks himself in his apartment and succumbs to psychosis to write a horror script. Not a terrible condition, but the execution is terrible. This feels like a first year job and writing job and probably is. The director jumps out everything. It should disorient. What it is is annoying. So much so that small movie drones are incoherent. The letter is predictable and does not exploit most of the ideas it offers (bags of oranges). It's like they run out of time and beat them up for the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie is not awesome "oh my god, it's so bad that it's good" bad. It is boring bad and teases you after a long time. James Van Der Beek is not a terrible actor and barely keeps the boat afloat. But for the psychosis the movie is trying to offer, it's too normal. He's just a retired guy who one day sees people and hallucinates things, then decides to be slightly disturbed. Cause follows effect. Maybe something is in the water. Now Darryn Lucio, who plays his "friend", is a terrible actor. He bears the resemblance to Chris O'Donald and is even more annoying, a superhuman achievement. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere offered by the film is good (dull gray and somber), but since that's the only thing the movie reaches. It does not mean anything. This movie wants to be Jacob's Ladder or The Machinist. It's not even a secret window. It's the preppy girl in the class who decides to turn Goth. <br /> <br /> Not annoyingly horrible, but the sheer stupidity of it will ebb away. I have already dealt more with this criticism than the filmmakers did. <br /> <br /> D
