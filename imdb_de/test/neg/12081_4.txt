"Hardbodies 2" is harmless, aimless and less plotting. I would add "brainless" to this list, but the film-within-a-movie gimmick, though not very well done, helps him narrowly avoid this label. The landscape has changed from the California beaches to the Greek islands, and the only recurring actors in the first film are Sorrell's Pickard (the bearded guy) and Roberta Collins (who eventually falls into a mud pit and brings back memories of classic Catfight with Pam Grier in "The Big Doll House"). All other actors are new, but apparently, Brad Zutaut plays the same character (Scotty) as Grant Cramer in Hardbodies. This sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first film, and it does not come close to that in the "Hotness" section. Of course, both Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are very pretty, but the team of Teal Roberts - Cindy Silver - Kristi Somers is unbeatable. "Hardbodies 2" is by no means the worst of its kind, but if you only want to watch one of these films, the original is the right one. (* 1/2)
