There seems to be a whole sub-genre of cheap, tired, old sex "comedies" that say the same old stuff about middle-class couples. A bit like friends, but with softer porn and no jokes. This movie is no exception - it had such familiar situations that I died of Deja Vu. People sat on sofas and made clich√©s about sex and relationships? Check. Monogamy vs. Fraud with a Woman / Man Who Would Never Look At Another Woman / Man In Reality Twice? Check. PORN the BADDIES !!!! 111? Check. Someone who happens to be the only reason you look at this garbage? Check. The lesson, when in doubt, is to make a tired old sex "comedy" about people nobody cares to make a statement that's been heard by everyone three thousand times. That will make your movie. It will even attract some sitcoms with a bad wig!
