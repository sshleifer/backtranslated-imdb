OK, this movie was far worse than the first and the first to be sucked! The zombie make-up was extremely fake! Acting is very bad! And it does not really follow the first one! As I saw this, I always thought that the first by comparison is a masterpiece. I would say, start it on TV, do not spend your money on it! It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the list. I started last night and fell asleep so I looked at it today and almost fell asleep again! The plot was useless, I mean, I get the fact that a small military group is sent on a mission to fetch the blood of the main zombies and bring them back so they can save lives and stop zombies, but they've made it that everyone dies. They made a lot of bad guys that were really annoying. If you ask me, this was a rip off of the evil resident and not a good rip-off. The plot could have done it if the acting was good and if you were actually scared to see what was behind the corner. With these zombies my grandma could have walked into this building and survived! from a 1-10 I give him a 2.
