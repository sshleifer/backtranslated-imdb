I was extremely excited for this movie! My expectations were under control because I had read the book soooo first that I expected differences. What I did not expect were the differences. Starting with the physical appearances of the characters ... like Channing Tantums, there is a shortage of tattoos? N Amanda Seyfried is not a brunette, but I let that go ... the character development was not there at all ... They did not have time to love Amanda Seyfried's character and you could not feel for her or for John when she first met separated ... I thought the two weeks were rushed and I hated that she went first, then it was him. and why did you change Tim from the book? Why did they make him a father and not a brother, and why did they make him look so old, and the film lacked the intense moment when they found out what happened in the end? I want to ruin it, but for those who do you know what I mean.) And what did you do? It was heartbreaking and emotional in the book, and it emphasized the decision of the Channing Tatum character, why they twisted it ... it just looked like a lavish ending ... it was awful ... tha which made me the most disappointed ... the end of the book should have been exactly the same :(
