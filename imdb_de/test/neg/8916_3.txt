I love his martial arts style, he's fast, up close and oh so fast, but it seems his films are becoming more and more crime-based quality of life and less important .... At least some of the films had a hidden meaning or agenda, it had some good redeeming qualities of the character, but the rest was so far away. I was very disappointed. The martial arts also suffers. I hope to see a more engaged Segal in his future films. This film also lacks the maintenance of history, there are too many gaps, so that the thought is lost. Too many things are cryptic without solution.
