This is a really mediocre movie in the style of "Buckaroo Banzai". The cast runs around like "Mad Max" wannabe and seems to share a joke they do not want to share with the audience. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of the guilty amusement actresses who like to stumble across movies, but she's not worth the rent. Spacecraft launches an electric fire and burns a vote of 4.
