Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a "crypto zoologist" (fancy term for one of the self-depleted losers who wants to study extremely rarely - read: non-existent - animals) and his hunter crew manage to capture a chupacabra big, flaky, heavy tangible, fast moving animal. To bring it to the mainland, they smuggle it on a Greek cruise ship, and some idiots open the box it's in, though it's said explicitly that they should not. I think the strange growling sounds that came from within were not good enough for deterrence. The monster then makes the monster thang; He was churning biting chunks of various passengers until the ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies), a square-jawed special agent who pretended to be an insurance agent for some reason (Dylan Neal), a squeaky blond Tai Bo teacher (Chelan Simmons)), a few guys with machine guns and others try to stop it. The main victims (which I think are the comic relief, but it's hard to say) are an old rich bitch (Paula Shaw) with a yippy terrier and a gold digger (David Millbern). It looks like the monster can be knocked out of the game with a single reassurance arrow, but can live through dozens of bullet hits. The Chupacabra design is acceptable (though not original), but the rest of the film is tensionless, surprising or uninterested. A boring "original" movie from the sci-fi channel; They made dozens of movies with almost interchangeable characters and plots, but with minor changes to the creature. Enough now!
