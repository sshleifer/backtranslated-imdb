Despite John Travolta's statements in interviews that this was his favorite role in his career, "Be Cool" proves to be a disappointing continuation of the fun and clever "Get Shorty" of 1995. <br /> <br /> Travolta delivers one Pleasant Performance In this mildly entertaining film, however, the film flattens out due to an underdeveloped storyline, unlikely characters, and a surprising lack of chemistry between the main characters, Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there are some laughs, this atypical dialogue example (which often appeared in the trailers) somehow says it all: Thurman: Dancing? Travolta: Hey, I'm from Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> The film suggests that everyone in the entertainment industry is a gangster or wants to be a gangster who tries to compare it to organized crime. In "Get Shorty," the premise of a gangster being "legitimized" by going to the movies was a clever idea to get out of the water, but in "Be Cool," the business has since seemed to go awry. <Br /> <br /> The film is interestingly populated and the absolute highlight is a "monolgue" of The Rock, whose character is both an up and coming actor and an idiot, in which he has a scene between Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst of " Bring it on." Vince Vaughan's character thinks he is black and is often seen dressed as a pimp - this was quite funny in the first scene in which he introduces him, and almost immediately becomes tired and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Be Cool" For John Travolta Die-Hards (of which I'm one) it may be worth a rent, but you may want to keep your finger near the fast-forward button to get through without feeling that you wereted too much time. Fans of "Get Shorty" may want to avoid this, as the sequel will miss most of the things that made them a winner. I rate this movie admittedly hard 4/10.
