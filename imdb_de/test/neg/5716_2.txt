You know that this movie is in serious trouble when the BEST Act is Arnold Schwarzenegger's support. Although this was relatively early in his career and he was not the best actor compared to Brigitte Nielsen, he is Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this film proves that the only reason she received much attention was her breasts and that she was involved with the incredibly self-defeating footballer Mark Gastineau. Rather than being her "break-out movie," these and a Beverly Hills Cop movie mark about as much as they did in her one-touch career. It was also obvious that the funding assistants also gave up this film because the minor cast (aside from Arnold) is pretty lame and the script is dull, boring and boring. Fans looking for another CONAN movie would certainly be very disappointed in this slow and uncomplicated movie.
