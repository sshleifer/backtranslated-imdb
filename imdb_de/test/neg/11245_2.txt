As one of the victims of the entire Enron scandal, my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. How many times can I say awful? The script was so weak and used cliche after cliche. It seems that the authors have combined this story with some articles about Enron. When watching the movie we could honestly complete about half the lines and thoughts of the one-dimensional figures. I know that this was supposedly taken from a book, but was the book so bad? I do not know what to say. Just terrible. The best thing about the movie? Shannon Elizabeth actually put on her clothes. Apart from that, this movie gets a fat, fat F.
