The movie started well enough and stuck to the mood of the book, though the acting was not first-rate. The soundtrack was excruciatingly bad. Saxophone and electric guitars? It was incredibly inappropriate. The singer was absolutely bleak! In the second half of the film, the story becomes much darker. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey is a dark and formidable place, while the book was disappointingly tame and modernized for Catherine's eyes. A completely foreign and unnecessary character. <br /> <br /> One of the key elements in this book is that the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is much more complicated in his suppression of the ghosts of his children and his treatment of Catherine, which is based solely on money worries. He does not lock his wife or kill her, but he sends Miss Morland alone in a rented coach on a 70-mile journey that is not enough money to pay for the trip home. Only the consideration of her friend, Miss Tilney, to give her some money on the way out saves her from standing. This whole point gets mixed up in the movie. They make the general too dark from the start. <br /> <br /> Peter Firth should not have sung! This part was painful to look at. His portrayal of Tilney was not that bad, but it was dark in places. The book's Henry Tilney made Miss Morland's fantasy a sport on his trip to Northanger, but he was never dark. Firth would have benefited from a better direction. The young lady Isabella played needed a better acting coach. John Thorpe was appropriately disgusting. The striped combination of vest and fur tails that he was wearing was terrible! It certainly fits in with his character. <br /> <br /> I think the movie would have done much better with a completely different soundtrack. It depressed the entire movie with a depressing mood. When I look at it again, the sound is off and the subtitles are on. Maybe I would give the movie a 4 then. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was pretty bad. The picture quality was not much better. Striking is this on a digital TV. <br /> <br /> When I think about what this film could have been, I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.
