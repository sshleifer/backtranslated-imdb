This is the movie that pretty much killed the author in Hollywood. With over $ 40 million, Heaven's Gate is so poorly designed and executed that it would take a lifetime to overcome any area of ​​failure. What complains me the most is that it is technically very bad, an unforgivable sin for the money spent on it. John Hurtt's speech at Harvard is inaudible, as is a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the train station. Some people seem to think that Cimino thought of it as a "style". He did not. It's just a bad sound recording. The characters are not very well drawn except for the four or five leads. In the climatic combat scene, it's hard to say who the bad guys are and who the good guys are. Even at this level, it is impossible to enjoy the movie. The casting of Isabelle Huppert as Madame of the city is a joke, her French accent turns the whole character into a scam. Acting is generally rigid, with no reach or depth of feeling; Even Christopher Walken is bad. John Hurt is the only character with a boast or vitality (although Hurt in his 40s plays a fresh-faced Harvard graduate with bags under his eyes, is obviously ridiculous). <br /> <br /> I think it's overkill. The role skating sequence could easily have been cut, the cockfighting scene is fast becoming a movie cliché, and the last scene aboard the ocean liner is just outside the Twilight Zone. Finally, putting Rod Serling in front of the camera to explain what we just saw would have been the perfect finale. Actually, these scenes are not bad in and of themselves, but Cimino does not deserve to record them because what he has given us as the "flesh" of the picture is so incompetently bad. The cut is bad, especially in the big battle climax. At one point, the same explosion in which the same cartwheel flies out of the blast is used three times. I wish I could say something about this film: a great scene, a great performance, even a memorable line of dialogue, but I can not. It's all just a big unholy mess. The only thing I liked was the camera and the places in Montana that are breathtaking. Even Cimino could not screw it up. This is a long, boring, bad movie for all proportions. And the people who say it's just beaten because of cost overruns are kidding. 1/2 * of 4
