There's nothing to see here. Everything has already been done (and better). Who cares about this woman who is deficient in every way - as a mother as a wife and as a friend? In a moment when she could have taken the road - she jumped into the craze with both feet and held her breath - for no better reason than "me too!" If she is not the pretty and young person she portrays on screen, but rather looks like the human wreck that is represented by our family members, neighbors, and friends who really have supplements, we'd change channels in a nanosecond /> <br /> This movie starts down and goes downhill. Nothing redeeming, no lessons - nothing uplifting in any way. None of the main characters even evoke sympathy, let alone empathy. (Well, maybe the snake.) I would have had more fun if I had closed a door on my hand. Who needs to knock like that?
