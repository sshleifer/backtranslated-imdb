Very stereotypical. Very stupid. The drama gets worse and worse with the show. Do not believe what people are saying about the "realism" that this movie is supposed to portray. It's just a shooting range. An interesting twist to the effect that the VCs who besieged the base were given a human face rather than a malignant malignancy.
