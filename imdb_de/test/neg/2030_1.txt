OK, I wanted to see that because it had some good reviews, but this movie was awful ... just awful. The characters were one-dimensional and nothing the actors could do could ever breathe life into them. The story was miserable ... The wind stopped halfway to a plot ... It's just completely forgotten. The visuals were so cool that they were so boring ... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the floor, 3 minutes of a girl putting on make-up. I do not know what this guy is trying to do ... it's like he has no plot and no dialogue, and the movie just had to run so long that no scenes can be edited using history without much dialogue leaves me this one Movie think that American cinema can never do this. I want to give up watching movies altogether ... Bad Bad Movie!
