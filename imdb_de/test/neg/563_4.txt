This movie should have been called "The Eyes of Alexander" and they should have completely abandoned the Bogart concept. The film began with a light-hearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comic moments with his operationally-oriented face, but after the first 15 to 30 minutes, he turned into a more serious thriller, in which two palm-sized sapphires allegedly laid as eyes in a marble Heads were seen by Alexander the Great for him and him, shortly before his death. The gems are of great value not only for their quality and size, but also for their attachment to the greatest conqueror the world has ever known. As an expert on Alexander, I can say that this is a fiction, but it still makes a good movie. So the film winds up around an early stupidity and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in the foreground as well as in the background (which I liked very much) and ended with a dated shark attack (in '79 - 'you could not become one Movie) 80 without a shark threatening the audience). There is a yacht called Euridice (the young wife of Alexander's father), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus? (It's been about five years since I saw the movie, so I can not remember all the details), Olympia's street names and many others. It was fun to watch the movie just to try and capture all the background details that the director (obviously an Alexanderphile himself) has inserted. When all is said and done, the eyes are called and the camera pans on a bed as the credits roll over. Somehow a decent end. What would have been more fun would have been if they had gone the Indiana Jones Way and had an action adventure. There were many, many real artifacts that could be used to make it more interesting, or, for example, the version of the Iliad that Alexander carried throughout his life, as commented by Aristotle (by Aristotle), even on his many travels through Asia (would be invaluable today). Olivia Hussey (my beloved B-movie actress) was killed far too early to be the lead actress, not Mommas and Poppas' girl ... even though she herself could not see her eyes. If you can find this movie, it may be worth exploring the historic stuff and seeing Olivia Hussey in a hilarious, deadly humor, but beyond that I would pass it on to something more entertaining. <Br / your <br /> your nick
