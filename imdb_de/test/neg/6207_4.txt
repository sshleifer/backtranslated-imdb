This is another Bollywood remake of a Hollywood movie. Hitch ... If I'm right. <br /> <br /> The movie has some great moments where you have to laugh out loud. Apparently only from Govinda, who has become a legend in Indian cinema and will always bring his own A comedy game. Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav. Who is weird like the gangster imitating "Don", an Indian icon of cinema. Lara Dutta is a plus ... I know that I sound flat, but mostly because I have a soft spot for her. She tries to be funny, but it seems to be forced. Her acting is weak ... but she still shines. Salman Khan is cruel, he tries to bring the cool, charming depth, but fails miserably, he goes over acts and screams for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> "This is not the partner, that is, mentally challenged" <br /> <br /> Katrina Kaif is just bad ... not very good. No charisma, no talent ... and I do not understand why people think she's cute ... The plot was far-fetched and I found it hard to believe that Katrina's character was attracted away from Govinda. The only good thing is the music ... "You are my love" was the best in the soundtrack.
