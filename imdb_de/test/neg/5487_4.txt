I liked all the films of Lilo and Stitch. The TV series was not great, but I put my views on the series aside when I saw this movie. And I have to say ... It was bad. <br /> <br /> What I found disappointing was the animation. Yes, you heard it. The animation. I found the quality heavily compromised since the first movie. Its quality was only as high as in the TV series, which I did not expect. If you are looking for eye candy, do not expect much here. The animation could not pose serious moods. Even in the supposedly sad scenes, I did not feel anything for the character, another downgrade from the first movie. <br /> <br /> The next one was the absolutely terrible voice. I found it very, very unconvincing and wondered why Disney, with all its wealth and fame, could not afford speakers with real talent. The dubbing skills were just as annoying as those in the series. I tolerated him in the show because, who would not be tired if he was forced into the Voice Act for so many episodes? I do not know how many episodes there are (theoretically there are 624, but I just can not believe that). However, I thought the voice acting in the film would improve and I was put in the face by the truth that what they could do in the series was already their best the terrible script It was cheesy without salvation, and the authors just try too much. They try to make some jokes, but I just found them annoying. Maybe it was not the voice, but the cheesy dialogues that ruined the sound part. (On the plus side, the soundtrack was not that bad and the mood was pretty good.) Fourth, the problem was with the plot. I predicted everything, and the plot made the characters so unoriginal and suddenly unlikely. They have the aliens getting new positions and responsibilities in the outside space. After the first hype they realize that they do not like it and they miss their old life. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile the evil villain is broken from prison after a very action-packed action scene and breaks into Jumbaa's lab to steal his experiment. The experiment was then cloned into 100 more clones and the hamster wants to conquer the earth. When the main characters find out, they try to stop the evil hamster, but are confronted with the experiment in a cheesy final showdown and have him in a very lame excuse for making the series look cool. The characters then give up their new privileges and return to Earth to continue their lives. Seriously, how many other films have this ending been used already? The storyline was extremely short and formulaic, so do not expect too much of it. <br /> <br /> So Disney has failed in sound, graphics and storyline. The only charm of the series were the original characters and how they managed to maintain the "feel" of the characters, but even that could not save the movie. I tried to like it, I really did, but I rate it at 4/10. Another failure of Disney.
