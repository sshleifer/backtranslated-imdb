I have to admit that I enjoyed the earlier episodes, but probably because I was younger and stupid. I was kind of excited about the return of the family member until I saw the "new" crap they emitted. No wonder, it was just like the old crap. All the lame jokes were there, including the flashbacks, except that this time a joke was added about an old creepy pedophile who is apparently in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE. This is just one of the annoying gags the family is living on, and for some reason people are constantly watching. It's not funny anymore, it's just annoying. Let it die. <br /> <br /> Maybe the type of family was funny at some point, and the cheap laughs and gags were original and fresh, but now it's just not funny anymore. If you find family mates really funny, you have to delay or stay at the border.
