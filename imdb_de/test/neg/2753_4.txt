If you like The Three Stooges, you'll love these 17 minutes. There have certainly been some amusing moments, but as with all Stooges work, this is about their own style of slapstick comedy, and I must confess that somehow the Stooges have never really done it for me. Her slapstick always seemed more angry than witty, and although it was obviously a fake, her antics always seemed to hurt more than to laugh. In this short version, the slapstick revolves around the attempts to find a wife for Shemp (the music professor) because he has just inherited half a million dollars, provided he marries within 48 hours of reading the will. One of his students is interested, but as soon as the legacy becomes known, there are suddenly a number of potential brides, and between them comes a pretty good cat fight. Fans of the Stooges will enjoy it. For me it has all the elements that drive me crazy. 4.10
