Not only did I read the book and watched the movie, I was also stationed on the USS John F. Kennedy as they filmed that. It is needless to say that film crews and actors try to try people who are trying to get their job done. Now for the movie. As a career Navy man, I was quite upset about showing life on board an aircraft carrier. I could take the inaccuracies throughout the movie (anyone who could have lived from a carrier) apart, but that would require pages. One particular scene was when they were in the Combat Information Center (CIC) watching a RADAR contact move across the screen. Every time the contact moved, he beeped. Unfortunately, the device does not beep like this (I was a technician on this device). The book was based on facts, not the movie. The episode in the TV series was just as bad and the Navy finally realized that the support for this series would make them look bad. If you're a marine person, look at it to see a movie about the lives of the wearers in the eyes of Hollywood. If you are not a Navy person, look at Midway or Top Gun. These films are at least entertaining and based on facts.
