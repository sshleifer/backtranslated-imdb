I can not believe the actors have agreed to do this "movie". I could not bear to see it for long, out of fear, I.Q. to lose. Points for every second. I suspect that no one on the network who aired this dribble watched it before it was created. IMDB ratings are as low as 1 for awful scores. It is time to get negative values ​​for such cases.
