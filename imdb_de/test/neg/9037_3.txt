Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys even worse than it is. I particularly remember the scene in which Brian says that he will stop touring and the other guys call him traitor. I did not seem that way, and as the movie initially shows, some scenes are overreacting. A movie about The Beach Boys does not have to be that way, because a lot of things happened anyway. The sad thing is that this film gives a false picture of the guys to those who are less familiar with the group. Hardcore fans like me knew that this is not the whole true story, so I gave her a low rating of 3. However, it's the best movie about The Beach Boys I've seen the other movies so far. If you want the truth, I recommend the documentation Endless Harmony.
