I just saw this movie with some friends who said I had to see it, but right from the beginning I knew it was going to get worse and worse. So I can only give this movie a 1, because the used effects were used so little and were thought that everyone can see that there were no "real" ghosts. I think the worst part was that this so-called "old haunted house" contained a whole range of new items and a few "appropriately placed items". I could have thought up effects that would have looked much better than a chair that was turned over by an Invisible Mind (or should I say wire). Later, when they look through the band of the chair, it is turned in a different way. Oh, that's a big continuity mistake. If this was a really good movie, they would have caught that and all the other "old house" elements. This movie is like a rip-off of the house on a haunted hill and the Blair Witch project is summed up in a poorly thought out and assembled movie. I would be ashamed to bring something out with the bad behavior of actors, effects, and cheap video footage of the girls' rest, and how comfortable the camera is when something "paranormal" happens. This movie is an insult to people who are actually looking for ghosts and getting real ghost material on tape.
