Gordon Scott, with his well-made hair, his hourglass figure, and his funny, pidgin English, must be the worst of Tarzans. As far as the other actors in this mess are concerned, they are comparable to any elementary-grade 4 th grade acting class. I've seen used car dealers in TV commercials who can behave better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the dull Eve Brent) get her lipstick and her eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I know these were made for kids, but wow! The plot seemed to be all right, but the director should have demanded more from his actors. I know that even the Weissmuller films have a few flaws, but this seemed so "low budget".
