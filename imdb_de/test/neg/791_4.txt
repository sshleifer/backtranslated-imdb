Couples having financial problems get a box delivered to their door. If they hit the button, they get a million dollars, but someone they do not know will die. Do you press the button? <br /> <br /> This is a weird movie based on a Richard Matheson short story that has a few chills but is mostly chaotic. The problem is that there is so much going on. It feels like director Richard Kelly did not know what kind of movie he was making. Is this a direct horror movie with supernatural overtones? Sometimes it seems like talking about moral choices, damnation and life after death. Is it a sci-fi movie? There may be many questions about this Mars project. And what do the strange looks of the people look like, as if they were in a big conspiracy? Is this Invasion of the Body Snatchers or a demonic movie? Do not know, maybe. That's the problem. There are many questions, most are fascinating, but too many. There does not seem to be much explanation, and when we reach the end of the film, things seem to stop rather than finish (even openly). I make a movie full of topics and points, but author Kelly simply fills in his script with too many that director Kelly can not handle, or does so every topic or storyline has its ten minutes of screen time and lasts for those minutes it court before it deposits the next piece. It drove me crazy. (I can not get at the two leads, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who are not very good or who rather do not know what to make of the material that is constantly changing.) <br /> <br /> It is an intoxicating mix that does not work (in the end, there are too many holes). I was at the end and suddenly realized that I had no idea what I was watching. I really did not like it, but it's more in one. This is not good, because somehow it somehow gets overlooked. I would take a pass or wait for cable, where it costs you nothing
