Ben Affleck, who is just married, is shaken by a plane crash and becomes involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, who drives herself crazy). Who is to blame for this incompetent, ugly morass? It's so badly edited, as I checked the credits, it was not possible to read the editor's name - it was just to see if the person actually accepted the loan! In addition to clich√©s, gadgets and Sandra Bullock in Raccoon Eye Makeup, the film does not even deal with the creation of chemistry between the two main characters. Laughter does not exist: the scene in the gay bar with Affleck would have gotten a big laugh if she had not been so stupid (the bar's guests - a big bunch of them!) - called Affleck to undress and dig her Money out). It should have no other meaning than making Ben relax a bit, but the direction of the entire scene is wrong. The result is unseen because the idiot editor cuts away ... or was he going to have the whole movie? It's a small moment, but it's typical of this movie, an amateurish piece of pop-art that wants to be a modern comedy but has no guts. It's tailor-made for the bottom shelf in your video library. * from ****
