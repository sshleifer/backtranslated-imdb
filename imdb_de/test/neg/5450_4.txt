Jonathan Demme is such a character-oriented director that it's almost predictable when he draws a Brian De Palma (which Hitchcock calls Aping) when he fails to build up much tension in this lukewarm mystery. Working on a screenplay by David Shaber, Murray Teigh Bloom's novel, Demme attempts to strike a chord somewhere between Alan J. Pakula's paranoia dramas and Hitchcock's hanging particle thrillers. Roy Scheider is retired as a secret agent and mourns the murder of his wife, who is busy avoiding bad guys who want to kill him. Get started right away, but the script is full of threadbare threads and any excitement will fade quickly. There's a visually stunning climax in Niagra Falls, but Demme has little to do with his line-up and even less with that shit of a story. ** from ****
