I remember this bomb in the early 80's. At first it sounded like a great idea. A retelling of an American classic with the help of modern film techniques of the day. There was a bit of back pain in the treatment of the original "Lone Ranger" Clayton Moore. The film studio had threatened with a lawsuit if Moore had continued to portray himself as a true loner. (Moore appeared in children's hospitals as a lone ranger for sick children.) For many Americans, Clayton Moore was just that; the only lonely ranger. I had always thought that if Moore had been better treated, the studio would be able to accommodate both the fans and the heir to the lonely ranger. Maybe even a cameo in the new movie. However, that was not the case and many spectators stayed in droves. The story and the drama were also weak. All this added up to a big box office, and rightly so. Personally, I am glad that the studio has lost a lot of money after treating the real Lone Ranger. They do not treat an American symbol like that.
