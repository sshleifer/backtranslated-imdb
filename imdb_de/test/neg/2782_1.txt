When l borrowed this DVD, I knew for a fact that this might be one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. But to say that it was one of the worst films I've ever seen would make that frivolous. I wonder if there is no legal action against the people who made this film. I mean, the funding had to come from somewhere, somebody had to raise money to be produced !!? <br /> <br /> I would set several production values ​​that led to the failure of this movie. However, this film violated every production standard in the universe. I could not make it through the whole movie because the horrible movie techniques got dizzy. I also can not tell you how many scenes I ended because of the inexplicable, terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> I feel like I've been drawn to life forever. If you watched this movie before receiving this warning, you should consider starting a self-help group with me for the poor who have seen this monstrosity.
