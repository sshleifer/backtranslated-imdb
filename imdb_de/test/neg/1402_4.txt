I've just finished this dreadfully depressing drama and found that in the face of recent dramas like these, the only ones that can be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is just tragic. I would suggest how disgustingly perverted and counterproductive this conclusion is, even though the relationships and perspectives presented in this film are in fact to some extent well founded. Instead, I realized that these films made the resolve of the big "tragedy" trivial when the same boring situations, the same suffocating, dysfunctional families and friendships still occur, only if they were in some form over and over again. Try eliminating previous distortions of family life (which occurred in the fifties and earlier years with very subtle personality and character variations), replacing instead the "reality" of the actual situation. What we actually observe is no longer the dysfunctional, but in fact a normal existence and a set of circumstances that have always existed, but which we may not have known before and therefore were at least ignored. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that too many films have tried to make that point. And in almost identical form. When I read the synopsis for the movie, I immediately thought of 'Ice Storm'. As I watched the depressing life of the Travis family, who repeatedly seemed to endure emotional joking, I immediately remembered "American Beauty." And in a way, the interactions between the parent and the middle kid, Tim, I've drawn similarities from "Igby Goes Down." "Imaginary Heroes" can be a novel experience, perhaps a refreshing experience for an honest portrayal of the character, which, as I said, is often not allowed in the family movies (which is idiotic, considering it was us) These relationships have been shown in films such as "Ordinary People" back in 1980 and even go back even further. For the savvy spectator, however, these films can not offer anything new. In fact, they have become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers trying to outdo the others with the amount of trauma and apathy that they can put into a family (and this also applies to neighbors and friends). In fact, "Imaginary Heroes," the newest in the genre (I think there were enough films to call it a "genre"), brings so many catastrophes and surprises into a family that they would price it daytime talk show host. It is the story of a family tested by the suicide of the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who passionately hated the sport. The youngest son knew that, the father was stunned and blinded by the demand for competitiveness in his all-star son. And it is not clear that mother and sister had a great relationship with the young man. <br /> <br /> Granted, it's no less entertaining (and to some extent exhaustive to those who find this material exhausting after a while)) and the performances are quite good, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. However, I hope that filmmakers who want to be able to supplement the commentary on troubled family relationships (which seem to be coincidental or not always white upper-middle-class suburban families) intend to gain something new through material and insight Offer. I should not see any difference (and therefore no purpose) otherwise.
