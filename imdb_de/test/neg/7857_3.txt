For some of us, director Ernst Lubitsch, who was revered for his underlying impudence and ironic comical touches, was pretty wet when it came to choosing materials. It's not that Lubitsch is overrated - on the contrary, he was probably ahead of his visual narrative - but the projects he has been associated with (or been assigned to) are not necessarily the landmarks of comedy fans liking them label. With "Heaven Can Wait", a screen adaptation of Lazlo Bus-Fekete's piece "Birthday", Lubitsch sits in the lead with the sleepy Don Ameche - and the combination of an anemic plot, a colorless star and a stuffy frame of the director. A wicked man at the turn of the century "falls asleep without noticing it," and presents the facts of his life before Hell's entrance. Ameche ... evil? That was problem number one. The promising opening sequence (set in the Hades lobby) quickly gives way to bleak moods, and the side cast is of little help. * 1/2 of ****
