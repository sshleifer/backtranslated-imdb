This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it - acting, directing, script, cinematography - is terrible. The alien (a human in splendor) claims to be from a nearby universe; It is believed that the scriptwriter meant "galaxy," but did not bother looking for a dictionary to check his conditions. A better title for the film would be "It came from the planet of the conspirators". The plot is overly stupid and almost non-existent. All humans receive magical MacGuffins, which correspond to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions, only to postpone the mere conspiracy. Any thought of the passage of time is ignored. Now it's a few days after we hit the alien, then BAM! Suddenly there are only a few hours until zero o'clock. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie. You'll be stupid if you've seen it. The end is especially stupid and should have been accompanied by someone who called "Ta-Da !!!!" when the screenwriter just casually pulls out of his butt. I think the real alien plot is that this movie is so bad that you get cancer when you see it. If you can watch the last 10 minutes without laughing ("enemies of freedom" - honestly), you are left behind.
