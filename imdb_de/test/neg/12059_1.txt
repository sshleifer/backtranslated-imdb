Camp Blood is an absolutely cruel Slasher movie. We mix with the Blair Witch Project on Friday the 13th and add ... a killer in a clown mask. <br /> <br /> The budget for this film must have been very low, some actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture corresponding to the colorful version of Night Of The Living Dead, and if anyone saw this version has, I am confirmed that it is bad. <br /> <br /> This movie was just so bad. There is nothing in the movie that would be worth even to be seen. The mere fact that I saw all this through has amazed me. Just follow my advice and do not buy or rent this movie. It is terrible
