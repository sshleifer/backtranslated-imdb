What about studios like Paramount who have a proven movie series on their hands and believe they can sneak around with the budget and the formula? Paramount has spent less on this film than on TMP, which sounds pretty good until you find there is a gap of 10 between the films being shot. The resulting TMP cost of 40 US dollars in 1989 corresponded to about 75 million US dollars. This film is the reason why Shatner never had the opportunity to shoot other films. Every time he turned around, the studio cut its budget and made demands on the plot. The fact that this was the only action that Roddenberry and Shatner could agree on in large part made it difficult enough to brief them on the direction of the director, but after all the machinations had been done, everyone who had an erratic history at the end was a lot of badly performed actions had special effects that are not worthy of the original series, let alone an important movie. The most blatant examples: - All phaser effects were pronounced and fake look. - The setting of the Enterprise, which got into the big barrier, was obviously a still image, was zoomed off. At least the popsicle that had cut out the Enterprise was successfully covered. - God "chases" Kirk up the mountain ... Egads, they could have cut just as well, as Godzilla climbed the volcano at the end of "Godzilla 1985", and they scratched the emulsion of the film with thumbtacks. Electric screws are not visible of the endangered Captain Kirk ... Yes, friends, I have a real problem with the look of this last scene, especially. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Star Trek VI was such a redeemer of a movie ...
