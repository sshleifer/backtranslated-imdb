This must have been one of the biggest dropouts of all time. The script was beautiful and could have ended much better. The actors should have played better and maybe I would have given this movie a slightly better rating. Maybe Hollywood should shoot this movie with some better actors and better directors. The boys are disappointed with disappointment, but the movie is bad. <br /> <br /> If I had to look at him again, it would be like torture. I do not want to spoil everyone's opinion with me. My advice is to watch the movie first. See if you like it, and vote (do not choose before you see it!). By the way ... Have fun watching it! Do not just watch, but look to the end :))))))))) !!
