This film was an excellent prerequisite and could have had a fascinating look at racism, attitudes to women at work, and relationships between men and women in England at the beginning of the last century. It just became a weak love story. Worse still, the love story was absolutely incredible. The drama was mostly bad, the direction confusing, but most of all the script and story did not exist. The only thing I liked about the movie was how dark it must have been before the electric lighting. I've really gotten a feel for how little light a candle radiates.
