Michael Feifer writes and manages this fictional story due to the arrest of Edward Gein in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for an outbreak of gruesome murders that sent a shockwave of horror through his rural hometown in the late 1950s. It is believed that his evil spirit and twisted world are caused by his domineering, eager Lutheran mother. Ed was nicknamed "The Butcher of Plainfield." He would rob corpses of fresh graves of women who resembled his mother, and he would have sex with them before dressing them like a deer in his garage. Separate heads whose bodies are turned upside down are his personal trademark. After his arrest, many human skin items would be found in his home. In this film, a young MP, Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman), turns the search for Gein (Kane Hodder) into a personal person when his shopkeeper's mother (Priscilla Barnes) disappears. Acting is much better than the ridiculously liberal narration of documented events regarding Gein. With in the cast: Adrienne Frantz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berryman and Amy Lyndon.
