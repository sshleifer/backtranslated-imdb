The weakest Star Trek movie of the "old" crew suffers from a terrible screenplay and obvious budget shortages, especially in the abused final. The bones of a good movie are here, and Shatner's directing is not as bad as it usually is, but in the end the characters talk out of the style the previous three films carefully set. Lawrence Luckinbull convinces as the renegade Vulcan with its mysterious and mystical powers to influence the humans. These forces account for some of the best scenes, especially for Deforest Kelley, who shines as "Bones" McCoy in this penultimate movie. As good as these scenes are, they do not bring the plot forward and end up as a distraction. A superb score from the ever-reliable Goldsmith and some funny scenes in Yosemite between the three main parts are not enough to overcome the gaping chasms in the plot, and the honestly embarrassing attempts at humor only serve to alienate even the hard trekkies. All in all, a plethora of possibilities that can not be fulfilled have their moments. Look out for the pool table in the bar-racket scene ...
