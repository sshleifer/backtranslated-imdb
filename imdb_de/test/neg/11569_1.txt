I was so "impressed" by Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I tried it here. It's the near future, after the Apocalypse, of course. A wandering fighter named Neo (no, not the Neo!) Joins a group of similar-looking fighters to challenge The Dark One and its subordinate Valaria. Along the way, they encounter mutants, crazy females, canal worms, a large spider leg and a few clunky robots. Oh my! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is barely at HUNT level (or below). With a painful 79 minutes (the box says 90) this is a cheap movie. The sets all have the elaborate design of a carnival haunted house and the costumes prove that in the very near future everyone like John Travolta will dress in the last dance number of STAYING ALIVE. The atomic wasteland is a combination of old rubble and Central Park. The headquarters of Dark One is ominously called The Power Station and looks like a power plant. The drama is generally poor, except for Angelika Jager as evil Valaria. Hunter is a very different level of bad. Sure he's Cherman Accent, she's such an amazing performer that it's the only reason to recommend this movie. She also provides the only nudity of the film in the area of ​​"pleasure chamber" of the film. Ed French delivers the robot effects again, but they are nowhere near as slimy as his work in MUTANT HUNT.
