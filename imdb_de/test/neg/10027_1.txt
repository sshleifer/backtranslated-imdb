Even with the fallen standards of the 80s Slasher movies stinks this. The usual chatter of oversexed teenagers is toward a "forbidden" part of the forest that burned in the 1940s and apparently left one furious survivor behind. Fast forward (actually, you want to rewind through much of this mess) to the present day, where a few campers are slaughtered; The teens follow her, while a half-worried Park Ranger (a sleepwalking Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spends a lot of time tuning his banjo) pay attention to the court's Mill Nature footage upholstery. Finally more murders - but nothing you've never seen before. If you want to see the slaughtered children decide on SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first FRIDAY, the 13th, about this point
