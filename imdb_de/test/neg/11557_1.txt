I think I can say with certainty (without really revealing anything) that this movie does not contain robots. The boys in "robotic costumes" did not act or speak as such, and the evil being behind the whole "plot" is not a robot either. <br /> <br /> The whole thing looks like it was shot somewhere a city park with photos taken in the background, when the director needed his own sentence. I can not even use words to describe acting ... <br /> <br /> This could not even offer the fun ending of "Star Crystal". In short, it is clearly one of the worst science-fiction movies of the 80s and I would be so brave to say "of all times".
