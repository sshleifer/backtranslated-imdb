Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and nobody can play Woodroe F. Call better than him. He was not only the first and best, he was also the only person who could represent his grief and confusion. It was a terrible disappointment and I am surprised that I even looked at it. I can even begin how pathetic they made Woodroe. I understand that he would be old at the time, but everyone knows that he would NEVER let him go. The first movie was the best and the only one I'll ever see. I hope to God that no directors intend to continue or renew the wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval. Without them, the films are a waste of time and money for everyone, including the director. IF YOU DEVELOP ANOTHER UNIQUE PIGEON FILM OF ANY KIND, take away my and billions of others, do not waste your time. If you continue the films, just sand the first in the ground. Many Thanks.
