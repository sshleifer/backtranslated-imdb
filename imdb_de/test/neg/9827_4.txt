"Jefferson in Paris" is a really confusing movie. It portrays Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in a most unflattering light, paints him as a liar, racist and pedophile, but offers no grounds for condemning these sins. That's how it was, the movie seems to say. End of the sentence, end of the movie, the door is behind you. Upon his arrival in Paris with his daughter Patsy, Jefferson wins the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of a gay English painter (the criminally understaffed Simon Callow). A turn of events, however, sends Maria to England, and Jefferson forgets with astonishing speed for a man who had asked her a few minutes ago to live with him in America. <br /> <br /> Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton), one of his slaves who have just come from America, has bewitched him. It's hard to say why he's enchanted - though Sally's undeniably beautiful, she behaves like a silly kid before Jefferson. When she does not tell ghost stories in exaggerated "dark" language patterns, she sneaks around in her bedroom and literally swells in front of her pronounced Massa. <br /> <br /> If her behavior is an attempt to apologize to Jefferson, it does not work. Jefferson is damned even further when Maria, tired of waiting for his letters, leaves England to travel to see him. I have not changed to you, he says, offering weak apologies for not writing. To her credit, Maria immediately sees his outrageous lies. When Sally appears in Maria's presence and she and Jefferson flirt openly (and cruelly, in my opinion), the illusion breaks apart completely. Nobody today believes that Jefferson, Washington and the rest were absolutely role models of virtue and morality. But shall we believe that the learned, distinguished Jefferson would be attracted to Sally, a woman whose most intelligent conversation talks about how "Massa's Frenchie friends" are ashamed "unnastan" and who rubs himself while passing on his front. right in front of Maria's eyes? <br /> <br /> Even if we let this slip, the terrible revelation follows that Sally was only 15 when this affair took place (Jefferson was 41). Oddly enough, this fact does not come to an end when Sally's brother James is blankly angry at her bubble announcement that she carries Jefferson's child with her. Jefferson is as pale as he is told that Sally is carrying his child and patronizingly says that under his protection she would be far better off being free and living with her brother in France. But, he promises, I will release her when I die and our children (including others who come, Jefferson says in a detestable statement by Sally as * his *) when they are 21 years old. Oh thanks, massa, you feel like telling the screen. Big thing. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is yet to come, but with Jefferson's daughter Patsy. She is already angry with him, first because she broke his oath, was made mother on the deathbed so as not to marry again. (Obviously, the woman did not just talk about marriage.) Jefferson also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun as she desired, even though she had previously moralized religious freedom (this seems to mean freedom with him) to agree). <BR /> <br /> After promising freedom to Sally and her brother, Jefferson calls Patsy to testify to the deal and promise to fulfill it if anything happens to him. Sally's brother blurs the impending birth of the child and Jefferson asks, "Do you swear?" Paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant, though she has almost nothing to say. Her face almost strains from the agonizing pain of this revelation, but she controls her grief and whispers yes. If anything, and the filmmakers could have had something if they had emphasized this point more, "said Jefferson" Paris "is an indication of the status of women in the late 18th century, which is even considered as attractive property by men like Jefferson which is pleasant but with no real intellect or souls.We see some tears from Jefferson about a letter from Maria, who obviously tells him where to go, but he soon laughs at a wild dance from Sally, complete with thrown hair and heavy bosom. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this is an accurate portrait of Jefferson or not, but I do not just want to look at it just to see it, this Jefferson is not a hero or even an antihero He's a selfish, lying child molester - and one who gets away with it - not the guy I want to watch a movie about.
