Did the actors and the crew take drugs before they started filming? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing could have filled it. Was there any doubt in the first scene where the co-star was late for dinner, where he was and what he had just done? The tension was over from there. Now it would take another 85 minutes for the puzzle to be solved. I must confess that the biggest hole in the storyline kept me awake for hours and wondered how stupid the scriptwriter, the director, Chrisian Slater, Molly Parker and Stephen Rea could be, at least not to explain, like our murderer who is not Lawyer was, at least could not explain, or a police officer, could go to jail, kill his second victim and tie out a noose, so it looks like suicide ??? I wondered again and again if I had fallen asleep from boredom and missed how that happened. If someone can explain it to me, then please ... and then, why in heaven's name did he kill the third victim? Nothing made sense ... and yet someone thought it appropriate that this film was an official selection at a film festival. Maybe it was a comedy and I could not laugh.
