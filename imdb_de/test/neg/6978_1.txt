This movie is an abomination of everything deserving in filmmaking. The lead actor surprises his audience by not acting at all. We have to look at his pale, soulless face for almost two hours. The jokes are all lame. I never laughed when it was Saturday night. Five of us drank a beer to laugh. Then we put on this and you felt how all the warmth and color was emptied out of the room. The movie ended and the mood was ruined, so we all went our separate ways and destroyed the night! OK so advantages and disadvantages. Pros beautiful location in Hawaii, looks good on Bluray. Disadvantages that work the worst; You can say that all involved think only about payday. Foreseeable bad action. Zero character development. Forced jokes that fall flat. Many attitudes of the guy penis, which is fair, works better than him and has more charisma. May all the creators of this film hang their heads and keep their flaccid males cheap.
