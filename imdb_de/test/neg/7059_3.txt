It was not long after Halloween triggered the Slasher boom to curse the category through ongoing mediocrity. Already in 1983, the genre fought with the release of more than three decent offers per year and from '88 the stalk and slash movie was pretty much the runaway of horror cinema. At that time, all the big studios were aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction, leaving it to independent, mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy created by John Carpenter. Although there were still an impressive number of items on 88 shelves, most of them were poorly produced, and overall, they were extremely unattractive. With these words there were a few gems among the rubble. Scott Mirror's Intruder was a great classic in its uncut form, while Evil Dead Trap proved the cycle was not completely out of style and dizziness. William Lustig's Maniac Cop was successful enough to launch a franchise, and Dead Girls and Mirage turned out to be the last bewitching breaths of life in the offending category two years later. <br /> <br /> It was the ongoing release of Schlock like Berserker, Blood Lake and Rush Week, who cursed the Slasher movie for eight years of darkness. It took the big budget flamboyance of Wes Craven's Scream to ensure the necessary revival. Since I had never heard of Demon Warrior before I came across it unexpectedly, I immediately assumed that it was part of the low Brahms refuse that led to the fall of the Slasher phase. However, the film offers a fascinating premise that, in addition to Scalps and Camping Del Terrore, is a welcome addition to the Indians-influenced catalog. <br /> <br /> A truck drives up a forest road and out of two ridiculously dramatized rednecks. The Hillbilly Lumberjacks are on the canvas for only ten seconds and are then killed by an invisible threat. Next we meet a troop of five young adults who travel to the same location to train a few firearms. The area is owned by Neil Willard and passed down by three generations of his family. His grandfather stole the land from an Indian medicine man who allegedly left a curse on the property. Legend has it that a demon warrior hunts the forest with an extreme hatred of humanity and avenges himself for the vengeance of those he blames for plundering the tribal home. It would be no great joke if those myths were a lie, as regular as a clockwork, that a maniacal assassin is waiting for blood. Will the kids be able to stop this phantom killer? <br /> <br /> Demon Warrior is best described as a cheaper re-imaging of Fred Olen Ray's Scalps. The bogeymen from both films are virtually identical and the director even gives a scalping sequence to confirm my suspicions. Things start promisingly with a crunchy 13th style ego film and some shock jobs composed by director Frank Patterson with finesse. Thomas Callaway has done a good job with photography, and the tribal drums score is a refreshing change from the more traditional synthesizer trash of the late 80's. Flourishes of suspense are contrasted with a few credible directorial ornaments and there are even some attempts of humor. The killer looked successfully scary in demon attire, and the insertion of an arrow and an arrow as the main murder weapon was a skilful touch of the director. Fred Olen Ray's notorious Slasher was notable for his stark and credibly disturbing effect atmosphere. Unfortunately, although he was produced on double the budget, the demon Warrior never comes close to the film he so desperately mimics. It is rumored that the majority of the actors were drafted by Texas Baylor University and not even paid for their inclusion in the film. It goes without saying that the drama is adequately abysmal. I especially enjoyed the funny John Langione? an "Italian" Native American (do not ask) that surrounds as many emotions as the trees in the forest that surround him. Warrior began with some credible moments of the director, which actually led me to believe that this might be a welcome addition to the Slasher Index. Unfortunately, the venomous cocktail of hideous actors and an end plucked straight from Stupidsville changed the original plan that I had for evaluation. It is a shame that the drama was scraped off the floor of the Thespian barrel because Demon Warrior showed potential flashes at times. <br /> <br /> All in all, is Patterson's film a mix of ideas? Some of them were good, but mostly they were amazingly mediocre. Since this was released at a time when the Slasher genre was watered down to avoid the happy shear sensors, there's really nothing to mention. Even the scalping sequence is relatively tame compared to Olen Ray's graphical representation. Demon Warrior has the strange moment of credibility, but not often enough to justify a purchase. Not as bad as the Berserker mentioned above, Blood Lake and others, but not really good either.
