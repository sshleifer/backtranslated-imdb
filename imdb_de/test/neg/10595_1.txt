I saw this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears. I guess I was looking for a flashback to the wonderful series that I remembered. I was religiously watching The The Squad TV Show and it was awesome. It was action packed and the relationship the three of them had with Greer was adorable. There was nothing here. When Greer was murdered, they came up with the idea that these three could be less interested. The actor who portrayed Pete is a really good actor, but he wrote his part as if mentally challenged. Pete in the TV series was calm and serious, but also had a funny side. They had behaved this guy as if he was either taking drugs, drunk or just ignorant. I would not recommend this movie at all. Especially if you were a fan of the TV series. It will be a complete flop.
