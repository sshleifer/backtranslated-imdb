Has anyone else noticed that this version is essentially a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 release, with some scenes taken out? I think less of a movie that does that and shows a certain lack of creativity. Fairly, I tend to be biased against Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the movie seems to be a cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and sweet, albeit somewhat awkward in presentation and transition, and then this version took over the script, the music, and even much of the scene that blocked the earlier version. I do not understand the point of turning the movie over again, as the recovery method was basically to repeat George Cukor's film with everything except the people who work on it.
