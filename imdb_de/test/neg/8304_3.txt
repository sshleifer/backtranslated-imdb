Impressive. Just wow. Never before have I seen a horror movie that seemed like a bad fan-fuck scene someone wrote in 20 minutes. And then I happened upon "Lady Frankenstein". In this movie, everything you know about Frankenstein is turned upside down ... and not in a good way. If you've seen this movie, you've either stumbled upon it on Italian television, or you've set the synchronized version of the 50 Chilling Classics box like mine as number 24. Because they are not very good. enough of it but on the movie. <br /> <br /> It starts with Dr. Frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant who ... for some reason obviously does not annoy. His college graduate daughter (?) Shows up and explains just how she graduated from medical school. At that time there were so many female doctors. So she says how she wants to help her father with his job and he says no. And then he makes the monster and it kills him. So she mourns for exactly 7 seconds and then tells a story with the wizard, as it was a burglar. The monster escapes and rages. <br /> <br /> OK, I really can not believe that Dr. Frankenstein killed so early in the movie. he dies like ... 20 min. and then take over his daughter. what .... does not make much sense, but for sure. <br /> <br /> So, Lady Frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster that is raging now ... is to make another monster! oh yes, how I love their logic. So your new monster gets the body by killing someone and putting the wizard's brain in there ... I know. Just nod and join in. So the monsters meet and make it out. I love how the wizard asks, "Why do not we just let the mobs kill you?" and she answers, "You would not know how to kill it!" and in the end he kills it with an ax to the head. Haha. oh yes, nobody else could have found out. in the end, the brain has exchanged new monster kills frankenstein. The end. <br /> <br /> This movie was just ... weird. it was serious, as if someone had written a self-inserted fanfic. There is no other way to describe this movie. There were also some strange naked scenes. So this girl had naked sex in the park with her boyfriend, the monster picks up the girl and the man leaves. Haha. nice guy. She fights a bit and dies ... To be honest, I really do not know what she died of. But anyway. It's Lady Frankenstein. It does not make sense. <br /> <br /> This movie had many "Why?" Moments to the point that I just gave up. Films should not do that, but for some reason I see that it's more than I probably should. <br /> <br /> So the last word is not the worst movie I've seen in this package, but it's a bit boring and full of holes and random things. <br /> <br /> Lady Frankenstein gets 3 out of 10 Frankensteinszenen
