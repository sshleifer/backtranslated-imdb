It's really sad to see a once-great director like Deodato deliver such a second-rate giallo like this one. This movie was so horrible that he put an end to his film career. The box is lying, this is not an "erotic thriller" hell during the 97-minute film run, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us a nipple! I thought it would improve as soon as William Burger showed up (in one of his last roles), but his character is pretty abruptly and lame killed. This movie is pretty much failing in every way. Claudio Simonetti's music is little more than noise and the plot made no sense at all. For some reason, Lewis is being terrorized by ghosts who attack with cell phones. (?) In the end, the characters seem to have forgotten the last 90 minutes of hell they've been through, and laugh casually as they make the evil spirits sick of someone else, Lewis's ex-boyfriend. What?!? This movie has done little for me except annoying me ... and half boring me to death. If you want to experience real 80s deodato fun, check out THE BARBARIANS or THE ATLANTIS INTERCEPTORS. Let it rot in the video house. Argento could do a better giallo than this!
