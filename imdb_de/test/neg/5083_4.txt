This is the award by which I have lost all respect for the Hugos. <br /> <br /> If such an "excellent" panel can not recognize the obvious storytelling issues of Battlestar Galactica, is the value worthy of their award? The answer: not much. <br /> <br /> Award-winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence, none of which is attested in BG, in this or any other episodes I've ever seen. <Br /> <br /> Filming in a drab video is not "artistic", it's just cheap. Shaking the camera is not "creative," but vomiting and lazy as it can. All BG has shown is how corrupt most award-winning "academies" really are and how easy it is to buy awards with a lot of PR money.
