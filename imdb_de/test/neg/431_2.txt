This is a title in search of a movie. It's a pitch that sounds lucrative for some studio managers, and the rest is damned. When this movie was made, there were two things that CGI did not do well at all: people and coat. Furry people should not look good when they are rendered by the computer. This is the only example I can think of, where effects for a well-funded sequel have taken a big leap backwards, which came in significantly behind those of the original movie. For the protocol, the design of the werewolves helps little. The filmmakers apparently could not decide between four-legged and bipedal, tried to do both, and ended up with a creature that looked just as awkward in both directions. The transformations are anatomically nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high forehead and a short snout acts like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the blatant part. This is a movie that already exists to make money from its predecessor. I'm not a fan of Landis' original movie, but boy, does that look good? If you thought Landis' humor was a bit forced, try some of the tormenting attempts here. The gum scene, the corpse humor, the dog, the ... you know, you just have to watch how you bite yourself. Thomas Everett Scott is on vacation in Europe with his friends and decides to take a break in the middle of the night from the spectacle of the "ugly American" and the bungee jump from the Eifel Tower. This results in him saving a young woman (Delpy - Julie). This is not worth it just to become a star in America (ask Rutger Hauer), as she went to her death leaping stereotypes, gaping storylines, a jumbled ending Anyway, the studio just worried that the title would probably make millions of American Werewolf in London fans give their money. Most of the time they were happily wrong.
