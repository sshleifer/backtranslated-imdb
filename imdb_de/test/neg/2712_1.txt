This is the epitome of the bad movie of the 80s, unless you are a girl before puberty. To ride on a big name like Madonna, an act that physically attacks the intelligence and the humor that are most appropriate for a nursery school. If there has ever been any doubt, I think that crap of a movie clearly shows Madonna's absolute lack of acting talent and made me feel very embarrassed. The only thing I can not believe is that they ever let the director get anywhere near another movie. Madonna spends most of the movie dancing like an infantile doll and talking like a baby. It is painfully obvious that the only reason this movie was ever made was that Madonna was a big name in pop music at the time. DO NOT NOTE THAT THIS BAD TEMPTATION IS SEEN AT THE POP STARDOM. Stay away at any cost!
