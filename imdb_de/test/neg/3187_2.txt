I'm afraid I only saw the first hour of this movie because it really seemed like pointless TV waste and talent waste. Liv Tyler plays a magnificent beauty, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give the role a real kick. As she slowly seduces a bartender into a criminal life, it's hard to really worry about the characters. Even John Goodman delivers his faint comic book lines without panic, as if the humorless humor had to be recited slowly if anyone missed the joke. The end should be good, but the starter and the main course did not let me know.
