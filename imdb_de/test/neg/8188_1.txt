Joe Rogan's whole plot is a bile-drenched profanity. He's a smoker who joined Fear Factor and thought it was a joke. He said he would attract people because he did not know how stupid people would be. The producers of the show he explained assumed they played tricks on unsuspecting applicants to see how far they would go. The level of evil is a little twisted. Mr. Rogan's special is only filled with the gestures of a person who is too good for ordinary people. I found him offensive and his stuff can be heard by more talented comedians like Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. Rogan even makes a five-minute sentence for the N-word. Overall, ignore this special.
