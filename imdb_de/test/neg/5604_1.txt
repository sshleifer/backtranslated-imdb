What a production, what a waste of screen time and money. Here's what some European producers think of a scifi movie. Take former model Alexandra Kamp, a pair with a US C-class actor, and get one of Harry A. Tower's most famous film producers. Towers then finds an obscure Munich Prod. House, tandem communication, Rola Bauer, and then you mix everything without a script and you get "Sumuru" - an invaluable gem among the worst movies ever made! Get a living people and do something else, whatever you do, please do not watch movies !! To top it all, the producers went to South Africa to film. On the screen, you'll see a huge sand pit where the "action" takes place, between extremely bad actors and extremely bad things that every movie student would do better.
