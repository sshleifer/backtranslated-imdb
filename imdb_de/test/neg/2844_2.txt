This was a very short episode that appeared in a 1971 Night Gallery show. The episode featured Sue Lyon (by Lolita) and Joseph Campanella, each playing a babysitter and a vampire. The vampire hires a babysitter to watch his child (which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster) while it's blooding at night. The babysitter is unaware of the vampire's appearance when she sees him for the first time, and only begins to put two and two together when she realizes that he has no reflection in the mirror, a curious collection of books in the mirror Library about the occult and hear strange noises while the vampire is talking to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she originally thought was intended. She pops the door out, the vampire looks confused and the episode is over. I do not know what it was to make such an abridged episode that lasted only 5 minutes. They would have had to extend the previous episode by just the same 5 minutes and skip it. A total wasted effort.
