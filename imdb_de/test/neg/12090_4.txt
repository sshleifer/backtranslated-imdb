I wanted to like this one - the situation was rich and the environment unusual and interesting. The story, however, is swamped with childish female Gothic romantic elements that are hard to swallow. The director is biased towards the "Goy" characters - content to turn them into grotesque cardboard cartoons - and inexplicably indulgent to the heroine's adverse behavior. The possibly interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really dealt with. <br /> <br /> Feminist filmmakers will gain more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to bring the heroine all the sympathy and honesty with problems. This movie is more like "The 7 Pieces of Gold", another serious failure, more than "The Piano" - a true story of passion.
