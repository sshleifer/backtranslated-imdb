My husband brought this home from the video store so I could watch something while he was sick home. The kind of sick one never focused on a book, but a stupid, light, romantic movie sounds just right (that and a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he meant it well. <br /> <br /> My first thought (as well as some others posting here) was that the house must be a must ... it's not just isolated on the beach, but berths in the loose sand and so close by the sea, that the surf waves go directly under the house! This looks so obviously dangerous (in Hurricane Country, in THE FALL), so potentially catastrophic that I was sure filmmakers just gave the whole thing CGI (or used movie magic to throw a sweet B & B into the surf) <br /> But I have to tell you, thanks to "the interwebs" I can say that the house "Serendipity" is very real, yes it is near Rodanthe and apart from a few window displays and shrubs mostly looks like this in the movie. You can even rent it out of season for $ 1710 a week (or about $ 3850 in the summer)! Do it! But ... interestingly, the house has serious problems. The second thing I noticed after "washing away" was "What about the electrical wiring in this surf?", And "Serendipity" was sentenced to an interruption of sanitation caused by flooding of the ocean. (They rebuild.) <br /> <br /> And the house is not from the Civil War. Not to mention that Viola Davis is playing the "cliche of black best friend" (ungrateful role for a good actress, last seen in "Doubt"), not so old that her grandmother could have made something in the Civil War! HELLO! That was 150 years ago! Try it great - great! (In reality, "Serendipity" was laughably built recently in 1988.) The base film is based on a typical Nicholas Sparks weir, which means a lot of coincidence and a chance predictable event. It is also very much geared towards "women" - we women who love B & Bs, antique antiques and bells and whistles ... who dream of romance and men who look like Richard Gere and dance in the moonlight. Do not give us the plot or a thoughtful character development; Just set up some mechanisms and apply the love scenes! <br /> <br /> Gere plays a plastic surgeon who lost a patient to a benign cyst on her cheek during routine surgery. Of course, she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA, so you wonder right away why the surgeon is to blame and not the anesthesiologist! HELLO! where is the guy? Why does the wrong doctor feel guilty? <br /> <br /> Gere has come to pout and confront the wife's husband, and stays in the secluded B & B ... who should be there, why the ONLY OTHER PERSON IN INN ... Diane Lane ! She is a lonely divorce with rotted children and an ex-husband who wants her back. While she's trying to decide, the best black girl of the stereotype has her job as hostess at the B & B. Well, in the real world, the doctor would look like this, if it ever happened, Ernest Borgnine ... and the lonely divorce like Rosie O'Donnell. He spent his holidays chasing 22-year-old girls on the beach while she pouted and thought about dieting. However, this is not the real world. I digress. <br /> <br /> The couple confesses everything, falls in love, a hurricane strikes ... they love each other, fall in love, he has to go away, he dies and she cries a lot. The end. <br /> <br /> I saved you from that; Now you do not have to torture yourself or male acquaintances (husbands, sons, friends) when you sit by this coach. Very tiring. <br /> <br /> Someone else asked why Diane Lane is a perfect little woman (the filmmakers seem to like to work, because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her, but she does.) And not exaggerated, so she does not threaten) is constantly covered with large tarpaulin scarves. That would make sense if she were chubby, but she is not. <br /> <br /> Anyway, someone will throw a nice paisley scarf over this movie. So we do not have to see it. Conclusion: Read a book, unless you are too ill. If you are too ill, you fall asleep.
