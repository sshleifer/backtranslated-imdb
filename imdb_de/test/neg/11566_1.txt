In fact it was terrible. The head chick who gets topless obviously slept with the director at that time. It was filmed in a warehouse that is probably owned by a family or friends. Also, they did not decide to make a story. Sure, these are ways to cut costs, but are they smart ways to keep costs down? No, they are not. At least they could have found a middle school student in a creative writing course. These children had at least a lesson about the structure of the story. At least they could have gotten used to the 3-act structure, but the action obviously was not a priority. It was embarrassing to see those idiots walking around in funny clothes that was stupid for the 1980s. The fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably evidence of the limited distribution of this film. Had the actors actually seen the end result of their hard work, there would have been a number of people waiting to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 10/10 stars, but only this deserves 1 to be released at all. This movie should be shown to students everywhere. It's better than 90% of the student films I've seen, and wow this movie is a piece of shit.
