I'm shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and the IMDb. It belongs in the $ 2 container in your local video store. To say that this is a B-movie is extremely generous. <br /> <br /> Aside from the fact that there is not a single redeemable character that is just a little better than average, and an ugly 80s-style image quality, the script for this film is boring and lifeless. This movie is not only boring - it is pathetic. (Granted, there is occasionally some mild chemistry between the two main characters.) Even the final turn of action - rather the only turn of action - does not save this film. <br /> <br /> Rent "Diamond Men" "if you must, but do not hesitate to turn it off as soon as you are judged by its worthlessness 2 out of 10.
