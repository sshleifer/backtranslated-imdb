Yesterday I saw this TV production and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I did not have much expectations for a TV production, but the entire movie was painless and did not end. I felt like it took 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. Every minute was a long fight, and I was really struggling to keep the switch off. <br /> <br /> The film is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who gets many AIDS patients and most of them die during the movie. It is hard for Verghese to live with, so that his family will be punished with his frustrations. However, this film has problems showing both sides, it focuses mainly on talking to patients, and sometimes we see flicks from home, but we do not get much. The difficulty of showing more than part of Vergheine's life does not improve with the bad acting of Naveen Andrews, a man I (hopefully) can not see in any good future movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was 7.6 because of the topic (taboo?), but I'm sure there are better movies on the subject in the market. Stay away from this movie, it does not earn more than 3/10. <br /> <br />
