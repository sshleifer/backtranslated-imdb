On the verge of unbearable. Somehow I was only slightly interested, but was it because I really wanted to know what the "secret" is (which I should say is damn obvious) or because I was hoping that Scarlett Johansson would put on a sexy outfit ? This film is poor and, above all, a shame for lonely, alcoholic literary scholars of southern literature. Travolta wants his Oscar to be so bad that he is ready to cry drunk in the bathroom after he has drained blood. I'm sorry buddy. , They were more believable "Stay alive". Not everyone can pull a Peter Fonda into "Ulee's Gold". If you want the brave antipersonal Oscar of the counterart, you really have to act um. , Do not just pout on the screen. Stop this director before he / she (the name is not clearly gender-matched), again directing!
