This movie has a really weird mix of genres - toilet humor and action in one. It does not really take off - it would have to stick to a genre. The best thing I can say about the movie is that the dog is cute. <br /> <br /> The most troubling sequence is in the middle of the movie, as Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop at a hunting lodge / motel. I am not sure what the meaning of this sequence is - it seems to be completely unfounded in extreme cases. The owner of the hunting lodge ("Charlie") is a very nerdy looking type. For some reason, Moses begins a conversation with Charlie about porn, cumshot, gay sex and sex in three ... Charlie's photo of his "wife" seems to be Charlie dressed in train. There is no reason for this really youthful dialogue and this scene. Anyway, the whole scene seems to be focused on the moment when a naked Moses with Carter's gun lands on his bottom and Charlie sees her through the window. It smells like schoolboy humor about homosexuality - horrified and nervous at the same time - which I do not find funny at all. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who always raves about Adam Sandler's films. This is the first one I've seen - after that I'm not sure if I want to see more. By the way, this is my husband's report - he saw Happy Gilmore and he tells me it's pretty good - maybe I should give Sandler just one more chance. <br /> <br/> Countess Skogg
