This movie and the first AvP movie are featured in the entire Aliens and Predator franchise. <br /> <br /> It's horrible movies, badly played, poorly scripted and terribly directed. They seem to be just a desperate attempt to make money out of the good name of the original aliens and predator movies, but instead of delivering a well thought out, high quality production, they've come up with the predaturd. <br /> <br /> The original Alien / Aliens / Predator / Predator 2 movies were great. They redefined the horror / thriller genre by inventing these crazy (and still believable) creatures who played the role of the "serial killer" unlike a human. <br /> <br /> These films only milk the franchise and do nothing but darken the name. <br /> <br /> The Aliens Vs. Predator comic books were brilliant and had a great story. They were loyal to the Alien / Predator mythology, not joking around in the original stories, etc. ... Why did not they make the comic a great movie? Because Hollywood is idiots, that's why.
