First of all, this is one of the worst "erotic thrillers" I've ever seen in my life. Of course, like all erotic thrillers, it's about a brothel and a brothel. This of course makes the simulated softcore sex appearing every 10 minutes "related". What ever. <br /> <br /> For a moment forget that this was never meant to win prizes. The actors are terrible and their line reading made me flinch. The woman who plays the policewoman is so bad that it is indescribable. She must be a really REAL friend of the guys who set the film up for this terrible adventure, if you know what I mean. Other than that? I suppose, if you are really drunk and need something to laugh about, this would be a perfect movie. And if this is the case, I recommend fast forward to all scenes with the female policewoman. What's that accent, Brooklyn? Hilarious!
