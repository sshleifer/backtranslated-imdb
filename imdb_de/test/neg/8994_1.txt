Ram Gopal Verma usually makes such a biscuit formula, which is borne by a Hollywood movie. Every film after Shiva is in the genre of cookie cutters. Sometimes he makes a really horrible movie like this one. <br /> <br /> In the first 55 minutes we are introduced to the only two characters, a fighting gymnast disguised as a trained dancer (go figure!) and a would-be actor trying to make him rich in Bollywood beat. You fall in love, zero becomes a hero, dancers / gymnasts get no rest, gymnastics, anxiety, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, anxiety, song, dance, anxiety, a little more gymnastics, ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you sleep fast again. And that despite the HOT SEXY HOT HOT HEX HOT floor of the leading lady-gymnast-cum-dancer. <br /> <br /> But hey, you're not alone !! The editor, the director, the photographer, the entire cast and crew sleep throughout the production. The only difference is that they were paid to sleep while you paid for the crap, so you lose. Ha, joke is on you. You're not sorry for yourself, but for our poor girl, when she's wearing sexy sex suits of leotards and sportswear every day in her high-rise penthouse. Puh-leese, when will the poor guy get a break, she's STARR-VINNNG?!? Antara Mali can not act. RGV has lost his marbles. Abhishek did not try. No plot No story Nothing. She must have paid RGV plenty to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to the free gym class on his casting couch. What a great deal. No acting career needed. <br /> <br /> Of course, such absolute garbage can only be "Made in Bollywood"!
