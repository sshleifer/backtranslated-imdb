I really wanted to have this movie because I love Troma and loved the trailer and loved "Ghouls", another one of Ferrin's movies. There were some almost good moments, as the oldies love a song that plays over the car accident scene, and a scene at the end where the protagonist is closed. But on the whole it was just boring and mildly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The "unimaginable" shocks Ferrin brought up were truly predictable and worn. Poop, murder of prostitutes, incest. Could have been good, but done bad. Unsure if she insulted, amused, or tried both. Not at the end either. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: We're watching Troma movies because we want heartfelt movies. This movie did not always feel like it had a heart. There were some good scenes, but in the end it was boring and uncomfortable.
