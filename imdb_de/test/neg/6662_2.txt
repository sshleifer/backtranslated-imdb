I understand the draw and appeal to a different kind of film, and I'm a big admirer of films with little dialogue, but still this absolutely terrible. I was in the Scottish Highlands and found the lack of Scottish accents in the characters disappointing. Theoretically, this plot was strong enough, but the cheap sets and the lack of a single realistic character prevented the movie from getting going. I feel the use of silence to create an atmosphere that only works if you have actors who can express a certain presence without speaking, and these actors certainly can not. If you want a silent movie that captures this presence, try it (Le Dernier Combat). There were very few films that I could not finish and this was one of them. Absolute dribbling!
