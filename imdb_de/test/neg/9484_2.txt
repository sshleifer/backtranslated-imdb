A stupid movie with a stupid plot. It feels as if they have thrown every conceivable clich√© into a blender. First and foremost, I liked the part in which two teenagers get the French president to cleanse the water. Because we all know how much America is dedicated to preserving the environment. Kyoto, anyone? And the French chef, who has apparently never seen or tasted a hamburger ... That's why people believe that Americans have no culture. That and the fact that we meet your children when they come to Europe to "see the world" (ie eat at McDonalds in foreign capitals) as much cultural enlightenment and good manners.
