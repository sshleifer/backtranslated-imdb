Atmosphere and loud dialogues do not trigger this overrated classic. Boyer is a French thief hiding in the Kasbah of Algiers while police are trying to figure out how to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls in love with Lamarr and tries to find an escape route. The film is just beginning and never really goes on. Somewhat reminiscent of Casablanca, it lacks entirely larger themes than the man who seduces a good woman. It's all conversation, with endless scenes of Boyer carbonizing his idiots and courting Boyer Lamarr in the shadows. Personally, I was not interested in Boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was not there. <br /> <br /> The 1930s actors stumble across the muddy conspiracy as Boyer's henchmen - men who clearly do not belong Algiers Sigrid Gurie is Boyer's wildly overreacted jealous girlfriend. His shameless woman-chastising her is not a good sign of a future he could have with Lamarr. Particularly bad is a long sequence in which a sub-root Boyer tells how another henchman was captured. It sounds exciting ... too bad we did not see it ourselves. The end is completely anti-climactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a Hollywood happy ending. that does not stop it from being sappy.
