The fun that was present in the other "films" has virtually disappeared with this third effort, meaning that the production value of the garbage is showing through more than ever. Another 2-party ("The Chinese Web") is pumped together, which has too much padding, not to mention weak Spidey actions that take place in uninspired places like a parking lot, an apartment and a printing press. Nicholas Hammond is as loveable as ever, fighting bravely against the drab production and lame performances of the rest of the cast. The conspiracy in which Peter and Spidey help a Chinese official defeat the corruption charge during World War II by finding three Marines to testify to his innocence does not make the comic book come to life, does it?
