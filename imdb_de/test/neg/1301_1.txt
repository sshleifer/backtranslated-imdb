This movie was just on two evenings on ITV1. Someone actually bought this because of Robert Carlylse. OK, I missed the start. But what I saw was so bad, I thought, no ... I looked embarrassingly at the stars that were there. Nothing was based on reality, I doubt that things would evolve like this movie. Everything was bad on this movie. OK, cgi .. but no reality. The writing gave the impression of a cliff hanger. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. Yes, formulaic. I could not guess the end. From what I saw the military had the upper hand, the people who did the heroic stuff had little time for their thing. It just would not have happened like that? It was worse than leaving his head at the door. It was annoying, as someone else said .. yes, right .. of course that would have happened ... not !! The credits mentioned Quebec and Canada. So it was a coproduction, the affected third party was missed. I have to check this website. Normally I'm not that critical, but that annoys me.
