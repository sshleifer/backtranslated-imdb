I like underground movies when they have something to say or to show. I've tried to like "trash". I've tried to see an artistic achievement or an interesting depiction of New York life in the early 1970s. Or at least entertained by it? But the film stinks and can not be called art or entertainment. <br /> <br /> "Trash" is basically an excuse to expose Joe Dallesandre's naked body for 2 hours while hitting other uninteresting, annoying characters (I agree, that's a beautiful body, but no excuse for a whole movie about it, right?). Holly Woodlawn, as Joe's girlfriend, brings some good laughs in the end, but then it's too late to save those wasted hours. Lou Reed's classic song "Walk on the Wild Side" is a better portrayal of these people and this time, even though it's more intriguing than they actually were. 1.5 / 10.
