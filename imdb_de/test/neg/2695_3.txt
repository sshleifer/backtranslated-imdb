If you look at this movie and then hear the comment, it is clear that Michael Radford does not understand this piece. The first indication that he does not fully understand the work is that he tries to make the film in 17th-century Venice. What sounds really strange, yes, the misunderstanding of the movie would mean trying to make the movie as accurate as possible. Anyone who has studied Shakespeare knows that culture and values ​​are always in contemporary England, though he plays most of his plays in exotic locals. This does not hurt the movie, but it lacks necessary knowledge. <br /> <br /> Where Radford kills the movie, the movie makes him so serious. He manages to suck every joke out of the script and leave the entire production. Every ounce of passion is beaten out of the characters. Even Shylock's speech, "Let's not bleed," is a mild, awkward cry of a choleric who apparently only says and does what he does because he should. The lovers are solemn and far too reserved (Joseph Fiennes brings out some of the movie's most romantic lines this year in a barely audible whisper). Jessica reluctantly leaves her father and spends her life pouting with Lorenzo. <br /> <br /> In the commentary on the bland and watered-down court scene, the director expresses his shock at an audience laughing at Portia's phrase "one pound of meat, nothing more and nothing less"; Finally, he concluded that he had to put stress on relaxation laughter. "The Merchant of Venice" is a comedy and Radford mocks the idea that the most absurd and hysterical parts of the story are anything but the boldest provocative drama. The film still has no understandable focus cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes. The characters are forced into high-level drama, so they sound like Ibsen characters reading Victorian poetry. And the comedic ending, when all the good ones go to bed happily, is drowned in a venerable desperation that feels like they'll find their upper lip stiff with the impending death rather than reconcile with lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio leave the film and keep their hats like aristocratic mourners. <br /> <br /> The film is done badly because the creative powers do not understand the script. It's strict where it should be hysterical. It is reserved where it should be passionate. It's Michael Radford, where it should be William Shakespeare.
