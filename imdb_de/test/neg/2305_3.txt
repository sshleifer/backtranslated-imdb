Jacqueline Susann wrote several novels that all involved sex and melodrama, and some of them were actually made into films, including those efforts, and they all make the difference that they are among the worst films ever made. The story is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to the top of television, being reckless and calculating for everyone around him. He is a worst kind of playboy who locks in and then discards every woman he embeds, including the wife of the president of the IBC network. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is responsible for the television network IBC, and when his younger wife Judith grants a look at Robin, she does not waste time to go to bed with him. Greg falls ill and has to take a break. This is where Robin comes in and tries to operate the network. Meanwhile, a model named Amanda (Jodi Wexler), who is in love with him, kills herself. When Greg returns to his job, he tries to get rid of Robin by applying the moral clause in his contract when rumors of his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings), a gay fashion photographer, blown up. <br /> <br /> This was directed by Jack Haley Jr., who later became a very successful producer both on television and in film. However, this was only his second film as a director, and the material he had to deal with seems to be far beyond his head! The script is from Susann's novel and that's probably why it looks like a cross between "Alfie" and "The Valley of the Dolls". I think the reason her books never translated well into the film is that the filmmakers made the terrible mistake of taking their stories seriously rather than tongue in cheek. This is the unintentional laughter that comes of it, especially during this utterly ridiculous fight towards the end of the film that begins when Cannon refuses to return the slave bracelet to the gay characters! Hemmings was a very good actor, but his role here is completely exaggerated and he wears one of the worst beards in history, using the term "chic" in every other sentence. Law was not the first choice for the lead role, but another actor had a serious accident and Law entered and delivered one of the wooden performances of this page by Miles O'Keeffe. The script of the film suffers in two different areas, since it is completely stupid and terribly stupid and will test the patience of the audience if they so desire. One has to wonder what the result would be if a director decides to film one of Susann's novels and not take it seriously, because the attempt here is cumbersome and ridiculous.
