I have to agree with the previous reviewer: This movie has a great animation, but has problems throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Plot holes are huge, dialogue barely explains the plot's concepts - the MAJOR POINTS are fully explained only in the last five minutes of the movie. The characters explain the obvious, while they do not explain the film's more confusing points. There are characters that appear in the plot and have meaning that is never explained - most of them have names that are only called * once *, and it is extremely confusing to a viewer. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time with this movie. Unless you're in for a good laugh and how DUMB is.
