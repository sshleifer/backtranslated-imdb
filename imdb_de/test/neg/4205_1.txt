Ever wanted to see a movie in which Chuck Norris takes the bad guys aside and discusses with them the fallacies of their ways in peace until they see the light, and with tears in their eyes they shake hands of the world in peace and quiet Harmony and forever end the reign of evil in the world? <br /> <br /> Well, forget it, Jocko. <br /> <br /> "Breaker! Breaker!" Instead, it really starts when our truck driver Chuck steers his big rig to the small backwoods town where his little brother is being held by a corrupt judge and his even more corrupt lawyers. <br /> <br /> Chuck karate kicks, chops, slices, juliennes and crinkle cuts every dip in sight until no culprit raises his head. Many fights are in slow motion, for exciting purposes, but just help fill in the movie to fill 86 minutes. <br /> <br /> And here there are many fights that leave only 15 minutes for the plot development ... and that's all you get. But what did you expect: quiet discussion? <br /> <br /> A star for "Breaker! Breaker!"; and that's a little 10-4, good buddy.
