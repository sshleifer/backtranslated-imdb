That's what my friends and my friends have been asking in this movie all the time. We could not believe how stupid it was! I think someone recorded it at home with the camcorder, screwed it into the movie store and joked it on the shelf to see if anyone ever picked it up. Well, I guess the joke is about us. <br /> <br /> I think I should come to this website first and read all the reviews he has received. Everyone says this movie is awful, stupid and so on. And boy, are you right! Although there were some good laughs (me and my friends were pretty drunk) because it is so stupid. We just can not believe that someone was stupid enough to make such a fucking movie! I swear that this had to be done in the 70s before they had good technology for movies and other material, since every scene looks really crappy, but when I looked here it was said to have been made in 2001? What? It does not look like a movie that would be done today, but I think that's when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies with strobe lights and really false-looking lasers, and instead use real people from your hometown of actors or even aspiring ones actors. By the way - some of these chicks (or were they drag queens, we could not say it!) Were so fleeting, even my drunken, horny college buddies would not touch them with a 50ft pole. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no incentive for this movie, bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Do not waste your time or money on this, you will be completely disappointed!
