Based on the eponymous Elmore Leonard novel, Killshot suffers from lack of focus, focus and creativity. All the elements that the original story probably had and negative test screens required heavy editing (including the complete cutting out of a character), resulting in a movie that almost feels like a Leonard story. Far too many characters populate a story too simple and uncomplicated (not a typical feature of the author's work), and the focus is constantly shifting between two hits that are hard to like and a restless couple that does not control our compassion. While the story itself offers few twists and turns, it unfortunately still remains a mystery at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Washed-in hitman Armand "The Blackbird" Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict codex during his missions that accidentally forgives his last assignment. Fleeing from his former employer, he arbitrarily teams up with inappropriate criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to quickly make money by extorting a wealthy estate agent. When the pair of Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane), who are in trouble, engage in the mangled conspiracy of the thieves, they are forced to hide, as the crazy murderers do nothing about the two witnesses Silence. <br /> <br /> Killshot proves that the basis of an Elmore Leonard novel is not an immediate success or even a promising adaptation. The characters, situations, and even resolutions of the movie are all tired and unoriginal, and just very by chance point to something more. It's not that there was no potential, especially when Rourke's black-robed, calm and assassinated assassin perfectly hits in the opening scene. Purpose and principle are simply continually given up when every minute is gone. The style and the way in which each character is introduced is the most fascinating. Visually, the roles of Bird and even Wayne are adjusted accordingly, giving personas, which usually end in a creative impasse, an immediate interest and depth. <br /> <br /> The combination of coldness and calculating Black Bird with the irrational and explosive Richie is a tantalizing combination (comparisons to Fargo would be extravagant too nice), except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that made him interesting at first. When Richie picks up on the killer habits, Bird relaxes his own methods of murder. Regardless of what he sees in his momentary, frivolous momentum with Donna (Rosario Dawson), it is hard to imagine that his latest confrontation with the panicky Carmen would evoke a confession of his true nature and subsequent negligence that drastically affects his outcome. Probably or not, is that Killshot's unfortunate demise? and little entertainment can be obtained from these characters, who are constantly losing their originality, constantly contradicting the habits that once intrigued them. <br /> <br /> - The twins Massie
