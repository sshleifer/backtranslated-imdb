Almost a master class, how not to direct a movie. Since the misjudged, often incomprehensible screenplay, Dr. Rey on a series of bad choices that make the movie a torturous visual experience. Unfortunately, the film never rises above a kind of old-fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp where women are overused, OTT and middle-aged and the men are young, empty and in search of sex. The director was unable to determine the tone of the film nor the level of performance. <br /> <br /> There is certainly a lot of "acting". Dianne Wiest slips into a pale personification of her Bullets Over Broadway performance and the poor old Jane Birkin flounder in her attempt to make a comic performance. However, you must be sorry, because there is hardly any real comedy here. The whole thing feels like a very low rental version of Merchant Ivorys Le Divorce, which, frankly, was not very good either.
