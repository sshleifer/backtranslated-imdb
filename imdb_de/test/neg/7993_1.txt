I stumbled upon this movie on television late at night. My brother and I could not stop laughing at how horrible God this movie is. The crappy sound effect when White Ninja or Black Ninja uses punch, kick or weapon is hilarious. This movie is almost on the same level as the Evil Dead series, but you can only watch this movie once, because the shear cloud has been overcome. I'm not sure the director intended to be so shitty on purpose because he knew idiots like me would buy it.
