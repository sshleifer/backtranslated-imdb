Wow, what a bad movie. In the least not terrifying and hardly understandable. The plot is not related at all and the acting is absolutely appalling. What is this line from a famous critic? "She leads the emotional scale from A to B." Yup. That roughly sums it up. Not even good for the stock value! I did not expect Oscar material, but that? And what a pity, her friend is a ghost? You would have to have the IQ of a particularly stupid mollusc so as not to see one coming. <br /> <br /> This film (and I use the word casual) is an insult to the filmgoers. If only someone who was involved knew how to hold narrative together. This is a 1 in 10, simply because there is nothing lower. On the bright side - at least it's not a full two hours.
