This is really bad, the characters were boring, the story was boring and there is no sex scene. In addition, there is a lack of drama, the conflict is minimal and leads to an extremely slow pace. Nothing happens in this movie, you would expect a sex scene, but you only have one kiss. The plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife and a stranger whom they pick up from the high road. The couple invites the stranger to stay with them because he is homeless. At this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with the woman, right? No, they just kiss and that's it. Also, this movie contains no action, no comedy, no drama and not even tension. Do you think the studio might not even have read this script !!!!
