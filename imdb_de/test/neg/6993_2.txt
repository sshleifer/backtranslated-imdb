So pathetic it is not even funny. From the first scene of the movie, I knew I was feeling sick. Luckily I saw this movie only on TV. The story was awful, not to mention acting. It was terrible. In this movement, very unreal and unusual things happened like. The lady puts a whip under the door and whips the guy a little and he hands over the keys. I am like GET REAL. The lousy attempts of the creators to create a futuristic city reinforced my aversion to the film. To be honest, the only good thing about this movie was the fights, which were pretty lame by themselves. All I could ask myself when watching this movie was "when will it start!"
