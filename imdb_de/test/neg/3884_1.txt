After three hours in the cinema, the strongest impression was made that something was wrong. What was clear was that the directors forgot to refer the actors, and most of all, to write the scriptwriter. Everyone cried for no reason and made a fright. The script continued with many avoidable twists and turns and ended up in a too-known priyadarshan theory of converging actors at a single point. This theory has worked well in Hera-Pheri and Hungama, but somehow it managed to irritate her this time. Therefore, it was the habit that every actor was unable to answer. Simplest questions like "What's your name would repeat itself N times". <br /> <br /> Finally, it was wrong for the director to forget that his audience had something called intelligence.
