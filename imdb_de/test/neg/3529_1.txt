Hello, <br /> <br /> I bought this on DVD from England. You see, I have one of these players from several regions. I thought it would be fun to show my friends a cool movie. Well, surprise for Amy-Jo Johnson, she's hardly in the movie. Although she is on the cover. It's really hard to imagine how such a bad movie was made in the first place. Maybe someone has a trust fund. <br /> <br /> Oh ... It's about vampires who live on the beach
