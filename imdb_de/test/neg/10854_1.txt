Well, I was at a British university, in fact I went to this movie, and it was not like that. This is a horrible, badly made and rehearsed movie. Worst of all, it could have been really good if they had taken the trouble to spend more than 12 pence on it. If she really wanted to represent real British students, she should act like one and take out a loan of Â£ 15,000. It does not say anything about college life, where did the bush pop up, the tea drank until 4am, the endless talk about group dynamics ??? Where was the variety and the fun? Maybe I'm just romantic, but I can not remember that Fresher's week was so terrible, and I'm a philistine. And in the end, the question still remains ... a bed or a wardrobe?
