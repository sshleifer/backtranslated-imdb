It's easier to watch this movie if you look at it as a scenario created by Star Fleet Lieutenant Reginald Barclay during his holodeck dependency. (Barclay is a recurrent Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.) Dwight Schultz is miscast as Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a flat, two-dimensional figure from a soap opera. Paul Newman has also been misinterpreted as General Leslie Groves, but the film's problems are not just playing the wrong actors in the wrong roles. The political agenda of previous screenwriter Bruce Robinson makes this movie embarrassing to see. Probably this film has found a home in the so-called History Channel. <br /> <br /> "Fat Man and Little Boy" combines bad science, bad storytelling, bad script writing and mediocre acting to produce a movie that should not be seen by impressive high school or college students who do not care to know about the Manhattan Project.
