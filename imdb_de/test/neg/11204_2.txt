Gordon Scott has made some good Tarzan films, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, the bad, obviously inner sets and the hollow wooden "clonking" sounds twitched as they allegedly came over dirt tracks and bends in the bad dialogue and worse appearance among the minor characters, I always thought, "Sheesh, that's TV level!" Then I find out that there were actually three TV Show Pilot episodes that were seamlessly woven into one. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Scott outside (alone), away from the lame sets, in a few the scenes; and the bouts have some nice features ... but oh, oh, and ouch like the dialogue. And did I mention the acting? Heck, Cheetah (or "Cheta" in this version) was a better actor than most people. <br /> <br /> And that does not say much. <br /> <br /> It's kind of a sting to see a younger Sherman (ie Scatman) Carothers appearing as a native. But the total time investment is probably not worth it.
