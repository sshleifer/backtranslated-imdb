Well, I read the book first and thought to myself: Wow would that be cool to see in a movie, then I started to search and found out that a movie was already made of it ... I bought the movie a week ago DVD and saw it .. they did it terribly wrong! First this young hapi, who is not a character in the book, then the mix between the two books ("the river god" and "the seventh roll") as Nicolas, who needs money while in the book he is actually the lender, the whole thing about the Hyksos is also wrong .. Taila is said to have invented the lightweight car .. the whole thing about the grave is also very wrong .. there should be a channel that has a kind of vacuum The grave itself was in one Labyrinth built in which only the possibility exists, if one knows the rules of the old Boa play. There was nothing in the film about Nicolas as an Englishman and Royan was a Coptic Christian in the book, not a Muslim. This list is endless. There were only a few good things about the movie, the actors playing Royan, Nahood, Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well chosen, the rest was just a parody of the characters in the book, Rasfer was the worst, it did not come too close to the character that was in my mind while I was writing the book It's a shame that such a great book is maimed in such a bad reproduction ... I wonder why Wilbur Smith ever gave his permission for it ..
