The Three Stooges are probably the biggest comedy team in film history. For that reason alone, they earned a much better ending in Columbia than they got with this short film. <br /> <br /> "Sappy Bullfighters" just is not good. Granted, that's not just Joe Besser's fault. Personally, I find that some of his shorts are fun, simply because they are removed from the usual Stooges fanfare they contain, and because Larry is sometimes presented more. However, this short time is not enough. And the fact that you know it was the last short film ever shown only raises the general disgust. <br /> <br /> This film embodies just how short subjects were at the last breath during that time and how little effort was made to make them. This short film is so sloppy. It's a simple rerun of a Curly short "What Matador?", Which was filmed years ago. As if that fact were not bad enough, the studio did actually shoot Moe and Larry from the original (which was filmed nearly 20 years ago). Are not these things obvious? Laughing or sad? You are the judge. <br /> <br /> Another part of this short series that makes it unhappy is the fact that it's essentially a Joe Besser storefront. Curly-wants-to-go-totally wrong! Moe and Larry have little to do in this short time. As a Larry fan, I must also say that I find it a little shameful to make Better to use the joke that Larry had originally made popular in the short series "Ants In The Pantry". To see how Better says, "I can not see, I can not see!" and leave the simple "Why can not you see?" say while Besser says, "I closed my eyes," is wrong on all levels. <br /> <br /> The two brave soldiers who are stuck In all these years Howard and Fine have so little to do in this short time. There are hardly any funny pieces with them. The only thing that qualifies is that Larry hides under the bed of a jealous husband and tries to be "Pepe," his dog. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the dynamic duo. Larry and Moe give everything. No matter how ridiculous things might be (and I'm sure they had their opinions by that time in their careers). Howard and Fine never gave less than their best. Their efforts are not pale from 1934 to 1959. <br /> <br /> I often like a lot of shorts that some will dismiss as horrible. I'm all for her "experimental", unusual shorts. At least they contain new ideas. However, I believe that all these respondents can agree is simply not good. Fortunately, TV later spotted the boys after the shorts department closed down. If they had been forced to go out in this way, it would have been a great injustice in all the years they made the audience laugh.
