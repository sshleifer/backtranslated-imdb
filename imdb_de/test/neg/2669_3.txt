Normally, I would not bother commenting on a horror movie episode because it is usually thought that they are BAD. In this chapter of the current Halloween saga, however, everything was offered what the original stood for. In the very first movie, Dr. Loomis (very clear that I could add) that Michael Myers is evil, and this is trying to explain why (doing a bad job, I would like to add). In my opinion, he was a lot scary than he was just a bloodsucking freak. The whole goth / cult thing was unnecessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new curve into the Halloween equation. The result was a boring, predictable movie that was not scary and not bad enough to be funny.
