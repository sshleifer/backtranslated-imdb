Bad. Personal opinion? The people who did it? They knew that when they did it. To play the lead role in this movie, in my opinion, you had to meet three criteria ... # 1: You had to own your own Gothic clothes and jewelry. Make the wardrobe easier and cheaper this way. # 2: You had to remember and repeat your lines without cue cards. Note that I did not say you had to do well. Saves time and paperwork. # 3: They had to be ready to undress. Gives an R rating and thus increases sales. Do you want to see a better movie? Easy. Get a camera and some of your friends together and do it yourself. Trust me, you will not make it worse. How vampire movies go, well, that's shit. And a hint here for people like me, who like to look for little peculiarities in movies ... Consider the connection between vampires and crosses. Now look at the symbols and names on the tombstones in the cemetery where parts of this thing were filmed. Ed Wood could not have better planned such an accident himself.
