This is one of those weird, self-important, selfish movies that try too hard to be profound. It's not Instead, it spits out clichés that try to fit for profundity. Typical is the scene in which Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to the protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how man begins breastfeeding, then sucks his girlfriend's breast and finally concludes his wife that ultimately sucks life. So deep. We are confronted with a multitude of characters who offer their view of life, the universe, etc. during Adam's journey through the Mojave Desert. (He abruptly leaves L.A. on the day of his wedding and his family, friends and fiancé assume he died when his car was found in a missile-smashed military test track.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best thing is by far a refugee from a mental hospital, who speaks only through the voices of others. The actor James Kevin Ward makes some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye and several characters from the original Star Trek. Once the interesting characters have left the screen, we stay with Adam and his quest for the deep. It is a long journey that is going on in many places. In fact, it's the longest one and a half hour movie I've ever seen. And the finale hardly makes it worthwhile. <br /> <br /> I discovered this movie on HBO one day when I got up too early and clicked on the TV. That will teach me. Next time I try to sleep more.
