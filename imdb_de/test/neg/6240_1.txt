How do two great actors crowd out such a piece of rubbish for the filmgoers? My only conclusion is that she and her director believe that EVERY movie in which they play the lead role has to be seen and applauded. The actors showed minimal emotions; The plot was appropriate for a period of 1/2 hour (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was almost a dumb parody - his partner was apparently silent and did not speak a word. To describe Robert Redford, the rogue was a meaningless crap! The movie was boring and meaningless - the only question was whether the hero would die or not. A really bizarre part of the story - The waiting family seemed to last at least a few days; The hero and the antihero seemed to need only one day. <br /> <br /> All in all - a waste of time
