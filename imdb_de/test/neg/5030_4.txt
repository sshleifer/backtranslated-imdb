As you may not know, EÃ§a de Queiroz is one of the best-celebrated Portuguese writers. He was funny, he has spared no one in his critics and now has to roll in his grave. And that's not because this film is bad, which it is, but because of the treatment given to one of his masterpieces "O Crime do Padre Amaro". It's treated like cheap disposable garbage. <br /> <br /> When it became known that this was supposed to be a "modern and urban" interpretation of the book I feared for the worst, in this context it usually means modern, the freedom to take the p **** in an adaptation to halve it in the least possible way. Therefore, a priest's moral and social dilemma with a secret, forbidden matter is replaced by extra-long passages of people who handle drugs and sing hip-hop without a specific or objective reason for the conspiracy. It's just as if it might not have been like that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's a lot of sex, so at least you can count on it if you do. Do you remember how every movie in the 80's, regardless of genre or sound, always found a way to sneak into nudity? If it was a thriller and they had no reason to, they just found a way that when they captured a criminal, he "accidentally" lay in bed with a woman who was going to scream (of course naked) when the cops came in Um, the word is free, I think. It's not that nude scenes are all right, but here the creators of this movie will look desperate just because the movie has nothing else. It is completely free of dramatic content.
