Are not we kidding, okay? We all know that this film was created because of the success of the "Grumpy Old Men" movies. Unlike those, however, this travesty has no humor and little heart. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven is the only glowing light you can see. It breaks my heart that she finally got the chance to show her skills to a new generation of moviegoers and then land in such a bastard. There was a touching scene in which she was stopped by someone she had fallen in love with. Their good performance was the only quality that went into "Out To Sea". All others just go through the motions. 2.10
