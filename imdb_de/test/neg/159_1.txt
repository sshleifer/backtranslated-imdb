This movie fails at every point. First of all, it is presumptuous to strive to be "meaningful" and fail miserably. The script was extremely banal, nobody said anything interesting from afar at any point. It was impossible to take care of one of the characters. Knightly was a waste of time, while Sienna Miller was a waste of time. The play about the soldier who had gone to war was a cliché even before the film Atonement. The use of the Second World War as a backdrop was in itself a cliché ... the bombs, the accommodation in subway stations, etc., to import something urgently needed drama. Why someone thought for a moment that this movie was worth shooting is incomprehensible to me. It was yet another case of "Let's make the costumes look authentic, no matter the story, the script or the acting!"
