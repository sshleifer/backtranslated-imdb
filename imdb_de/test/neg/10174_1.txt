OK, this movie was the worst thing I've seen in years. The actors were not bad (I thought it was a B-movie, so they made B-movies). Anyway, I've seen this movie and thought OH COOL was a UFO sci-fi movie. NOT CORRECT. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to bring a message to people. The last scene was extremely messed up. This is a terrible thing to do to a person to believe in something. What someone believes is a matter of opinion. This film only shows how corrupt religion is, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a B-movie, this is not the case. If you want to watch a movie TRYING to brainwash the masses. Well, that's the choice of the litter. go right. If you want to deliver a message, do not force it. Ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such an extent. Especially Christians.
