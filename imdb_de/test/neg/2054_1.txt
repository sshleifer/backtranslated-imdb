I rented this movie today ... the worst movie ever. It was a total waste of time and a terrible story. The acting was terrible, especially by the actress of "Sai". It was so bad it was ridiculous. I can not say if it was her bad acting or because the character was just so dumb. I can not even care how horrible and pointless this whole movie was. I'm surprised someone even thought it would be a good idea to film this movie and make the effort to release it. Go right! It's a waste of time and money. Heck, I would not even DOWNLOAD this movie if someone PAID me. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that it does not even deserve a "1". I wish I could give a "0"!
