Conqueror of Shamballa shows what happens if the creators of an anime do not understand what their fans want. As a fan, I did not want an Evil Nazi movie from the 1920s. What I would have liked is a real showdown between Ed and Dante, as we do not REALLY know what's become of her. I would have brought Ed back to his world much earlier and left him there to finally have the chance to be normal. You know, educate a family with a certain blond mechanic, something like that. No, instead, I got an intricate plot with Nazi mystics, Fritz Lang and about ten minutes Al, a joke with a Roy Mustang cameo and only one Armstrong joke, a short joke, and no Winry hitting Ed with a wrench. Above all, it just did not feel like a Fullmetal Alchemist to me.
