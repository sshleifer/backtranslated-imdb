Federal agent Frank Poo (Andy Garcia), who has broken into a secret database file for matching DNA serums, discovers that the only person who can save his son's life is a psychopath played by Michael Keaton. However, if a serum transfer at the local hospital goes terribly wrong, a certain Mr.Poo must do everything in his power to ensure that the madman stays alive to facilitate the inevitable transfer. By the way, his name is not really Poo, I just want to call him. Despite the original concept, this is an implausible and careless action thriller. I've never been a big fan of Andy Garcia, and his character trait did not suit me here, making this movie even worse. Sequences are treated rather disappointingly, and the end is pretty bad. Keaton's psychopathic villain here in Pacific Heights is a vicious villain. He is a disappointment and offers a maniac who is too funny and charismatic to be complained.
