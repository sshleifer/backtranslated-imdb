As an avid moviegoer, I had the feeling that while I ranked my favorite movies, I found it only fair to rate my most hated movies. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I really have nothing positive to say about film. It's actually one of only two movies I've ever experienced. To be fair, I went back and looked at the movie again to give it another shot and just wished that I should have stayed away ... but then even the brightest stars in Hollywood can not have a dead duck Bring scripts to life. <br /> <br /> Stay away ... Save yourself from this truly sad "movie" 1/10
