I had high hopes for the film until they changed the name in "The Shepherd: Border Patrol," the most annoying movie name of all time, which was wrong with "The Shepherd." This is an action strip that has its head on many classic Van Damme movies. There is a nice piece of action in a bar that reminds me of a hard target and universal soldier, but with no intensity or flair, which is a pity. There is a great line about how to get drunk and carry a rabbit, and some OK action scenes are abandoned by the cheapness of the whole thing. Most of the time, the dialogue does not match the characters' mouths, and the stunt men fall dead seconds before being shot. The final fight is one of Van Damme's better fights, except that the director is trying to go a bit too, and John Woo fails. Also, he does not introduce flashbacks that nobody really cares about. <br /> <br /> Not good, not bad, only average generic action.
