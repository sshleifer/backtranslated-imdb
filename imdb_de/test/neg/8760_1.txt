You always enjoy the classic horror movies, but this movie was really a big waste of time and if John Carradine had not played the crazy doctor who can control humans through his experiments. This film was filmed during the Second World War and John Carradine was a German Nazi who worked to find a human weapon against the whole world. Bob Steele played in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob seemed to be bored with his role in this movie and acted as if this was his first movie. Mantan Moreland (Jeff) did an excellent job with great comedy that helped get the audience's attention. I hate criticizing a 1943 film, but that's a big disappointment. If you like John Carradine and the roles he played in many movies as Count Dracula in the 1940s, you might want to do as John does his best.
