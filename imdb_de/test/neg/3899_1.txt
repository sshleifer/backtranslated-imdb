I know that Jesse Franco is responsible for a lot of films, and I mainly go for his horror movies, as lousy as they are sometimes. I think it was morbid curiosity that made me, and I was not even curious enough to finish it. Maybe things will get better towards the end, but if you're not into lesbian sex scenes (there are plenty of them) you might want to make a pass. So what exactly can you say about a movie in which a woman pees in a bowl on the kitchen counter (standing up)? It never bothers you what it's about later, you probably do not want to know. If that sounds intriguing to you, then that's your problem, but you may also like this movie. I myself am not faultless, I have seen many disgusting films in my time, but at least they were well done, and that is not the case. Sometimes too much is just too much. Bleah.
