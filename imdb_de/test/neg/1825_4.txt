Basically, I only observed that because it contained references to the Third Reich. It turned out to be a pretty mindless and predictable Slasher movie made to appeal to feminists or something. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something, if you wait a whole movie to see the breasts of the attractive female lead. The last thing you want is a "tasteful" sex scene with annoying camera angles that show nothing. Her busty girlfriend did not bring her out, but we saw a lot of asses and pubic hair for men and men with their shirts. And in the end, you have magically escaped our heroine with the thrust of the scalpel and the villain's turns (which turns out to be funny), and she easily fights him (er, huh) while her male love interest is tied up and waiting The funniest part was when she picked up a chair and "swinging" him on the guy and breaking him. Now it would be about as much as she could lift the chair, let alone hit a person with enough strength to break it! It looks ridiculous, it basically hits him and it falls apart. If you perform this type of "role reversal" (which has already been done to death), you must make it at least half-plausible. <br /> <br /> But there was a fair amount. The villain has defeated the sloppy girlfriend by giving her a lesson because she's such a tramp and running around. This is not exactly what feminists would like. <br /> <br /> Pretty stupid. Not that American Slasher films are generally much better, but you have to wonder why they bothered you. It did not bring anything new to the genre. <br /> <br /> 5/10
