The audience sat in silence almost throughout the movie, with only a few, rare, occasional giggles. The character of Maxwell Smart was so volatile, I felt lashing. If it is favorable to the plot, Smart behaves like a spymaster. At other times, he behaves like an idiot. They pull out many classic lines from the TV series, but do not work in this version. The classic "miss it so much" is weird when it's talked about trying Braggadocio by someone who's an obvious failure - but loses all sense of humor when spoken to by a qualified person. To a lesser extent, many of the other characters move at a dizzying pace from skilful to incompetent cartoons. Siegfried, the main villain, seems to be intelligent, but he makes decisions that make no sense at all. Nevertheless, none of the characters in the film is as incompetent as the authors of this mess. I am deeply depressed that so many IMDb users find it good.
