There are no saving graces in this terrible, gradual, boring snooze festival reminiscent of "The Ransom Of Red Chief"! <br /> <br /> Even though there are some big stars in this movie, acting is almost uniformly horrible. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, usually a laid-back guy, gets it up with forced emotion. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed is so over the top that she is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielson is sad and terrible. <br /> <br /> The son is such a disgusting little brat, I've referred to the hijackers. <br /> <br /> The only decent performance in this mixed mash is the relatively small role of the butler. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too hard with the actors, after all, they just read the lines they were given in the script. Ah, the script, that jerky piece of dirt that wants to pull at your heart strings, but only turns your stomach.
