A bad movie ABOUT a bad movie. Is this original or what? If so, that's the only good thing about it. Lovely Ally Sheedy could not stop this bomb from destroying cinemas and VCRs everywhere. It should also be noted that she and the other actors hired by Danny Aiello's character when they were billed themselves and the characters they played in his D-rated movie. A movie that has been rated B is too big a compliment and would lead to megalomania.
