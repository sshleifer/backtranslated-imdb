I would not betray too much of the movie to tell you that there are many, many, many, many scenes in which Lucas (the young protagonist) goes and looks at things! Yes. And you'll be happy to know that the first third of the movie is pointless and pointless and is pretty much ignored for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> This film is inhabited by boring people doing boring things, and the most boring of all is the young Lucas, who becomes blind and needs surgery. You see, he has delusions, terrible delusions! He thinks a killer hunts blind women! He walks around a lot and behaves like an unbearable fool! <br /> <br /> Patience is NOT worth it for this movie. In the end, the plot and the events are just as confusing and lethargic, and it's very hard to care in one way or another for what the nightmarish images meant. Nothing is clarified, the film moves at a snail's pace, and I had the same effects as a hangover. <br /> <br /> Judging by "fear of the dark," the British are not stupid thrillers like the Americans; They make boring.
