I think you could say that this movie has a potential, but not anymore, because the filmmaker messed it up. The plot is virtually incomprehensible, the tempo is lethargic and acting is pathetic. And what the hell is a commercial rat? Worst of all, however, the climax of this film is the anticlimax of all anticlimax; Besides, the title does not seem so accurate. The only redeeming thing about this movie is the pretty dark haired woman ... well, the blonde girl was pretty, too, but she was annoying and did not look as good as the brunette. As with many films, this can only be seen on MST3K.
