This movie was disturbing, not because of the topic, but because of the way it was handled. The extremely overweight mother (Angela) did not even make it to the cover of the videotape when the rest of the cast did so. That's not fair, but a statement in itself. I also notice that her picture is missing in IMDb (maybe her own choice) and it looks like this is her only movie ever? The language in this film was gross beyond necessity. Being watched with my 10-year-old son because he was classified PG in Canada and the language came out of her mouth was shameful and disgusting. Shirley Maclain has never been as appreciated as so many others seem. <br /> <br /> LOVE Kathy Bates and always will. Sinese was annoying. <br /> <br /> Little Alex is a great little actor. I have to see what else he has done lately ..
