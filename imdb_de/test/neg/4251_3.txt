A family of dirtwalkers are moving west. <br /> <br /> The head of Walnut Grove's newest colorful brood is called 'Charles'. He works in the mill and saws lots of wood, although he thinks he's a mystery because he cuts everything for wood in hell, because no one in the city has enough money to buy a splinter, let alone because two. Four. <br /> <br /> The city is run by the 'Olsons', a rich but stupid clan who moved to these areas to rake all the dough they sell for eleven cents a dozen. They have two children, a boy, "Willie," and a girl, "Nellie," who have only one advantage ... Nellie is hot and spits her spying on her bath. <br /> <br /> The city preacher is also a village idiot, because he thinks he is really special for this hinterland of country kisses. In fact, they can not stand his boring sermons and the only prayer because on Sunday he falls as fast as possible from the nearest cliff. The city doctor is a dinosaur who saw his better days about 20 years ago, but he's hanging around anyway, so he can give free breast exams to the old Hagen living in the city. Unfortunately, these old hot moms only once dropped to their knees when they pulled a loaf of bread out of the oven to give it to the Doc for his services. With Doc, that's fine, because he knows that these old bitches give good bread. <br /> <br /> The back of this colorful collection of Country Cow chips is drawn by Charles' wimpy wife Carolyn and her three girls. Mary ',' Carrie 'and' Half-Pint '. Mary is another hot girl who all boys take a look at when she takes a shower or crap. Carrie is an annoying little kid, but put a biscuit in her mouth and you will not even know she's there. Where is she? ... oh, there she is ... she's in the yard playing with a pack of cigarettes ... how cute! Half-pint is the city's latest problem. She may not have a brain and no body to talk about, but she can spit on more than any other boy in the whole damned school. It's a great city, Walnut Grove, where somebody always falls off the roof or gets hit by a cartwheel, and it's also pretty, it's made up of a building ... the church / schoolhouse / town hall / poolroom. Ah, it gets a bit hairy in the prairie, but that's fine, especially when Mary takes a bath in the pub ... then you can see how hairy it really is.
