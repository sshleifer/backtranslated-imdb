Totally forgotten movie, but an incredible soundtrack: I would give it a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is outstanding! I saw the movie years ago and had to check IMDb to remember what it was about. I'm obsessed with getting the soundtrack and have since replaced it. It ranges from blues / soul / ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren are the "other" lead guitarist alongside Steve Van Zandt in the E Street Band. This guy can play! The vocals are from Nils (he can not sing very good-to-rappig), Bonnie Sheridan (who is a great singer) and Tom Lepson.
