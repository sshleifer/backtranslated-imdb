A crypto-oculist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island. To bring him back to civilization, he captivates with funny, and I think the script had catastrophic results on the hold of a large luxury cruise ship. <br /> <br /> Let's start with one thing I really did not like about this movie ... The monster really looked like a guy in a rubber suit. The CGI scenes looked like another movie. OK, that's what I liked about all the enjoyable parts of this B-movie. <br /> <br /> The best was John Rhys-Davies (his daughter, the eye for a second.) John was at times funny and polite No matter what the writers said, he said it well. Good job he had to work with. The cyptozologist was exaggerated and fun to watch, he had some funny pieces. The Marines were all alright and made good cannon fodder for the monster, as did some of the crew and guests. There are some pretty funny lines in this movie and a pretty amusing deal with a thief. The special effects are usually med low and I swear that they have reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie. I liked the Gore of the legless man. Actually, since this movie was not scary at all, I feel like a little bit more Gore would do a lot to improve the watch capabilities of this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all If you like B-monsters, this is worth a visit.
