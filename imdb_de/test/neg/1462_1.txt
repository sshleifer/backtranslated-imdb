This movie was presumptuous, stupid and just not funny. The turning technique reminded me of MTV. I'm a fan of Hartley. But why was he thinking? There could have been so much more thought in this film, considering the subject. This could have been a true theoretical struggle for good and evil, but Hartley seems to have used the stand technique of the viewer.
