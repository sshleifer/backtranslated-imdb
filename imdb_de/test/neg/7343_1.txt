Man lives, is this game bad or what? The graphics are far below average, even if they were on a Playstation 1, not to mention a Gamecube. The gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorienting. What a worthless game! <br /> <br /> I totally love Warner's Batman animation and it's cool that they make all the games that way. Batman: Vengeance would have been great when they got off to a good start with all the gothic visuals and speakers, but they stumbled seriously when it came to playability and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun at all. I really have to stress how bad the graphics are. Do not be fooled by the color schemes. I have seen better things on a Commodore 64.
