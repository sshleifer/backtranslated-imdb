In this film, there are many repetitive dialogues about "cold spots" (signs of the presence of a ghost) and characters who pray to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. In order to restore the feeling of the film, I will repeatedly refer to cold spots in this review. I've seen worse movies than the St. Francisville experiment, but this may be the most memorable ("it's getting cold!"). Basically, some 20-year-olds spend the night in a haunted house. This is filmed as supposedly true documentary. It's obviously not real, but the house contains some cold spots. SPOILERS (as if you can not predict most of the plot!). Not much happens in this movie. We have the time-honored horror clich√© of a cat jumping out of the hiding place at the beginning as an "exercise break" to warm up the audience. People walk around with flashlights and occasionally take a moment to remind the house that they are resting - that they do no harm to the spirits (or cold spots) inside. Every now and then a door slammed and someone scared. Of course, the Ouija board appears. They chat with a ghost called "Charles". A girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach. More cold spots. Another door closes and a man goes off because of the unpleasant sound of the door. Scrap, scrap, he says. Oh my god, someone says. "Surround yourself with white light." I admit there is a good scene in the attic (where a chair is knocked over by a ghost) that really took me by surprise. Apart from some funny, bad dialogues, the chair scene (the actual fractions of seconds in the upset, nothing immediately before or after this moment) is the only good thing in this film. However, there are still some cold spots here. Finally the movie ends. Nobody dies. No further information required. I was not a big fan of the Blair Witch Project, but next to the St. Francisville experiment, it looks like a masterpiece. It may be that you are not debating whether or not this is real documentation, but whether it should be funny or not. I still do not know. Whatever it was, it failed.
