"The best movie of the 90s" "The Welsh Trainspotting" ... Yes, right! I went into this movie with pretty high expectations and from then on it went downhill. <br /> <br /> This film should be this archetypal film about the drug culture of the early 90s and would allow us all to see into this scene and destroy media prejudices about the moral panic that led to the death of Lea Betts 1995 followed. Unfortunately, she has come too short. <br /> <br /> Where Trainspotting treated you like a grown-up on this subject and treated potential drug-related issues, it just offered us a nasty story about the wonder of drugs and how you like it, like yours Fully open mind. Arrive via Bill Hicks and Howard Marks. It is sometimes painfully bad. I mean, the scene at the end between Lulu and her aunt actually made me laugh. Now maybe I'm just a cynic, but the way Jip guides us through this story is like hearing the acid-crazy guy you once met at a house party talking to you about how " the man "holds us back and how Acid freed him from the rigors of modern society. They just want to shake a little sense in him and ask him to leave the building. <br /> <br /> The script was a real problem for me, because where Trainspotting had to quote Irvine Welsh's excellent book, this is written Director: Justin Kerrigan The words "All-Rounders, Masters of Nothing" strike me on. You can see where his inspiration comes from, especially in the narrative style of main character Jip (who puts the main character in a social situation where he talks directly to the camera and outlines what he's thinking about during the scenario) is that some of the speeches in front of the camera are just painful to look at. This is mainly due to a lack of empathy for Jip, but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that in the end they sound like an average A-level drama project. The direction is fine and the intentions are good, but it lacks integrity so that you wonder what the hype is actually. <br /> <br /> If you say that, it's not all bad. There are moments that are really amusing and entertaining. Moff is the highlight of the movie for me. For an independent film, he also managed to attract a large number of British quality actors / actresses, which is perhaps one of the reasons why the movie was so great. <br /> <br /> Best movie of the 90s? Not for long, but if you're looking for a solid Sunday night movie, this could just be your bag. Inevitably, the film is flawed by the hype surrounding it.
