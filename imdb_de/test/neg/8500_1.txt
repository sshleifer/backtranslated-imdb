I did not understand the people who rated it over 5. I think it's a horrible movie in every way. Acts, drama, art, dialogue, music, whatever! I have nothing against a low budget. Anyway, you have to get a point. They wandered, wondering ... without a point ... then two boys in the bed began to kiss. terrible, just terrible. I love indie movies, but it's slow. However, this film disappointed me from all perspectives. Even the graffiti, not artistic. <br /> <br /> I was wondering what kind of people would want it. I am a woman in my 30s. Is it for teenagers who have a certain loneliness in life, or I just do not understand it? What did I win then? Wasting time! Please go for some others.
