This is the worst movie I have ever seen. And I have seen many movies. Me and my friends rented this one Wednesday night. Man, we had a lot of fun. This movie is the worst and most boring crap I've ever seen. But it makes you laugh! You will roll around on the ground and try to get some air. You wonder why? Just rent it and look for the keyboard-playing girl in this seedy Russian bar. My mother would feed a thousand times better movie about her cats.
