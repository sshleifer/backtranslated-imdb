One of the first things that struck me that made this culture stand out among the others was the awakening at Sole. An aerial view shows Sole, as it is flowered by a sea of ​​women with kisses. I felt that this was a commentary on the closeness that women had among themselves, who were connected through generations, divisions and misunderstandings, and who were still able to bond and trust each other. In addition, the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals. By flawless, I mean that they did not have the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father. Her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act, while Paula seems to have almost no remorse for what she has done. Another example is that each daughter (or granddaughter) had the opportunity to reunite with her supposedly "dead" mother (grandmother). Knowing the tensions this most likely has caused in their family, each of them embraces the mother, ignoring what she has done - that is, killing her husband and lover. In this light, women are portrayed as those who love not only independent of character behavior but also those who are not in the least disturbed by the actions their friends / family members perform. <br /> <br Another idea that I thought fascinated this culture referred to her idea of ​​the supernatural. With the death of Raimunda and Soles's mother and their inexplicable return, the director builds the emotions of the audience to believe that this film will embody the supernatural. The people portrayed in this culture seem to be very supernatural, that is, very much hoping that life exists beyond the grave. Her aunt, longtime girlfriend Augustina, prostitutes and other people living in the city of La Mancha all believe that the rumors about the dead return to family members to end the "unfinished business". I believed that this was a mixed reflection of the religious beliefs of the culture (predominantly Catholic) and their need to make amends to those who had no chance to be forgiven during mortality. The belief in the "life" of the dead consisted in giving hope to the destitute circumstances they had suffered in mortality. When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film is not supernatural at all, it is interesting to see what role the mother continues to play. She is treated as though she were still a ghost (ie H. She hides in small columns (under the bed or in a trunk of a car)). I believe the director has portrayed the mother in this way to reinforce the city's already existing supernatural faith. The mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long-cherished belief in a life after death.
