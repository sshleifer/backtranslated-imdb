This movie is terribly bad. It can be said that all actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a truly terrible movie. There are obvious budget constraints, but with a little thought and attention to detail, the movie could have been so much better. For example, look at the scene in which Mickey first goes into the morgue and talks to his friend, the pathologist, while the murdered taxi driver lies on the plate. You can actually see the body breathing! What, could they not afford to rent a half-decent extra that could hold their breath for a 2-minute scene ?!
