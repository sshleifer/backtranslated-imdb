This is a good design for examining corporate power and the dichotomy between the required public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor was founded by CEO Burl Ives as a replacement son to replace him as the company's director. He sends him to England to negotiate a deal in which Taylor is stunned by both the ethics and morality of the men he deals with and can fall in love with a refugee while he's at it. He comes back empty-handed after doing his duty, but telling the English the truth about his motives. He tries to marry the refugee and not the boss's niece, so he begins an attempt to discredit the refugee as a suitable woman for corporate governance. It could have been dirtier, more vicious and less romantic - the time spent on romance displaces the film from the points it wants to make about corporate ethics. <br /> <br /> Somehow the costume design was nominated (undeserved) for an Oscar - these are all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively - undoubtedly also back in nuclear politics. <br /> <br /> However, the black-and-white CinemaScope cinematography is excellent - if anything, the Oscar deserves nom. (It was MGM's first Scope movie in B & W). Not as good as it could have been, but not terrible either.
