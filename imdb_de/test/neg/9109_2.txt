** Could contain spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Ok, let's close this movie in a word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Why do I think so? Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Guttenberg heads a special ops team, consisting of four people charged with recovering a deadly virus after an arms dealer steals it from a lab. They do this by attacking the gun traders in the middle of the flight and somehow getting the virus back after a few battles. However, there is a suspicion against Guttenberg because one of the terrorists knew his name. After the debriefing, the team members are attacked by strangers, and all suspect that everyone else is involved. After deciding that they can not trust their bosses, they decide once again to steal the virus and try to lure out the potential attackers. <br /> <br /> In theory, this is a conspiracy that could have worked in a low budget movie, which should only be broadcast on television. However, the plot is at risk and the film is ruined in several accounts. First, the plot is completely predictable and it's no fun to know how the movie will end in three minutes. Second. Acting is really bad, or the actors are meant to act as dummies. There is not much emotion, no change in facial expressions, etc. I was especially disappointed in Guttenberg, which I believe can do much more, but fails completely when trying to be a rough action hero. Although I am by no means an expert in this field, I absolutely believe that I could put together a better Covert Ops team by picking up five strangers and training them for a week. This seems to be an issue in the film to make things as stupid and unprofessional as possible. This also applies to the good, bad and spectators. Then I seriously doubt the scientific and technical adviser of the film. For example, I poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and did not break immediately. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to really conclude this, but let's say that this movie has a predictable storyline, bad acting and they seem to be amateurs, no matter what. Sorry, can not be more beautiful. Do not look at this movie, it's not even so bad it's funny. 2.10
