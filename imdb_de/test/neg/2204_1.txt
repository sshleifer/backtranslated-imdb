This movie is such an incredible crap. First let me talk about the pros: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit. <br /> <br /> Now the rest of the story is all pretty bad. We said the programmer Angela Bennett (whose online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY !!! I bet the directors cheered this for an hour) basically checks the company's software for bugs, etc. So let's start put on their pizza order on the internet and then put on their monitor a fireplace (EXTREME computer skills have been shown so far). After finding viruses on a Macintosh program, the entire system crashes after the escape key is pressed. This seems like a HUGE problem, but the virus created for it could be fixed in about 1 minute with a simple batch file. <br /> <br /> At each event we move on. She gets this call from another guy (who works for the same company), and that idiot says you have to click on this icon, which apparently opens a secret Internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected "top secret" data woohoo! Angela saves this crap on a disk and now the people who created the hole are looking for her. Of course, this is only after she meets one of the bad guys BEFORE trying to kill her BEFORE she jumps out of his boat into the sea BEFORE she gets to a hospital. <br /> <br /> Issue # 1: You can not break the Internet to gain access to a range of top secret FBI data. Where the hell did that come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the Internet (even in 95)? Issue # 2: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would release her. She could not just pack her things and go. <br /> <br /> Then these 'hackers' or whatever will change Angela's ID so she can not get help from anyone and virtually all of her ID is gone. So she returns home and a cat and mouse hunt goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Apparently all police and FBI people are stupid and do not believe her. Then she has to use a set of tactics to get into the building she works in (where the person now sits for her) and return to her old computer. She starts talking to another random guy, and finds out who's behind everything that the director knows is that the audience is too stupid enough to believe it, through a BS IP address. <br /> <br /> Then she runs to a center to send this information to the FBI. She apparently had to use a mainframe to send emails to the FBI. But the same fool who tried to kill her BEFORE she gets thrown into the water, gets her and easily hacks back into the FBI (wtf?). But remember the cool virus? Well, somehow she gets that fortunately and although the virus only worked on software, it now works on the entire system as well. It brings down the entire mainframe, which contains all the fake information since the mainframe was in the middle of a convention ... WHAT IS THE HELL OF THIS CRAP! Anyway, the now excessive virus works and Angela (the real one now) runs away and later kills the bad guy with a fire extinguisher. Of course, he has a gun, runs to her, so he's only two yards away and decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is so full of BS and crap. Anyone unfamiliar with computers is misled into the possibility of this crap, but with regard to computers or the Internet, no thing is right. And I honestly doubt that I would see a multiplatform virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (* hough LMAO *).
