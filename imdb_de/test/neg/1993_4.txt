It's alright ... a few years later, Chayefsky's classic "Network" will be his real cinematic BIG home run ... but right now, this dark comedy is not the classic she's aiming for. It's mostly awful, though there are some good scenes: the first murder victim found, the notary staff responsible for billing patients, a startling discovery, Drummond's delusions, and the last scene in Scott's character's professional integrity and regained self-esteem. It also has some ridiculous scenes: Scott's tiny monologue during his early visit to the hospital psychiatrist, Scott's character raping Rigg's character, Dysart's terrible ambush in his short scenes, and the O.R. Doctor lunges on the operating table to revive the wrong patient because "I already have an official injury claim". <br /> <br /> Chayefsky is also trying TOO HARD to throw every conceivable hurdle into this one hospital (ie the killers, the administrative board) mistakes, the poor people protesting outside, etc.). It might have worked better if you look at the industry as a whole. In terms of acting: Scott is passable, Rigg seems to be miscast, Hughes is inspired and Dysart trumps his short performance. The rest of the cast is too one-dimensional.
