I think most people would agree with me if I said that the film Alien is pretty much setting the bar for the atmosphere. I've seen a few films that match this bar, but no one has outclassed aliens' weird tunnels and darkened halls. The cave is a movie that is trying hard to reset the bar. I think the trailer even mentioned something as scary as Alien, but not once in the movie had I ever had the slightest fear or enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Now that we had the ball I might as well explain why the main hook of the cave (the atmosphere in case you were not careful) lapsed into a waste of my time. I'll say right now that most of the sets were great and well lit, but what we hear and know it is there tends to ruin what we see. The music for one is terrible. We get either crass rock music or exaggerated ghost house music. Okay, maybe it does that a bit, but I could not stand it. The many underwater scenes were bad enough (it's a known fact that underwater scenes are always boring) I did not need any rock music in my ears as they just floated through a cave. This in fact led to unintentional laughter, which was then amplified by the subsequent crash scene of the vessel. <br /> <br /> As I said before, it was not just the music that killed the atmosphere, no. The creatures that hide in the dark are supposed to cause horror. I should worry that they will appear, and just a quick glance at them will make my blood go cold. The cave wisely takes a page from the alien handbook by not showing the entire creature for a very long time and leading to revelation in a few moments, but it just does not work because the creatures are so lame. I think it would be rude to spoil the peculiarities, but they are basically aliens with wings. I think you have understood the point now. Atmosphere ruined. But I know a lot of people who will see a movie when it's exciting. I want to say that about the cave, but I would lie. This movie is slow to get to the action and once we get there, we wonder somehow when that thing will finally call it a day. We've seen that all but a few nice scenes (the guy riddled with stalactites, eels, and rapids) have done better, so you really do not get thrilled when you watch people running in endless tunnels Uninspired Alien Throws Run. <br /> <br /> Ah, no, the pain does not stop there. We also have to consider the characters and the actions. Well, I can not remember a single line of dialogue except "run!" and the only name I can remember is Jack, but that's just because he's in almost every other line at the end of the movie. Maybe the actors were capable, but the script did not allow them to do anything other than walk and argue. They had almost no background and when somebody died, they just dismissed him. It's pretty sad, considering that the CGI eel achieves the best performance in the movie. <br /> <br /> Talking about CGI; There are many of them, most of them are terrible. I recommend them for the use of suits (at least I think they were suits), but nothing is networked with the environment, and most of the effects look pretty hokey. <br /> <br /> So I think to pack The cave is bad and has little to offer. If the movie had been a sci-fi premiere movie or a low-budget movie for release, I might have a little more love for it, but this movie was a theatrical release. With more wit and talent this might have been a frighteningly funny movie, but it looks like this movie is as scary as getting into the basement and that's not very good. <br /> <br /> My review of Frider Waves: http: //friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave
