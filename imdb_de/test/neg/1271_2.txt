Opulent sets and costly costumes that Theodor Sparkuhl has photographed well, and a good (not great) performance by Jannings as Henry can not overcome bad writing and static camera work. Henny Porten chews the landscape as Anne. <br /> <br /> It's all very nice; but it is all surface and no depth. The melodramatic story of a woman who was wrongly committed turned it into a hit in America, where in the same year (1920) the Expressionist "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" flopped. Lubitsch would be remembered for his lively comedies, not for sterile glasses.
