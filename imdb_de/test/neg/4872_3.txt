They make everything too easy in this movie. It somehow reminded me of Indiana Jones, where he hides outside a submarine during an ocean crossing. Everyone knows everything that's going on. It's really easy to find anywhere in the White House. I do not even know why I saw half of it. Because I like Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland. I expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from any angle and run faster than a motorcycle (usually faster than a car in a garage or allyway). It was mostly silly, and I did not even know that I had a ten-story elevator in the White House. In any case, everything is conspiratorially interesting.
