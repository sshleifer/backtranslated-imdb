OK where do I start? I saw a show a few weeks ago and was shocked at how bad this movie is. Sure, if you love Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres (Bad Acting) and think they're the best TV shows, you'll definitely love this movie. Personally, I really like George very much and he is very talented, but comedy is not his strength. Of course, some people are in the comedy and I'm sure he's great and funny to work with, but comedy can not make it on the big screen. It was a sweet movie, but would I pay $ 12.00? H & LL no !!!! Now that I've seen it, I would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money. George, buddy, I love you, but please do not make comedies anymore? This script lacks much, a great concept, but it just was not done.
