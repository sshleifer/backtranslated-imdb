This game was terrible. I think they worked too much on the visuals and did not do much with the gameplay, which is the most important part. I mean, the visuals look amazing, but does the game really "fun"? NO! I mean, it's like "Hey, let's jump off buildings" and all I do is stop and A / X. The game just is not there and I do not agree with what Ubisoft did because that's her name Girls had (the producer of the game, Jade Raymond), and they were like, "OK, we have this hot girl, let's pimp her" and if you go to gaming websites, you will not see any Assessin's Creed video games, you see her face with a microphone and it becomes like "We interviewed Jade Raymond about her favorite biscuits!" It's like a man, close the F * @ K UP WHO CARES ?! Apparently ... a lot of people, because they bought the game and they like it ... I mean, compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that does not really abuse the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and essentially delivers GAMEPLAY! They were able to do a bit of everything with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still stunning, the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing, and this is a game that deserves the Game of the Year. NOT Assassin's Creed, man, it does not even deserve to be a NOMINEE for the Game of the Year. The hype surrounding this game, which looked like "Oh, it's the next generation of games" ... really? I do not think so! Let me make this clear, because I think the people who like this game just like it because they are jade fans. I tell you, JADE will not come out with you or anything if you love or forbid this GAME! If you want a real game on the PS3, get yourself Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, if you want a real game for the Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and a lot of other games) and if you just have a real game want in all systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, if you press two buttons to do all those cool things, is this really a fun game? The only reason other games make it more complicated is that it makes it more innovative and fun afterwards. And this game just is not. <br /> <br /> 1.3 / 10 A LIVING HELL!
