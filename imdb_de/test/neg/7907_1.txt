Honestly, I did not think that the movie has anything humorous. It was really lame and bad, without any conspiracy. Surprisingly, it made me chuckle at the beginning with the Malcolm X-Terminal, and that's about it. Seriously Soul Plane made even the worst movies like Gigli like an Emmy winner. This movie is really not worth seeing unless you were, of course, blind like Johnny Witherspoon, who played the blind man in the movie (another sad character). By the majority of the stereotypical jokes, I cringed and ruined Tom Arnold and D.L Hughley by casting them in this movie. This movie could be summarized in just one sentence. Nashawn wins $ 100 million and creates his own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, did I mention sex? If I could, I would rate this movie with the negative numbers, but the beginning was amusing, which brings this movie to a tenth. "T bag" pfft!
