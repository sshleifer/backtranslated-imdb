This movie is the worst thing people ever did. You think Manos is the worst movie ever? It does not even come close to this garbage. I do not know where to start. The "Russian" commander and the rebel chic are the worst "actors" ever seen in a movie. They make the sister in Troll 2 look like Meryl Streep. The stupid faces the chic does while he's in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed. Then there is the oompa music during the prison break, the totally inappropriate love scene, the stupid song that plays during the inappropriate love scene, the wrong castro, the fact that everyone either wears a headband and / or a bandana is part of their body, the craziest Rape scene ever shot, and the worst acting ever made. This movie deserves to be known among bad movie fans. Definitely the worst movie ever made.
