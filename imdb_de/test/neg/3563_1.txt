Conclusion: very, but very, very boring, yet I watched to the end and hoped for an upside-down effect, but the end was worse, because it was nothing. The old black and white game did not help at all, it usually helps psychological films, but that was not the case. The script, the plot, etc. were linear, had no substance, nothing went wrong. When you study psychology, you are dealing with the analysis, that is, with details, this unit diversity formula ... there was no essence, no detail. Just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and hard to forgive with the tools and creativity of the filmmakers ... well, that's not one.
