Sure, the concept was already created with Alf and the Charmings: The modern society has encountered one or more other characters. But I loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990. When I heard about Scorch, I was really hopeful for something new, as the new TV did not impress me in the 90s (but at least Star Trek: TNG and the Simpsons were still running.) <br /> <br / > What I got was a big disappointment - the acting was awful, but given the ridiculous dialogue and unbelievably incredible writing, I can not blame them too much for what they had to work with - there were some humorous moments, but most of the deliberate jokes seemed to be forced.The entire production of the show seemed too low for what was on television back in the 80's. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it was the first episode, where the characters had to be introduced and the entire premise of the series had to be fixed.The second episode was not that bad, and I was hoping the show would improve as soon as they got their gan had reached g. Unfortunately, my VCR did not record the third episode, I never saw it and the series disappeared from the TV list. All I have now are the first two episodes taken from the air on a VHS tape.
