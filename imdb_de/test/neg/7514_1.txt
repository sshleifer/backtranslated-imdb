This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I still try to overcome how bad it was. Just because it's Godard's name, it's not great. Aside from the fact that it makes absolutely no sense, we see an insanely long stoppage of traffic jam that is not mind-boggling, unbelievable or anything like that. During this long period of congestion, you are more likely to make a pastrami sandwich than to look further. Parts of a supposed story, stupid, stupid characters. Which message do we accept? It offers nothing and serves no purpose. The arrogance of the director in presenting these boring, boring, chain-smoking Frenchmen who talk and talk for hours and then turn them over as art is truly amazing.
