Lance Henriksen has a talent for being the first name in a B-movie, even in this case with Charles Napier, Master Control Program and Joe Don Baker. As always, he does a great job as a bad guy, but the plot is just bad (do not even let me start the end). And the editing is so horrible that it can actually be beautiful. Is it just me or does it seem like Joe Don Baker was spun into the movie at the last minute? Every time a glass is broken in this film, it's so anti-phenomenal. After looking at it, I find David Warner dying for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light Iron Eagle IV and no mercy.
