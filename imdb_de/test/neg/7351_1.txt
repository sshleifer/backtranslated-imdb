I agree with the user "SpecialAgentFoxMulder" that this episode is terrible. Now I'm not interested in many episodes of the later series, but this one takes the biscuit! It was not funny and unofficial. I am sorry for the end, but it has detested me more than any other episode. <br /> <br /> I mean, the guys think they meant well, but the end was so exciting that they belong to the whaler on the moon and over the credits we see it's dead. What could have saved the episode if the prankster had confessed what they had done? <br /> <br /> There seems to be no outgoing message. Okay, South Park may be preaching too much and it's always nice to see an unpreachign (like Make Love Not Warcraft), but this episode was just wrong! Avoid it! Helen xxxxx
