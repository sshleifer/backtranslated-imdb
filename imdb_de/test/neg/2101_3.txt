When I rented it, I did not expect to be blown away. In fact, I knew it would be terrible. It was only to see how terrible it really was. That's what comes with a horror on a low budget. <br /> <br /> "Snakes On A Train," not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster "Snakes On A Plane" starring Samuel L. Jackson, is about a woman who is under a Mayan curse set, the snakes can slip in and devoured them from the inside. Her only hope of surviving is a shaman living on the border. She and her companion stayed on a train going to Los Angeles. Throw a few passengers, and it comes to the amusement. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, the story is not half bad. Is not half as good. <br /> <br /> The drama in this movie can match that of a sci-fi original, if not worse. Trust me, it's terrible. The snakes were another problem. I suppose this should be Rattler, but most of it is mostly harmless garden snakes that do not attack anything, and there's this rattling sound effect that really annoys. <br /> <br /> The Gore effects On the other hand, they were not on the level of Tom Savini, but they were actually pretty good. <br /> <br /> And one more thing, the end makes up for the rest of the movie. I will not talk about it here, so you have to rent that and convince yourself.
