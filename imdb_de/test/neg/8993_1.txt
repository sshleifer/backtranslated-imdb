Naach would have won a Razzie for the worst movie in 2004 (possibly also overall) if he were global. When it comes to acting badly (aka posture / yawning / over (not) acting), Halle Berry is not for Antra Malli. While the Catwoman Storeline had, supposedly hot actress in microscopic costumes, and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all. <br /> <br /> One of those movies that wonders why IMDb rates a movie as 0/10. I also think the movie does not deserve a 0. It has to be something negative or minus infinity. <br /> <br /> OK, what about the action sketch? It's a fund-giving, arrogant, full-bodied stance choreographer who encounters a useless, skilful, less gifted cheater aiming for an actor's story. The story is so brief that, if only one more sentence, I could ban IMDb from writing a spoiler. About storytelling? It's like a bunch (unfortunately 2 people), moving in super slow motion. Do not try this movie if you have bought a new DVD player. You would end up believing that either DVD is in bad shape or a DVD player is down. Not his fault. <br /> <br /> At the end you give the director some credits. At least he realized that both Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan can not speak convincingly (at least at this time), so there are not too many dialogues in this film. So you can at least fall asleep through the movie, with annoying sounds from these Antra Malli song sequences. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you are not yet in Bollywood Cinema. Once you've tolerated this movie, you can watch and enjoy every Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> There can be no worse 3-hour torture than this!
