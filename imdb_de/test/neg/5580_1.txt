Every now and then, it's good to see a really bad movie like this, just so you know how decent an actor Keanu Reeves is in comparison. The premise of this story is good: teens go out on a boat, meteors land in the water, aliens kill teens. What is not to love about when you like screaming thrillers? But I should have known something was going on when I read, it only took 75 minutes. I thought, "I hate judging movies by how long they are, who says a movie has to last 90 minutes?" But when I took the BBuster DVD home, I was shocked at the awful production quality, the acting and the directing of this completely amateurish garbage. The only reason I've seen it through to the end is that I do not have cable TV and I've already paid four dollars for it. However, there was a ray of light: the actor who played "Chris" is actually decent and far surpasses this filth. First, the special effects were cheap and unconvincing. Then the aliens - the costumes seemed to be interesting (rubber suits), but since the movie mostly plays in the dark, you do not really see them! And hardly any of the actors convinced the unbelief. Finally, I have to say that the DVD case was made with much higher production standards than the movie itself, which felt like a rip-off, so be careful when renting other DVDs. Save 4 â‚¬ and buy half a liter of beer.
