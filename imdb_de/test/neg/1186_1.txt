very disappointing and incoherent - from time to time a germ of an idea developed and was discarded in the next line - it had the feel of a film that was cut and re-cut to try to make it work - I was bored and distracted throughout and I speak as a big fan of the series. Many of the jokes were unoriginal and tired. The medieval section took far too long and the quality of acting was very poor - some in the tiny inns, such as Simon Peg and Liam Cunningham, surpassed in their 30 seconds more than the main cast did in 90 min. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame. <br /> <br /> The only really interesting thing was to take a look at the small shed at Soho Square - which is everyone who wonders about it in this part of London.
