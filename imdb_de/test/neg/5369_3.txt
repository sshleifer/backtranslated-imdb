"Paranormal State" is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. I like to see what the "team" has to say and what they "find", but I know that the entire show, along with its constructions and storylines, is completely built up. They go to really haunted places and I suspect they are talking to actual witnesses. When I watch it, I often feel that I do not look at non-fiction, but a real film that contradicts reality. Personally, I would not advise anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic scarecrow. <br /> <br /> Interesting show. Stick to "ghost hunters"
