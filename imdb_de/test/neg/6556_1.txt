Especially if you love horrible movies. When I started to look at it, all I could say was, "I hope there's a dance sequence in there." Imagine my joy when not only the two main characters danced, but the main spirit also began to dance. And Sherman Hemsley sings the Break Dance song (not to mention the theme song). It makes me a little sad that he went bankrupt because of this movie, but I never liked him as an actor and he should have known better. Not even the director would appreciate this movie (and you should check out some of the other films he was a director!) Um, male lower regions. For example, one of the characters discovers a book titled "Last of the Dark Species". I'm not joking. And that's the most disturbing part of the movie for me. Otherwise, find the obscure video store in your town, get the movie, invite all your friends, and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.
