Even if I had not read Anne Rice's "The Queen of the Damned" from the "Vampire Chronicles", I probably thought that this movie was just awful. <br /> <br /> It was tasteless, without plot made absolutely no sense. I sat for a while, thinking about the conspiracy that deviated from the book, and the longer I thought about it, the worse it got. To associate it in any way with the earlier Chronicles movie is ridiculous, as it is ridiculously incompatible with this film, let alone the book. The few ideas that Rice had taken from his genius in "The Vampire Chronicles" were slaughtered and ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It is an absolute insult to the fans of Anne Rice everywhere and such a pitiful excuse for an heir to be Aaliyah's last movie. Really, it's an insult to Aaliyah fans. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only compliment to the sound effects and some graphics. As good as they may be, it's still not enough to regret the time I spent on the film. In fact, I signed up for this membership just because I wanted to share it with the people watching the movie (7 years after release) so as not to waste time or expect much more than disappointment.
