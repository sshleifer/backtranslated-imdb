I like bad movies, but this thing is a steaming bunch. Do not waste a second on this bunch, from the shaky cameraman to the terrible sounds and the devastating spectacle. Fifth graders could have done a better movie and first graders could write a better script. Do you want a real summary? Ugly chicks in neon bikinis dance far too long. A disjointed conspiracy that was exacerbated by abominable action. The on-site sets were not even passable. The church scenes play in a dance studio and oh yes - what about the two tap-dance numbers coming out of the blue? I did not even save this movie - 0. Add it to the Recycle Bin.
