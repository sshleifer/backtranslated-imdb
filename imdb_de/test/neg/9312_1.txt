The most horrible casting I've ever seen. Clark Kent as Crack Head, a very feminine-looking woman as Trans and On and On ............. <br /> <br /> Stupidity of violence, just to be violent. No content, no meaning. This person has never been on the street. It's a joke! <br /> <br /> The only thing stupider than this movie is the fact that I've finished watching it. I always thought it could not get any worse, but it took until the end. <br /> <br /> It is trying too hard to be a movie off the rack. Tried to be freaked out. So stupid! I really have nothing left to say, but I can not leave a comment unless I write more. <br /> <br /> Please take this advice and do not get to watch this movie !!!!! DREADFUL!!!
