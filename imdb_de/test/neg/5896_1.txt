This documentation was very amateurish. It could have been done by students. Suppose that was it, my rating is as follows. Content: C, Sound quality: F, Camera: F, Acting: D, Soundtrack: F, Casting: C, Boobshot: A ...... Overall rating: D <br /> <br /> I found myself seasick, as we walked along the streets with the characters and hopped up and down with every movement of the cameraman. My mother-in-law even changed the batteries on her miracle ear and she could not hear the muffled dialogue. Extensive post-processing and CGI would not help this bomb. These students would "barely" pass my course. My advice ... Do not waste your time or money on an "A".
