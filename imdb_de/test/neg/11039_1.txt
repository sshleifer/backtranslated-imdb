So some people might argue that this is not the worst movie ever made, and no, that's not it. I've seen movies with weaker acts, worse acting, and so on. <br /> <br /> Why do I hate this movie about everything? Well, basically it is a man who is kidnapped for many years. When he comes out, he tries to find out who did it and why to take revenge. The problem I have with this movie has nothing to do with Gore or Horror, but <br /> <br /> *** IMPORTANT SPOILERS STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ***> Our main character basically becomes tempted to have sex with his own daughter, and he wants to cut out his own tongue so that his enemy does not inform her because she did not know it. It's so humiliating that he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission. And why did he deserve it? Because many years ago he saw a brother and a sister in a tender moment - in the wrong way. He went on to tell some people, and as a result commits suicide. And viola, it's the brother who has led our main character through all this. I was wondering, maybe I hate this movie so much because I think its punishment is way too hard. Maybe because I feel that this movie does not condemn incest but somehow confused with love. Maybe it's because I expected something different. <br /> <br /> *** END OF THE SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Believe me, no one deserves what happens to our protagonist in the end, and I am very serious; Do you know how some films just get under your skin and stay there? Well, I felt damn dirty after watching this movie, and I REALLY wish I had never seen it. It stayed with me for days, and some may ask, Well, is not that the purpose of a good movie? The ability to influence us in such a way? Yes, that may be, but this movie not only made me sick, I also felt hurt.
