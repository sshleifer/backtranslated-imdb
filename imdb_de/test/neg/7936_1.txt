They expect it to be young, but at least they expect a complete and coherent film. What a waste. I am extremely disappointed, not only because I have seen a bad movie, but also that such a great concept is influenced by a common movie that we have all seen before. If this guy earns 1 dollar over his budget, it would be wise to win the studio, reattach all the available copies, store them deep in the nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain, and then never make a similar movie again. Most of this movie will make you think, "I did not want to see that." This movie is aimed at the unintelligent and maybe also at teenagers. It's a shame, since most films are made for this demographics. I had much higher hopes for this movie.
