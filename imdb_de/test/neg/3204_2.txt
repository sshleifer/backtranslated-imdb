(SMALL SPOILER) Yesterday I bought the DVD of this movie. I saw it with my friends and could not believe what had happened. <br /> <br /> In the first 3 films, the creatures had at least a sense of humor (especially the 3rd movie), which was not only the case, the critters rarely occur, they were not funny! They never made me laugh. I have to admit that the story started well. After an hour had passed, I remembered that the Critters films were always very short. So I thought, "Where are the $ ^% # $ the critters?!?!" They were hardly in this movie! If that did not anger me enough, the boy named Ethan would be sitting on his bed after Charlie "killed" the ship and he knew the living things were still on board! In the first movie, the Brown family was frightened out of their thoughts. But Ethan did not even care about that! It was as if the living things were not even a threat! Well, what I say next may ruin the end, but I'll say it anyway. In the first film, at the end, they had to face the giant animal for a final battle. In the second there was the big critterball. In the third movie, the animal burned a spindash (by Sonic the Hedgehog) with his darling and wanted to attack the little kid. But at the end of the fourth (which infuriated me the most) the cold-blooded guy storms toward Ethan, and Ethan kills it as if it's nothing. Now something I really do not understand was what happened to Ug. He was one of my favorite characters in the first two. Then he is angry after 50 years. That was very disappointing. Not only that, but was not he a faceless bounty hunter? Why was he still "Johnny Steele?" He also seemed to have a different personality. He seemed much smarter and not as monotone as in the first two. <br /> <br /> As someone who really enjoyed the first two Critters films and loved the third, I enter Critters 4 2/10
