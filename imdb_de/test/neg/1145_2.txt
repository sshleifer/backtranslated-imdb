I'm a fan of some of the Vacation movies, but when a movie franchise switches from the big screen to the TV screen, you know it's out of steam. Made for TV National Lampoon movies are not good on TV. This movie is another reason. <br /> <br /> I think many of us were excited when this came out, but we also had to face reality ... it's a TV movie. Randy Quaid is okay as cousin Eddie, but in a minor role is better than the main role. Dana Barron writes the story as the first actress to play her role as one of the Griswold children. It's just as pretty, but it does not help a thin script. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie ever made? Probably because NBC recently introduced several years of Christmas holidays. There is nothing wrong with acting. It's all in the script. It's just not so funny. People have to think before they write such things. It's a Christmas movie that I can not recommend.
