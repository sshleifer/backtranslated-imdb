Well, the sci-fi channel keeps getting these turkeys out ... and they always seem to get worse. When usually good actors like John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto go down in rank as amateurs, you can imagine how abysmal the REST of the cast is in this waste of time. The only thing that is reasonably decent is the creature's rubber outfit (which is so quickly flashed that you do not really have time to see how wrong it really is). The dialogue ... the plot ... if this "movie" (and I use the term loose) was food, Jack-in-the-box would be a gourmet meal by comparison. Take a look at the 372th review of "The Munsters" - your time would be better (and much more frightening).
