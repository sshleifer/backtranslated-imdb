How anyone can praise this rough movie version after seeing the wonderful WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor is incomprehensible. MAE CLARKE's Myra is a long way from the role that VIVIEN LEIGH plays in the remake She plays a common American woman with a Brooklyn accent and the "Yeah" responses are a bit shattering if you expect a less rude character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed as KENT DOUGLASS) is unlikely unlikely as a soldier in love with her, no matter how many times she abandons him. BETTE DAVIS plays no role in a small part. <br /> <br /> Their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are inconceivable (extravagant overreaction) - even given that this is a grosser version of the story than the sound has been for a few years old and dumb drama was still the rage. <br /> <br /> Just awful. And it ends abruptly with Clarke losing her life in a bomb attack on the bridge. The end. <br /> <br /> The 1940 MGM remake does not include any of the beautifully shaded images, including a supporting sterling font. Instead, this product is designed with low production values ​​(and therefore a shoe-string budget), without any subtlety. And in the scene where Myra tells the aristocratic lady why she can not marry her son Roy, there is no brave pre-code bravery. She simply says, "I picked him up at Waterloo Bridge." Explanation over. Nothing brave. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Exceptionally, the original is by no means the best version. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR were never surpassed as Myra and Roy in the delicate, exquisite 1940s movie classic.
