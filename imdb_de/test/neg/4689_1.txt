What was that horrible movie! After about 50 minutes I skipped to the end of the chapter. The plot is nothing special, and the dialogue in the film is so different from the main story that your head explodes with rage. Many pointless minutes were wasted on listening to characters who were dealing with something irrelevant to the plot, and / or something that could be said in less time. The camera work is shaky and grainy. It seemed like Mr. Milligan had to take his finger off the zoom button! I also noticed that Andy apparently had seizures in some places and shook the camera uncontrollably. The splices between the scenes were nervous and did not flow. The murder scenes were nothing special - unbelievable and ridiculously wrong. Hardly any blood, as the title suggests. This movie runs for about 1 hour and 20 minutes and the murder scenes take about 1 minute of the entire movie - if that's the case. What a miserable piece of rubbish this movie was. In fact, Andy Milligan is one of the worst directors, plaguing humanity with his talentless directing and cinematographic work. Usually I can get through really bad horror movies and later laugh about it. But I can not do BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHERS. I'm just angry that I spent an hour and a half of my life watching this (which I would not do to regain it). Take my suggestion and do NOT watch this movie unless you want to fall asleep. AWFUL.
