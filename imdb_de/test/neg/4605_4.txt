Perry Mason: The case of the Glass Coffin states that Raymond Burr defends David Copperfield / Rick Blaine and the magician Peter Scolari from murdering one of his assistants. A trick with a glass coffin floating in the air goes awry and Nancy Grahn's body falls out. <br /> <br /> Nancy was one of six assistants working with the act, and we learn two things about her. In a moment of drunken weakness, Scolari was seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated. Second, she lives under a supposed name and had a secret from her past. Billy Moses, who probably never thought he would do such a rough job at the law school, gets old folks involved in some good things when they seek the truth in Grahn's hometown. A bit more action than usual for Ken Malansky, he is almost killed himself. <br /> <br /> A big mistake in this puzzle is simple forensics. The medical examiner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a manner that Scolari could not possibly have done the deed. The police should have searched in another direction for the killer. <br /> <br /> If you see who the killer is, you will not blame the person, but you will also see the investigator James McEachin misunderstand it from the start. It somehow spoils this special Mason movie.
