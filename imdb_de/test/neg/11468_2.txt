I was looking forward to this movie. An old Robert E Howard fan, mostly from Conan's point of view. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much and thought that they could not mess it up too much ... oh dear - how wrong was me .... <br /> <br /> The most important mistake was it's pretty boring. It had to be carried away with a nice dose of supernatural acts, sword fights and the like. <br /> <br /> They have a bit of Gore, but everything else was just pretty much lifeless. The middle section seemed to be only 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow dumbing of horse-drawn carriages and even slower dialogue and character development! <br /> <br /> On the positive side = costumes and effects were fine, but not enough to keep your interest. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been better to turn down the Gore, increase the pace and aim for a rating of 12A. As a ten-year-old boy, I might have liked this movie. I've probably been reading the Conan stories for the first time. Maybe that says a lot about my anticipation of the movie? <br /> <br /> Or ....... Do you really go "Art-House" with sound, direction, etc. But that's a pretty big risk like Box Office. <br /> <br /> Well .... Maybe the next Conan movie will make up for it?
