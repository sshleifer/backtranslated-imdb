Once again I was deceived by seemingly intelligent reviews that made seemingly intelligent comments on an obviously crappy movie. I actually put on my shoes, got into my car, burned expensive petrol, and after reading the aforementioned reviews drove to the nearest rental station and paid the required $ 4 and changed to rent this thing. I tell you, this is not worth the tiny kilocalories that have to be spent on raising your index finger to switch channels on a TV remote. <br /> <br /> I gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the tell-tale signs of a pedigree dog. These are presented as clinical symptoms of a director who a. go senil or b. is only slightly interested in the film he is required to produce. I have seen a similar deterioration in recent years with John Carpenter's series of ridiculous cartoons. <br /> <br /> Here are a few scenes as incriminating evidence. The priest has a disturbing dream ... supposedly a harbinger of malice, as he seems to be hellishly inclined to open the archaeological feature in which the demon is located. The dream is a stupid collage of disjointed images straight from the footage of the Twilight Zone. A ticking clock runs through the blackness of the dreamscape, which implies what, the unfathomable mystery of time? .... big thing! A disembodied head painted with demon elements in a convenience store-quality Halloween make-up flickers up and down in a convulsive rush. Every time I see this effect, a big, fat rip-off from Jacob's Ladder, it pisses me off. This in itself almost immediately discredits a movie. <br /> <br /> The entire construction of the archaeological dig itself is ridiculous. Everything is so obvious ... so tired and overworked ... the only answer is boredom. At one point in the excavation, the priest comments on the statues of angels surrounding a sarcophagus. They all point with their weapons at the crypt. He asks, "Look at these surrounding statues, this is supposed to build up tension ... critical mass ... but it does not even come closer! How can there be tension when you treat the audience like a bunch of idiots who handle the tension The pictures are initially exaggerated, but the additional comments add, in my opinion, only injuries. "Soon after, the tomb is" decorated "with the remains of the soldiers who were placed there to guard the main atrium space. Another shameless rip-off of The Keep, by the way.) Who made the make-up effects for this movie because he cried out loud ?! The blood actually had the pink color seen in the 70s Tromaville stripes At that point, I was almost convinced that they had simply forgotten the make-up and had to go to Wal-Mart out of time and money interest, and I will also watch Schrader suspiciously Looks like it's time to hang up his gloves. Perhaps a close friend will give a gentle reminder as long as the memory of past films is still in dignity.
