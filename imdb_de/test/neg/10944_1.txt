Most people have the luxury of entering a movie title and getting informed before watching the movie, but unfortunately I was never one of those people. I would not even read the synopsis for fear of spoilers, but there are two sides to it, because if you ignore such warnings and even give a movie a chance after jumping in the cinemas, you're at your own risk and maybe just English At the end I have a bad taste in my mouth, and that 's exactly how I feel about this stupid movie. English: www.mjfriendship.de/en/index.php?op...39&Itemid=32. Honestly, the only thing good about Shakalaka-Crap-Crap are some of the songs (and serious exclusion of the theme song). Even the promising talent of Kangana Renaut (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously wasted when she plays Ruhi, the woman who attracts the attention of Bobby Deol's two leading male characters (the AJ's rootless music producer) , and Upen Patel (who plays Reggi, an up-and-coming artist who crosses AJ's path). Celina Jaitley offers the right amount of OOMPH required by a celebrity (who helped her get his foot in the record industry door) by a celebrity. That does not sound like a mix or movie that should contain Anupam Kher, right? Well, you're wrong because he's in as Reggis father (another wasted talent). <br /> <br /> The movie might not have been that bad if it had not been for Deol's writing. The moral message was to be preached (revenge had a deadly dark side) and the end was far too exaggerated to ask you why you ever sat down to such a stupid movie. This is truly the epitome of crap.
