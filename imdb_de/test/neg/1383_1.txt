The slogan for this show is, "He speaks his mind, we hire additional lawyers." If you look back in time, a classic, slippery comedian was never proud to be controversial. Richard Pryor's slogan was not "I'm rough, racist and daring." For example, Comedy Central markets this show basically - in your face, without a PC and "honestly" - but how can a TV show be proud to be like that? Where is the humility and humility? And what has Carlos Mencia suddenly turned into a great figure for Comedy Central? Let's start at the beginning - Dave Chappelle breaks off his show (UNEXPECTED became popular and controversial) and Comedy Central is looking for someone with something new to offer. They hire this guy named Ned, who claims to be a Mexican, even though he is not. They spatter his face into a couple of TV spots, making them look like they're "dare" by letting him out to the public. <br /> <br /> I have seen many hateful topics on the forums, and I disagree with the critics of Mencia. This is not a terrible show. I had to cry a few times. If it's funny, it's very, very funny. Yes, it is youthful - but also Chappelle. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlos is that he uses the same material over and over again. And he is too obvious. The open marketing has put aside, "Carlos" has so often said that I have lost the count. He tries to make it the next famous line (like "I'm Rick James, b ****!"), But it's way too obvious. <br /> <br /> In terms of repetition, Carlos uses many of the same jokes again and again. For example, in one episode he said that he would love all Mexicans to disappear from America overnight. He woke up and an American would say, "Room ser'vuce!" with a southern accent. <br /> <br /> He used this joke - literally - when he was on the talk show hosted by Adam Carolla. The second time it was a lot less fun because he looked desperate. <br /> <br /> Is "Carlos" funny? I think so. There are some unheard-of moments in his show. But he's concentrating too much on trying to be controversial instead of just going down the river and having his comedy evolve, of course. Repeating little silly little phrases with silly faces and loud screams, in fact, gets old pretty fast ... I just hope that Carlos - or his authors - can give this show a new head start, because at the moment it's starting to dwindle in repetition of hell
