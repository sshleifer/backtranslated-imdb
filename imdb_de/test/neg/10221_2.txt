I found the first stop-motion animation intriguing and the mostly live action in which the girl was running around in some country that had caught my interest, but the other eleven short shorts did not catch my interest or made me think about anything. The music and the 8mm material all seemed so random that everything looked just random. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you get it for free. <br /> <br /> As far as the music is concerned, that's not the case. I rented the DVD because I thought it was all stop-motion animation or SMA, mixed with live action, and only the first short was SMA, the second had a little stop-motion and mostly live action. There were paper cutouts in one, and the rest were exterior shots of an 8mm camera with the music bed. I just had no meaning, I could see.
