... as you easily recognize the biggest flaw in the movie. What was the motive? The details of the murders were used, but never explained. I think the team has penetrated too much into the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely missing. There is no thread to follow. I think if it was done right, the movie would have taken a little longer, but it would have been worth it, Vicky, at least to my liking. <br /> <br /> Not much to say, really. But I really wish they had focused a little more on the less obvious. <br /> <br />
