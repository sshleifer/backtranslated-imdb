Mmmm, in a previous summary states, "If you like aliens and predators, you'll enjoy this movie," I could not argue anymore. This film does not pay attention to its weighty lineage and has reduced two of the most popular sci-fi strands to something more than worthwhile. The teenager's horror slasher movie has no tension or ignorance in previous alien or predator films and there is none recognizable main character. I really was not interested in any of the characters, and I longed to see the stereotypical cast dying so fast. If it's possible in vain hope that something better would replace them, it's really a human incompetence that two The most fearsome creatures ever invented in a positive way will not create a thrilling, exciting movie. Just look at this, if you want to see how NOT to do it.
