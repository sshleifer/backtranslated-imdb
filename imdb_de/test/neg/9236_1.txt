Altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all titles, from the worst to the very best. He does not care about art (or has no idea) about art. All he cares about is giving people the impression that they have a kick in the groin area by watching his films. The problem is that the effort is far too obvious, and when the events evolve with all the senseless exaggeration that is kneaded into them, the effort fails. <br /> <br /> In this "Turkish" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made, as it felt extremely Holihilian to me), Altioklar tries to be a kind of Tarantino. (Mr. Tarantino, if you're reading this, watch the movie to get the best comedy of your life!) He does not use subtle steps to do anything, all he does is use extreme stuff, and it becomes unbearably absurd and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Levent Üzümcü as the forensic man with the cow-slicked hair is just funny. I hope to meet him in person and to ask how he felt about this movie. Because I found the role really offensive to him. Demet Evgar, who was probing her genitals, was also inappropriate and did nothing but make everything look the wrong way. Another, particularly idiotic aspect of this film was the 100% faulty tempo setting. When things need to be picked up slowly, scenes abruptly stop. And at other times it makes you sleepy when you watch the slow mockery. <br /> <br /> If Altioklar falls so in love with the lame Hollywood superficiality, he should instead use Michael Sixarrows as his name. Even such a move would not be half as ridiculous as what he did in this movie. He should learn not to imitate directors whom he will never approach, only to realize that he is not in Hollywood, and then take private lessons from Zeki Demirkubuz or Reha Erdem to bring the flow of thought into action. This useless movie could not even be saved by them, but in the future he may be able to make visible films with these steps. By the way, I've seen some notorious failures like Propaganda and Otostop and I still can not say that this movie was the worst Turkish movie ever.
