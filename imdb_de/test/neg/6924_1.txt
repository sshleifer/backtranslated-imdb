Owen (David Krumholtz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are a young couple living in Manhattan. Owen is a moderately successful magazine writer, while Chloe is an aspiring actress. Fortunately, Chloe gets a big role in a sitcom and moves temporarily to Hollywood. Owen misses her and books a surprise flight to LaLa Land. When he arrives at her set trailer, the "house" wobbles as Chloe and her handsome co-star have a little romantic tryst. The writer and the actress are through. Injured and angry like a hatter, Owen goes back to NYC. Sympathetic friends decide to meet him with Nadine (Milla Jovovich) on a blind date to free him from his miserable funk. But it's bad because the duo mixes like oil and water, mainly due to Owen's strong personality and big shoulder chip. Over the next few months, Nadine and Owen are amazingly friends who trust and depend on each other. Can it become more? Well, who cares? This movie is so stupid that most people will pull it out of the DVD player after the first ten minutes. The script is pathetic, somber and stupid. On the other hand, Krumholtz also gives a very vile and offensive performance. Jovovich is not much better, but who could look good with the lines she has to inject? William Baldwin also achieves a career with his raw and sex-crazy role as Owen's brother. The only performer who does something good is Richards, but she has to flinch when she looks back at it. Okay, the costumes and production values ​​are appropriate. Then there is also ONE clever thing that the characters occasionally speak their lines, but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads in the words of what they really think. That does not save the movie from "bombs". Do not be stupid, dear film and Romcom lovers. Do not rent, buy or lend this giant turkey. I'm the stupidest person on earth today because I've seen this thing to the bitter end.
