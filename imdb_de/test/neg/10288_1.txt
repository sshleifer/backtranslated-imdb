After a very scary, rough opening that gives you the eerie "Chainsaw Massacre" feeling, everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI officers start to bump, you know they're real killers. Anyone who has seen enough of these "Fool Ya" movies can find out. <br /> <br /> This movie is a single-minded Mader: Brutal Murders. Why is not the little girl tortured and murdered too? Will this be next for us moviegoers? The torture and abuse of children? What is wrong with you people? Lynch really has a disgusting, ugly mind.
