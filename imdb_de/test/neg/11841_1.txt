On a Saturday I had flu, and on the silver background SciFi Channel had a marathon of dinosaur movies that day - the "Carnosaur" trilogy "Pterodactyl", "Raptor Island". Then I flipped forward with my wired remote to see which movie SciFi had on Saturday in its glamorous Saturday night. A movie I'd never heard of was called "Raptor." I was pretty excited. The film begins with some youths driving around in a jeep when they are stolen and killed by a Velociraptor. I thought, "Hmmm, that's weird, it looks almost exactly like a scene in 'Carnosaur', except it was in the middle of this movie." Then I was really bad, and then a guy was scanned into an underground research lab, where he was eaten by a wild T-Rex. Now I'm like, "Wait a second, that was also a scene in" Carnosaur. "After seeing some scenes that were apparently demolished by" Carnosaur 2, "I figured out what the hell was going on. Roger Corman & Co. tore off scenes from the "Carnosaur" trilogy to be used as action scenes, interwoven into a basic "dinosaur amok plot" and trying to output them as an original movie, shameful, I'm not ashamed I do not know who to annoy me more, because Roger Corman or SciFi Channel have tried to call it prime time, and the only reason it's worth watching is the selection of actors / Actresses who looked like their colleagues in the "Carnosaur" trilogy and guess which scenes will be raised next, as much as it hurts me to be a dinosaur lover, there 's nothing left for me but the cute little ones To give the highest possible rating, because I feel totally torn off.
