"Nero," as the title of the film in Germany is called, is another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero. Although this attempt has at least tried to show a more historically precise Nero than the amusing, but completely fictitious Nero, Peter Ustinov played in "Quo Vadis!" it is still a serious failure. And for those IMDb commentators who still believe the propaganda of Suetonius and Tacitus is true, please read a book about Nero, published less than 20 years ago. Nero did NOT burn Rome, that's proven! He did not murder Britannicus. He was not tortured, killed and maimed with pleasure, he was the first emperor to fight the gladiator. The film still shows a lot of mistakes, mistakes and is made in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looked like a villa, the city itself looked like a cheap set. The acting was between good and below average, the music was almost insignificant and the film soon worsened, when Nero became Emperor, to a hectic, badly worked up mess with no clear narrative structure. So there is still the potential for an epic biography of Nero that shows the true Nero who, despite the lies of Sueton et al. One of the best emperors ruled Rome.
