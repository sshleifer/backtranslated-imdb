My wife invited my son and me to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday night, thinking that this might play an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. At least that's the promise the movie makes: Her character is ineffective and sticks to almost every horror movie cliché of the Slasher type. Like the movie. Cataloging the tested attachment to them would be an exercise to remember something I hope to quickly forget, so I will not do any. Basically, this is an idiot who's heavy on the red herrings: Everyone seems to be guilty, not just the two you suspected from the beginning. The rule "excluding the logical and obvious, and what's left" is the rule of bad horror movies. The only surprise that had impressed me was the final clinging of the indefinite final cliché: Will Jane continue her engagement with her attempted savior, who will tell her the identity of the 2nd conspirator (obvious to the public) and drive her into another round of the hysterical victim play. Luckily, I will never know.
