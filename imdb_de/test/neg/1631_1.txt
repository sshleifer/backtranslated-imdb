Like almost everyone else, I've become aware of this turkey on Mystery Science Theater 3000. He is one of the most popular MST3K episodes of all time. I really could not imagine watching this movie alone ... but it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, very, very bad. <br /> Miles O'Keeffe plays as Ator, a muscular Fabio wannabe who lives in caveman times. We viewers are challenged to expose our unbelief by knowing alchemy and chemistry and building a complete hang glider in about 5 minutes. Yes exactly! There is also a pretty attractive actress (she can not remember her name) wearing a hubcap as a breastplate. Oh, and I can not forget that crazy Asian side kick Thong. He had the simplest role in the film because he does not utter a word of dialogue throughout the film. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking ... and he failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The film is in no way to be seen and should only be viewed in the correct MST3K format. If you look at this version you are laughing silly! <br /> <br /> "I'm HUGE !!!!" <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
