If you are looking for a masochistic thrill, borrow this movie and show it to a group of your friends soberly. This movie is just lame but not without value. The short tits are nice and the death of a victim is hellishly funny. Apart from that, that's garbage. But it's still better than "Grim" or "Spookies".
