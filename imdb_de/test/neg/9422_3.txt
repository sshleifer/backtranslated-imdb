Solo is an action movie about a terminator-like Android designed and trained for the military. When an error is detected, it is issued for deprogramming. Instead of facing death, he flees into the jungles of Central America, where he hides in a village. The military chases him in there and leads to a big action party. Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance, the Android. His movements and gestures are mechanical enough to do the job. The real scientific realism is given up to become a good action hero. And it works; The action scenes are not that spectacular, but not too bad either. Acting the other characters is pretty bad, but I did not expect anything good. The special effects were decent. <br /> <br /> Solo is decent as an action movie, but very memorable. It lacks the substance that most films possess. But if you only want to spend a few hours without much thought, this will do the job.
