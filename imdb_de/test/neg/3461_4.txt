This is defiantly a DVD rental movie. I'm a big fan of the cast, but history has never really grabbed me. Do not expect "Oh brother, where are you" in any form. The funniest thing in my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens in the argon. Apparently they wanted to copy some of Clooney's funny expressions from "Oh brother, where are you", but you could say they wanted that. John Krasinski was the bright spot and was consistently solid. Renee Zellweger plays the role of an eager reporter ready to do anything for the story. All in all, it's a movie that pays off at home.
