This is the kind of movie BEGS shows on television at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, if that. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the filmmakers responsible for "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" thought they made a meaningful statement about women and people who were in a science fiction allegory. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it was a tax write-off. <br /> <br /> In any case, "Attack" proves best for the viewer in the following circumstances: a) extreme poisoning, b) seen on a double count of one of those films by Jacqueline Suzanne (maybe "Once is Not Enough?) Or c) just one night where you feel insecure and the world around you is a bit too perfect. Pop in "Attack" and you'll feel great! <br /> <br /> It's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script, the rubbery special effects and the four-eyed sheriff. And I think the last line should be engraved in a memorial somewhere in Washington DC - it's just so memorable. Four stars for "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"; Buy a copy, send it to Gloria Steinem - she will love you for it.
