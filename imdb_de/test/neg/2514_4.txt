After watching Carlo Lizzani's documentary film about Luchino Visconti, I was bound to expect higher expectations before watching this movie made three months later by Adam Low. But the viewer like me was dissatisfied ... I faced a critical opinion that I generally do not like to give because there are no documentary films that satisfy every viewer. There is also no documentation that fully examines a topic. But when I read the reviews for this title, I was also a bit confused. Sometimes people do not know what to criticize. To put it bluntly, I will divide this film into two main parts that differ considerably: the first about Visconti before his career as a director and the last about Visconti, the director. <br /> <br /> The aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the richness that young Luchino has experienced and enjoyed is clearly presented. His efforts in the horse race are mentioned as well as his relationship with his mother, who was disturbed so much after the divorce of his parents. We also get a very good idea of ​​where Luchino was educated as a true Earl of Milan: rich in wealth, with nannies, cooks with access to everything, in TRUE ARISTOCRACY. This is proven, for example, by the splendid villa of his father in Grazzano and other beautiful villas. Visconti's pivotal visit to Paris in the 1930s was particularly marked where he met eminent persons ("leftists") who later had an influence on his style and message in the art. This clearly explains the idea of ​​a communist with aristocratic education (a contrast at first sight). <br /> <br /> However, the part about the career of its director, who started out at OSSESSIONE in World War II and ended up with INNOCENTE shortly before the death of the director in 1976, is poorly executed. His films are not well discussed. Why? Because there are very few people who really have something to say. The director Franco Zeffirelli remembers the work on LA TERRA TREMA and that's fine. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi. Later, such films as IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig, I did not like the interview. Moreover, some of the thoughts he unveils are not true in such a documentary. Important works by Visconti such as CONVERSATION PIECE are not mentioned. There are no interviews with the famous Cast Burt Lancaster. Mention should also be made of Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider. There is an interview with Maria Callas that seems interesting, but it's only a short piece. Franco Zeffirelli, although I appreciate him as a director, makes fun of it rather than saying something really valuable. For example, he mentions the event of how Visconti separated from him after years of service. That's why I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> What I find special here are footage interviews with Visconti. As a result, we can get his own opinion about his works. For example, I appreciate very much the words he says about death as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. He also talks about his health problems after the stroke when he turned LUDWIG. I think it's better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) by Carlo Lizzani than this document. Although it is shorter and compressed overall, you get a better idea of ​​the director. Visconti would be angry about that and the anger he used to turn people's feelings and points of view into stone ... 4/10
