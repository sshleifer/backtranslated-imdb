The blame for this terrible film lies with the director Martin Campbell. Having looked at some of his credits in later years, this must have been one of his first directing work. He had a more than decent lineup to work with, but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that made absolutely no sense. Where was his head ............... he had drugs? I was looking forward to this movie just because of Oldman & Bacon. Maybe it was a short schedule and Campbell just had to "kick it out". I can not imagine that the story that Campbell conducted even came close to the writer's story. Oldman & Bacon, along with the rest of the cast, must have slipped under their chairs when they went to the show. As a poster emphasized, Karen Young did a pretty good fight scene with Bacon. She really let go. It is unfortunate that I have to fill in more space to stay within the guidelines of the IMDb because I really have nothing left to say to this uninspiring film. You do not have to be forced to be a "windbag" when you criticize a horrible movie and wish that the IMDb would change the number of words to fill a critique.
