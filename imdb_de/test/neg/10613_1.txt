Young writers, young writers, young cast, producer productions, what could go wrong? Everything. Even lame is too good a description, suggesting that three out of four legs worked, though none of them actually worked. Barely enough, Plotline recycled for a 48-hour television lesson, stretching to ninety minutes stretched. The audience spoke back to the screen, the story was so bad. Dirty police steal drugs from the evidence room. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad policemen frame good policemen. Again how often? There was no original scraps in this whole preparation. Giovanni Ribisi did his best to reinforce the lack of scripts and only laughed at the whole movie. And the thought that he and Claire Danes are working on a real script with an adult director and being photographed by a real cameraman fascinates me. Note to scriptwriters: Buy one of these story generators. It can not possibly be as bad as demolishing bad TV. Note on authorization: There are different shots available than close-up shots. Even the lovely and interesting face of Claire Danes gets boring in close-up. Note to the cameraman: Let yourself train for a few years to the specialist - you have much to learn. Note on the color timer in the lab: At least try to convince the author and the cameraman that they do not know what they are talking about. Note to Claire: I hope that has paid off for your new apartment. It's time to learn professional management and read the scripts before signing up.
