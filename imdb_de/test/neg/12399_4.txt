It's strange what fate does to some people. When I saw the discounter at a DVD dealer, I came across Deadly Instincts. As a collector of a movie that's either sci-fi, horror, or alien monster, I decided to buy it (not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars - a bargain, believe me). After seeing it, I thought it was nothing special. After some research on the internet, however, I discovered that the film was actually called Breeders and was a remake of the Tim Kincaid horror movie that threatened the video stores in the mid-1980s. What I've seen My appreciation for "Deadly Instincts" grew after this discovery. <br /> <br /> A meteorite crashes in the meadow next to a private girls' school. The only teacher, Ashley (played by Todd Jensen - that's right, the guy who was turned into a cyborg four years ago in the cult strip CYBORG COP), notices some of the students starting to disappear as they meet a black woman with a scarred face and a tangled leather outfit. His investigation shows that an alien creature had made a ride on the meteorite and come to Earth to breed with the indigenous women. Together with a local detective who believes he is responsible for disappearing, Ashley tries to stop the monster. <br /> <br /> The original BREEDERS, directed by Tim Kincaid (who would be leaving the genre for gay pornography), was a sci-fi / horror film that was a thinly disguised software. Core pornography act, which was intended to bring the Genrefans skin shots. In my opinion, it is one of the worst films of the eighties. Why someone wants to remake is quite a mystery. <br /> <br /> This remake is actually a better effort than its low budget source. The film, which adopts the basic concept of an alien monster trying to mingle with human women, eliminates all pornographic elements. In fact, the movie is indeed very tame. There are no sex scenes, no nudity (even during the shower scene), cursing and violence are kept to a minimum level and there is no gore (which can cheat Gorehounds). This makes the remake a safe movie for the whole family, ie if the kids are not afraid of alien monsters (which brings me to the rating M 15+ of the movie, which seems a bit much). <br /> <br /> Apart from the fineness of the theme, the film has some shortcomings. Although the script has some good characterizations, it has a number of holes that are large enough to pierce a meteorite. <br /> <br /> What? Are you mad at me for that? Come on, this review needed a bad pun, so it will stay interesting. Anyway, movie setting is a problem the script could not fix? The movie is set in Boston, but the buildings do not look as if they belonged to Boston. There is something wrong with the architecture. Another thing is the college itself, with a fairly large building of about twenty students (all female of course) and just one class? Art. The only teacher there has a relationship with a student (and also the janitor!), Which somehow escapes the headmaster's attention. Not to mention the bulls that are so one-dimensional (and stupid) that the real Boston PD would have a good case if they ever decided to sue. Oh, and the meteor? Well, the chance that a meteor sent by Saturn (check the initial credit) that reaches Earth without on-board propulsion is astronomical. This does not include the chance that passengers in the meteor survive the landing. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, Todd Jensen gives a dependable performance as a heroic teacher, while the late Kadamba Simmons (who was murdered by her boyfriend shortly before the movie's release) makes a striking figure in this leather outfit and proves that she can act. The visual effects are unsurpassable. The filmmakers have provided us with a cool monster.
