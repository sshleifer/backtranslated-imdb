I'm not sure what it is, but there seems to be a curse when it comes to movies about the elusive Bigfoot. There still has to be a film that intelligently approaches the subject, and that does not generate any real tension. Both "Legend of Boggy Creek" (1972) and the first film entitled "Sasquatch" (1978) have become small cult classics, but both were not very memorable. Both movies were geared towards a family-friendly audience and thus prevented them from actually scary anyone. "Harry & The Hendersons" (1987) was the first big budget movie to use Bigfoot with a terrific creature design by Rick Baker. But they, too, have chosen a younger audience, but this time as a comedy (like "Bigfoot" 1995). I've been waiting a long time for someone to be a thriller on the subject, perhaps in the vein "Jaws" or "Predator". When I saw this in my local video store, I thought my dream had come true. Boy, I was wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who heads an expedition to the Pacific Northwest, hoping to find his daughter when she was aboard a small plane when it crashed in the mountains. The premise is interesting and promising. The truth is that it never builds a real tension. I have never been interested in any of the characters, as each of them was very two-dimensional and rather bland. Even the ever-reliable Henriksen seems to be on the phone in his performance. Every time he appears on the screen, he looks bored. He should be, because in the first hour of the movie there is no action to speak of. Where do I start with the creature? At least I thought we were going to let a cool-looking monster roam the forest, but instead we have that bald-headed man (yes, I said "bald!") With pitch-black skin and patches of fur here and there. Imagine a cross between "Swamp Thing" and Chaka from "Land of the Lost" and you get the idea. Nothing like the artwork on the cover box, I assure you. Careless editing and careless directing also add to the confusion, because half of the time everything did not seem to be in the right order, while the other half of the movie was constantly with these long, slow fades (which did not make any sense or served any purpose) was used up. They even stole the entire infrared vision P.O.V of the creature in "Predator", who just looked too stupid and inappropriate to be effective. Maybe that just proves that Hollywood should simply forget trying to do more Bigfoot movies, since they do not have to make one that works. So far everyone has been as frightening as an episode of "In Search Of" 3/10
