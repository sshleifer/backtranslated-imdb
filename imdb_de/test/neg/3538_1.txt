The only reason I saw this movie was because it had Giovanni Ribisi and it should be "horror". Do not be fooled, this movie must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. It's about these people who go to a secret place that contains a "monster". The monster is a man with a deformed face, who runs around in blue tracksuit pants and has a craving for mind. Some people die, others do not. In the end, they throw the monster out of a plane and then fly away happily. BUT WITHOUT NO! The monster is still alive after it has fallen off a plane! Spend two hours in another way, such as For example, how paint looks dry on a wall. Trust me, it's more entertaining than this crap.
