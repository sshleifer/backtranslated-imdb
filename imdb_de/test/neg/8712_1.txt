I almost fell asleep during a show. From a boring story that seems to go on forever, she follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. After a heated affair, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they can not be together and how they have to go their separate ways. The male prostitute then goes on a downward, self-destructive spiral to find his "one true love", which kept returning to the same places they were in, looking for clues or clues as to where he might find his love , In the meantime, he associates himself with an ugly guy (who I thought was a male prostitute too), a gay Basher, and a guy who ends up having a "three-second sexual intercourse session" with him in a back alley. <br /> <br /> It never fails to amaze how movies STILL depict random sex scenes as scenes that can take place in seconds, as in this case, where the trick barely unbuckles his pants before being thrust three times and miraculously experienced an orgasm! <br /> <br /> All these random encounters end with the sexual partner who asks him to call her, whereupon he rejects her phone numbers. <br /> <br /> There is a short subplot with the main character visiting his busy mother, who seems to have no time for his lifestyle. There is also a short subplot with a chance conversation with a young woman who has seen him several times on the bridge from her window. There is also a short subplot in which he shows the letter to a male acquaintance, but the audience is not informed about his relationship with that person. <br /> <br /> None of these things really connect with each other Just to show us how lost and confused this young man really is. He seems to live life like a ghost. There was a good scene in the entire movie as he scoured a farm sale looking for a particular album that featured the saddest song in the world. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie just seems to last forever. Filmed in black and white, it may seem like a dream, but if you sit in the theater for almost two hours, when you see this game, it's more like a nightmare! <br /> <br /> I found the end as confusing as I was not Not sure if the young man died and went to heaven? That would have been a nice reward to end the misery that had to endure both the audience and the main character in this pointless trip. However, since this is an "independent film", movies with such endings should be encouraged to "use your imagination". <br /> <br /> For those looking for nudity, there are only brief scenes, and most of them are filmed in a way that artfully hides everything in the shadows. In other words, do not waste your time with this. <br /> <br /> My rating - 2 out of 10
