All Grown Up had a lot to do and there was a lot of hype when this show was announced. Now, it's easy to explain why it did not live up to expectations: First, this show could not create a realistic pre-teen world, as Rugrats conquered the world and the imagination of toddlers. Secondly, the characters of the show are stereotypes (Angelica: White-tainted blondes as opposed to Suzie: Little girls from humble families, ...) or boring (Tommy, Chuckie) and annoying (Dil). After all, there is no ounce of innovation or an original plot line. All in all, All Grown Up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a sequel to a series like Rugrats. It is boring, there is a lack of imagination and it seems that the producers do not even know how 10-13 year olds behave. In fact, Angelica and Suzie should not compare the bra sizes, rather than arguing about who does the housework better?
