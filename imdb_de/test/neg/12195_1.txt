That was not a good movie !! Why do you keep saying that? There is a nice little story and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires !!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where are you from? Also what the hell ?! There are all these "super human" vampires, but George Clooney and three other random guys are ALL of them. It's not like there's a long battle scene with a lot of fighting. There were only three people in the bar killing these vampires like a fat man killing twinkies! The next thing you know, Clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by Cheech, leaving the homeless homeless in the middle of Mexico. End of the story. Literally. Oh, and the strip club was an Aztec temple, which is funny, because that would be South Mexico, not the border. Why are you lying and telling people that this is a good movie? Do not borrow, buy or watch this movie with a friend. You wish you had this time of your life back.
