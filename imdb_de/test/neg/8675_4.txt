Oh man! The BBC is on the verge of being knocked off its pedestal to absorb the dramas of that era. I agree that this novel by Jane Austens is difficult to portray, especially for a modern audience, the heroine is hardly an Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not destined to make female hearts skip a beat. However, I have to say that I had hoped for an improvement in the last hope and unfortunately was disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so changed that everything that was Jane Austen's tone, behavior, feeling, wit, and depth was watered down, if not lost. If some adjustments of the past are considered outdated, the weakness of this one must be too modern ("his life is a long party" ?????). The cast was generally sufficient, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone who was more reserved, I did not get a sense of hidden depths beneath a submissive look, she was more like a joking kid. I see, I have to wait until the BBC unfolds its magic again.
