I saw this last night for the first time in 40 years. It's bad. Really bad. But it has enough funny, horrible moments worth seeing. Was it purposely intended to make the boy who is a babysitter completely feminine? He even says to Costello a la Mae West "You fascinate me!" Costello doubles God only knows what would have happened if the babysitter had been a guy. This kid would have seduced him in a heartbeat! Then there is the main dancer. He is totally incompetent. Roaring with laughter, he dances without talent over the grave of the giant, while he never looked better in His life. The two romantic leads are zeros, wastes. Abbott sings a line that was recorded by another singer. Gosh, I think he could not even carry a tune! Costello manages to be charming in his I Fear Nothing number, and I think very young kids might like it, but there is not much to recommend. But oh, that seductive, feminine boy! This aspect alone blew me away! Plus the fact that the family accepts everyone on the street, with no clues to babysitting a child! Today they would take away the little Femmy boy!
