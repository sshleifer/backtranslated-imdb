OK, everybody is so excited about this movie, I dare hardly add a negative review, but I just did not enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> First I have to say that I have seen the film in Russian Some dialogues, but not much. <br /> <br /> Nice things first. There are some funny moments (for example the Elvis impersonator). Actors seem to be well cast, including the Russians. Efremova is great and Goldblum is very good. Which brings us to the disadvantages of this film. First. There is hardly a story and we already know the end: Yeltsin wins. So no drama or tension. They have tried to solve this problem with an emerging affair between the above actors, but this story evaporates. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the movie is not a reality. The Russians at the level of politics and society depicted in this film are not funny, they are a serious and dangerous crowd. I'm ready to believe that flying with some state-owned spin-doctors helped Yeltsin win his campaign, but the really interesting questions that should be raised are: who funded the campaign? from the broadcast of some commercials? <br /> <br /> So here we have a film based on reality (strangely enough, avoiding anything that could make the movie historically relevant or just a very good political thriller) without conspiracy or subplot.
