Reports on the brilliance of this film seem to have been exaggerated, and if the other reviewers have not looked at another film, I can not see how anyone can find this film boring, unconventional, unspectacular, overly and sometimes unbearably irritating. I'm not a shy horror fanatic. I love j horror and euro horror about American horror every day, but I feel the need to warn potential viewers about this movie before investing two hours of their lives in the movie. <br /> <br /> It could be so great. A reporter examines a series of bizarre deaths and incidents that appear to be disconnected, but a series of disturbing tropics seem to connect them - dead pigeons, rushing noises, the presence of oddly knotted knots ... Our reporter goes from person to person they interview, film and then pass on. Three important characters are among this jumble of people, a young, shy psychic girl, an extremely irritating, crazy psychic man, and a crazy old woman and her boy, the meaning of which is revealed later. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the movie is not even remotely interesting, which makes its two-hour run unforgivable. It's not even scary or scary. Probably scary scenes, such as shots of scary faces, are made incredibly poor, shown twice or, worse, we are told when they will happen. Other techniques, such as telling us that a family that has just been interviewed, "died five days later," just does not bother me, let alone a bit crawling. <br /> <br /> The movie increases towards the end. As our reporter, cameraman, pastor, and cursed woman go to a village to "remove" the curse that binds all these deaths together. At the time, however, I was in a catatonic boredom and I did not care that the scary camerawork and shocks were wasted on me. The "last tape" is pretty good, but once again I had given up the care and just wanted this movie to end. Boring and boring, not scary and not scary, I would advise you to keep going away from Noroi. It has promising moments, but this is a movie that has been done badly and is not worth your time.
