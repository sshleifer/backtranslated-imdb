In a future where a hardworking travel agency uses time travel technology to send wealthy clients back in time to explore the dinosaur age, the future is inexplicably altered when one of his clients breaks the cardinal rule of not straying from the path. To remedy the damage, an experienced Time Scout (Edward Burns) collaborates with the inventor of the technology (Catherine McCormack). <br /> <br /> The premise is pretty good and captivating. It may have a few bugs, but it could still make an interesting movie. Unfortunately, A Sound of Thunder can not really captivate the audience. It has a number of problems and it is taking too seriously, so it is difficult to enjoy watching the movie. Personally, I thought the script was the movie's biggest problem. There were more storylines than expected and the movie was pretty lazy in terms of explanations. I hoped for a deeper insight into the "butterfly effect", but the movie was more fun than anything else. That's alright for me, because 90 minutes of pointless fun is still a nice way to spend an evening. All the fun this movie offered, however, was unintentional and lame. There were a few scenes that talked me, but I was pretty bored. <br /> <br /> Acting is not much better, as most of them are more interested in a paycheck than in anything else. The only person who did well was Ben Kingsley. He made the first half of the movie enjoyable and also seemed to have the most fun. Edwards Burns was pretty pale and bland. I do not think he has what it takes to be a leading man. He could, however, make out a decent supporting actor. Catherine McCormack was really annoying and not very credible. I have not seen her otherwise, but she could have potential. The rest of the actors also perform poorly, though most of them are relatively unknown. Therefore, her career should not affect you too much. <br /> <br /> When you look at the message boards, most people complain about the special effects. There is no way to gloss them over and they are terrible. All dinosaurs look really bad. The Gibbon Lizards (Partial Monkey, Part Dino) become obsolete during a creative idea after a while, and they encourage laughter rather than fear. The Green Screen work just looks awful and unprofessional. I was really wondering what director Peter Hyams was trying to achieve here. He does not manage to convey tension, action and thrills, and makes this movie a long sitting. In most cases, however, the film is quite harmless and far from the worst movie of 2005. Hopefully they will make this movie new in the future. There's potential in this project, but right now this is the best we've got. In the end, there is no reason to see A Sound of Thunder unless curiosity prevails. Rating 4/10
