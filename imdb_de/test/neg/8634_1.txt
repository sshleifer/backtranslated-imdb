I know that for you Americans it is hard to find European films on video / DVD, especially from the 80's, but please look for the original version of the vanishing title Spoorloos (1988) - and you will see why the Hollywood Version of The Vanishing screws is Bigtime, especially at the finale. <br /> <br /> I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and especially Jeff Bridges, but that's just so lame compared to the original. What did you think? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending in which Gwyneth Paltrow ran happily into the arms of Brad Pitt in the final? The whole point where the original had such a huge international success was the shocking finale. Why do you accept such a shy remake? Really, avoid that and get the original.
