Stanley Kubrick, a director I admire for his masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Killing, The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, etc.), put the film out of circulation, leaving him to only find hardcore fans and completeists. After watching the movie for myself, I could see why. Kubrick had already refined his still photography for the LOOK magazine at the age of 24 and made a few short documentaries. Like many first-time filmmakers coming after him in the decades, his ambition for Fear and Desire was, in short, simply making a cheap movie that more than likely saw if he could. He was successful in that regard. The movie itself is definitely not the case. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that the film is a failure, because there was something I thoroughly liked about everything. Even as the story of the film has fallen by the wayside and the actors (whom Kubrick had no idea how to direct, not a man of the theater), this film shows his ability to produce and record great images has, its germs. In suspense / action scenes, there are sometimes shots of close-ups and quick shots that catch your eye. Unfortunately, that's all good, what I can really say about the movie. Although there are a few "name" actors in the film (Frank Slivera, who also starred in Killer's Kiss, and Paul Mazursky, a director of his own), the overall appearances are boring and very routine. In fact, that's the main disadvantage of the movie for me; Whenever I watch a Kubrick movie, even his early movie Noir's Killer's Kiss and the Kill, I can tell who did it, as his style has now prevailed. It was not as "artistic" as I imagined (which is usually the case with first-time directors like Scorsese and Spielberg), but when you looked at that movie, it did not just feel like Kubrick, it felt as well I looked at a class B (or even C) movie by a director who forgot at the time - not quite "Ed Wood", but close. The music is as standard as possible, the transitions are pedestrian, and the plot does not really seem to attract much attention. In short, as others have said and I can agree with, this is a "doodle pad" of a future spade-teaser showing some shots and a few edits that get some attention (the best scene overall is when the soldiers are the stupid ones Take hostage), but not enough to really be commended I myself, who in the end has seen everything of Kubrick (or perhaps even has to watch every war movie on an extremely low budget), if only out of curiosity.
