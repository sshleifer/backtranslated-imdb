I would like to comment on how the girls are selected. Why are they choosing more white women than black women? In every episode there are more and more white women than black. as if to say white women are better than black women. I would like to see more black women than white ones. and it's not just your show, it's like there are more and more whites in many shows. but I would have thought that as the main echo of the show you would see yourself and have more black women in your show. But you are like the rest and try to behave yourself so that you are so beautiful and nice. You are just a big hypocrite.
