This is a perfect example of why many people say that the nineties are shit when it comes to horror movies. A boring voodoo on campus tale of terror with the once so promising Corey Feldman (STAND BY ME, THE LOST BOYS, etc.). There may just be enough things to prevent falling asleep, and it does not look too cheap, but this is still a horror targeting an audience that was in their 90s in their early teens. I may have been part of this audience, but I still did not do much of it when I saw it now. Nowadays, the teenager is much more and better used, and I can not imagine any of them knowing or caring who Corey Feldman was. Or "is" actually, because the guy is still making films. But the only thing that still connects him to his fame days is the sequel to LOST BOYS 2: THE TRIBE, which was recently made. And I can even imagine that nobody is encouraged to go to VOODOO. Just another movie that was lost for obvious reasons in the horror of the 90s.
