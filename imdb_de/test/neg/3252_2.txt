This movie should never have been done! It stinks, it's awful, it's not good, it's bad, it's awful. Start to see a pattern here? Jackie Mason is certainly not Rodney Dangerfield. Away were Ted Knight and Bill Murray, who together with Dangerfield were indispensable for the first film. It seems that the three (the stars) all knew a stinker of a script when they saw one. The one who did not have the good sense to bow to this was Chevy Chase, who was close to me but in my opinion was a stranger to both films. This movie is just not funny. It also has no other endearing features. This thing is heavily dependent on anti-Semitism, and it is detrimental. I hated this thing. A waste of everyone's time.
