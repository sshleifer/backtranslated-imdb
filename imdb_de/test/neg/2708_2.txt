A deafening movie, a quasi-old-fashioned screwball trumpet showing the comedic qualities of the singing star Madonna. In fact, she goes far beyond the proverbial limb and plays a survivor prisoner who tries to prove that she was framed for murder (a body was found in the trunk of her car after she lit a red light ... big laugh ). After an energetically animated credits sequence - which is much more fun than the rest of the picture - we have nothing to look at but Madonna's black mascara and red lips triggered by her platinum hair and pale complexion. What else is there? Griffin Dunne seems to be defeated by Maddy's Keeper, while the poor choice that supports the cast tries to laugh with lousy dialogue. It is an unfortunate setback for the talents of director James Foley, who unwisely runs his star in the spirit of nutty slapstick movies from the 1930s (but even Katharine Hepburn in "Bringing Up Baby" had a human side). Misery. * from ****
