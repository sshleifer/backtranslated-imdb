I saw this movie and was bored! I'm a fan of Peanuts, but I can not understand why Charles Schultz admits this catastrophe! Spoiler ahead. <br /> <br /> I can not believe Snoopy would let his friends sleep in a dangerous situation out on the ground, go to a bar and drink a few cold ones without standing there. The story was utter nonsense even for comic characters. They take too long to get to France, and when they came to France, I felt that the author (I still can not believe it was Schultz) did not know what to do once they got there <br /> Peanuts are best produced in 30-minute episodes, not in 80-minute films. <br /> <br /> Go home, Charlie Brown, you are best there. <br /> <br />
