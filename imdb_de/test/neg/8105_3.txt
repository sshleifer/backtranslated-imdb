Poor Bela Lugosi. Only one more day at work. A group of saboteurs who try to disrupt the American war effort from within. It's hard to figure out in the beginning, because although we know these guys are up to something, their way of working is just not very clear. I will not spoil it, but the end is pretty amazing. There are a number of murders committed by our hero. A police who do not know what's going on. What a coincidence that all victims come and go from the same house. There are comments like, "A real patriot would do this or that." It is obvious, while the suspicion abounds, that most people would not know a spy or subversive when he jumps up and bites them. I was also surprised to see Clayton Moore (the lonely Ranger) in a romantic role. I never realized he'd ever done anything other than sit on a horse. Of course, there is the complacency of criminals who believe they are immune to the murderer's guest list. Anyway, Bela is kind of a good guy and a bad guy. The best scene in the movie is finished, but I will not spoil it. As a curiosity and a piece of time, it can be fun to take care of some people.
