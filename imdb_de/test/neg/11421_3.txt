On many fronts was not much thought. This is a good action movie, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> - The film says the Lycans were kept during the day to protect the vampires. Nevertheless, they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks. So they can not turn into their wolf form or do anything that other slaves can not do. How does this protect the vampires during the day? Who are they protecting the vampires from? The uncontrollable lycans? The slaves in human form are nothing but peasants. <br /> <br /> - I understand that vampires are immortal and do not age. But Sonya ages from the child to the adult. Do you just stop aging at a certain age? I understand that Viktor is old because he was filmed (as explained in the second movie). But vampire babies are aging? Strange. <br /> <br /> - I did not know that vampires needed torches at night. Still, we see them carrying torches throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> - Silver was the only thing that supposedly harmed Lycan. But also wood steaks, which are fired by the giant crossbows, kill the Lycan. <br /> <br /> These are just a few of the things that just show a lack of reflection in the story.
