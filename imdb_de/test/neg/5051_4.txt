The only reason I saw this movie a second time was to find out the name of the "second banana girl" playing alongside Katie Holms. Her name is Marisa Coughlan. I have never heard of her. She is lovely. Captivating With an animated face and a sweet body she is very good to see ... She really has "Poisenality" ... more than just a temporary feeling of Grace Kelly ... with youthful cockiness. I think she is Irish in the gene pool (my favorite female DNA), so it makes sense that she resembles the most beautiful Irish American. The film is unremarkable, Katie Holms is classic beauty in the flesh. But Marisa Coughlan is the one who follows you with your eyes. In 1999, when this film was shot, she was about 25 years old, in prime condition. It reminds me of another stupid, worthless movie with the only redemption the Pretty Girl has in it. It was "Career Opportunites" when I saw Jennifer Conoly for the first time. Or "Grease II" when I saw Michelle Pfeiffer for the first time.
