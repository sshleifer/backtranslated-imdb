We all know that the world is full of dubious horror movies. Some of them can be fun because of their stupidity, their terrible impact, and their uncomfortable dialogue. But Raptor, who could have been in the same league as the equally pointless Carnosaur series, does not even ATTEMPT have fun at it. It's so bad, it's really unbearable, even if you look at it with the intentions of having a day without a brain at home. Where do we start? Well, the sets are pretty drab. My old theater group has created more realistic stages. The genetics labs look like they're from a university, and it looks just as incredible from the outside (even if you cover up, why bring yourself near civilization, where people can easily hear the dinosaur), while the Doctors department does not do this. I do not look believable at all. Next up in the Complaint List are the creature effects. Well, what can I say? Absolutely pathetic. I also find it worth mentioning that the tits of the woman are mentioned as an effect. Both female protagonists obviously had brutal activities, and it brings down the characters. One female is a respected member of the police, while the other is the cute, "innocent" daughter of the sheriff of the cities. But acting is by far the worst tragedy. Eric Roberts can be excused for trying to give his role at least a bit. There it ends. Corbin Benson was said to have killed his costume designer because he made his lackluster performance even miserable, while the female lead SO looks boring (though you could skip it on that movie). The other character I want to point out is the daughter who lets her tits do all the acting in the "hardcore" sex scene (ten minutes of endless replays of her bouncing on a guy). <br /> <br /> All in all and summarized. Do not bother, just do not.
