Bill Rebane's "The Capture of Bigfoot" is one of the most terrifying horror movies ever made. A greedy sawmill owner, Harvey Olsen (Richard Kennedy) decides he wants Bigfoot to be captured at all costs. However, local gamekeeper Dave Garrett (Stafford Morgan) learns that the Bigfoot lived in peace lived by a geological expedition and set out to protect the creature. There is nothing interesting in this piece of scrap even remotely. The film is extremely boring and full of terrible songs and cheap special effects Gore, no tension - just a huge boredom. Avoid this horrible garbage like the plague.
