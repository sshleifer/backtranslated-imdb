A wallflower is thrown into the sea and dreams herself as a pirate fantasy as a fiancee in a pirate apprentice. Energetic and good-natured perhaps, but a modest enterprise; a failed musical broadcast of "The Pirates of Penzance" with a cheap, uncomfortable feeling, worn-out bubblegum songs and constant, dazzling overacting. The film career of Kristy McNichol was then a real hit, while the leading man Christopher Atkins can not get a special emotion under control. His voice wavers in search of a suitable tone. You have to wonder if this is the best title you can imagine, how much joke the actual script will be. The "Grease" -like affinity of the film for musicals does not combine the propensity for slapstick a la "Airplane!", Although McNichol works overtime, the effervescence, and the slender handling almost appealing. Mostly it's an embarrassment. * 1/2 of ****
