A formulaic story with all the tired stereotypes. I was shocked that the horrible script became a movie! What a waste! How many ORIGINAL scripts are scattered without being produced? <br /> <br /> At the peak, I was able to predict what will happen in each setting. Oh, and do not even let me start talking about the idiotic sexual tension between the pretty policewoman and the paralyzed policeman who can barely move a finger. YES EXACTLY. I can buy that. What next? Finger porn?
