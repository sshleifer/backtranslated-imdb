I have seen some cruelties of the cinema. In the last few years, producers and directors seem to be making films that bring me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was no exception. I did not expect much when I saw the movie. The book was ridiculous and the saying "The book is always better than the movie" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. But what I saw was a movie that made all the other bad movies look better in comparison. <br /> <br /> When I see a horrible movie, I usually find myself amused more than anything else. Unfortunately, I could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a movie that is Hannibal. I think the movie was made with pledge. There were Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman. And as a director there was Ridley Scott. There were films with significantly less talent, which were enormously better. I cut so much out of this movie that I doubt there was anything left. It was pathetic. The story was so ridiculous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. Worse is that the book was even crazier and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be recorded, which is sad in the case of a movie where the spoiler is going on. <br /> Ray Liottas Brain was cooked to pieces. This scene, more than any other, made me want to cry because it had clouded its predecessor to such a monumental level. The Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite movies of all time. But Hannibal was two hours plus joke. This movie should only be viewed if people want to learn how to write a good movie.
