The film is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary renditions, torture and the politics of the war on terror. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the film. My review may contain spoilers. If you have not seen the movie, you may not want to read further. <br /> <br /> Several questions are raised in this film. Was the protagonist guilty or not? There is no satisfactory explanation for why the NSA chose to pick it up and make it first. Is there an innocent explanation for why he got calls from the NSA, which he considers a terrorist? If so, the film does not seem to give and that makes the whole movie pretty unsatisfactory for me. It is good and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong, but first you prove to me that you have tortured the wrong person, then we will take it to the next step. <br /> <br /> If the protagonist was guilty, what was achieved by releasing him? Maybe we were well trained to resist to a certain point and then pretend to clash and give answers that, with a little research, may turn out to be wrong, causing the torturers to think they have an innocent man tortured a confession without actually being guilty. However, there is nothing in the film that proves he is guilty. <br /> <br /> The various other loose ends out there are: 1. So a rogue CIA agent released him and flown home. What's stopping the NSA from picking it up? A small advertisement in the Washington Post? Please give me a break here ... If a senator is unwilling to stand up for him, what must Corinne Whitman fear? 2. If the NSA has tracked which phone numbers are being called by whom, why can not they overhear some calls to find out if subordinates are being discussed? 3. The plot is even stupider anyway. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would handle his criminal business via an anonymous prepaid telephone line, not one that is due to him and his home. <br /> <br /> The whole film revolves around drawing In the heart of the beholder, the viewer radiates graphic and gratuitous torture scenes. But if you think about it, there's nothing substance in this movie, just lots of unanswered questions and the feeling, "What's that? !!!" at the end of the film.
