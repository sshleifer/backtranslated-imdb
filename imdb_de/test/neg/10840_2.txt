There were some decent moments in this movie and a few times where it was pretty funny. However, this did not compensate for the fact that this was an incredibly boring movie as a whole. There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I could not understand why he was considering even having his future wife for this chick from whom he was allegedly knocked out. There was better chemistry between him and Liv Tyler in Armageddon. There was a better chemistry between Sly and Sandra in Demolition Man. <br /> <br /> There were some moments in the movie that just did not have to be there and were painfully slow. <br /> <br /> This was a bad remake of "My Best Friends Wedding". Wait for the video to run for a year and a half and rent it in .49 cents if you have nothing else to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon and can not imagine better movies for rent.
