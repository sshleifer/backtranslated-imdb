Shakespeare would have been outraged. The writers mutilated Shakespeare's amazing work. Ariel is the only credible acting performance. The African voodoo, the secluded swamp and the character "Gator Man" make the movie a mockery of Shakespeare's true Tempest. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your eyes on this movie.
