I do not want to seem like a fussy killjoy, but if a time traveler's accidental death of a butterfly caused such a tremendous change in the timeline, how could that be because the butterfly was burned by the pyroclastic explosion of the erupting volcano anyway? And how could time travelers return to the same moments over and over again and not always meet with their former and later self, which was also in those few minutes in the timeline? It seems that a fairly large crowd stood before this dinosaur march. <br /> <br /> Although I can accept the idea of ​​a time wave, I seriously doubt that the wave would have made just a few changes. As the wave passed, all the changes that would have happened would have happened at once during the passage of that wave. So, scratch the idea that the city will be overgrown by the jungle. And why jungles? The city's location would still have been at the latitude and longitude it had before, and would have had vegetation appropriate to its geographical location on Earth. <br /> <br /> And an endless list of other illogical mental exercises. <Br /> Bwahahaha! This streak is a weird combination of pretty decent production values ​​and totally ridiculous potholes and factual mistakes. <br /> <br /> Pity. A grandiose idea of ​​ideas, which was packed with stupid science. Sigh ... why, why, why, why? Why spend all that money on production and not even bother checking the script to see if it actually makes sense?
