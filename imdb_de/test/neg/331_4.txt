I bought it out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) appear in a 1995 movie? Thanks to the miracle of unused footage, which has probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years, it's like! You can see it because the movie that shot the scenes does not match the movie that was used for "Jack-O." The curse of Ed Wood lives on. The good news for Carradine and Mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you would expect on both filmographies. The same applies to Scream Queens, Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith. <br /> <br /> The setting is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween, and a kind of curse is unleashed when dumb, beer-loving teenagers disturb a grave. The result: a heavy killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! He (it?) Goes to the healthy Kelly family for revenge (and kills others who stand in his way). The father opens a haunted garage for the neighborhood children. The son (Ryan Latshaw, son of the director) has for all his scenes a coherent, astonished expression and a lying in a grave, hilarious seeming dramatic scene. At least he is a child. The mother's eyes about jumping out of her head as she struggles to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who appears to explain things that seem to be trying to phonetically pronounce all their dialogues. <br /> <br /> What about the name actors? You see Stevens, Wildsmith, and Mitchell on a TV screen for a moment (they're used to filter out the time). Linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter and she does exactly what she can do with it. Your enthusiastic performance helps a little. There is also a laugh from nowhere when an ultra-conservative couple watching a Rush Limbaugh clone on television bites it. The woman slips on a carpet and pricks a toaster with a knife. She's electrocuted and the end result looks like a flaming grilled muppet. <br /> <br /> Everything and everything, pretty entertaining stuff! I was not bored!
