Shot! Pretty boring, and they could just as well have photographed it in black and white, it was so colorless. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a rolling text explaining cryogenics and the question of whether God or Satan is behind it. There are some protests outside a cryotechnology lab. Some people rob a bank, and many of the robbers and guards are shot. The father of one of the robbers (I think) lets his son freeze. In the beginning there is a lot of jumping around from scene to scene, introducing characters without us knowing how they relate to each other as zombies. They all wear silver, mylar-style suits and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (no idea why they look so bad - when they're frozen, they obviously have not kept their looks) and they have silver eyes. They go around, killing people, sometimes stumbling around like zombies, sometimes moving like normal people. <br /> <br /> Linda Blair keeps coming back for what purpose I'm not really sure. I think her character works in the cryogenics lab, but she is not very important to the plot and her role is very small. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with some still images and text captions that show us what happens next the characters who are pretty stupid.
