Oh, my goodness. I never thought it possible that I might soon see a thriller worse than Domestic Disturbance, but here it is. Sanctimony is with a lazy plot, terrible cut, stilted acting and headache-inducing "style" (sorry, I have no other words for it), the kind of movie that almost forces you to reevaluate a whole genre; In other words, this movie is so bad that even the thrillers that I have condemned as utter failure seem a little better now. <br /> <br /> Well, not only Sanctimony is a horrible movie in itself, it also succeeds in demolishing better films in the difficult task of doing a miserable job. As for the main titles - nothing more than a blatant attempt to reproduce the titles of Se7en - I had the impression something did not smell quite right. As soon as the movie started with a series of crazy, funny hip cuts full of bloody images and bombastic colors, I knew where that smell came from. <br /> <br /> It turns out that two policemen Police officer Jim Renart (Michael Par√©) and policewoman Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin) are investigating a murder investigation in Vancouver. A serial killer known as the "Monkey Killer" (what a threatening, daunting nickname, er?) For his work methods, a lot of people have killed. You see, this nut seems to work according to the saying, "Do not see anything evil, hear no evil, do not speak evil," and cut the eyes, ears, and tongues of the victims. So far six eyes, six ears and three tongues. Ingeniously, Renart and Smith discover that the monkey killer is likely to kill three other people ... well, because he probably wants to complete number 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), a young, successful, handsome businessman with a terrible temperament. And this is where the rip-off of American Psycho begins. <br /> <br /> So we are following the lives of the two police officers and the young psychopath, none of whom is of any interest until they finally meet. On the way there, a disco in which Renart Gerrick hardly misses us, unintentionally one of the funniest scenes of the last memory: Renart goes to the back of the disco club, because ... well, just because the script suspect a suspect leaves room; Then, with a single punch in the stomach, Renard unleashes a tall guard blocking the way, and the guard never hears anything again? Does this scene find someone totally unrealistic? <br /> <br /> After another murder, Gerrick appears as a witness, but Smith, and especially Renart, immediately suspect he might be the killer. In the typical way of Basic Instinct, Smith gets some appointments with the young businessman, assuming she can discover his true identity. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the end, but it's just an embarrassment; There are contradictions, some action holes, problems that can never be resolved, and most of all, there is one final scene where brutal mass murder, which should be shocking and sad, is so ridiculously exaggerated and nonsensical that I honestly do not can imagine how everyone could not laugh about it. <br /> <br /> With 87 minutes, Sanctimony really pushes it. You never care about a single character because they're all so flat (not to mention boredom) that you know who's who, when you first meet them. They are never drawn into the story, because the scenes are connected by faint plotters, if they are not really unnecessary and inappropriate. Acting ranges from average (Van Dien) to downright atrocities (Ruby and most of the minor cast); The music is a terrible generic techno and photography is one of the worst I've ever seen. Of course, like every fiasco in the genre, we also have some free nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
