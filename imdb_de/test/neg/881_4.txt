Richard Gere and Diane Lane play in a kick-flick romance with the kind of ending I get really mad at ... let's just say it's not my cup of tea, just like the cent store romances are not my cup , > <br /> The plot has a doctor stopping in an inn and meeting a woman with whom he has a deep but brief affair. He goes away to meet his estranged son, and she goes back to her life. <br /> <br /> Well played and well done, the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot. This is the clutter of dime-store romances that makes the women faint and the men shake their heads in disbelief. I would not be as adamant about the movie as a careless romance, except that the movie plays a role in the final part, which is so out of the left field that it is totally unbelievable. Why do certain types of films have to do such stupid things? It really ruined it for me. <br /> <br /> If you like romance, give it a try, but wait for cable.
