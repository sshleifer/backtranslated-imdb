I'm sorry to say that, but this is actually one of the worst documentary films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Due to his name "Darwin's Nightmare" I was expecting a documentary about problems with the Nile perch in Lake Victoria. <br /> <br /> What I actually saw in this "documentation" is a loose collection of individual stories, most of which are unrelated to fish and sea. And for the most part, you can hardly call them stories - it's more like some accumulated scenes that lack a meaningful connection ... <br /> <br /> Why is this movie wasting time on: - Showing us not relevant Information to the families of the Russian pilots (some minutes are wasted, for example, on their private digicam snapshots of wives and daughters) - mourning for the death of an African child bitten by a crocodile (as if that would not have happened without the Nile perch Show us about 100 times how airplanes land and take off at the airport - Show us strange religious events for a few minutes - Discuss in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport - Talk to children about their mothers, fathers and their work and / or how they died (well, what can I say: some died of HIV - who would have thought that?) These are just a few Examples, I could go on several pages ... <br /> <br /> This film is totally blurry and does not know what it wants to say uh. If you have never heard of Africa and have no idea that this continent has problems in the areas of social / health / HIV / violence / war, this movie might be right for you. If you have not closed your eyes in recent decades, 90% of what is shown in this film is not new to you - and the way it is presented here will do its best to make you fall asleep , <br /> <br /> Perhaps my expectations for this film were too high, but I really did not like it, although this is an issue that I would generally find interesting. If this film wants to show how poverty is related to the Nile perch, maybe he should have spent some time discussing this matter ...
