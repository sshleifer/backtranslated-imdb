This movie is weird, even for a silent movie. It essentially follows the adventures of an engineer in postrevolutionary Russia, who dreams of going to Mars. In this film, it seems as if the producers KNOW that the Communists really screwed up the country, but it also seems they are doing something good. Marsian scenes where everyone on Mars wears stupid hats. They have a revolution after being inspired by Earthman but are quickly betrayed by the Queen who joins them. Unless it's all a dream or is it. (And since the Russian Revolution eventually led to the Stalin dictatorship, one wonders if that was all allegory.) Now I have seen good Russian cinema. For example, Eisenstein's battleship Potemkin is a good movie. That's just good, stupid.
