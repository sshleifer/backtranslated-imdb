I have seen worse movies. That's bad, but at least you're not trying to be good, so it deserves a short round of applause. It's firmly in the low-budget B-movie sci-fi genre. <br /> <br /> It's a garbage movie, but in a nice way and it's definitely worth buying if it's in the "bargain box" local grocery store. Terribly charming and not just awful. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover saves her. When she appears, she calls "Bunnyfluff!" What pulls Sniggers out of his copilot. <br /> <br /> Sit back, get drunk, enjoy!
