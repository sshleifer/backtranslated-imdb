This movie is terrible! The actors can not act. There is no action. I think they have to start over and film again. I hope you can correct the drama mistakes in this movie. I would like to see the trailer after shooting it again. Maybe there is hope for that. I'm not out to hurt feelings, but I think high school kids can do a better job. The wardrobe could have been much better. Sorry, but it just did not do it for me. Usually I enjoy the trailers from this site, but ... I can not find them entertaining. I hope they take criticism well, because I think they will get a lot more from this movie.
