This vicious little movie is horrible. My low rating for this has two main reasons. The first is that it is an animal snuff movie, and I find the whole concept so abhorrent that it turns my stomach. Shot over a hundred years ago, I can only hope that we have developed a little more human and compassionate. This movie is fully and completely exploited to take advantage of the sensational aspects of the movie and the theme. Apart from the historical interest, this is just something that you only have to look at when you are in morbid fascination. <br/> <br /> Reason number two? See how the camera is set up. It's placed in the best possible position to bring out the full effect: long stride of the elephant, perfect view of the electric shock platform, and a cold and clinically passionate look at the elephant from which smoke escapes before it finally collapses. Nausea. <br /> <br /> Thomas Edison has done many great things for civilization, and his talent and intelligence are undeniable. No one is perfect, but if you realize that this film A) offered the opportunity to outdo the first cinematic competitors with a sensational film about an elephant killed by an electric shock, and B) he filmed the execution to see the greater effectiveness of To demonstrate DC to AC, you can not be surprised if the scientist in him was a bit too dispassionate and cold. Lots of crazy scientists from Peter Cushing would be proud. The rest of us should be ashamed and outraged.
