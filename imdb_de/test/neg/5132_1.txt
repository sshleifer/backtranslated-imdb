My friend and I rented this movie for 3.99 at Blockbuster. If I had known how absolutely horrible this movie would become, I would not have paid a dime. I had no warning for this BS. Acting can not even be described as acting, the inevitable sex scene is uncomfortable and it can be said that both girls feel completely uncomfortable, and the male villain ... God, who did not realize that he wanted to attack Emily and the musical ones Notes ... my Lord. This movie makes me cry. Never rent this. In fact, if you look at it, measure your eyeballs. This movie is not from God - he's from hell. I'm just going to take the last few lines to write bla bla bla bla shiz because I really do not want to continue with this review.
