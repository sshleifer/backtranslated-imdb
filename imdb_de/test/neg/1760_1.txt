I had to write a review for this movie after seeing it last night, and read some comments from people who have tried to classify the displeasure of this film, go to Wfmitchell's post)). I do not adapt any of these rankings. The other classification that has to be on the list is 5) People did not like this movie because it was not good. I thought the movie was moored and forced. My wife chose it for us because she is a big Kidman fan and she also likes Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Law, it took a long time and it took a lot of fighting for me to believe its southern accent. I can not wonder if they did not intentionally make his character less talkative, so we would not have to hear that tortured accent so much. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, that was a long time to get interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then fell flat in its end. Interestingly, I did not know that this movie was shot by Minghella. After about 40 minutes, I asked my wife, "This will not be another English patient, will it?" It was absolutely. <br /> <br /> So far the fight scenes. I'm trying to imagine a word to describe the opening battle scene, but I think the most descriptive word that describes it exactly is simply "stupid". It was forced, it was incredible, it was stupid and it was stupid. (After the fight, I looked at my wife and asked, "Was that just stupid?", To which she nodded vigorously.) <br /> <br /> The only bright point in the film was the performance of Zellweger , The role was a bit over like a decent comedy relief role, but it worked. From her speech pattern, her walking, her behaviors and esp. her little jokes (my darling: "If you want to get a three feet butt in the ass, you just have to talk to each other, if sweethearts talk to each other"), she was able to create an almost cartoon-like character doing her job Very good. <br /> <br /> I just did not like this movie and I have to ask myself what kind of people it really is (or the English patient). I suppose you could classify them into one category: 1) Soap opera fans
