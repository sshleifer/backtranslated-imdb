Although Dying to Love You is a well-produced TV movie, it smells of melodramatic splendor. The film opens to Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, who looks much older than I remember). Who is a struggling businessman who leads an empty, lonely life after his wife Ruthie (who looks suspiciously like Roseanne Arnold) leaves him with speed. Now Roger has only his cats ... and his ad in the newspaper. <br /> <br /> Once his ad is answered, he calls Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa. Oh, it does not matter who I want is Lawrence. Then ... they have phone sex. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where you came from or when you were born, but I remember the phone sex was played in the late '80s. I'm sorry, but that was trashy. <br /> <br /> Soon, Roger and the wide connection will close and have a whirlwind romance. They fall in love, visit the zoo to see gorillas, and then they have some perverted sex with Roger's son in the other room. She ties him to the bed and seduces him. <br /> <br /> Roger is just so stupid that he does not realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a fool who likes to sleep. God forbids women sleeping with only one man. Soon weird phone calls start, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute swiftness, and she scolds and raves about her ex-husband who beat her. It's fun to see Roger believe her through all this stuff. Until a frumpy colleague tells him to snoop through her belongings like a curious housewife. He takes her shitty advice and lo and behold, he finds a suitcase with fake identity cards, wigs and guns and a crossbow. He immediately brings the suitcase to the police and has them arrested. Despite all the jazz he still loves the stupid expanses. She tells so many lies, it seems her tongue will catch fire once she tells the truth. <br/> <br/> Roger continues his life and meets an ugly woman named Angela, who looks like something out of Gremlin's 2. She also has a child and Roger likes her very much. But something in Roger's subconscious keeps him in touch with Lisa Rohn (if only her real name), and he visits her again and again. <br /> <br /> Now Lisa is the "ex who will not go away" She "deserves" a free card from prison and shows up in front of Roger's front door, and his son Matt is so busy finding her to make, he pours juice on the floor. IL 'Rog is so stupid, he throws Lisa out and does not even change the locks. Boy, if all people were so stupid, I would not even write this review. The end of this movie is so hackneyed that you will not believe it. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson is a Made for TV movie king. He just looks like a mother of the mother in this movie. He is a bit wooden and stiff. The dazzling Tracy Pollan works well with her character and her dizziness sounds right. She is extremely beautiful and I see what Michael J. Fox sees in her. <br /> <br /> This movie is great to look at when dealing with this late-night tip, but on the other hand, you might fall asleep considering how boring and bland it is.
