This is only the second time that I have been moved enough to write a review. Unfortunately, both times they were for films that can be described with several 4-letter words that can be defined as faeces or feces. The other film of such caliber was masked and anonymous. <br /> <br /> anywa, on the review ... there are some important things that are wrong in this movie that I will describe below. <br /> <br /> Steven has lost the storyline (ie family / friend is killed in all his other films, Steven gets angry, Steven kills people, the end). <br /> <br /> 2) Steven has no money at first It was a good chase scene in the beginning, but I think he spent his budget on it and could not afford a decent screenwriter or editor.) 3) Steven no longer seems to do its own action. Instead, the (remembered) 2 combat scenes were shot with the neck down and from the back, so you could not really see his face. most likely a stunt double. I suspect Chuck Norris. <br /> <br /> in summary .. the worst Seagal movie of all time. Second worst movie I've seen in recent history, and I've seen a lot of bad movies.
