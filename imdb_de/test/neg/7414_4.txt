Bigfoot movies are usually bad, so I do not tend to watch them. However, there were some good commercials on the sci-fi channel, so I decided to look at them. An expedition to the northwest of the Pacific to find a fallen plane carrying the expedition leader's daughter (played by Lance Hendrickson) and bringing with her a revolutionary DNA detector to prove the existence of the Sasquatch. And it creates some tension at first. The Sasquatch is out of sight, but sees the body heat of the mountaineers (like the alien in "Predator"), and I wondered when it would strike. The acting is passable, as well as the background music. The densely wooded location is well used. And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, though nothing great. But with the movie it gets increasingly annoying and absurd. Most characters are unpleasant people, rude, and only in the money and public relations expedition (with the exception of Lance Hendrickson's character), so it's impossible to worry about what's happening to them. And her behavior is becoming increasingly stupid. A man shoots at the creature (not deadly), then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark. A female camper puts on a creeping silk negligee before she crawls into her sleeping bag. Then she can hardly escape by being pulled into the forest by the Sasquatch without her hair and make-up getting mixed up. Then the survivors come to the conclusion that the Sasquatch really is behind the DNA recognition engine and will let them live if they leave it behind ("a creature knows what threatens it"). Obviously the instinct does not apply to these actors or they would not have appeared in this movie. And the end is so stupid that you want to kick the TV screen. Without the script, it would have been a decent horror movie.
