I saw this movie last night with my friend. I'm 20 years old and this movie was far too much for me. I could not imagine bringing a teenager, a teenager or (especially) a child into this movie. It was rude and offensive. The PG-13 rating and the previews I've seen have completely mislead me. I had originally seen previews on Nickelodeon for that, and I thought it looked pretty cute (maybe I just do not remember the preview properly). In addition, Drake Bell (the main character in the film) plays a Nickelodeon television program aimed at teenagers and teenage boys. I really did not think the content of the movie would be as risky as it was. I should have investigated more before leaving. However, I hope parents will catch up on this movie before they take their kids along just because Drake Bell is there. Seriously, DO NOT take kids or teens with this movie. The rating should have been R. Throughout the film, there are countless sexual references, drug references and disruptive events. Examples: Drake Bell is attacked by sexually charged animals. Several scenes of men taking women's breasts, lots of obscenity. Drake Bell smokes vanilla frosting (or similar) with a bong, people are stabbed, hit and injured movie, and an elderly lady and her dog are shredded. There are many other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. It was really humiliating for women in general. The movie is made by the people who made the Scary Movie series, so that's exactly what you're saying. Please keep in mind that movies and movies can cause children and adolescents to have misconceptions about sex, drugs and violence. Most children and teenagers can not distinguish between spoofs or comedy and reality. <br /> <br /> I have a sense of humor. I also know that the humor of this film is typical of his genre. But I think there is a possibility that children and teenagers will see this movie HORRIFYING. <br /> <br /> As for the overall quality of the movie, I did not find it so original or funny. It subsided in parts, and part of the humor was only forced and painful. Acting was not too bad, considering how bad the script was. If you are an adult or older teenager looking for a fun movie, skip or lend it.
