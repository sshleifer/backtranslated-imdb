There are really no redeeming factors in this show. Simply put, it's just awful. Absolutely terrible. It's just a horrible "reality" show. Not only that, it's a terrible fiction. <br /> <br /> Imagine the following: A couple of overly inventive teens come together one night and go "Hey! Let's do a paranormal show, just like Ghost Hunters, and so on!" So they grab a camera, harass residents and film arbitrary landscapes behind a painfully "dramatic-to-fail", yet failed monologue. This show is basically a group of teenagers running around with a home camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary. The only difference is that this show actually has a budget and authors. A wasted budget and terrible writers. Oh, the problems, how do I count you? First of all, let's talk about it on a personal level. I'm not a total skeptic when it comes to the paranormal. I'm ready to believe in what is paranormal and what is not, and I'm sure there are many people who feel the same. So, if you want to do a show on the paranormal, you have to do a good job of convincing the viewer that what he sees is either paranormal or not, because the viewer can easily believe something else. I hate to compare, but I do not understand why. Take for example "Ghost Hunters". In "Ghost Hunters" you can see that the cast is aligned with the audience. They are not completely skeptical, but they are still willing to keep an eye on the possibility of paranormal anomalies. You have to look at something and be ready to say "it's possible that it's just nothing." And in that sense, they began to prove themselves wrong. They use technology and several other devices along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal, along with the fact that what they are monitoring may have nothing in mind. Not only do you try to convince yourself what is real and what is not, they try to convince you. This element of doubt is not present in the Paranormal State. Beat one. <br /> <br /> In "Paranormal State," the cast simply says "There's this scary place and its HAUNTED, so we'll find some SPIRIT!" And immediately you know and say to yourself "Okay, convince me differently". The cast is not professional in their interviews. In fact, it sometimes seems that they only bother residents of these so-called "frequented" areas. They have no real evidence to substantiate their claims except assumptions and theories, and the best they can do is someone who "claims" he can make contact with the dead without anyone ever supporting who that person is is and how valid it really is. They could easily pick a random person off the street and say, "pretend to contact ghosts for our show" and have left. In the "Mothman" episode this just happens. Without convincing evidence towards the end of the show, they bring out this kind of individual, where he does a random and painfully written "reading" of an alleged area, such as "being followed", to convince the audience. Very, very hard. I feel like one of the main problems with the show is that it feels like a script. During one of the episodes, the cast is sometimes attacked by one of these "paranormal anomalies" to be dramatic. That sort of dramatic sequence would make any skeptic laugh, and even those on the fence will realize that what they see is just a pile of tabloid esquire garbage. If the goal of the show was to try and convince the audience that these "paranormal" events are real, then they are doing a terribly bad job. Hit two. <br /> <br /> However, there is always the switch. Just one last point of view to see if the show is worth anything. What if the show does not try to convince you that these paranormal events are real and that you're just entertaining them with good fiction? It also fails at this level. If the creators of the show tried to make fiction to entertain the audience, the writing is too bad and even on a fictional level the audience can not be convinced that their performers are experiencing the unknown in all their horrible splendor. Writing is just not compulsory, and I can even say boring. Strike three. <br /> <br /> So what's left of this show is just a group of teenagers who are too willing or too gullible to believe in the paranormal, simply because it's just far more amazing than the reality that has set off with a camera, a bad script and bad actors that generally only make a really bad horror documentary. That's the whole show at this point. There is no reason to see it, not even for the entertainment factor, and there is no reason to worry about it. To be dull, it is lame. There are absolutely no redeeming factors in this show.
