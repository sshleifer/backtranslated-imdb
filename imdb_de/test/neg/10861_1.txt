This is my first "awful" review on IMDb, and I could not imagine a more deserving film to honor him with. I hoped for entertaining garbage and found the trash of the saddest and most boring kind. I found a movie that nobody could have taken care of, including its creator. <br /> <br /> "Hell Ride", director, screenplay and actor of Larry "Friend of QT" Bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two biker groups and a cruel murder in 1976 who was not yet avenged. Larry seems resolutely determined not to tell this story. He focuses instead of bringing his staggering, oddly distorted lead character into situations where he can caress women who pretend they like her. He also has a dialogue that contains enough horrible fire puzzles / metaphors to paint the word "fire" for life. Dennis Hopper escapes the complete humiliation, others are not so happy. Sometimes they use their bicycles to hit the streets, causing even more harm to Michael Madsen, as his tall handles offend the injury of appearing in this movie. There is a lot of nudity with silicone, but pretty little action and no humor. One wonders what kind of audience they had in mind. <br /> <br /> My guess is that most people will see this movie, including fans of trashy 60s biker movies, will feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and rethink the actual stuff instead.
