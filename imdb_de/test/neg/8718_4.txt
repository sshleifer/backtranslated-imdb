While the David Lynch version of Dune is choppy, awkward and unfaithful to the novel, it's visually well designed and well executed. The best thing you can say about the sci-fi channel's attempt to make Dune a miniseries is ambitious. That's actually the only positive praise you can offer. The actors seem (with few exceptions) to be happy to recite their lines with as few emotions and the least appropriate accents. The costumes seem to have been designed by someone who has a large excess of Mylar cloth on hand and an unhealthy love for unflattering headgear effort. However, it takes elements from Lynch's film that were not in the novel and copies them almost completely (ie The Guild Steersman's Navigation Sequence), and this only encourages negative comparisons with Lynch's film. A for trouble. D for practically everything else.
