I think that was a terrible mistake by Disney. First of all, Kuzco does NOT have to pass the "Imperial School" to become Emperor! That has never happened. Second, the new voices do not sound like the originals at all. Very bad repeat. And while I admired the movie The Emperor's New Groove, New School is just stupid. Like all jokes are the same and many are from the movie. The plot becomes obsolete, always Yzma (is that how you spell it?) Who tries to become Empress, Kuzco who stops them, etc. Or Kuzco learns to become a better person. I think that Kuzco annoys with his constant complaints and questions. He is a spoiled brat and it bothers me. I do not think that's worth five minutes of your time, let alone half an hour.
