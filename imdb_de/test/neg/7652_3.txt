Very disturbing but expertly crafted, scripted and intelligently directed with a good eye for color and details. Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis and especially Randy Quaid are unusually good. The story revolves around a boy (Bryan Madorsky) wondering where all the leftovers that they eat every night come from. The strange behavior of his parents (Hurt, Quaid) causes the school psychiatrist (Dennis) to get involved. It's a cruel cannibal movie. But it's not bad. If you like Hannibal, you will love that. If you do not like parents, stay away from the movie. I only give cannibal lover and haters advice. <br /> <br /> Rated with R for strong adult topics and graphic violence
