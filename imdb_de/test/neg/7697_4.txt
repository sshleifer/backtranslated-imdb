I saw this short on the DVD for Ridley Scott's The Duellists. There was no introduction from Scott before the film, he was just starting. <br /> <br /> Boy and a Bicycle is hardly an example of Ridley Scott's other work, it bears no resemblance. The film shows a boy, played by Tony Scott, driving around on a bicycle. Guess what? That's pretty much all that happens. The boy rides around and wanders on with meaningless, confusing dialogues. The film was shot in black and white, and since directed by Ridley Scott, I expected some cool cinematography or visually striking sets. Instead, I was treated with nothing. This movie is not even good for a first try. I recommend every fan of Ridley Scott to check this at least once.
