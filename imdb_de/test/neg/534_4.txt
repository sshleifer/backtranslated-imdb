It's a friendly, gentler cyborg movie with a love story. Awww It's not as bad as it sounds. The action is decent, and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always reliable. It is the fact that this is a continuation of the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme movie, or is that the conspirator of the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused about that. In any case, this movie really was not necessary. What was needed there? Angelina Jolie. She may play an assassin robot that can explode in the middle of coitus, but what a way and although this is her first movie, she still has the presence that made her a prizewinner.
