This would probably be a good movie ... assuming you've already seen every other movie and thoroughly examined the navel of yourself and your environment. God, this movie was unbelievably bland, with some of the worst (or nonexistent) fonts ever recorded on film. There is no salvation for this movie; Even the animatronics are pretty lame, and it's just a complete waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Run. Fast. It is beyond terrible. <br /> <br />
