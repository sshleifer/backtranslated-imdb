After the good words of my friends, I hired this movie and hoped it would at least match the laughter of the similar movie "House Party", but I was very disappointed and bored. <br /> <br /> Falling asleep watching a movie is never a good sign. I do not know if I would not like it because I do not live in "da Hood" or if I'm not black, but it's probably one of the two. <br /> <br /> trying to fake a few movies, just a few laughs, but in the long run, it fails miserably. Miss it.
