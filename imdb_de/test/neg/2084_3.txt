I did not see this movie when it originally came out, but there were a few songs that shared the title and the term is still used gave a look. Now I want to get back the approximate hour and forty-five minutes of my life (it seemed much longer). There was nothing particularly bad about the movie, the acting was good, no big storylines, of course there was not much conspiracy to get holes. The movie was just not much. There was some chemistry between the two, but nothing attractive about their relationship; Nothing interesting about her story. Towards the end, as he tried to hunt the train to catch his fleeting romance, neither my wife nor I wanted him to catch her. Honestly, we thought they were better, and when they get back together, we really do not care. So, what does that say about this love story, when even a 25-year-old sappy romantic woman like my wife did not have an emotional investment in the relationship. I should have left this in the category "missing". <br /> <br /> Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html
