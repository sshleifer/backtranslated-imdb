This movie had the potential to be a good little thriller for high school. Instead, we got a boring party about a crying, spoiled baby sitting. The problem was that there were too many unnecessary things. A fight with the friend, random friends come to die. It was obvious they were just killing time. The main character was bland and uninteresting. Camilla Bell had no emotions during this movie. She was there. Another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat. The kids survive, so it's obvious they will let Jill survive. The only reason these four points were scored was that the last ten minutes (when the killer FINALLY comes out) are really exciting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
