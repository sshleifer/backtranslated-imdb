I'm a big fan of Northern Exposure. Men In Trees is a complete knock-off of the Northern Exposure. In a remote city in the hinterland (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman) stuck the New York city dwellers. She did not immediately meet a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). The city has only one pilot who is not often available. There is only one radio show. The whole show is about bizarre people with sincere and strange relationships. Too many parallels. Just as with Northern Exposure, each character's demeanor has changed only in an obvious demographic structure. I'm bored. Give me something new to think about. <br /> <br /> On the top, writing is pretty good. However, if this was a school project, it would certainly have received the stamp of plagiarism. <br /> <br /> Maybe people who love this show were protected from the dedicated creativity and hard work of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.
