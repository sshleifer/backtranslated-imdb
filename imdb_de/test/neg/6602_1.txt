Usually, when a television biopic is released by a celebrity who is at least a Campy (ie, Cybill Shepherd as Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), this is the most terrifying, cheap, and boring TV movie ever made , When VH-1 shoots a TV movie, they have to spend a little more money on it. Flex Alexander - although he is gifted with the Michael voice - is not a great dancer, Michael does not resemble a bit and does not even have his manners. VH-1 would have done better if he had hired a real impersonator. That way, when Michael undergoes a plastic surgery, he does not look exactly the same. Why should we be amazed when Michael's nose shrinks, just as big as it was at the beginning of the movie? The woman who plays Elizabeth Taylor can not behave and does not look after her and does not even marry me to Janet Jackson. Terrible script and a serious case of miscarriages must keep VH-1 from producing more films. Flex Alexander would have made JERMAINE JACKSON better than Michael. Costumes Trashy rip-off. Neverland? Footage from news documents put together. Do not worry, it is not worthwhile even remotely. That's a good bit of casting - the actor portraying Joseph Jackson and MAYBE as Lisa Marie Presley, though she should have been more tomboy than girlie girls.
