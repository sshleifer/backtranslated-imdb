Yes, we all know about Dan Schneider's unusual fascination with doing shows with young people, and iCarly is no exception. Watch young girls wagging their toes, sticking out their tongues in front of the camera and wearing tight dresses and bikinis. Yes, one wonders if these shows were made for teenagers or older degenerate people. Either way, the show is not so good when compared to Dan Schneider's other shows like the far superior Amanda Show & Drake and Josh. <br /> <br /> The show is about a brother and a sister (Carly and Spencer) who live alone and when they have to cope alone while their father is in the army and their mother is away. Carly has a mutual friend named Sam and they do a very well-produced, award-winning web show called iCarly with their little friend Freddie. The episodes are about her life in and around the web show and her hello at school. Carly Shay is a young, all-knowing web personality / business woman / producer, played by Miranda Cosgrove, a young actress who relies on speaking very loud and fast to understand her point and make strange faces. Her brother Spencer is a mean, gloomy and eccentric artist, played by Jerry Trainor, who tries a bit too much to be like Jim Carrey, and whose comedy style is aimed at the young male audience that likes Joey's style Gladstone humor. Then there's Sam Puckett, an unlikely, mean, small, lying thief of a brat who needs a shot of attitude, played by Jeanette McCurdy, who clearly wears hair extensions as they disappear and reappear from scene to scene. And finally, there's Freddie Benson on the Web, showing nerdy cameraman and technical advisor who has a crush on Carly, but obviously with her being played by Nathan Kress, nowhere will Freddie's mother, Carly's grandfather, annoying teachers, and many of her Annoying little school friends rounding out the cast. Most of the comedy is mean, like blowing Lewbert the Doorman a gag, throwing a teacher with a water balloon, and throwing young girl scouts selling biscuits across the table. All adults are perfect idiots, while the children all know, and certain main characters have absolutely no morality. Lying, cheating, stealing and violence are acceptable in this children's show created and written by Dan Schneider. Yes, it's a children's show! What can young audiences ask for more? Well, with Dan Schneider, we can expect the young girls to dress in tight clothes and bikinis and do some weird things, such as: For example, stretch your tongue in front of the camera and eat bananas. <br /> <br /> Shows like these are just what you're looking for. The younger crowd likes it, and I think it's no worse than all the other trash shovels that Nick shovels at his young audience. There are always fans that can be found on everything seen on TV, at least this is a bit better than most things you see on Nick, like this horrible Naked Brothers show.
