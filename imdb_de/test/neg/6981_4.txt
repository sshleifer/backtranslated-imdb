This movie wasted 2 hours of my time and I just want to scream: "LAME". Nicholas Stoller writes the movie "Yes Man", but directly "this". Maybe he should stay with writing. <br /> <br /> I am so disappointed that I have heard all the great reviews. I expected something like collision. You say this is from the manufacturer of "Knocked up"? Why can not I see the similarity? but that felt like a flat, exaggerated movie to me. I am so disappointed. Actually, it does not matter if you think of it as your average chick movie, but the character of the "band guy" just gets on my nerves. <br /> <br /> Maybe I did not pay enough attention to the movie, but yes, they have some funny lines and scenes, but I did not feel the originality. And the ending makes the movie a bit better. At least the end is not a boring clich√©.
