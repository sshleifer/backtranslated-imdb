I'm tired of making films that sound entertaining in a one-line summary, and then end up with what you would find in the lower middle of a compost heap. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "Witchery" may have been interesting on a pitch for the studios, even with a "big name cast" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink, nudge-nudge) and the shower lovers of Hildegard Knef (I do not know a woman ...) <br /> <br /> But in the movie it just falls apart faster than a paper mache sculpture in a rainstorm - it looks like these unfortunate people are in an island villa the East Coast are trapped, and one of them (a woman, I suspect) is targeted by a satanic cult to endure the child of hell, while the others are in a grotesque, convoluted state of ways. <br /> < br /> Okay, right there you have a cross section of plots from "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Little Indians" and a few other minor films in the satanic worship round mostly you bend from scene to scene until it's over. not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help much. They are only going to make a paycheck and do not seem very anxious to give her "everything." <br /> <br /> As it stands, Hasselhoff probably wishes he was back with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... on the run. A Prominent PETA Charity or Pro-Am Golf Tour or whatever it is today. <br /> <br /> And the torture scenes! Ecchhhh. You'll see people close their mouths, dangling in seething chimneys, lined up in trees during a violent storm, ships blown out of their necks, etc., etc. Sheesh, and I thought "Mark of the Devil" would be the most sadistic movie I've ever seen .... <br /> <br /> Do not bother. It is not worth your time. I can not believe I told you so much as I did. When you see it, just see if you can count the clich√©s. And yes, Blair is obsessed, as if you could not see THAT along Main Street followed by a brass band. <br /> <br /> No stars. "Witchery" - these witches will itch you.
