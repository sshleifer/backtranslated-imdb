I got this movie for fifty cents on a sales outage. I want my fifty cents back. Bad acting, bad script writing, lousy direction, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the film is awful. It is not the topic that offends. I am one of the many who find tension films and real thrillers very interesting. The subject could have been treated more seriously, with more attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect for the victims and their devastated friends and family is enough to puzzle everyone. In addition, little or no attention is paid to what might have caused someone to begin the bizarre behavior that Ed Gein has displayed in these horrific crimes. <br /> <br /> Save time and reason. Do not look at this horrible movie. If you bought it, you have my compassion. However, it is not a total waste ... You can discard the CD and use the plastic wrap!
