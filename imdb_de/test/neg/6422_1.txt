If you see this movie in the TV shows, just ignore it. If you are looking for something weird, you should better see the repetitions of the X-Files. <br /> <br /> Earlier comments referring to the unbelievably bad behavior of female lead roles are in vogue. She is almost unsurpassable. The sum total of her assortment includes "weepy and anxious" and "weedy and not frightened". <br /> <br /> I'm the kind of movie fan who likes a good "bad" movie. That's ridiculous. There is no direction. The storyline is as simple as the amount of numbers it keeps throwing at you, and basically like that set of numbers, it does not matter in the end. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent looking at the television and bathing your dog.
