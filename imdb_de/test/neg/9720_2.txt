The story was incoherent, the acting was not Callibre, which can be catagorized. More from a serial pilot than from an actual movie. I wanted to like this movie but could not find anything that I liked. Whatever made The Lost Boys so likeable, obviously did not exist here. Nevertheless, it tried very hard. Plot hooks were awkwardly placed between a series of dark clothes on Dawson's Creek, and the story line soon went nowhere. Very disappointing for me. The final scenes were driven by special effects that focused on comfort, and how the villain of the story planned his entire project. Stay with films of this kind of genre from the eighties, when they had more of an idea.
