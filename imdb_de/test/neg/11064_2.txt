As I sat down to watch this movie, I thought it might be something good. but no. It was an OK movie, not good, but not bad for most, but then you come to an end and it loses all credibility. They should have just been dead. They did not leave the last piece behind, it made no sense. if they had something in the beginning of a plane crash, but we did not do it, so it did not work. The first piece is fine and I give them credit for it, but the rest is just bad and unnecessary if you remember to watch this movie 2/10
