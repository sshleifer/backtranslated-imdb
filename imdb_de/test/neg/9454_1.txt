How poor is this movie? Well, I got it less than two months ago and I can barely remember what it was all about ... <br /> <br /> I also paid Â£ 1 for it on DVD, the old story of 'put-a- new 'cover-on-the-box-and-some-fool-Will-Buy-It syndrome. All I really remember is that the cast went around a lot, the use of cars had to be too high and a vampire was involved. Presumably you could know that from the movie title. Directly to the video waste or directly to the cheap DVD, as it is now. This stuff is on sale in supermarkets and charity shops until the sun goes down. Only cockroaches rule the earth, but this garbage is still there. God bless the beginning of the DVD era ....
