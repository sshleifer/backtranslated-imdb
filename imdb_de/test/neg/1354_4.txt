I believe that a whole book on the Odyssey can be written to recreate the classic film on which this film is loosely based. When Hollywood started talking about such a company, the reaction was always negative, as there were just too many aspects that could go wrong, starting with the solid ensemble that made the original memorable, and that's where the deal with the band starts Selection of actresses who can otherwise do remarkable work but are not fit for the parts, and unfortunately they were led with the heavy hand of a director who does not understand or appreciate the source material. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is no focus or direction, or as if the direction taken was to erase something that was good with the original movie. This is called updating, as we drain the story from humor, biting dialogue and any interesting premise. Above all, we want to prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that (at least through this film) we do not really get to where women really go. <br /> <br /> For starters, the casting of Meg Ryan in the lead role is almost fatal for the movie, because somehow she seems to have locked herself in a kind of limbo in which women do not really do that after 20 years of filming Change appearance. Her Mary, who proved to be a difficult role in the 1930s, somehow grew out of her interaction with other stereotypes like Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz," learning, observing, and recognizing that she had a choice in the matter. It was not a choice that women would celebrate today, but it was fun to ride, and part of the fun was the stupid, stupid, sometimes slapstick routine that brought this movie into the realm of the sublime. Here we are down to earth. By changing the nature of Sylvia, the movie has lost much of its spark and it is not due to Annette Bening's fault. I could not help but admire her attempting to save this sinking ship, and felt sinking as she struggled with the terrible lines. Luckily, I talked by looking at some of her fantastic outfits and kept reminding myself how talented this lady really was. Your Sylvia is wise but flawed, and she could have been a great creation. Unfortunately, Ms. English did not pay attention to her own work and lost control of the one character who could have turned the film in a new direction. <br /> <br /> But that was not the biggest blasphemy of all. In the original we have Joan Crawford, which is probably one of the best performances of a woman. Her crystal is legendary, with catchy lines, fireworks, double maneuvers and some very sexy poses. It was the connection between the man and the woman, and through them we knew what the catastrophe was all about. She provided the tension between men and women. She was dangerous, sexy, the ultimate femme fatale. A woman of intelligence whom we feared and admired, and above all we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. Eva Mendes, as great as she is, is two-dimensional because of the weak writing and this time also a bad casting. <br /> <br /> There are even more atrocities in the movie, such as a terrible role for Mensing as a committed mother who lives for babies, and the rather annoying lesbian turn of Pinkett. Then comes the biggest talent trash in the movie, as Bette Middler, a little unrecognizable in her make-up, shows the spark of what could have been. Its acidic delivery is reminiscent of the contemporary perspective that the film could have taken. Her words are revived and bring much of the much-needed outrage into the movie, and it's exciting to see that it could really fly, then it's gone. She's in the movie every six minutes, and she disappears in the middle of confusion. <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that has raised our anticipation and really disappointed us, a movie that could join in. Successful "Sex in the City" that made an amazing transition to the big screen because She respected the source material and made no compromises. It gave us more, bigger and better customization. It has really updated what it had previously done successfully. "The Women" in its current reincarnation has to go back and revise itself as "The Hulk" did this year to find suitable artists, a really good writer, and above all someone who really appreciates what good movies are Over.
