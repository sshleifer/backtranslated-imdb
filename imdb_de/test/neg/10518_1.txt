There are some great Canadian films. There are some shitty ones. Last night I saw one of the shitty ones. It was not the typical Canadian movie in which it tried to be so artistic. This movie was trying to be some kind of Hollywood gangster movie. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> From the beginning I felt it would be a bad movie. It had some of the kasest dialouges a movie can have. There was that voice for a scene and then she never returned. This bothers me again and again when filmmakers simply use Voice Over when they have no other creative way to tell a story. but this movie is garbage. The premise is something of a soprano episode that is not realistic. The father of a banker mafia chief is on his deathbed and orders the son to legitimize the business. Not so original. And the workers complain about it, but they simply accept the fact that they will soon be out of work. To make it legitimate, they use blackmail. Irony. But not the good kind. Then an unusual showgirl, who had a horrible Elvis wig and a birthmark that covered half of her face, robbed the main character and robbed him somehow. Anyway, this guy for some reason now likes dressing up as a girl. Then this banker joins a hooker when he has a beautiful future wife at home. But he falls into the hooker, because the hooker disguises like a man and make him. She blackmailes him with photos of him wearing bras and panties. Still, he still loves her. He also has no reason to leave his fiancée, but he does it to be with the hooker. <br /> <br /> There was no sex or action for a movie about organized crime and sexual fetish. It was like a Late Cinemax porn movie without the good. The possible sex scenes were neither hot nor sexy. It was all too amateurish. The film had nothing to offer, only the lame plot. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was the actor's fault. I think they had a terrible script that they could work with. What stood out the most were the ridiculous characters. The bad guy's name was Uncle Bunny or something. But the name was not important. It was all clichés. The dialouge was ridiculous throughout the film, and the other moviegoers laughed aloud at some of the film's "serious" moments. Then the worst of everything. It had to be the cheapest end. If you can ever remember that as a kid you shot with imaginary or toy guns. That was basically the end of the movie. But I was more than happy that it came to an end, and I had to ask my Canadians to waste no time or money watching this movie.
