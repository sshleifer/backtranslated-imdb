I have great respect for Mr. Argento's work, but this film lacks many features that make his films truly unique. The opening of the film is great and offers you the possibility of a really scary horror movie. What happens to the rest of the film has no structure or purpose and does not build up much. However, there are some good performances and a great atmosphere. The end of the film is weak given what has been built up to this point. Where there should be a great climax of enormous proportions, instead you get a very typical conclusion that is used by many other horror movies. A few scenes are very memorable for her pictures, but in the end, the film does not succeed in making a really good movie. If you do not feel that you have to see everything that this director has done, I recommend the sharing ...
