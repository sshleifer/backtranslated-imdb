CHEERLEADER MASSACRE (2003) <br /> <br /> starring: Tamie Sheffield, Charity Rahmer, Erin Byron, Leonard Johnson, E. Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, GiGi Erneta, April Flowers, Nikki Fritz, Brad Beck, Summer Williams, Brinke Stevens, Melissa Brasselle. <br /> <br /> Action: A group of cheerleaders is on their way to a game with their coach and three boys when their van suddenly collapses and they seek refuge in a nearby cabin. Soon they drink, have sex and are brutally brutally murdered by an invisible murderer. <br /> <br /> The Good: A few laughs, surprising identity of the murderer, a brisk Stevens Cameo, my favorite scene from THE SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE serves as a flashback. <br /> <br /> The Bad: I loved this movie, I loved all three slumber party massacres because they were just so much fun, and I have a lot of this "slumber party / Sorority House Massacre with Screaming But it was just shit! They went above and beyond "we're cheesy but proud" and basically made softcore porn, but with a good who-dun-it. <br /> <br /> **
