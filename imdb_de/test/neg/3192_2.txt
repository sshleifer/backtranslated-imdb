Probably one of the worst movies ever made. I'm still trying to figure out if it should be fun, but I had absolutely no fun. Maybe the film lost something during the English-Italian translation, you know, I definitely miss the courage to revisit it in the original version. <br /> <br /> My price for him 2/10, and I feel like '' I'm quite generous (say, 1 point is for Liv, because she's a pretty baby, and the other point is for the decent actors who have fallen into a worthless, useless and pathetic movie). <br /> <br /> Take Care <br /> Alex
