A Tearing Baby T-Rex is passing through a small western town, prompting Sheriff Eric Roberts and animal control agent Melissa Brasselle (who plays her role in a very uninteresting way) to get to the bottom of things. They note that a mad scientist (Corbin Bernsen), unaware of the government's sponsorship, is continuing a long-abandoned US research project called "Operation Jurassic Storm" (ha!) By setting up an army of dinosaurs in a remote underground laboratory facility , After a short time, our heroes are trapped inside, the marines are brought in, the power goes out, and the dinos are free to make a quick lunch of everyone, where they can get their claws and claws. An often indescribably inappropriate script full of Plot holes, inconsistencies and incomplete character traits. This direct copy of JURASSIC PARK and CARNOSAUR is a pretty wholesome garbage thanks to its good production values, passable FX, occasional laughs and lots of brainless action. <br/> <br/> Someone has pointed out that CARNOSAUR had an opening scene stolen in this movie, but Anyone who has watched Roger Corman productions knows that directors can generously reuse the clips of his early films to save time and money. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
