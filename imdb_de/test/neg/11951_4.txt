Well, I have to admit, when I saw the trailer for this movie, I was looking forward to it. I'm generally a fan of carefree romantic comedies and the trailer, that's the impression I got from this movie. However, I spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. Although there were a few amusing scenes, the prospects of the film were generally quite depressing. <br /> <br /> I also found it difficult to fall in love with one of the characters because they all looked a bit underdeveloped. the time in which the director could have explored the characters consumed by unnecessarily overworking Opera, making the movie feel slow and sluggish is pretty deceptive and I would only suggest you look at it when it does really nothing else that tickles your imagination. <br /> <br /> Not fantastic, and as I said; Fade.
