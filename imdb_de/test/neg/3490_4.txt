I remember that I saw this movie when I was a kid. I remember that it scared me a lot, and it stayed that way for all these years. I spent a few years finding it online. I could not remember the title, just the story. After searching and searching I came across a VHS that was sold at E-Bay. I was excited and when it finally arrived I put it in the VCR and could not help feeling a bit nostalgic. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. This was not the movie I saw as a kid. It was boring at times and I found Beryl Reid's incessant whining extremely annoying. Both appearances by Reid and Flora Robson were good overall, but the movie was not scary. I think every movie is worth a visit to make your own opinion, but sometimes good.
