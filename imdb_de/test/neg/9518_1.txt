I was looking forward to seeing this at the Sydney Film Festival. Like many others, I left the theater before the credits, because I could not stand it any longer. It was badly shot, the sound sucks and the drama was worse than an episode of The Love Boat. Now I know why this film failed to find an American distribution company that publishes it in the United States. This screams for a low-budget high school production.
