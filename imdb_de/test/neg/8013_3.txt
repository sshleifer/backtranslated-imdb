Well!! The movie has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. It's a Hallmark TV movie. It's from a Thomas Hardy novel. It has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. She is by far the only one in the film who behaves better than in my high school theater class. Oh yes, it has Clive Owen in it. I am not British, which means almost as much as a Thomas Hardy novel. Except that he was in "The Bourne Identity" and I liked that. That sums up everything. That was really all there. I'm going to be repetitive, but I like CZJ, so I stuck it through to the end. The computer tells me that I do not have 10 lines and I count them down. I always count 11, but maybe I just do not like my style, but that's also my opinion of the movie.
