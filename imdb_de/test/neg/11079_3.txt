A group of speleologists with a sad story leads an author through an unknown cave in Kazakhstan. In times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to make profits from any combination of cinema components, The Cavern has in recent years only made a relatively different turn compared to the previous eight cave films an X file. I like giving each movie the benefit of the doubt, but it just gave me too many little annoyances. The camera work can cause headaches as they seem to constantly confuse which direction they are going. Since I'm not a Caver, I do not care if the movie was realistic. There is too much unnecessary PANNICK from supposedly experienced speleologists, in the latter half one says according to one of two things? Oh, just shut up and focus on saving yourself, or I hope you all die to the end. It must have been very tiring for these decent actors to shoot this movie. A moderate amount of Gore and nothing special in dialogue or characters. While you're pretty sure you'll know what's going on in the end, the last five minutes explain all the details. But I would have had a better opinion of the movie if they had left the last minute on the tailoring floor. It just was not necessary. I suggest that you take the expectoration immediately upon confirmation of your suspicion and secure the setup for the sequel. I've long thought that the movie industry should share the modified checkout program of the restaurant industry. You pay for the material to make the movie before you go in, but all the profits for the movie come from the tips you give when you leave the cinema. I can not blame it on its low budget, which I do not like about this movie.
