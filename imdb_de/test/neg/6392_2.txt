Michael Caines character has problems. He is a normal, shortsighted, insecure man in his mid-40s. He is married, but his wife does not seem to love him anymore. He has a bad relationship with his only daughter. His immediate problem, however, is that an amazingly beautiful young woman, played by Michelle Johnson, pursues him too eagerly, kisses him, gropes him and tries to initiate sex on every occasion. What is the poor guy doing? <br /> <br /> This movie should be taken from the field of comedy and placed under science fiction. Only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of Michelle Johnson's character. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - she can quite decide - she goes with a clumsy, aging loser. This goes beyond a middle-aged male fantasy into something so insane, you just hope that all parties voluntarily undergo therapy. There are some quick attempts by Caine, who often seems to play Hawkeye Pierce and not just a new character. Joseph Bologna is like fingernails on a blackboard. Michelle Johnson is not an actress - she has a crying scene that would not pass in a high school game - but she is beautiful and undresses. Buy the DVD, continue with scenes 4 and 9 and forget about the rest.
