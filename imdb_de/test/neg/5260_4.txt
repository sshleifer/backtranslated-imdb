The drug runner Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, the drug king Frank Colton. Moses is unknown, Keats is actually a covert police officer. During the bust at Colton's factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in the head. He survives the wound and arrests Moses later. The duo must dodge Colton's hired assassins to overcome his mutual hatred in order to survive. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler's films are usually a hit & miss affair, with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone. This is not as stupid as his other films, but can not overcome a lazy script. The direction is unbelievably uneven, with fast action sequences that allow the slow comic exchange between Sandler and Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes? flying a plane without engines, chasing a car through a forest at night? are quite absurd invented. Acting is the standard for this genre, Sandler & Wayans being a good couple. In short, the movie is stupid, but it's fun to look at it. <br /> <br /> Note: C + Review by M.K. Geist
