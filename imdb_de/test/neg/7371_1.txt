A film about an interesting and sensitive time of the story, shot in a beautiful setting, managed to present a frighteningly banal and clich√©d production, grossly awkward script, poor continuity, intrusive muddy music, sugar-sweet casting and pale drama. <br /> <br /> It was a quarrel between the script and action, which was worse. The script has probably won - the historical background, the background story, and the description of the characters were presented in dialogue with painful details. ... actually words can not describe exactly how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> In an advance screening, there was a massive exodus of about thirty minutes. After an hour, many of those who remained were laughing out loud. I should add that I am a Francophile, I am fascinated by Canada and love the historical film. That was really a one-time thing.
