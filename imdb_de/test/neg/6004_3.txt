A nude departure from Se7en and not suitable for cleaning his shoes. The word "predictable" must have been invented for such an occasion. As always, Lambert is made of wood (his 'emotional moments' are as laughable as his accent). The "climax" is not like that at all, because we had so many signals, and in the end, we're just immune to flesh, rotting, and more. All in all a real mess.
