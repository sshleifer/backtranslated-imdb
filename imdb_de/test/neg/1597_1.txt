Okay, not every Australian movie is that good. Yes, maybe there were really very few with much merit. However, Take Away is an absolute bomb and qualifies as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I wanted to like it I thought I would let it go. I even met one of the screenwriters, Dave O'neil. I feel like a traitor giving a bad review to this movie, but ... The plot is pretty thin (I will not bother ... read the synopsis) I can forgive: there are many movies, who can mask that with a few decent jokes. Unfortunately, the jokes of Take Away hide their conspiracy like the skirt of a prostitute $ 2. Probably the only laugh that came from the other six people in the movies was the bad drama and the dialogue. Take Away goes down like a week old Dim Sim ... You might understand this joke when you see the movie, but the joke is not worth it.
