If you're wondering if Disney could do a show with a character more spoiled than Paris, flatter than Britney, more vappelent than Jessica, and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR? The amazing thing is that Selena Gomez is apparently the heroine. She is also said to be an outcast of the spoiled, flat, gloomy, narcissistic "popular" girl in school, who is no more credible here than Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Plots range from recycled BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to "parodies" of HARRY POTTER. The older boy switches between a magical genius and the inability to master the complexity of his own shoelaces. The younger boy is just another clever "rogue" who has proliferated on television like cockroaches in New York (and with the same allure). The father is the stereotypical dumb TV dad and the mother ... well, she is not terrible. But all pale with the hideous, hideous and yet terribly intriguing spectacle (as in a serious car crash) of Mrs. Lopez's self-satisfied, self-satisfied, playful performance. And again she is the heroine.
