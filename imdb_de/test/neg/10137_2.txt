My parents may like this show, but I can not find the humor in it. What's so funny about having a dentist husband impregnate his hygienist assistant and impregnate the oldest daughter of the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! It's sometimes a shock to me what people think is humor these days. To blame for shows like "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game", which put the topic of sex in the center of the 1960s in the foreground. Sure, the series has its touching moments, but that's no excuse for the content that went into this series otherwise. This is not comparable to the family-oriented days of "I Love Lucy" five decades ago. <br /> <br /> One answer to the question of why this series is being played on the Lifetime cable channel is that the women in the channel believe women could relate to Reba's character! I absolutely do not like the character of Reba Hart's daughter Kyra. She is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager! Funny, I wonder if the actress who played Kyra. Scarlett Pomers is so far from acting in real life. Who plays ex-husband dentist Christopher Rich is not much better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is selfish! The characters of Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying. <br /> <br /> Another thing that baffles me is why Dingbat-of-a-series creator Allison M. Gibson decided to play the series where I live 25 miles away from; Houston, Texas! Reba McEntire is not even from this state, she is an oklahoman! Why did you choose to let random music sound like a snorting pig during a season or more? What I mean by that is where we hear how this baritone saxophone is played with drums, but the tunes are basically doeless!
