There is only one word that describes this movie: BAD !! I have no idea why this movie was made or how they made Dennis Hopper a star in this movie. Stuart Gordon is a better director than this and Hopper is a much better actor. The movie is just stupid. I liked the idea of ​​the "square pigs" and there was an interesting love scene in which a cyborg was involved, otherwise this movie should be avoided at all costs.
