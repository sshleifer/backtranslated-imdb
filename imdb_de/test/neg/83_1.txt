Now I understand that this took two months. "Really?" I'm pretty sure my crew could do it in less than a week. This movie was so bad that I could not even pay close attention. Further evidence that women with breasts can not always protect from terrible writing, acting and directing. Now I understand that it was not a budget, but there is also no continuity and no reason not to turn it off and see infomercials or foreign messages in a language you do not understand. Oh, there are some decent-looking women showing the merchandise. Still, there are not enough sexy women to justify looking at this travesty in the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. However, I did it with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and prepare your weapon because you might want to use it after this hack job. Finally, the individual (idiot) who left a comment before me thought that this was a great movie and he loved it. Just a proof that siblings should not develop themselves. Oh, burn !!! - Captain J
