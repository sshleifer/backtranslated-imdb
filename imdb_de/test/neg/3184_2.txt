"It should have gotten good reviews," says the G / F. If so, I can not find her. She goes to sleep and I endure. Michael Douglas as a good old boy - now there is a new one. Matt Dillon screwed up everything. John Goodman loses his coolness. Paul Reiser walks around in BDSM leather. Oh, it's a riot okay. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you are likely to lose interest soon. Liv Tyler plays the Femme Fatale and critics complain that she may not have the record for her role. But it does not matter: this movie is not about character development. I would even go so far as to say that there is no character at all. What you appreciate here is the plot. <br /> <br /> Nobody is "bad" in this movie. Some people wonder why all these "stars" - Reba even here for goodness sake - sign up for such a junk project. Probably they thought it would be fun. Maybe they had fun. Who knows? Hey - maybe they were well paid too. <br /> <br /> But you have to bridge the money in one way or another to see this turkey. And that's probably not a good idea.
