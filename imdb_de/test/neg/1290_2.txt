While the dog was cute, the movie was not. It was not the premise or the topic that was a problem. The premise had great possibilities for humor and pathos. The topic is a worthy one. Helping other people is more important than amassing a fortune. Unfortunately, the adorable dog, unique premise and theme were undercut by bad acting, stilted dialogue and amateur filming. Even my youngest kid, who will endure almost everything, has given up before we die Had gone through half. How often can this dog walk up and down the same hallway? I can not spoil you, since I have never seen the end. It was not worth seeing all the way to the end.
