You know, I really hate IMDb's censorship system, because my whole review is almost gone when you take the cursing out. But now it starts. Processing time! <br /> <br/> Holy Moley is so bad. I thought it might be a cool little movie judging the summary of the plot since I know I've blindly rented such gems as Frailty and American Nightmare. That's just outlandish. It's about a murderer who uses the works of Edgar Allen Poe as a reference for his murderous exploits, and the story of a detective who has to stop him. Can not these confusing hacks make a good movie without messing up the grave of a great horror writer? I mean, the killings here are completely free of reflection or originality, and the hints to Poe are hokey and false, without enough thought being put into them. They are shallow and they shame Poe's work. Holes full of terrible sequencing. Acting is also poor and reminds me of the abortion that was known in some Third World countries as "Fear X", which is the case with all the pausing and un-emotional lines. <br /> <br /> I realize that this is an indie movie, but that's no excuse. I've seen schoolchildren behave better than these idiots, and I could have come up with better scenes and a better plot if you have plenty of time. <br /> <br /> That has no reason to exist. Avoid at all costs.
