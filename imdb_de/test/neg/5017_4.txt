Bobcat Goldthwait should be recommended because he tries to do something different with this surprisingly warm movie, a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being honest with everything. Melinda Hamilton plays a starring role as Amy, a girl who had oral canine with a canine in the past. She fights with her fianc√©, John. Of course the truth is behind her shaggy ugly head. The film looks at the effects of this escapade. The movie is well played by everyone except perhaps Jack Plotnick as Dougie, who never really felt like he was mixing well with the picture. And although the film is sound enough, it seems to miss a few times. Every single person in the movie is struggling with massive hypocrisy and all of us a bit hard to find. Bobcat should be recommended for something else, as I said earlier, but different is not always good and it always does not fade away from Goldthwait's own directorial debut, the criminally misunderstood "Shakes the Clown" My Note: C-
