I saw this during a short round at a Philadelphia theater. Despite its local origins (and its relationship to a hometown tragedy, the beating death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really need to work hard on this film. The director chose best-known reasons to shoot the entire movie guerilla style with uninterrupted handheld cameras and Rapidfire cuts. Such a technique may work for scenes of violent violence, but is totally inappropriate for the rest of the material that makes up the majority of the film. A walk on the sidewalk, a brother-to-brother conversation on a couch, hell, even a kiss on a date for the first time, are all shot in Cusinart style, distracting the viewer from ever entering the drama. Martin also undercuts his narrative by packing far too many topics: besides the birth of mob violence, we get anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, abuse of parents ... did I miss anything? Undoubtedly, a better occupation (and a more targeted direction) would have put these threads together, as Martin certainly intended, to show how a moral error evokes and sustains a number of others ... but good intentions are not necessarily great films. Just a huge mess. Martin, I know you're from my city and I went down with you, I'm really ... just do a better job the next time you did on Two Plus One.
