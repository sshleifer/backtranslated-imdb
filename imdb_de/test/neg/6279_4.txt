The War of the Worlds by director David Michael Latt by G. G. Wells is a slightly under-average movie, which is not bad considering that the budget he has to work with is only $ 1 million. On this budget, the production value was not too bad - the best part is the visual effects (I was very impressed by the CGI budget) and the sound design. The less than outstanding parts of this film are the story, which will be extended VERY long at best (but I think this is again due to the budget they had - they had to extend certain scenes to bring the playing time to 97 minutes), the acting (again because the actors had no history to work with), very few extraordinary camera shots and the music. However, for the most part, I can only let go of the negative parts because this film was made for a frugal budget and still had a good production value. Still, you should see it to see how a low-budget version of War of the Worlds can be made with mistakes. 4 out of 10.
