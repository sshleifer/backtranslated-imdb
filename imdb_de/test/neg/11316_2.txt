Leslie Nielsen is usually someone whose films I really like (even critical films like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrongfully Accused"). The fact that I'm slamming "Mr. Magoo" should show that it's a piece of garbage. It seems Nielsen as a short-sighted title character, something is planted on him and he makes everything confused. It seems like the combination of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind two of Jackie Chan's films) make this a weird film, but it does not; It seems they only have people who can do something and there is no real sense of humor here. <br /> <br /> So, the original cartoon with Jim Backus, who provided the voice, was worth seeing. Leslie Nielsen has also done a lot better, so there is no reason to waste your time on it. With Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; They probably do not want to emphasize this trash in their careers.
