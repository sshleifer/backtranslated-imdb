With pretty good Rick Baker-like special effects and Deran Serafian in a small role, this pretty lame Italian movie deserves recognition. Cerchi deserves some credit for still making Gore-Flicks, while most of the other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava, and Enzo G. Castellari) are moving to lower-pitched TV films. As for plankton, it's half Piranha - half The Thing, with people who turn into monsters, rape women and cause general chaos. The film's extremely filthy, sloppy, and overly sexual feeling makes it hard to enjoy it. Only available in Italian.
