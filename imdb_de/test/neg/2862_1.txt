When I first heard about this movie, I started walking around renting it and mistakenly believed that it was one of those so bad movies that was fun and that I wanted a reward. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> For beginners the tempo is agonizing, amazingly slow. The tempo begins to increase only in the last 15 to 20 minutes of the film! The plot was boring and the end was nonsensical and confusing. If you are looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills, you should look elsewhere. This film offers the cheese dairy in spades, but he lacks painfully "thrill", cheap or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Try Child's Play instead.
