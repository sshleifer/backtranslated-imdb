I have been looking forward to this release for many months. The previews looked good, the first reports on the net were encouraging, and Golden Eye and Timesplitters were excellent shooters (from the same people). It turns out that I was seriously misled! Haze had the potential to be part of Call of Duty 4 and other next generation shooters, no matter how they look, feel, and feel like it was something like five years ago. I played Haze on a 1080 TV set and was initially disappointed that the developers of the game had limited the graphics to 720. Haze's universe lacks details and atmosphere, the feeling that "you really need to hurry to finish this" is always there. > <br /> The controls are sluggish and awkward, and I still need to find an adjustment for the sensitivity of the x / y axis. There are many parts of the single player game that are very dark (visual), to the point where you can not really see where you are going. Why not add a flashlight feature like in Halo? or even better, night vision? The use of the performance-enhancing drug "nectar" is interesting, but just as you get used to it, switch sides and stop using it! why bother? I could go on with many more Haze errors, but instead I just DO NOT say BUTHER! Wait for Killzone 2 or play Call of Duty 4 and try to unlock the Gold AK!
