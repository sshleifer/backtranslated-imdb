I'm sitting here watching the movie, Tango and Cash. IT led to a discussion about other great movies of the late 80s. The ridiculous connection between Tunrer and Hooch, K9 came up. <br /> <br /> Granted, I've never seen K9PI before. Joshua cites this as his movie of the year. Impressive. Impressive. I am totally amazed that this movie exists. But much more than the fact that Joshua likes this move bothers me to the core. I think Joshua is an interesting guy <br /> <br /> K9 <br /> <br /> K9
