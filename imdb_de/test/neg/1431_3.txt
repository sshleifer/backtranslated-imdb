What starts out pretty well (and quite disconcertingly) quickly sinks into an annoying mess. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider (by Twisted Sister Infamy) seems to have written the script out of his own idea, and the idea of ​​a cyber-stalking Pierce freak has potential; they have uneven tempo, bad talk, and so on one of the biggest non-ends you'll ever see really brought to a standstill. Despite some lifeless performances, the director creates a really scary first role. This really looks like it's a good low budget effort. <br /> <br /> No such luck. The plot runs the entire map, and Snider's character tirelessly spits out psychotic fortune cookie lines meant for meaningful dialogues. Worse still, the minority is barely registered, and the halfway credible dialogue comes from a young girl helping a detective navigate the internet. <br /> <br /> What a waste of a great idea. Oh, and there's a new, twisted Sister song if you're interested.
