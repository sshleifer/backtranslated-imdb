This was such a horrible movie, almost a comedy sketch of a Noir movie. The budget was low compared to a blockbuster, but still higher than most. But here they have decided to cut costs, which is weird least competent, while others look like they've just been pulled off the streets. One of them is the lead actor, he is so bad that I jerked when he said anything (he talks all the way through the movie) At the beginning of the movie, all the characters are wearing 1930s clothes. You drive a classic car, but the background is a modern state-of-the-art wind farm. And the costumes and some settings continue to follow the Noir theme of the 30s. Then BAM drives a brand new escalator with 24-inch rims. WTF. Right back, if a guy has a night-vision device on his rifle, you get a shot down. He's aiming for a guy with an mp5 and tactical in an even stranger contrast, the locations are brilliant and seem to have cost me more than the rest of the entire movie. The camera makes very good angles / angles and shows these scenes brilliantly in the scenes. The director has a keen eye for a good-looking single shot, but has no idea how else to do it. <br /> <br /> Persons who should be shot for this movie â–¼ <br /> <br /> The Author The Director The Casting Agent The Costume Designer <br /> <br /> People who need torture is death for her monotonous, monotonous nails on chalk board voice. Anton Pardoe - the lead actor, writer and producer If you have ever seen the Film Hostel, I wish that would happen to this guy, but he does not miss
