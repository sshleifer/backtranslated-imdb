Carrot shell in a full-length movie, enough said. The only reason this is not a one is because of my personal voting system of only a 1 and a 10, and this is not an extreme task. terrible god terrible. There are some films that are so bad that they are unintentionally funny. Then there are movies that make you feel physically uncomfortable, and then there are movies that lead to serious suicidal consideration. burn all the copies of the movie, shoot anyone who was not creative, torment anyone with creative input. As for the star, there are only so many things that can be said online ten seconds with a severed head to the end of the work.
