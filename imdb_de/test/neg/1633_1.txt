Why was this movie made? Can producers be so easily deceived by sadists that they give them money to create torture methods like this so-called "movie"? I love a bad movie as well as the next masochist, but "Cave Dwellers" is pushing him on. It is seriously physically painful to look at. The story is about a guy named Ator - a bloated stupor I'll refer to as Private Snowball for the remainder of this review - who has to fight invisible warriors and save a princess to beat the evil one who needs it better barber. I may have misunderstood the plot since it's been a while since I've seen these excrements, but are you really that interested? Oh yes, Private Snowball also has a dumb Asian buddy (who does not have that?). Who is not funny. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Private Snowball fights invisible people, visits some caves, all in the name of a good king, so the personality is free of Al Gore, who looks like Jim Carrey. Then Private Snowball builds a kite (yes, I'm serious) and picks up the girl. Yippie-Kee-Yay. It's cheap, unintentionally stupid and dull. Why am I not surprised that the director has made porn? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: AVOID. Ator will steal part of your life and you will not be taking any funny "so-bad-they-are-good" hints from the experience. Bad Ator! BAD! Aak! * Gags *
