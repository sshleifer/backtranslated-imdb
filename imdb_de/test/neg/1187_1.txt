This review took longer than me to watch this movie. It's just bad. The plot is terrible compared to the TV shows. It's flat, unstable and boring. <br /> <br /> It's clear that the LoG runs out of ideas long before this movie was lit in green. Viewers should take this as an example of how they do not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> Bad editing, bad music, bad acting. Zero Dynamism, Zilch chemistry. <br /> <br /> A movie that does not know what it is, that has been turned into a mysterious ending without any love, that makes you feel depressed and feels angry that so much money has been wasted br /> <br /> The LoG was obviously offered something that he could not refuse, or maybe his egos just made the best of it. It's a dark marketing boost that might have been better if the LoG was fresher and more inspired. <br /> <br /> However, I knew when to stop and did it. <br /> <br /> Please! Someone is trying to convince me of the subtleties of this movie!
