Woa, talk terribly. Do not waste your time. I wish I had seen the other user comments first. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I did not look at it all. It was just too horrible. The worst, happiest dialogue ... I could go on and on. But what made it really unsurpassable was the direction. The poor actors. They can not even say if they have talent, because they not only have pathetic sayings, but the director has not given them any action. If you look at the filmography of the director on this website, you will see why this film did not stand a chance. <br /> <br /> That would not even be good for a TV movie. <br /> <br /> Ouch!
