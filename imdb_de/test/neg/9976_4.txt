Fellow Giallo Fanatic: Use caution and / or caution? because this movie is not exactly what it seems to be. It certainly looks like a giallo, with its juicy VHS cover (showing a busty naked girl and a big, bloody knife), a rhythmic title and the name of two seasoned Italian actors in the cast (John Phillip & Fernando Rey), but basically it's just an erotic thriller without much plot. The version I looked at is probably heavily censored. with a running time of almost 77 minutes? But there is still a lack of suspense, character development and above all sadistic (and usually giallo) carnage. "Eyes Behind the Wall" can be briefly summarized as the collection of a series of perverse characters and the expanded presentation of their sexuality problems. Nevertheless, it is an interesting effort, because writer / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) has clearly tried to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfactory and regrettably tame. Inspired by Hitchcock's "Rear Window", the main character is a frustrated writer who is elderly and wheelchair user. He and his much younger lover get their sexual tricks by spying on the lone tenant living across the street. The tenant likes to perform naked gymnastic exercises around the house and has clearly bisexual wishes. Wheelchair user sends his wife over and they have sex. Then there is Ottavio, the butler, who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. Are there normal characters in the story? No of course not! The movie benefits from a consistently sinister atmosphere, with a moody soundtrack and a sophisticated photography, but none of it leads anywhere, so everything is just sleaze & sex without meaning. At the end of the story there is a really bizarre twist, but it comes too late and too randomly to increase the overall quality. Not recommended for fans of Italian horror / cult cinema, but perhaps it's a great sight for psychology students to analyze Freud's characters.
