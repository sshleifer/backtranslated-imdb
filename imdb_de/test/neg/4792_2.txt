Another horrible movie from Hollywood. This time a woman helps the revolution in a Central American country. Yes Yes Yes. Hey, let's do a movie without feeling real. I am so fed up with such films. The actors and actresses are lousy, the effects are cheesy and the dialogue awful. And suddenly I see John Rhys-Davies as the evil president. From Gimli to Hugo Louis Ramos. I bet he is very proud of it. Well, I should not have expected much from this movie and I did not do it. And I am glad that the bigtime is shit. I wonder what people like this movie. My guess is younger people between 12 and 16 years. And I guess some people like Kristin Dattilo. Well, I'm not in any of these groups and I hate it. Rating: 2
