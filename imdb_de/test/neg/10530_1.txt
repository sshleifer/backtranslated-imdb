Seagal fans are watching - he's not doing any action scenes for nearly an hour in this mess. Instead, Seagal runs away from numerous fights and lets Ja Rule convincingly lose every fight. Yes, Rule might be an aspiring action star, but Hollywood must at least get him into adolescence (which should happen in a few years ...). What type of commando / terrorist wears a nude torso suit? The chick in this atrocity looks like a backup singer for Christina Aguilera. Back to Seagal - When he finally cuts himself off, it's his stunt double (HEAVILY PADDED to resemble the bloated Seagal) that does a lot of work and brings the cases along. I can not remember any aikido either. It's just your standard kicks and punches that you would see in any martial arts turkey. Not even "that bad, it's funny". Just boring ...
