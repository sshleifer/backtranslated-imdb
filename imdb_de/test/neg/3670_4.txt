The casting (and the direction) in Undercurrent is rather bland than inspired in this Noir-Klunker that does not jump off the ground right from the start. Robert Taylor's wooden style represents a roadblock for the severely affected Kate Hepburn, which is a poor chemistry from the start. Naive and innocent Ann Hamilton (Hepburn) falls in love with the attractive aircraft manufacturer Alan Garroway (Taylor) and rushes with him to the altar. She quickly discovers that she does not know much about him. As Alan is a bit more remote, she dives deeper into the gloomy past and Ann soon finds a nightmare instead of the American Dream. Underflow resembles some Hitchcock plots, but Vincent Minnelli quickly realizes that he is not a master of suspense. Hepburn is not a shrinking violet and she's a tough sell for a character more in keeping with the restrained styles of Teresa Wright or Joan Fontaine. Minnelli never really manages to make Kate desperately give in to Taylor's limited ability as an actor. Their attempts seem like a quiet Gish, while Taylor's long descent into madness occupies the reserved Bela Lugosi. Robert Mitchum completes the abuse as a sensitive brother. Talk about stacking. <br /> <br /> The cameraman Karl Freund offers some highly stylized noir interiors, but Minnelli and Cast use the atmospheres gently and the tension stays calm. With Minnelli far from his strength (musicals) and Hepburn's victim role, which she adapts like a bad suit. Undercurrent drowns all involved.
