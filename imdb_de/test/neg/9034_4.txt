Marked for Death (1990) spends more time on action sequences than concentrating on his characters. After his first two impressive efforts, Above the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third Steven Seagal image makes clear the idea that anyone who opposes him should look like a fool; The bad guys are just there to make him look good. Seagal had constantly built an audience that seemed a bit bigger than the one that followed the kick-em-up antics of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> In Marked for Death, Seagal throws off any semblance of style and boosts the exploitation at full throttle. This film contains a lot of graphic violence, gorges and nudity, which seems to have no reason for it, as the enthusiastic moviegoers who do not distinguish between action pictures that tell a story, and those that simply do not rhyme or reason are . And he deserves a real blame for this loss of taste as a producer of "Marked for Death". Seagal plays John Hatcher, a retired DEA agent who comes to Chicago, where his family is attacked by a Jamaican street gang attacking his sister's house, and the film proves it is not squeamish when Hatcher's niece (Danielle Harris ) is shot in the crossfire. Hatcher goes crazy and decides to team up with his old friend Max (Keith David), a gymnastics teacher, and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican policeman. Of course, Hatcher declares war on the boss villain, a Jamaican voodoo priest with fear called Screwface (Basil Wallace), a nickname that apparently means "outrageous overclocking". <br /> <br /> And it's almost unbelievable how Seagal picks out various members of the gang: He grabs a guy in the eye, breaks a guy's back and breaks numerous arms and limbs. The logic for this movie is thrown out the window - through the glass, that is. Why are not Hatcher and his friends accused of all the damage they caused or the number of bodies that pile up? And how did they fly from Illinois to Jamaica without being detected? <br /> <br /> Seagal has a Clint Eastwood stoicism about him that fans once seemed to like, and despite the three different characters he played in as many films, everyone dresses in oriental black bathrobes and wears them a ponytail. One of the problems I have with some of Seagal's films is that the main characters never seem to be seriously endangered. And because he is the star, nobody can attract him, of course, except evil. <br /> Seagal's heroes are all interchangeable, as are most plotlines and action sequences. No matter if he disguises himself as a ship's cook, a firefighter or a policeman with love beads, Seagal is always Seagal, exactly what his fans want. In fact, the equality of these films is such that if I wanted to, I could take an old review, change the names and take the new movie reasonably well. Not that I would ever really do that ...
