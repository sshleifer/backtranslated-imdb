This is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> The story is incompatible with most other TC episodes. It's pretty boring, but seeing Peter Falk as Fidel Castro-Lookalike is somehow amusing. <br /> <br /> Whenever Twilight Zone aired in my hometown at an unannounced hour, I grabbed a sandwich and a drink and settled for some good conversation. 9 times out of 10 it was this episode! Weird thing? This often happened to my mother (another TZ fan like me). There were so many times that one of us said to the other, "I was ready to look at _The Twilight Zone_ and guess which episode? The Cuban dictator episode!" Obviously, some people like this episode because it gets a rating of 6.7 ... I do not know how that happened, but that alone would make a great Twilight Zone plot!
