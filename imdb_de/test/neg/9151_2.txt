I've just watched a horrible movie called The Sleeping Dictionary. A reviewer from Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) got it right when he wrote: "From A to Zzzzzzzzz". The story is about an English colonialist who comes to Malaysia to 'civilize' the savages, so to speak, and finally falls in love with his sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute who speaks fluent English and cares for English colonialists and in turn teaches them their mother tongue. Well, the movie never really makes that clear, but I can only assume he's giving her money or something. It is needless to say that the film focuses more on the "sleeping" part than on the "dictionary" part of the job description. Things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair is aggravated by her culture, the domestic situation of his soap opera and his own boundless stupidity in every important decision he makes throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> So yes, the film has some serious flaws, but on the other hand, it delivered exactly the two things I first rented for it: a beautifully photographed exotic location and an even more beautiful photographed and exotic one Woman playing the sleeping dictionary, Jessica Alba. My girlfriend told me that this crappy movie was on her best side and damned he was right. She's not a great actress and does not suit Malaysian, and it's pretty obvious they use a body double for nudity, but who cares? Jessica Alba has this rare face and a figure that is more than just sexy, but also as beautiful as a Vivaldi Violin Concerto or a Rembrandt painting. <br /> <br /> (PS Sorry, to all feminists who are discouraged from objectifying women, the "male gaze," etc., etc., but I hope you can understand that I do not mean disrespect.)
