The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's "Nine Lives" comes when Sissy Spacek, hiding in a hotel room where she is having an affair with Aiden Quinn, finds a nature documentary on television. - Different footage is cut into a scene, predators and prey are thrown together to capture the moment - anything to force connections where there are none. Characters in the nine short films that make up this movie are occasionally translated into the stories of others, but none of them seems to really connect. A woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen in a hospital room, where another woman prepares for a mastectomy. A man who meets an old friend in a supermarket and sees what his life should be like later, hosts a dinner party for an unhappy couple with his current wife. Garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other, but none of the following stories really builds on what came before. <br /> <br /> Garcia's first film, the wonderful "overlooked" things you can say by looking "At Her," also had a short story structure and overlapping characters, but there were fewer of them and they had much more Space to Breathe and Grow - The tricky premise of "Nine Lives" that tells each of their nine stories in a single, uninterrupted take in real time never makes the film truly dramatic or dynamic - it's also a pretty ugly movie Interior shots are often bleak and hard to see, while other scenes - especially one in which a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parents - are disturbed by the camera work - Garcia's third Film and he has a considerable directing work for television, the direction in this film is quite surprisingly amateurish, as the film's comrade Rebecca Miller konze Garcia (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) focuses on the written and character aspects of his films, often at the expense of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Individual scenes touch and even influence. I liked that Jason Issacs Robin Wright kissed Penn's pregnant belly. And Joe Mantegna lovingly whispers to his wife as she slips into sedation before surgery. And Sissy Spacek steals some happy moments from her life with Aiden Quinn, before she was brought back there with a call from her daughter. But the film (as opposed to "things that can be seen by mere seeing") feels more like an exercise than a real drama. We only watch how people act.
