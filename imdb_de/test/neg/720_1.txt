This was an interesting adaptation of William Shakespeare's last known solo, but in my humble opinion a terrible one. Jarman first tries to change the personality of the characters. He makes Miranda go crazy after being held on the island for so long that Prospero is no different - a mixture of madness and self-pity. I could not imagine Shakespeare taking his characters for something Jarman portrayed them. <br /> <br /> Caliban's appearance may be the only thing he understands correctly, but on the other hand, I had the impression that Caliban was a tortured, deformed monster, but he turned out to be an insane wanderer, a Northernerner who was constantly cackles, not as I would have imagined. Ferdinand makes a brief appearance, most of the time naked and quiet. <br /> <br /> Up to the point where I stopped watching this awful adaptation, they had cut so many lines from the game. If anything, I think Jarman has tried to rewrite Shakespeare and include his own scenes most of the time. In the first part, so much text is cut out that it is not a Shakespeare play, but a lot of melodramatic, absurd garbage from the 70s. <br /> <br /> An attempt to interpret this piece more realistically in the end, but this here The game was never realistic and nothing was done, as the text shows.
