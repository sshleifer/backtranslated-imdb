STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** just missed the mark *** This little bit in between ** lagging behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> Based on another of Stephen King's long novellas, This happens in the sleepy town of England Castle Rock (also the name of the film's production company!), where a new antique shop, the title "Needful Things", was opened. The owner and owner Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) hides, you could say, a diabolical secret. There is an item in his shop that everyone in the little town wants. First, a small cash price is required before a far gloomy price is demanded. When the suspicion, hatred, and madness tear the city apart, police chief Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) struggles to restore order and save the city from a terrible end ... I read the novel of Needful Things earlier this year They were curious, and the movie adaptation wanted to look at it again to compare it (as if it were a contest!) But it was deleted on video and DVD, and I could not rent it anywhere. So I was happy when I finally found him at a flea market on a shopping spree ... <br /> <br /> It's one of the cruelest ironies that King novels usually read best, but if they're prepared for it Screen nine out of ten is, as here, the complete garbage. The material that makes his books great, for some reason, simply does not translate well into a script. And I think there is always the question: why should I look at it if I could read the book again instead? <br /> <br /> I appreciate that some are too long (ie, the stand) to make all of the situations and characters a full screen job, but there's no reason why this could not be anything Material from the book. As a result, many key characters from the book (ie Ace Merrill) are not included at all, and we have a terrible character development, which means that we do not care about the characters involved because they are so deep in depth and depth of motivation - for example a character from the book, Danforth Keaton, who ultimately murders his wife, but we have not been shown to have any reason for not understanding or hated her if it happens, unlike in the book in which much depth was invested and it was really necessary to find out what happened to the characters involved. All the stuff in the script to fill in the cracks, if you like, is really stupid and cheesy and the typically silly stuff that's included in King's adjustments like this one. <br /> <br /> Most problems of the film are that it deviates so far from the book, but there is also some horrible spectacle from a cast that obviously does not feel the stupid material they are supposed to play. In the 1990s, many of King's works began to skip the cinema and were simply turned into TV / video regions. A garbage like this one must surely call the reason. **
