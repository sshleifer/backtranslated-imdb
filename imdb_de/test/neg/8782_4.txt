The unknown origin of the Lone Ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became the ranger. Legendary bomb. The idea was not a bad idea - to reinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger to the audience of the 1980s. Right away there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to no longer act as Lone Ranger. This resulted in an unpleasant little battle that made headlines. I know people who did not want to see the movie because of Moore's treatment. They also hired the awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the ranger. Spilsbury was very pretty and muscular but had no charisma and just could not act. In fact, his entire vocal performance was renewed by another actor! Even his off-screen antics (public drunkenness and beating people) did not help. Apart from that, the script is boring and slow. Even the ranger himself appears after a HOUR! At that time, there were some complaints that the film was too violent for a PG. But I do not think it was that bad. <br /> <br /> There are a few (very few) things that are done here - the photography was really beautiful; Michael Horse was excellent as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd is a lot of fun as a villain and when the Lone Ranger finally shows up (with the William Tell Overture being zoomed in by the soundtrack) it's a blast. All in all, however, this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the Lone Ranger. It's easy to see why this bombing. A 4 - mainly for photography.
