This movie spends most of its time preaching that it's the script that makes up the movie, but apparently there was no script when that time was wasted! The trailer makes this a comedy, but the film can not decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action movie. Press releases showed that Shatner and Hamlin made this film because they loved the script (what did they think of?). If you like William Shatner (I do), you will see "Free Enterprise" instead.
