'Book II' is not a movie, it's a sermon. This disgusting, sickly and almost unbearably boring misfire probably works as a religious propaganda, but has no entertainment value except for a few secrets of George Burns. Louanne plays a little girl who is asked by (er) God to launch an ad campaign that will make people believe in him again. No, that's the story. It's a leaden load of old shoemakers who have far too much self-explanatory, "explanatory" religious waffle but barely a decent dialogue and certainly the complete lack of something that even approaches magic or spell. "Miracle On 34th Street" is not. Suzanne Pleshette breathes life into this rancid puddle of fast-hardening concrete, but the pudding-headed writing and garbage performance of the annoying Louanne quickly sends her into the fiery depths of knowledge.
