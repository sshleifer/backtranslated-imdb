I really like this genre, but The Cell was one of the worst movies I've ever seen unhappily. While about 25 percent of my audience entered and left the theater during the tour (or completely abandoned), I was dumb enough to hold it. The main problem with this story (there were too many to list) is that you have to do two things with this kind of movie ... First, make them afraid of the killer (that is, they'll take him twenty minutes after that) Get caught film) and you have to give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that it really matters to you if she comes in time or not. Not only did I lose sight of the girl, I got so little insight into her that she was just a blurry face, and when I remembered that she was part of the story, I really did not care what to do with it it happened. While the visuals were interesting in some sort of LSD flashback style, they often made no sense and this should be a lesson that can not replace visuals with a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example) or know what to do with it the women who knelt in this area and stared at the sky? Ridiculous.
