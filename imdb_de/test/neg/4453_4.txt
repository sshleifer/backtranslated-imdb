It's funny, this movie. One has the impression that the makers of this snooze party spent more time in the local bars than on the set. In fact, it is a surprise not to see the name of Harry Alan Towers in the credits. It certainly has the flair of one of its tax shelter productions, but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for all involved a longer stay in Provence. Despite the fact that the film is to take place throughout the region, Les Baux and its surroundings are suitable for almost anything. David Birney is a spectacular colorless hero - as Michael Lonsdale says at one point, "You are a walking cliche". What Lonsdale is doing, one can only guess. For some reason, the most interesting character played by Rampling is disregarded, whereas she should be the central character regardless of the book, since she clearly has the ability to carry the film (which would have been boring anyway, but at least would have to see more of something pretty). <br /> <br /> All in all, a pointless affair worth seeing what an action-action movie might look like.
