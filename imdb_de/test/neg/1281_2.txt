Why did you make the cute Rugrats TV show that we all know and love a lame attempt to attack teenagers? You do not have to do that. All ages observe the regular Rugrats. When I heard about it, I thought, "hey, you made a TV series about the movie, except, they're really grown up as a teenager, that'll be better." When I saw it, it was like seeing As Told By Ginger, unless they let it suck. Good work. <br /> <br /> When was Tommy in the Rugrats series director? Never. Basically, all episodes of this attempted series are Tommy's love of directing. I do not like it. I tend to look at plans that change every episode. Not always the same. And when did all the characters in the old series have their own pages of history? Never. This series has done that. I did not like it, that all have separated. I do not want to see Angelica's side of the story. I hate them. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this show if you like As Told By Ginger and the Rugrats.
