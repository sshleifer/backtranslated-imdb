The movie is precious and Cage is a baby. <br /> <br /> But will anyone agree with me that the punk presentation in this movie is ATROCIOUS?!?! <br /> <br /> Where is the collision? The Ramones ?? Mismatches social distortion? the cramps? Sex Pistols?! SOMEONE?!?!?!?! the music is this film is incredibly disappointing! At least they play the cure. <br /> <br /> Plus, Randy feathered hair and pleated khakis ... <br /> <br /> this definitely looks like a movie about "punks" like a bunch of punk in the movie industry. <br /> <br /> Although it's a 90's film, SLC Punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punkrock scene of the early 1980s. I'm just saying '.
