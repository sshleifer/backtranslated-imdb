Bruce Willis does a great job as usual. <br /> <br /> [Warning: can be referred to as a "spoiler". <br /> <br /> While my friend thought it was good, I took a look at it my watch throughout the movie asked me when it would end. After seeing such great films as The Patriot and Chicken Run, I was really disappointed with Disney's The Kid. <br /> <br /> Willis plays a middle-aged man with a tough and realistic attitude when it comes to it. Positive twist on people's images (he's an image consultant). An unknown child appears. Yes, he is younger and even Lily Tomlin can see him. At this point I remember a cross between a bad "Quantum Leap" episode and a bad time travel. <br /> <br /> Kid and Willis are trying to figure out why he is at this time. They find out. You meet Willis when he's older. Not to mention that it never goes into details, how old Willis teleports her between the time periods and brings them together at first, how he initially got that knowledge, how he came to the realization that he had to do this, and so on. Basically, it's a very tired, unoriginal and boring act that involves some great actors. The good news is that the "The Kid" actor is not nearly as annoying as he is featured in the trailers on TV.
