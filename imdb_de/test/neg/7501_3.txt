The most important premise for this film is the fantasy of every woman: a vagina that kills and eats men. At least it's a fantasy for any woman who has ever fought a man. What is it, 99.9999% of women? But do not worry, it's not a bloody way to eat men. It's more like a weird shuffle, like a drain plug. There is no blood or parts left. So, for fans of blood, courage and thrills, do not forget this movie, here's not much of a thrill. <br /> <br /> The two main characters of the film are a bit unrealistic. Helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. In the meantime, Dennis is a nice guy who tracks Helen. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit stupid at this point, but then they throw in two more equally stupid sub-stories that simply send this movie to the bad B-movie area. The first new sub-story is about Dennis finding new love with two connected twins. and finally she murdered one of them and became a fugitive bank robber. The second new sub-story is about Helen finding new love for a nice cop who saved her from a bad prostitution-related date and decided to marry her. Dennis and Helen finally meet at the end of the film in incredibly incredible circumstances, magically healing Helen's murderous vagina!
