I loved the last film by Bellocchio, the masterpiece "L'Ora di Religione" so much. It had a great script, great actors (well, Castellitto is so much bigger than others), a brilliant use of light for great movie art. <br /> <br /> Well, Buongiorno Notte is a different story. Ridiculous script that erupts a lot of morality (and we could talk about politics for weeks, you know that we are Italians ...). Poor cinematography (it's too easy to portray the dark years of the 70s with dark colors and dark lights, some efforts make more people !!!!). Bad use of music: what is the purpose of using psychedelia to portray the tragic rationality of Brigate Rosse? <br /> <br /> And to all the people who asked for the top prize in Venice, I answer: "Are you crazy?" Maybe the Russian movie was bad, but not so bad. <br /> <br /> I'm with the PE Do not believe the hype !!!!
