I woke up and it was a beautiful day. The sun was shining, the birds were singing and I wanted to buy a movie, something new, maybe a horror movie? Like many other reviewers, I've come across something that can only be called a shit in a gold foil. The cover on the front page is great and the commentary on the back is intriguing - "it will scare the harvest" ... oh, I laugh back at such naivety and ignorance. <br /> <br /> One of the many things that are more frightening than this movie is the acting skills of these "actors". I think, no, I actually cheered when they were slashed by these "scarecrows" wearing classic costumes. I drove past corn fields fairly quickly, as I found them quite scary at night. But after watching this movie, I almost laughed at the sight. <br /> <br /> I've honestly seen scary omelets, not mine, but I'm clueless at cooking omelets. If someone associates this film with my omelet, we'll just say that I'm creating a situation where they're forced to watch this movie three times in a row. <br /> <br /> If someone has good corn films (crop not pop) that he can recommend, I can inform myself. It's a great comedy, if nothing else, OK, it's nothing else. Enjoy, but some advice - before you press the Play button on your DVD player, throw it out the window.
