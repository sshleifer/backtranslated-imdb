The best part in this movie is the first one in Sicily, I suppose. Crialese shows a good talent for photography, and the start of the film is a pleasant surprise. The rest of the story is pretty boring. Crialese insist on stereotyped situations and characters, trying to merge neorealist suggestions and video-music technique, surinistic memories of fur lines and a very annoying and utterly devious soundtrack that brings it to an end that makes you feel overly lengthy shortly canceled. Honestly, this is a really overrated movie, and Crialese is an overrated director.
