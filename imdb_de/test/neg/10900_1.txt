But it is not. The plot is not so bad, the actors are not all terrible, so it should be decent. Instead, despite a good starting point, the plot simply continues and suffers from many of these "I can not believe he / she is so stupid," so often used in horror movies to keep things going. It has sometimes frustrated me to watch some of the main character's decisions. It also took far too long to reach the good part of the film. The anticipation is great, but you can not spend more than half of the movie on it. Too bad, since it was decent after the release and was hit shortly before the big Halloween season. Nevertheless, I feel that there will be at least one sequel. If not more, they may be able to build on the strong general plot to eventually publish something decent.
