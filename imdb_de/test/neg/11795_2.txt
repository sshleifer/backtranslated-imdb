This movie is a good companion for Blair Witch because he does so much wrong that BW did the right thing. Like BW, this document is a documentary for ghostly events, with each team member hiring his own camera. <br /> <br /> However, the sense of reality is never there. The participants are poorly written clichéd characters and the events that take place are equally clichéd (the cat jumps out of a closet, falling chandelier, etc.). The gestielte dialogue and the improper improvisational work of the overly attractive cast affect the docu-feeling. And, even worse, the cameras supposedly held by the participants capture too many events too perfect to even be nearly credible. With a bit of post-processing, this thing could actually have been a parody of Blair Witch. In fact, there's a scene in which the blond historian eats a sandwich with a giant roach that is actually quite funny and reminds me of a similar, rough scene from "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Steals Me." In the end, however, the event will be played without a punch line. It's hard to say what the intent with the St. Francisville experiment was, other than making a few stray BW dollars. But it's rather sad, as the only real interest I could find in it was whether or not the blond historian would have tied her t-shirt with a certain shot from the belly.
