This film, which I have just discovered in the video store, has apparently been sitting for several years without a distributor. It's easy to see why. The story of two New York-based friends looking for high school mates who now live homeless under the Coney Island Boardwalk has a very good movie, but ultimately comes from the story of Stan and Daniel concentrates, burdening Richie instead of her homeless friend. Cryer is, as always, very good and the film has a nice, crass look, with the ghostly images of Coney Island. However, author Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are too preoccupied with the rather uninteresting life of Stan and Daniel, instead of focusing on Richie. A flashback in a music store where Richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this movie could have gone. But not much in the end. Two lengthy scenes of anger, say in the Skeeball building. RATING 4 out of 10.
