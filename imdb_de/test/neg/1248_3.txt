20 people rated this review as 10! This ballot box was better stuffed than a Christmas turkey! Speaking of turkey, here is a traditional story that hopes to hone the current poker craze - to no avail. All told in linear flashback, and when I say Told, I mean TALKED TO DEATH, this movie never leaves a picture when words can be used to express words. Hoodlums may sound like interesting footage, but the director manages to to take their lives from them. At no time did I have the slightest sympathy for Unger, a genius at the cards, who threw everything into other forms of gambling he was not so skilled at. Of course, as we go through THREE music montages, this leads to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, family loss, and finally, his salvation (of a sort). Big yawn!
