I think the previous House movie was a hit that made Universal pull a few more drops off the monster box. The creative team must have been in a recycling mood, starting with the opening theme, which was lifted by 'Son of Frankenstein', and a few of the stick shots that were scattered throughout the film, like an unwanted business involving shots of Glenn Strange were made monsters mixed with clips from Karloff's Bride of 1935, and compared to the movement of the robot Strange, Karloff seems to move in comparison like a cheetah. <br /> <br /> Previous film continuity is thrown on the line regarding miraculous death. to deceive the abilities of the Wolfman and Dracula, but as Dr. Edelmann & Larry Talbot Discovering Frankenstein's monster with the skeleton of Boris Karloff, Edward T. Lowe recognizes at least some of the past film history, though Talbot has never mentioned meeting Karloff. Niemann. <br /> <br /> As this was the last of Universal's horror cycle, the supernatural elements of The Wolf Man and Drac (unconvincingly) became medical woes. Drac is said to be suffering from a blood disorder, a very rare disease that allows him to turn into a bat or vaporize when exposed to sunlight. >: -] And Larry Talbot has only a small pressure on the brain. Of course, all this is painstakingly explained by the fact that in many scenes throughout many medical terms are associated. This turns out to be the biggest obstacle. At some point, the filmmakers seem to forget the horror or the conversation to give the monsters conditions that are as treatable as a flu. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of the old universal horror, it's rare for me to get bored watching. The whole thing just feels like a movie made just because it could be, but if that mess had not been beaten, the monsters Abbott and Costello might never have met, so I think something good came out of it.
