Of course, this nonsense raises the question of whether a genre as self-referential as the teen comedy really needs another parody movie. The terrible "Scary Movie" (I and II) has adopted the formula as much as possible - "Not Another Teen Movie" really has nothing that is either smart or shockingly exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The plot, which is essentially based on the fairytale film "She's All That", is shaky between parody and homage ("John Hughes High School"). From "American Beauty" to "Varsity Blues" everything is searched for references. The result is ultimately an unfulfilled viewer experience. The disadvantage, if you give us a copy of the copy of 'She's All That', is that we all know where it's going anyway. And if not, then the jokes would be meaningless. <br /> <br /> There is very little to recommend here. The fake big-scene scene (an erupting toilet) seems to be wrong here among all "feel-good references". There are moments of humor - the song is funny enough and the odd good line is a way for the audience. It stinks, do not watch it.
