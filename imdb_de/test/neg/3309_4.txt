Like many other people I have heard of "more" and wanted to see it because of the music composed by Pink Floyd. I have to say that I was really disappointed not because of the music but because of the movie itself. It's a boring, bland movie that lacks the rhythm. Where does this disappointment come from? In my opinion, from different things. Especially the subject of the film, the drug combines badly with the idle, sunny atmosphere of the film. This should have taken place in the filthy areas of Paris and should, for example, have produced a dark and helpless climate. In addition, it should betray a descent into hell, but this descent is mitigated and hardly sketched. Barbet Schr√∂der is not enough on the dramatic side of the story. They could have wished something more madness. On the other hand, Schroeder fails to obtain the emotions and the clinging of the audience to the distress of the two main characters. You are watching inadvertently your attempts with drugs. The two protagonists are absolutely expressionless and develop during the film hardly further, especially Mimsy Farmer. In the end, you only retain the beauty of the Mediterranean landscapes bathed in sunlight. The film caused a great sensation when it was released in 1969. Nowadays it seems <br /> <br /> obsolete. The hippie culture is nothing less than a distant memory.
