Man oh man, that was a piece of dog. I read a few reviews here after seeing the case at the local video store and figured ........ Ah, that seems like a half decent movie. Vampires.Swords. Thailand. How can you do something wrong? Law? No, no, definitely not wrong. Jesus, if I could just open my eyes and not remember this movie, I would be happy. The lead actor had the tiniest, gayest voice ever. Man! It was really bad ... "Amandaaaaaaa ....", "I have to save my girlfriend ..." Shit! My buddy and I changed the audio track on the DVD to Portuguese just so we did not have to hear the guy's voice. Subtitles and everything ... and that IMPROVES the movie. I'm serious, if you're like me anyway and asked me how this movie was ... STOP MIRACLES. I have the answer The worst VAMPIRE FILM ever! No good action, no good blood and only the smallest nudity. Simply pure for 90 minutes. Do not rent it, do not buy it, think about it or look at it at 3:00 in the morning. It just does not cut the cake ... not at all .... somehow. Fuck this movie and watch All Anal 7: Real Deep Cover. You have a better time. I'm sure.
