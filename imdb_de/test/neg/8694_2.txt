It's hard to stand up to classic greats, but once you've made that decision and the decision is in the game, you need to find the best and smartest resources to keep your product in the top drawer and improve quality. If you are aiming for the second or third (or fourth) best, why should you even try it? So I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced and broadcast. I asked the producers, "What did you think, did you try to create a projected deficit?" If the producers might think, "We want to look at this biblical story from a different angle ..." Then I would say, "OK, I saw the show, what's the point of view?" The premise of this "possible viewpoint theory" escapes me. I can generally see programs and (right or wrong) at least get a feel for what the creators were trying to achieve. Not so here. I know names like "Robert Halmi" (the producer) and can combine his work with some eye-catching products. Tin Man, Earthsea, Flash Gordon, Jason and the Argonauts. Low budget entertainment based on myth, history and comic entertainment. A perfect genre for Sci-Fi Channel. So I have to ask Robert Halmi ... "What was the meaning of THESE Ten Commandments, what did you think?" ???????? FJS
