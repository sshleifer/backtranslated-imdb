My wife and I have watched this abortion from the beginning. I hated it right away, but my wife became addicted to it for a few years. For me it was getting worse and worse and the characters were all without question bleak and depressing, without any restful traits. My wife was tired after that and we stopped to look. Occasionally I catch a clip of it or pass it while surfing the canal. There is always someone who yells at someone or does something terrible. There never seems to be brighter moments or feelings of happiness. That was always my main problem when we saw it for the first time - no humor. The authors seem to have no idea about drama - they seem to believe conflicts in IS drama, and of course that's just one element of it. Light and shadow are urgently needed and actors who can bring something. I'm sure the actors in Eastenders are competent, but they have nothing to work with. It must be the most depressing job in showbiz. I do not understand why the British public sees and loves it. What does it say about our psyche? I've heard that it's "as in real life" - it's nothing like my life or the life of someone else I know, or we'd throw ourselves off tall buildings or public transport. The topics that tackle it are far from being seen by families, but are still shown off the watershed. I love shows like Breaking Bad or The Wire, but I would not expect to see them at 7:30 or 8:00 in the evening. The program is capitalized and should be avoided at all costs.
