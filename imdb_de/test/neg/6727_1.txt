First, I like S Segal! But in this movie he has reached the bottom and started to dig! <br /> <br /> THE PLOT What action? Very strange and incredible plot. <br /> <br /> THE MEASURES WERE UNDER THE SEALS STANDARDS! <br /> <br /> THE GOOD PARTS Mr Segal is a professional. And show it. That was it. <br /> <br /> ABSTRACT I could (and did) write a better script for Mr Segal. If you're reading this Stephen, email me, I'll give you a better script to make a better movie! The only realistic part is where ... (see spoiler part). <br /> <br /> SPOILER PART (Stop reading here if you want to watch the movie!) - - - Gas leak? Impressive. Make a black box recorder in a hotel room? I work in the industry, ridiculous! The villain "go away", that's right in life!
