I just watched this "movie" and actually wanted to write my first comment on IMDb.com, even though I've been a user for over 9 years. The reason I've seen that, is that I like splatter movies and sometimes explore my limits and see what actually shocks me. First, the horror in this movie did not shock me, not even the idea that someone came up with it and turned it into a movie - what really shocked me is that there is a market for this kind of crap. Do not get me wrong - I'm all against censorship, but this movie seems to have been made for a kind of fetish audience that seems to be dealing with this kind of crap the same kind of disgust and guilt you feel after watching from movies like "August Underground". This movie is horrible to watch, but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting violence is. In the case of "niku daruma", it seems as if it was strictly done to arouse people. I prefer films that are shocking because they are well done and thoughtful, like Gaspar Noes films or Takashi Miikes or Funny Games or Man Bites Dog - these films will stay with you for a while. I'll have forgotten this movie tomorrow, and the only thing that will stay with me is the thought that there are people out there excited by watching this movie. If you are reading this, please check in at the nearest hospital or shoot yourself - of course not for breeding dogs who just love splatter. You're cool! peace
