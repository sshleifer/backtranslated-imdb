Connery climbs in that stinker of a movie aboard the Moore fool's train. This movie, which throws away everything that made Bond ever successful, further downgrades the Bond character and throws him into the Inspector Gadget category. Get Smart is not. There is no style here, only second-class actors perform on cheap sets. It's a shame that Connery could not give any element of class here, but it does not come over. Everything stinks of mediocrity, even Connery's bad toupee. If I had snowed in and had the choice between "Never Say Never Again" and "Howard The Duck", I would choose the first one. If you want the real James Bond, get a novel by Ian Flemming.
