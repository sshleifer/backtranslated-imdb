If you need an indication of whether Playmaker is decent or not, look at its star Colin Firth, described in an interview as "absolute rubbish" - I sincerely hope no one ever sees it. "<br /> <The script and plot are ridiculous, the female lead is not convincing, the only thing worth it is Colin Firth, and he seems to be a little embarrassed everywhere. <br /> Just for diehard Firth fans - the shower scene alone is worth the $ 3.99 you may have to spend in case you find them a video cutout box like mine. <br /> <br /> I'm glad for Mr. Firth, that his days of recording projects like this are over!
