It looks like the people involved in this film are stuffing the ballot box to increase their ratings. The good news is that apparently only 18 people have seen it. I think this makes me the 19th. I have nothing to do with the movie and I do not know anyone who did it, and I am a longtime IMDb user (check my voting dates and ratings from the past seven years). I promise that I am honest and unbiased opinion. It comes to you from a 30-year-old horror fan who has even appeared in a few low-budget movies. Apart from a few interesting video effects, "Frankenstein's Bloody Nightmare" is incoherent. boring and technically flawed for any reason. It was apparently filmed on silent floor and the sound was then recorded; most of it sounds like it was recorded with a tin box and a piece of string. More than three quarters of the dialogue is inaudible. <br /> <br /> I've watched this from beginning to end and have no idea what the story was or if there was one. It seems that the director impresses with long pans of table corners and dead black rooms, which do nothing but polish the film. That would be a problem if you actually developed an action and made a movie that had a sense of speed. In this case, however, the rule does not apply. It does not matter how scenes are shot because they do not make a story. <br /> <br /> Watching this video is a pointless exercise at every level. Whatever the people who write it, and even if they try to influence the ratings here on IMDb, that's just a bad, boring stuff. That's the honest truth. If you think about spending your money or your time, think again. It's easy to find something better because you will not find much worse. <br /> <br /> And that's the unbiased, unvarnished truth.
