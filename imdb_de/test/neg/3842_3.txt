Sometimes, when I watch this movie, I think the people who made that movie were drugged. What's up with this movie, I'll tell you Bad Plot, Bad Jokes. Bad acting and flat-out characters are all just bad. <The film is about Pest Vargas, a two-bit cheater who can survive 24 hours from a German hunter who kills humans for a living. So Pest has to think about how to do this. I think this hunter is dead before he dies. I know what you think, "What the hell is this?" Another would-be Ace Ventura trying to get money. This conspiracy is just boring and confusing. Sometimes the plot changes and you lose yourself during the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the funny scenes this movie had? straight face oh yeah I smiled a few times, but nothing laughs out loud. Besides, the jokes are crazy and seen before Ace Ventura encounters Dumb and Dumber, but bad. <br /> <br /> As far as character development is concerned, you do not learn much about the main character, Pest. Everything you know is an annoying cheater, but that's what it is, if he does not change his image or is a little smart, just stupid. What a German hunter you are that he is crazy and wants to return to Germany. Actually, one wonders why this guy lives on an island when he has money to go to Germany. The hunter's son is better, but not much. He is really a coward and is snake-obsessed for reasons in the end. He stands up to his father and faces Pest. <br /> <br /> As for acting, no o Never had any memorable perforations, but only exaggerated. John Legizomo, for example, is superior in exaggerated performance and does not fit into his role. It's not the right place for Jeffery Jones, who plays the same hunter game, but a stereotypical performance, as well as the rest, either simply does not use enough or just exaggerates. <br /> <br /> Overall, a bad comedy that you can find for $ 2.00 at K-Mart.
