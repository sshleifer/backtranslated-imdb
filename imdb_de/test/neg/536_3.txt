This movie stinks mainly. The only reason I awarded a 3 was that the graphics were half charming. It is the total disregard of an action and the absence of even insignificant surface characteristics made it look like a lot of beautiful drawings. This is by far the worse anime that came from Japan. I can not believe that they actually put their name on this trash. What a rip off, selling this thing for $ 20. If you have not seen it yet, do not worry. If so, I feel sorry for you.
