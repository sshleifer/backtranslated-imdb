I just saw that in the cinema. I did not read the books. There is nothing new about this movie. <br /> <br /> the bad guys seem to die with a few slashes no matter how many times our hero was stabbed with a big sword and he always looks the same (ish)! There are several action scenes, but they are very fake. Filmmakers seem to have the impression that if they do not bother to choreograph a fight scene, they just move the camera around, move quickly, and turn up the music ......... get restless again. <br /> <br /> I admire them for trying to tackle a dark plot without the normal Hollywood cheese, but unfortunately I have to say that the filmmakers have failed miserably. The signs are two-dimensional. We barely get to know or feel it at all. The lead role has a charming farmer accent oo arrr ..... though it does not seem like he has much to say ... <br /> <br /> You should not bother to see it, be it because, you are bored and got half of it price from blockbusters ....
