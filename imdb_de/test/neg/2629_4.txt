Four elementary school girls testify to the murder of one of their classmates during what they considered an innocent game. The killer is a strange boy named Milo Jeeder. Sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event reunite under happier circumstances in the same city in which they took place. They believe that Milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder, but soon they learn that the demon killer Milo has returned, still a small boy who has remained unchanged for nearly two decades. <br /> <br /> The cover for this movie makes it really cool (but still I expected it to be a bad movie). When I insert the DVD into my player, the menu appears and still makes the movie look cool. Unfortunately, this movie is not everything I was looking forward to. The film is your average attempt at a Slasher movie, and when I say average, I mean just like all the other Slasher movies on a budget that most members of the horror community never received with open arms (I'm talking about You, the horror fan, in other words, you could go to any horror fan and most of the answers would be "this sucks." <br /> <br /> What mistakes did the movie make? First, the DVD cover art really leaves Milo dark but they do it all by showing their faces in the movie in many different scenes, he has the potential to be a very crazy character, and second, on the back of the cover artwork, Freddy, Jason, Chucky, etc., are said to be to pack their bags and move on, because Milo is so much better ... why would you say something like that when it comes to a no-budget low-budget Slasher movie that has obviously failed? I mean, it only increases your adult the film and makes it harder to impress you. In a last attempt to attract attention, it says (in very large letters) "From the Creator of Anaconda". Show you just how little they get as much attention for the movie as possible. <br /> <br /> The blood in the movie is shitty, the director gives you some vile angles when Milo attacks someone. The music is not so bad and I never fell asleep during the movie (congratulations). I'm still trying to figure out what Milo really is. My best bet would be that he is a zombie, if anyone knows, tell me. Rest assured, I will not lose sleep when I think about it.
