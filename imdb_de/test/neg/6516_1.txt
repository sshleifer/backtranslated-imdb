If you've never read the book and do not intend to read it in the future, watch the movie (6/10). It's a beautiful fantasy movie with well-made CGI, nice acting, a beautiful environment and an above-average fantasy story. <br /> <br /> If you've read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it Do not expect too much (or better: do not expect anything at all). The story is completely different from the original book. This might explain that the film is judged 1/10 and better by people around 40 or over (like me) who have most likely never read the book and therefore expect nothing. <br /> <br /> Differences between film and book are not necessarily necessary and change the setting (in my opinion very disadvantageous): <br /> <br /> - The magic of the book works with rituals for classic magical effects. (Change weather, create illusions, turn into animals, ...) In film, magic is more like "Jedi School for the Middle Ages" (TM) (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). That the devil looks like Emperor Palpatine (according to Part III) does not really make it any better. <br /> <br /> - The mill in this book is not completely cut off like in the movie. In the book, the story takes place near Dresden, which Krabat once visited with his master, and he also visits some nearby villages for festivities. (This part may have been changed to reduce costs.) I also do not understand why the mill in the movie is in the hills, while the nearby cemetery is in the high mountains. <br /> <br /> - The whole environment is the average run of the medieval fantasy style of the mill. Mud everywhere, dirty faces, no proper kitchen, only very rough houses. The book has never suggested such an environment. <br /> <br /> - In the book, Master tries to make Krabat his successor, but Krabat refuses. Krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the film, Krabat always rejects Teacher like a stubborn student. <br /> <br /> - The movie takes place in 1647 instead of around 1720. This makes it impossible for Master to tell some stories from his youth 170x. OK, the stories are missing in the movie anyway. <br /> <br /> Also a few explanations in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so many minutes: <br /> <br /> - In the book The day's work is effortless and the work at night is like normal work. This explanation is missing in the film. Sometimes the boys sweat and sometimes they are happy. <br /> <br /> - The book explains why few 'journeymen' try to confront Master: if Master dies for some banal reason, the 'journeymen' are free AND retain their magical powers. If Master dies in the confrontation, all will lose their power forever.
