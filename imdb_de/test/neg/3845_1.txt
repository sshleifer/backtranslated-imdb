This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I have to admit that I did not see it from beginning to end, as cleaning the toilet was more fun. <br /> <br /> The "star" was the most unpleasant character I've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive. In fact, scary and disgusting things are far too complementary. <br /> <br /> It's painful to look at, there's no acting, especially not from the star, who acts like a dumped, mentally deficient take on one of those loud noises, black actors with their mouths. <br /> <br /> As horrible as it may be, if one of them can not silence black actors, it's even worse to see a Puerto Rican one. <br /> <br /> The name of the movie is descriptive, it's the pest. This movie is a must.
