This is a fact that this is the first Saudi movie to be shown in movie theaters, but not in Saudi Arabia. For a simple reason, we have no cinemas in our big kingdom. Not just a movie theater! The government banned the opening of cinemas after Islamic extremists OR the religious police (or both) demanded closure in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They accused the seventh art of promoting false sexual relationships and such things. There is no reason why we do not open cinemas !! We have a lot of video stores all over the kingdom, we watch movies from some satellite channels on TV, we can install the "Showtime" channels and finally movies in general look harmless in neighboring countries just to watch a few movies .. Me personally visited Bahrain several times just to watch movies in the cinemas, because watching there is a lot of fun, unlike a movie house. Saudis pay the most expensive movie ticket in the world, we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world has a movie theater in every city. This is one of the problems we have !! .. <br /> <br /> The film is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment, a major company owned by the Saudi tycoon prince Alwaleed Bin Talal (the 8th richest man in the world). <br /> <br /> The title of the film is a word that literally means "How are you?" but it's also a slang meaning "what's going on!", sometimes used as slang to say "bad" about something, and sometimes it's used as slang to politely tell someone to take care of his business and Do not interfere in the affairs of others. Anyway, I think they meant (how are you) & (what's going on!) At the same time I might be wrong too. <br /> <br /> Male actors are from Saudi Arabia like Hisham Abdulrahman, who is very famous After winning the first prize in the Arab real estate show more like "American Idol", he has some popularity, he works in some TV Programs like the Arabic version of Cash Taxi. The other famous actor is Khaled Sami, who is funny and very good sense of humor .. other actors like Mishal Al-Mutairi, Turki Al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less famous and work in some TV series. Female actresses are not Saudis and they did a great job in speaking the Saudi accent. The Jordanian actress Corn Hamdan in the lead role and the emeriti actress Fatima Al-Hawsani .. not that we do not have any Saudi actresses, but there are only a few well. <br /> <br /> A Saudi critic, Rja Al-Mutairi, who writes for Alriyadh Newspaper (the Kingdom's most popular newspaper), wrote: "Does not expect much from the first Saudi feature film Therefore, we can not judge him as usual under the usual standards, it is a fact that on his first opening days, the film only achieved tremendous financial success in the Kingdom of Bahrain, it is about a Saudi family dealing with controversial new ones Issues within Saudi society are concerned: women driving, flat thoughts about the arts, the guardianship of society by a particular group and the differences between conservative and conservative behavior Extremist: The ideas are good, but you feel right in the middle One of the movie's benefits is the beautiful musical score by Rajeh Dawood, which was good, but sometimes does not agree with what you see in the picture. Turki Al-Yusuf has done a great job. His performance was the best in addition to corn Hamdan. The biggest loser is the lead actor Hisham Abdulrahman, who is behind the supporting actors Mishal al-Mutairi, Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami, who played a role in their role well. <br /> <br /> at least "Keif al-hal?" Despite all its drawbacks, it's still an OK movie and it's a very good first step from Rotana .. and the film has been talked about by people and streets, which is a golden goal, a strong debate within Saudi society about films in general to lead them until they become aware of the importance of the 7th arts and other arts "<br /> <br /> PS: There is another Saudi filmmaker," Abdullah Almohaisen, "who claims to have titled the first Saudi film "Shadows of Silence" staged. <br /> I have not seen the movie yet, I hope I was helpful.
