A wasted effort. On the surface, it is a typical catastrophe film: we are involved in the lives of some people who are interested in the big event. However, the script is so dreadful and there are so many explanations about the background of the characters within the dialogue that we feel we are treated like idiots. Even Sesame Street did not explain the origins of Mr. Snuffleupagus nor the death of Mr. Hooper: we can find out. Someone thought that typing 'Enron' into the script would make money in the discussion about electricity companies. Acting is mild on the whole, except for the older performers (Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy), and after the first hour I could not care less about who the storms were. But maybe there are the special effects to see. Sadly no. Even on a 20-year-old television I could see that a tractor and a trailer were poorly generated by the computer. Maybe there are budget restrictions, so I can forgive them. The footage of an airplane trying to land looked pretty real, but I kept telling myself I'd seen it before. This page confirms it: It was from an earlier movie, Nowhere to Land. <br /> <br /> So in summary, the only good parts from another movie, and when you look at the best action sequences for a 30 second network promo, Category 6 does look pretty good. My advice: rely on your network to make good 30-second clips, look at them and save two nights.
