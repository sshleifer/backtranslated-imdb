I'm shocked to see that this movie has been awarded more than two stars by some people. They must either be joking or completely blind to the art of acting, directing and other shortcomings of the film. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I just could not force myself to go through the whole movie just too bad. <br /> <br /> The first three characters who did not include the "Digger" were terrible actors, and I mean, WONDERFUL! Maybe the director did not care, or he's a worse director. It was like a bad school game. The film was of course filmed with a video camera (low budget - not a real movie), and the lighting settings were not very good. Also, the soundman (if he had one) must have been either a freshman or a drunk, since the sound was amateurish. Even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen (AWFUL, acting by the way), the tone from the dialogue was pretty bad. For example, when the woman moved her head while speaking, her voice disappeared and returned. It sounded like they were trying to correct that in post-production by raising the volume slightly when she turned her head. There was also the constant, disturbing hum of camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> All those squeaks in the first 5 minutes or so. Do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> A good school project or a fun project for friends, but not for a real audience, especially not for a paying audience. THIS WAS A RIP OFF, unless you have a very low standard in terms of movies or just bad taste. They are WARNING! SB.
