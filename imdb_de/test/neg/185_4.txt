Do not get me wrong. I really love the "arena martial arts genre" and I'm more and more surprised how many movies there are here. This is one of them, and it is not even close to being one of the best. With Mathias Hues, I thought it was good. He can not save this movie, though, and honestly, he was not that good either. Just do not pay attention to what other people say; The fight scenes in this movie are not good at all. I really know what I've been talking about since watching so many movies. There are also a number of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the storyline. I guess they just added them to make the movie take longer, in addition to manifesting the evil as being.
