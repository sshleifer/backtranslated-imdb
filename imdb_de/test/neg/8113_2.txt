A traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton) stumble into the city of Gatlin, where children have slaughtered the adults and are always anxious to slaughter more while they are separated, and of course Peter Horton must save his wife from these troubles terrible minds in this very bad adaptation of one of King's best short stories. In the original story, King has managed to create suspense and draw the personality of his characters. All this, however, has been a repetitive bore, far too predictable, for the production and everything that remains, to be so exciting. Also, the effective ending used in the story is rejected in favor of a happy ending, which mutes the overall effect. There is some atmosphere and stylish direction, but no plot to support it. The children are sad not convincing. <br /> <br /> 1/5 Matt Bronson
