A terrible mish-mash of predictable storylines and toe-twisting arms provided PC clich√©s ad nauseam (races that work together, the heroine is smart and also pretty, a man who sacrifices himself to save another life, a father-daughter Relationship, etc.) The movie looks like something created for network television, and probably should have stayed there. Even the gifted Tommy Lee Jones can not save this bomb. I urge you to waste neither time nor money on this cinematic ruin when disaster films roamed Hollywood. The two stars are made available exclusively to the CGI people and PR people. Get even a movie viewer through.
