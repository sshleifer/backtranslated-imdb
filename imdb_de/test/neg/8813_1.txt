This was the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the author and director did not see that almost the entire movie looks like an SF movie. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> 1. It is impossible for the killer to stay on a cold glaze and get up so quickly after 10 hours. <br /> <br /> 2. You can not get electric shock like a movie through a water pipe (believe me, that's my domain). <br /> <br /> 3. With a saw, you can very easily cut 10 tubes in 10 hours. Suppose the chain was made of steel, but the water pipe was rusty and it was made of iron. <br /> <br /> 4. If you try to cut your foot with a saw that faints you (in the best case, you die because your heart is failing) before you reach the bones (shin) others examples.
