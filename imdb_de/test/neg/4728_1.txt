This is not the true story. It is the darkest possible fiction derived from the events. She advocates suicide, the boring obsession with death, a totally vain wipe on organized religion in general (and especially the Anglican Church in particular), and generally offers a nihilistic, meaningless worldview that movie goers should probably be richer in Poverty and more hopeful in her hopelessness. <br /> <br /> Utter garbage, though attractively executed by a capable cast. However, claiming that this is a true rendering is very wrong advertising. You want the true story? Rent 'fairy tales'. That's the true story. Check that you can find a match between the facts presented in both cases. I only found one thing: the girls who took the original pictures were in puberty.
