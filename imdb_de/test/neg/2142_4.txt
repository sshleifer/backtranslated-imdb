If I rated this movie solely for drama / script / production, etc., I would give it a star. All these elements are terrible. I can forgive this partly against the background of the $ 250 budget of the film. The film contains many entertaining scenes, mostly the unintentionally funny. Some of them are: a 14-year-old kid who steals a bus and drives a bus, teenage hooligans (one of whom wears a Joy Division T-shirt), who is scared to scold the movie's protagonists about a woman who wears an obviously wrong weapon and encounters a plastic bull skull in the Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would have rated it just for the 5-star entertainment value, if it had not been for that terribly annoying, morally pontificating old granny. I just had to dock a star because of her. Who is going to * make * a wedding cake with black icing anyway?
