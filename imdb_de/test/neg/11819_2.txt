And you are right. Black Mama, White Mama, also called "Women in Chains", is exactly the kind of trashy and shitty B-movie that suggests the premise. Pam Grier was thrown into a jail on a small island with many other women, and this place makes the summer camp, where Martha Stewart is currently detained, seriously look like a prison with maximum security. It's not five minutes after the movie that one of the hot hotties uttered the line "Strip 'em" and "getting wet", and then we're introduced to a prison life that resembles the imagination of a college freshman who is the interior of one Dorm resembling is like. <br /> <br /> The prisoners soap and rub themselves and wrestle with each other in the shower as if it were a Girls Gone Wild shoot, then they all hang out in their dormitory, smoking the kettle openly and discussing in a large group What it would do would be the best ways to escape. I have never been in prison myself, but I feel that escape plans are the kind of thing few people should know about, prisoners or guards or anything else. The biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy studies is that the women in this movie wear all the orange cardigans (and no pants) on which PRISON stands. These must be the typical jail prison outfits that can not afford expensive accessories like the prison name or the number of prisoners for their uniforms. <br /> <br /> And as expected, a jail that can not afford The identification of the prisoners on the backs of the uniforms obviously can not wait to find guards who are as interested in guarding the prisoners as they are Sex with the prisoners and with each other. <br /> <br /> The Conflict The title of the film refers to the fact that Lee Daniels (Pam Grier) is tied up most of the time with a blonde prisoner named Karen while fleeing from the police after her escape are out of jail. I'm not going to go into details of how they're going, except to say that you may have seen something similar in The Fugitive when they could not afford to stage a train accident, and that leads to the confused history of competing interests who also hunt down these two women for different reasons. Karen and Lee both have their own group of people hoping to rescue their captive prisoner, and the cops are after them all the time. <br /> <br /> (Corruptor) So Karen is involved with a bunch of hippies who want to revolutionize life as they know it. In the meantime, Karen just wants to get off the island, something she's been trying for years, and not only is it perfect that everyone has to go to the other side of the island to reach their goals. So we get a few couples, and since it's a weird couple, it's not hard to predict that they'll hate each other for the vast majority of the movie, but in the end, they'll love each other more and more. <br /> <br In a movie with so many conflicting interests, especially when these opposing interests not only drive the two main characters in opposite directions when pursuing their goals, it is not unreasonable to expect it to be a climax of the rival gangs will give sometime in the movie. Not wanting to leave anybody dissatisfied, at the end of the film they throw up a stupid gang in which each machine gun shoots at each other and kills each other while the two women paddle safely and quietly across the river in a small boat. Kind. Even better: At the end of the film, after a huge massacre that shoots many people and shoots bright red paint all over the place, the captain watches the mass criminals of dead criminals covered with terrible, horrible special effects, and we learn that he will be major before dinner. It's not a bad way to end the movie. The criminals are killing each other and the police gets all the loans, but here's the last line of the movie? "It's better to win, right?" <br /> <br /> Will the Captain be promoted to Major? Because he found out ???
