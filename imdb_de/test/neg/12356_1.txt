SPOILER ALERT. <br /> <br /> This movie will spoil your afternoon or "little morning hours" viewing playground. <br /> <br /> I like Marc Singer. He has portrayed good characters in the roles I've seen. Until this movie. <br /> <br /> What starts as a promising movie soon disappears with the catastrophic background and extreme close-up of the person who is going to die ... <br /> <br /> Then things will get worse. <br /> <br /> Much worse. <br /> <br /> To describe it as a hammam would offend pigs. This film goes to the end of the ham barrel and scratching the acting there. <br /> <br /> Apart from Marc Singers overcooked hammering, Mike Dopud stomps through the countryside looking as though he might fear falling onto the rocks, and his big-eyed evil guy just makes him look like an idiot , He is not threatening at all. <br /> <br /> George Stults looks like a deer in the spotlight. He claims to have been threatened by the other two, but his character would have been threatened by a cashier who offered him "paper or plastic." <br /> <br /> This is really a vehicle for Nicole Eggert as an independent woman who caught her life back even though the wrong man was dressed ... she was unremarkable. <br /> <br /> This is not a remake, but it is remarkably similar to "Cliffhanger" - an experienced guide who loses someone in a fall, who has a conscience to help someone else, a missing treasure, a valuable money is, and a gang of N'er-do-wells exploiting the leader. Except Cliffhanger was a great vehicle for Stallone and Lithgow. I have to admit, Lithgow stole the show. <br /> <br /> Even the unwanted comedy was bad. There were times when I was not sure if they used a rubber-faced model to replace Singer when he tried in vain to storm the weather station (no pun intended). Pushing his face against the jamb and his awkward nature generally did not help his character. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> No, seriously, avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something more constructive. For example, if you see the paint dry or grass grow. Or just close your eyes and examine the back of your eyelids for 90 minutes ...
