Another movie with a wrestling star. So far, I've noticed that wrestlers can not move on the movie screen. This movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> The action is terrible. It makes you laugh at what they say, and they can not be serious, they try to look scared, but they fail and look stupid. Acting is awful, possibly from the bad director. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy was stupid ... Only some people are taken to a hotel because they are criminals, and they are indiscriminately killed. The movie is stupid through and through, making it one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I just think, and that's why I give him a 3 and not a 1, is due to Jacob Good night dies. The pole through the head and the stories in which he was overthrown were fantastic. Overall, this is a really horrible movie and you should not waste your time on it.
