What a horrible movie! The acting in this film is about the quality of a high school or story porn. This is not pornography in this movie, but there are certainly a lot of nudity! This is one of the only redeeming qualities of the movie, one of the few things that has kept it from getting a rating for a star. There are also a million policemen who die in this film. Barely offensive, since the violence is so unrealistic, we can only laugh. But breasts appear and are unmasked in the most surprising and funniest times. If you really enjoy very bad movies, look at this. This is a story of Bonnie and Clyde, in which a mother and her two daughters take revenge. This movie also shows a sex scene with two of the oldest people I've seen naked!
