Yes, life has a habit of making the male species look stupid. And this soap opera is no joke when it gets Perry King, a supposedly respected doctor, not to see the evil around him. Do you trust with doctors? How can someone not see what's going on? Is he that stupid? And the evil woman with a face like a horse walks around killing his entire family without any trace. How does she get all the medication? That is not explained. How does she end up as a secretary in a hospital without evidence? I think the director, Don FauntLeRoy, is asking us to believe it. I have not kept yelling at the screen over the stupidity of King, all right in front of his face. If the woman were so attractive, maybe I would accept it. But she is not even. Shannon Sturges is the perfect woman and I tell you that she has the face of a horse. I would not cross the street, but our perfect husband does it fast and fast. After all the cast was knocked off, I was not happy with the pence our villainy gave. She earned more than she got. William Moses plays the brother of the doctor, whom you unfortunately know from day one. Joy, at least to see a pretty face in this clinker. That of Lesley Anne Down. She gives the movie a 2-point, just to see the relief of seeing someone in this mess. Perry King had earned his fate. What an idiot.
