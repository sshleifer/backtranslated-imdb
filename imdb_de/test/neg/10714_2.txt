Maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe the one who managed to reach a 7 has a soft spot for kids with AIDS. But really people, the crazy laughter during the withdrawal scene? Did not you see that coming? I am surprised that there was no baby crawling over the blanket and the Sickboy addressed the camera. The acting was good, for sure. But for me, this is just one example of a film from a time when film language situations and themes could go through. Things happen, but that's about it. There is no glue or motif that can be recognized on the screen, so the subject can use existing emotional connections to advance the plot without the script doing it the way it should.
