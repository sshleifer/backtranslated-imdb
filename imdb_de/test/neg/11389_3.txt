***** spoiler or two, that's not a thing ****** <br /> <br /> Two things characterize this movie. Firstly, it's both "Bruno" and "The Dress Code" and once you've seen this movie, you'll feel the irony in it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it's about problems that go completely off the wall. The adventures of a crossdresser at elementary school were not something one wanted to scream a movie about, nor an issue that most people would be interested in. Shirley MacLaine manages to circumvent the issues of gender by linking Bruno's desire to wear a dress for religion, which will probably open an even thicker box of worms - what did she think? <br /> <br /> Yes, there is some humor and it is not directly offensive, but the disturbing feeling at the beginning is getting bigger. It does not do much to reiterate the liberal mantra that "other" people should be accepted (or perhaps excepted?), No matter what. <br /> <br /> Which is fine - but for people to be able to live in a society, everyone has to do something to get along. Bruno does not just want to wear a dress, he wants to look like a miniature Gladys Knight on the night of the awards, and his graduation costume makes him look like a Cabbage Patch Cowgirl Doll. But all the other children dress and behave like normal children. What is there? When it came down to it, we could all declare ourselves something special or different and behave the way we felt, and the result would be total chaos. <br /> <br /> This acceptance of "dissenters" is also quite narrowly defined. I doubt we'll ever see a movie about a kid who finds his true self and wears overalls, chases geese and wants to leave Tractor pulls and demands that everyone else accept him as he is. "Bruno" is a stupid movie and a complete waste of time.
