I think I can see why critics give this movie two out of five stars, that's not fantastic, but I think it's worth a look, by director Shawn Levy (Cheaper in the Dozen, Night at the Museum). Basically, 14-year-old Jason Shepherd lies to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he does not do his creative writing, he will fail his entire semester and must repeat the summer grade , He ends his work, but is taken away by Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who beat him on the way to school. He brings his newspaper with the story "Big Fat Liar" in the car. He finds out from a movie trailer that Marty has stolen his newspaper and turns it into a big movie. He and his best friend Kaylee (they are the Amanda Bynes of Man) are on a mission to prove that Jason once said the truth. Marty, of course, is too angry and too complacent to call Jason's father, Harry (Michael Bryan French), and he burns the "Big Fat Liar" paper. Now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as hellish as possible until he agrees to call Jason's dad. They dyed blue paint into his swimming pool and orange hair dye into his shampoo, and many more naughty pranks that made Chaos a mess for Marty's career. There's the obvious point when Jason looks like he's giving up, but do not worry. All the characters who despise Marty help with the last surgery, and when Jason's parents come, he finally wants to prove his truthfulness, and the boy does it. He delivers great style. With Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham, Lee Majors as Vince, Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson, Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan, Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pies John Cho as Dustin 'Dusty' Wong. Muniz is personable, Byrnes proves a surprisingly talented support, and although Giamatti wastes his time and talent a little, he's great at being evil. It's a children's movie, so if it seems trite, cheesy or predictable, just think about it and try to enjoy the performances and slapstick. OK!
