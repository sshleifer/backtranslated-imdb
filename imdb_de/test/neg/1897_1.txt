God, I hated this movie! I saw it 13 years ago in a preview, and I still have bad flashbacks. It was without a doubt the worst movie I ever paid. It was badly written, misdirected and (surprisingly given the cast) badly traded. I would rather be thrown from a roof onto razor-sharp spines and then my skin peeled off than to assert myself again. Can you imagine that I did not enjoy it?
