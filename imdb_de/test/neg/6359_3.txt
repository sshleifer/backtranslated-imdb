Unfortunately, this movie is not very good. But is it really important? We all know the basics of the story, and that has nothing new. But I love low horror and sci-fic camp classics ... so I forgive this one. The only thing anyone remembers from this movie is that little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in it. <br /> <br /> He did OK. The part did not demand great acting skills, and the direction probably never gave him a chance anyway ... Little Leonardo DiCaprio was very sweet ... and also the girl. The movie is fun if you like Horror & Sci Camp classics and have experience in seeing them.
