If you are ahead of a movie, you know that you are wasting your time watching the movie in question. That's exactly how I felt when I saw "Darkness". I could anticipate every turn and turn it easily. It is a combination of "The Amityville Horror" and a variety of films that deal with occult. It's so stupid that I almost loved his naivety. I can not say that I was totally bored, but I found the movie far too declined for my liking. Director Balaguer√≥ tries to repeat his early Spanish hit "The Nameless", but he can not do it. I admit, a few sequences were scary enough, but I just hate it when I figure out what's going to happen next. I also hated watching good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini sweat over this damn thing. Finally Anna Paquin as the star of a horror movie? That must be a joke. She's cute, but she's one of those good kid actors who have become a very monotonous adult actor. You can live without seeing this.
