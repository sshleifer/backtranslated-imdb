Who fights with monsters, could ensure that he becomes a monster. And if you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you. Yes, that's from Nietzsche's Aphorism 146 of "Beyond Good and Evil". And you'll find that at the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you look at the whole movie, you may doubt if it was the message that Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to pass on. While the scenes gradually emerge, quite violent and sometimes puke, the viewer is expected to forget the Nietzsche quote and think otherwise. To cope with a few people, you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe, who are licensed to kill everyone, not just FIRs (something unworthy of the police, we believe). <br /> <br / When TADA was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and more draconian laws, RGV's "Satya" performed the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the growing, multiplex-growing urban mass whose views are in a democratic country like India are of importance. Within a year MCOCA was passed. <br /> <br /> When the encounter of the specialist Daya Nayak became a monster on the way of fighting and was even booked by MCOCA, "Aab tak Chhappan" had to pay attention to "false" impression among the people. "You must be a monster to save your nation". <br /> <br /> And people have consumed it. No questions asked. Only praise and hope that they get a Sadhu Agashe in their local police station, which solves all problems and thus only milk and butter flow. Blood? You can ignore it. <br /> <br /> Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear voices like "India has to attack Pakistan in a similar way". This movie is made for such psychopaths. If you do not give them that, they'll probably die of boredom and LSD and what's not. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this game of passion of hatred.
