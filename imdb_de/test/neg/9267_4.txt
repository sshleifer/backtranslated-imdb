After just opening a cheap pound shop, I thought it was worth looking for inexpensive DVDs that looked good. And while the back of the cover sounds like a Jeepers Creepers movie, it's actually a movie anthology movie! and thought that one or two of the stories felt very familiar. It's still a funny, light horror / comedy. The Acts: <br /> <br /> Story One: The Classic. <br /> <br /> A young couple feels like it's time to make an effort to prove their financial well-being with a car worth $ 1,500. But when the guy is looking for a car, a car starts talking to him. The bann says to get everything he has ever wanted in life, he has to buy Baans for $ 5000 relationship crumbles, Baans does all he can to show who is really in charge. <br /> <br /> Story two: kitchen culture. <br /> <br /> A guy who could be thrown by his landlord. Because of his mess in his apartment, he discovers that the tuna pasta was stored in his refrigerator for six months and turned into a green, moldy version of developed it. And while they start as friends, they end up a big failure leading to a final fight to see if the real guy or his refrigerator clone will survive. <br /> <br /> Story Three: Too good to be true. <br /> <br /> A girl joins a dating agency and she is matched up with her The guy is perfect for her. But she's not sure the guy is too perfect, and when she thinks she sees that he's "shut down," she's starting to get scared. Look at the movie: <br /> <br /> The first thing I have to mention is the rating for the movie in England, where he was rated eighteen, even though he does not have nudity, cursing or blood And the other weird thing about all the stories is that they all have a happy ending, where the goodies win !. And while the first story comes close to the Stephen King classic Christine, the second story is easily the highlight of the film, with director Tom Parkinson, who brings the nutshell of the story to feel like a Muppets episode on a low budget! <br /> <br /> Final view of the movie <br /> <br /> While it has a bit 'remake; Feel they are crazy enough to turn it into a good horror comedy.
