I rented it by mistake. I picked up the video and looked at the back and thought "shameless Blair Witch rip-off". Then, in a moment of carelessness, I grabbed 'The Francisville Experiment' and thought it was something else. My horror, when I came home and realized that my mistake was wrong, was anything but anything that this movie had to offer. Boring characters, bad acting and the feeling that "we've seen the Blair Witch Project and could do the same thing" permeate the action to the point where you can get straight to the credits with the fast-forward. I am not to blame for filmmakers because they are lazy or desperate, but after this yawning feast I felt the need to warn everyone: do not waste your time, you have a life.
