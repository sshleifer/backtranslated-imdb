Whenever someone tries to tell me that a movie is the worst one (and usually it's a movie that's "cool" to hate, like "Manos, the Hands of Fate" or "The Avengers"), I ask she, "this is it movie A comedy about an orphan who's constantly trying to murder adults? Anybody talking the line 'I'd rather eat a shit' in this movie?" <br /> <br /> This movie is too much childish and feeble-minded adults and way too violent and irresponsible for children. Is there so much money in Beavis and Butt-Head demographics to make a series of such films? There is a problem child 3, but I have not seen it. I would rather eat a shit.
