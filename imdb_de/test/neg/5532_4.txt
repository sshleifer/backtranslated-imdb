This is a very interesting acquaintance! "Two-fisted tales" contains three stupid and childish episodes - genre is not really horror or action, rather something in between. Where is the suspence? Where is the fun? Where is common sense? Definitely not here, but if you do not expect to get it, you will not necessarily miss it. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called "Showdown". It's a violent, absurd west. I did not understand the whole idea. "King of the Road" is a stupid story with Brad Pitt. At the time of "Two-Fisted Tales," he was just a pretty face that really did not know how to act. Fortunately, he later learned the skill and is now a fantastic, talented actor - one of the great younger generation. The story is almost ok in its stupidity. The last episode "Yellow" is the only segment that is almost completely successful. It is stupid but funny. We have to thank Kirk Douglas for that. <br /> <br /> This movie is something to see when you sit in a chair and eat popcorn. (I should know, that's what I did.) If you loved "tomb stories," you'll love "two-fist stories," because it's basically the same thing. I understand that these three episodes are actually an extremely rare "work of art" and hard to find everywhere. I have the entire package for VHS, but I do not think it's a big privilege. You have to be a fanatical Brad Pitt fan to find out. Otherwise, do not bother, it's not worth it. Stupid crap.
