To be honest, this movie is one of the best movies ever ... if you suffer from insomnia. It's a foolproof way to guarantee hours of sleep. As the movie progresses slowly, the audience enters a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses any kind of storyline that the movie could actually contain. This effect is certainly due to the lack of sweet action / sweet babes. <br /> <br /> Mr Eisenstein obviously was not in a position to master the assembly art either. A prime example of this is the scene on the steps of Odessa. For no apparent reason, an event that would take just a few seconds in real life turns into a seven-minute nightmare for every healthy person. This editing error affects every realism throughout the movie. Honestly, I have seen more realistic arrangements that have seen cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some people who have commented on this title have called Battleship Potemkin "one of the best films of all time" and "a true masterpiece". "Well, I am writing this comment to the readers My best guess is that my Potemkin critics have just written the wrong words in their summaries, and what they meant by that was certainly "one of the biggest snooze festivals of all time". and "Really an Epic Failure." <br /> <br /> Finally, do not waste your time, if you're looking for a movie of far superior quality visit www.youtube.com and watch a Halo 3 montage If I were to play the Battleship Potemkin movie Guardian in a game of Slayer, I'd shoot him in the face with my sniper rifle and then put the body in a teabag.
