Some of the early talkies survived to become classics. "The Squall" from 1929 is a classic, but not as it was intended. Melodramatic in history and acting, it seems ridiculous today, especially the cast of Myrna Loy as Nubi, a seductive gypsy. Imagine that Nora Charles would dissolve a young couple and steal a young man. Outrageous! As many know, when Loy came to Hollywood for the first time, she played some of these exotic temptresses. <br /> <br /> Based on a play, "The Squall" concerns the aforementioned Gypsy, who plays in the film, has now fled from her cruel master in Hungary (Spain in a play) and invites to the home of the Lajos family (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce), essentially by appearing at the door. One by one, Nubi seduces the men of the family and the farm who speak their pidgin English ("Nubi not bad! Nubi does not do anything wrong!") And gives hints of nice gifts. The son of the family, Paul (Carroll Nye), is betrothed to the beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and can not wait to marry her. He loses interest when he meets Nubi. <br /> <br /> With the exception of lovely Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts living in the household, and stunningly beautiful Loretta Young, acting is equally awful. Loy sticks to her character's hallmarks - bad English, whining and hysteria. With her dark make-up, peasant get-up and curly hair, she is not only beautiful, but from the eighties - quite modern, although Richard Tucker puts the back of his hand on his forehead, reminding us that we only from the Silents show up. <Robert Osborne of TCM commented that this film is one of his secret delights. While it's deliciously bad, it's not delicious enough to sit through again. It's just awful - but a great example of how far we've come and if someone did not realize Myrna Loy's sense of humor, how limited her wonderful career might have been.
