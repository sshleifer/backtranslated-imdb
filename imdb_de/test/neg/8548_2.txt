They belong to me (1941) is an example of the "ScrewBall Comedy", which began in the mid-1930s and ended the post-war period. Some of these films retained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when they were originally critical and were Kinoflops. Like raising a baby (1938) or MR. & MRS. Smith (1941). Then there is this, whose value continues to drop. <br /> <br /> Why can the script / story be rooted? It burdens credibility from the beginning and reveals a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to the millionaire HENRY FONDA, who is incredibly jealous. He would be content to sit back with his millions of dollars and love her, she wants to keep her job as a doctor. She wants him to become a useful member of society in what her eyes are. This conflict should amuse us. It can not be saved by either the directors or the minor characters. <br /> <br /> The flaws in this scenario may well be in DALTON TRUMBO's footsteps. The character of HENRY FONDA's is written in such great lines that every viewer has an immediate aversion to him. BARBARA STANWYCK simply has nothing to do but react to any idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO had spent too much time outside the studio to be a "useful idiot" and then be in action. Obviously COLUMBIA was not worth the money, maybe ROBERT RISKIN should take the helm.
