IMDb lists this movie as a comedy. I have no idea which genre this movie is for, but it's certainly not a comedy. Tragedy maybe. I will not say if this is a good movie or not. I only know that it is not a comedy. I wanted to laugh tonight and what I got was a bizarre idea of ​​someone's attachment to an ugly chair. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what is advertised. It's a film school that I can only assume to "make people think". I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know or do not know that I do not know. It's a ridiculous idiot that makes no sense at all. <br /> <br /> It made me think well. I had to think, "I wish I had those ninety minutes of my life back." <br /> <br /> I'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal inclination to their world view. This movie is worth something to be seen. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
