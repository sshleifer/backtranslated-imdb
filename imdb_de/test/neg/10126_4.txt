For a series that was inspired by Kolchak, it is ironic that The X Files should land on the ass at the first attempt of a vampire episode. 3 has always puzzled me, and I've often wondered if I miss the point. The story feels like a jigsaw with pieces that do not fit the box, and the result is that you spend a leisurely evening by the fire trying to hit the sky that is really sea. This incomplete feeling remains regardless of how many times you visit the episode again and how much attention you put on it. I know that through this review, I'm in danger of being pulled by teenage vampires to Whitby, who drink my blood while listening to Busted, but that's a risk I'd like to take. I have always been a werewolf myself.
