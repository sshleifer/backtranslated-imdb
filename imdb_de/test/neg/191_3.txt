I have never heard of this movie when it came out. It must have sunk immediately. : o) I saw it in the hospital when I was sick, so I barely had enough energy to look at it, let alone turn the channel. A better choice than the Style Channel. (0) This travelogue should have been filmed on location, it should have been on the Travel Channel. The property is recycled from ship races of the thirties and forties. The cast seems to come from the fifties. Donald O'Connor, Star of Musicals and Edward Mulhare as a card shark: As for the main cast, does Walter Matthau still play the same role as in Guys and Dolls, or was it the orphan thing? Wiseacre irresponsible player and all-rounder Do not take it with a man of his age. As for Jack Lemmon, he plays his role so straight that he can barely dive and slide while dancing. And as mentioned earlier, Dyan Cannon is extraordinarily attractive as another dodger driving with her mother, who thinks Walter is rich while thinking she is rich. Elaine Stritch plays Dyan's mother, another retread from the fifties. The fun is above all the running feud between Brent Spiner as dominating and snotty cruise director, who immediately discovers Walter as a poor dancer and spends his time trying to fire him, he has to pay for his free passage. In the end, however, he receives his Comeuppances. In the meantime, Jack is wandering around, meeting an attractive woman with mutual attraction, but her affair is resolved by Walter's lying that Jack is a doctor when he was actually a retired department store buyer. But finally, the two men go by inflatable boat to the sea to catch their seaplane, and everything is fine. There does not seem to be a major player under fifty.
