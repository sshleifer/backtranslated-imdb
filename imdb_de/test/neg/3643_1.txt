This is the absolute worst show in the history of Nickelodeon. Above all, no boarding school has a sushi bar, flat screen TVs and every student has a laptop. That makes the show so unrealistic and boring. The actions are meaningless and unbelievably boring. The actors are so bad that I want to kill myself. I really hate the fact that on the show Zoey is the most popular girl in the school, the prettiest and smartest girl and the best grades get out of work. She never has real problems and every guy wants to go out with her. She is so perfect. There is nobody like that. I also hate that everyone would do anything for them and everyone chooses them for each team or club. It's so annoying. Quinn is so abominable. Her experiments are pathetic, pointless and spurious. Chase is such a weakling. He says he loves Zoey, but if he told her, it would ruin her friendship. How pathetic. Michael tries to be funny, but he never does anything. Nichole is so naughty and screams a lot. She is never seen working or studying, but she is a direct student. Lola thinks she is an actress but she sucks (sorry for my language). Do I have to say more? I do not think so. Stay at your own best at any price.
