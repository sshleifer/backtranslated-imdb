Every James Bond movie has its own rules. Like every Indiana Jones movie, ITS has its own rules. And the fact that scriptwriters do not violate these rules preserves the integrity of the characters. With a completely unnecessary room for maneuver, the integrity of the two Ocean movies sinks somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon. <br /> <br /> Imagine what would happen if you hit the rope bridge outside the Temple of Doom. Indy told Shorty and Willie that they would not have to worry because he was down the first secretly possessed super powers in both movies and can bring them both to safety. <br /> <br /> Entertaining? Sure, for a roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would have upset the audience. They'd settled in their seat seats for three hours in Indiana Jones movies, and they were counting on Indiana to get them credibly off the bridge. If he would fly away? People would have gone out of the cinemas just as people did during Ocean's 12. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> 1. Julia Roberts' character, Tess, infiltrates a museum by dressing up as a ... Julia Roberts?!? A clever turn? By breaking the fourth wall three hours after we got to know these characters? Is this the Naked Gun 33 and 1/3? It's a textbook example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire movie. But wait ... just in case you have not gone out yet. <br /> <br /> 2. The tension increases during the last hour of the movie - how are they going to break the robbery - there are only 10 ... 8 ... 5 ... 2 DAYS LEFT! And then, in the last 12 minutes of the movie, the UNIQUE part of the movie, we see that the raid was made a few days earlier and it took Matt Damon every 30 seconds to get it done. The last 10 days A complete waste of your time. <br /> <br /> BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE ROPE ... "Relax, Willie, I stole back the REAL stones a month ago, and I convinced them, Kate Capshaw!" <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, reduce your losses and look at the Polar Express. I do not want to ruin the end for you, but there really is a Santa Claus. Most importantly, you will not feel cheated when you leave the theater.
