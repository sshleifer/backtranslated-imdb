I thought I had seen this movie before, when the plot summary sounded familiar. However, when I saw it one afternoon (I needed a mindless but amusing conversation), I did not recognize anything - if I had seen it before, I must have blocked the horror of it from my memory. > <br /> This movie is awful and shows its age. In fact, it looks older than it is: more like a comic comedy from the 80s. While I'm a fan of toilet humor and can see the funny side of many things, this is "comedy" of their most puerilsten and homophobic side. The plot is as thin as a supermodel, which would not bother me if only the movie were funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one amusing line in the entire movie spoken by the character Louis: "Looks like someone threw away a perfectly good white boy!" Indeed, Louis is the only sympathetic character ( and that does not say much). James and Carl are the kind of irritating, immature men a sensible woman would run a mile in front of, and their practical jokes were as funny as the war in Iraq. The character of Susan Wilkins is colorless (looks like Julia Roberts, but she lacks her charisma) and between her and Carl there is zero chemistry - though it may be unfair to blame the actress, as I do not know what she would do with it can do such a badly written part; and the villain is neither funny nor scary or memorable. <br /> <br /> There is good garbage and bad garbage. This is garbage that definitely should not be recycled.
