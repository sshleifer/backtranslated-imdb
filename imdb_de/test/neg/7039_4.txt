Weak story of a wicked warlock looking for a centuries-old satanic bible to execute Lucifer's command by reversing creation. Going all the way is a 17th-century bounty hunter named Redfern and his reluctant buddy, Kassandra. Sounds like a load of Bunkum? It is. <br /> <br /> This vehicle by writer D.T.Twohy receives the superficial treatment it deserves from director Steve Miner (who helped this romantic nonsense "Forever Young"). Twohy obviously does not know anything about real evil. Julian Sands just flies around and giggles and tries to look evil, while Richard E. Grant only manages to waste his rich talent. Lori Singer's career has also made a dive with this one. <br /> <br /> The special effects crew is having fun, and Jerry Goldsmith delivers a score that's superior to his subject.
