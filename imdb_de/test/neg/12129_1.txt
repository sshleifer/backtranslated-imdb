John Waters owes me back two hours of my life. I saw a preview of this preview in 1990, and I'm still in pain. Not before or since then have I seen such a terrible movie waste on the screen. I can not say anything positive about this film. Drama - terrible; Action - ridiculous; Music - cruel. After the movie, my friends and I reclaimed our money from the theater manager. He explained that because it was a free screening, he could not give us back, no matter how much grief we went through. How Johnny Depp's career survived this train wreck of a film, one can only guess.
