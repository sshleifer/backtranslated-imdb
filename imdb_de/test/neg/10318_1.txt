I do not know how this DVD was included in my collection - my wife suggested it was one of those "3 for 20 €" deals in a street shop. The thing is not worth 66p, let alone £ 6.66! After investing a lot, I felt obliged to watch it through to the end, just to make sure it was just as bad the whole way - and it was. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was awful, the story line was impenetrable (I still do not understand what the hell was going on even though I had read the abstract), the camera work was incoherent and hopeless, the acting was wooden (not supported by the dialogue) In fact, there were no salvation traits - no, not even the lovely Sandra Bullock, on whose glittering later career this heap of slag was likely sold. She should get her agent to buy all their rights and then bury them as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> As a last amusing example of the director's inability, there was a scene in which the young lead entertained with his father's ex-army buddy while driving. This was the clearest dialogue in the film - no engine noise! I'm looking forward to engine-damping technology finding its way across the pond into British cars.
