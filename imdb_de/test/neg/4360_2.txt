That does not say much. This Killjoy movie has a better cinematography and looks more professional than the last one. That does not mean it sounds more professional. This horrible final movie was about gangsters killing a child and being followed by a voodoo clown. I thought the guy who played Killjoy in the last part is a bad actor, but wow !!! This Killjoy is really the worst actor I've seen in any movie and I've seen a lot of movies. In the last movie, the clown came in about 15 minutes, this is shorter and the clown comes in after 40 minutes, and he is only 65 minutes long !!! I give a 2 because the acting of some characters is OK.
