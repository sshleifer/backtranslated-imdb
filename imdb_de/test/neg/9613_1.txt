"Frenzy", which was greeted with ridicule by most critics at its first appearance, has recently made the rounds of British television. I remember, as he had seen it in his original release, and thought back then that if Hitchcock wanted to make a kind of screen confession about his deep-rooted fallacies, he would not have found a nasty little vehicle to do that. <br /> <br /> But time is changing the perspective, and what was disgustingly bad in 1972 could be worthy of a revaluation all those years later. <br /> <br /> Could. , , but not. "Rage" is slag. The sink of an aging director desperate to exploit the artistic freedom of filmmaking in the 1970s without realizing that freedom imposes its own obligations - above all, the need to give integrity to its work. <br /> <br /> There is no one here. And not much evidence for the former directorial brilliance - the change from stinging implied to vile expressions is neither shocking nor stylish for a stylist: It's just banal (the long-running murder scene is just that: tedious, without reason and without another Purpose as the cheapest director's desire to appear as a contemporary artist, such as the other recognized practitioner of cheap Sleaze, Michael Winner). <br /> <br /> And it goes from bad to worse worse, with a dialogue that defies any human origin (not least the ridiculous distraction in the domestic life of our dear wood inspector and the cooking of his wife). <br /> <br /> Maybe the scene that summarizes 'Frenzy' best. (and proving to be the most explicit charge against Hitchcock's person) is the rickety exchange between two lawyers in a bar discussing serial murders and agreeing that at least the women at first had a good time raping them. I remember to my abhorrence of This '72 scene, and it's still blunt because Hitchcock was not smart or sardonic or trying to formulate a universal point of view (big issues, big truths were neither Hitchcock's strength nor personal preference.) Only Hitchcock, who allows a reflection of his own distorted mirror on life to shed light on the texture of the film. <br/> <br/> When you call it "Frenzy," Hitchcock's last great masterpiece is when you have little understanding of what Hitchcock actually is. Achieved in terms of cinematic trickery, cinematic thrills, and brilliant cinematic mastery. "Frenzy" is therefore now what it always was: a cheap, bad and shitty movie that has nothing to offer either the one involved or the memory of a filmmaker who was one of the greatest in Hollywood at the time ever gave.
