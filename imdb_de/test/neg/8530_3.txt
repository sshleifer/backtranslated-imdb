Special sneak previews are always a good time. No matter which movie you're watching, the theater is always packed with people who have been waiting for the movie, such as free stuff, thought it was something to do, or just lost. Either way, no matter how good or how bad the movie is, the audience alone will make it enjoyable. If the movie is a PG-13 pseudo-horror movie (can you really dive into horror if the MPAA censors everything on your back?), You know it's babbling, laughing and holding your breath , With The Messengers, the crowd did not disappoint, giving the performers on the screen numerous outbreaks and warnings. As for the actual movie, I'm sorry for those involved, because it could have been a lot better if it had gone right and stretched its legs beyond the scare / fade-to-black / show progression of these films. At the end a boring, plodding story is shown without surprises and a few moments of suspense. <br /> <br /> The story is common. A family moves out of the big city after a traumatic event in the country to restore their relationship to each other. Once settled, the spirits of the house come to the reformed troublemaker whose past makes it even easier for parents to believe everything they are told. Of course, the child does not cry a wolf and the environment only learns when it is too late. I'll thank the Pang Brothers, the directors of the acclaimed The Eye, whom I'd like to see more than before to see what they can do without Hollywood interference. Allegedly, the messengers shoot at The Messengers from another person, but the brothers kept their appreciation; it's a shame what our studio system does to foreigners, especially if the films are created through creative independence and are not affected by interference, because it's really fitting and the tired action stays a bit fresh. Unfortunately, I also have to attribute to them the almost unbearable slowness. Much as I disliked What Lies Beneath, I could not stand the boring tension that goes so far that it becomes ridiculous. When our heroine and her brother are standing in a corridor behind them with a ghost, the scene lasts about eight minutes with static, oddly composed close-ups and depth of field, leading to absolute nothingness. For just 84 minutes, I almost thought it would have worked even better. <br /> <br /> In addition to a very effective opening sequence with the fantastic Jodelle Ferland (weird boy playing) and a great atmospheric credit sequence, the only thing that saves the movie from garbage is action. Apart from Penelope Ann Miller, who first surprised me, what happened to her, and then after a few scenes made me understand why I had never asked that question in the years she was absent, and Dustin Milligan, who did it all lack of credibility is very strong. Dyan McDermott does a great job as a dad trying to keep his family together in all the hard times. He has many small moments of light comedy to counteract his serious, dramatic role. William B. Davis (everyone's favorite Cancerman) is effectively used as an almost daunting character, which unfortunately is no longer used. Our true stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart plays the emotions very well and promises as an actress with this and Panic Room in her resume. If Corbett does not give up his role, the entire movie would have been completely decrypted. I wish he would get more work since I enjoyed him since the underrated series "The Visitor". I still have to check out his first role in "Northern Exposure," a show I've never seen before. It's a shame he's probably the most recognizable for the overrated My Big Fat Greek wedding. <br /> <br /> If anything, The Messengers gave me a nice introduction to the work of the Pang Brothers Chinese Horror Catalog. The mood and performances were there; It was just the simple and empty story that needed far too much padding to make a feature film. If they were more concerned with other characters than Stewart's, it could have been more effective, though a little more than ten-minute scenes of nothing. If our protagonist is the only one who is attacked, there is no reason how far the creatures will harm her. The hazards had no gravity and until the end it was really just a filler. However, I'm looking forward to the free comic book that will be given away after the special screening, as hopefully the medium will provide a faster story that gets carried away before it tries to surprise.
