I had heard that this Japanese film is nervous and creatively interesting, a "cool new bang" in the Asian filmmaking scene ... maybe even something as innovative as Hideo Nakata's "Ringu" or especially "Oldboy" from Chan-wook Park the latter. <br /> <br /> You can imagine my disappointment when instead I found that the film was both narrative and cinematic incoherent (albeit not in a way that a movie lover would appreciate), but clich√©d instead and stupidly weird - on the whole a very bad episode of the "Pulp Fiction" style. <br /> <br /> I stopped watching after 30 minutes when I gave up on becoming something more than it is.
