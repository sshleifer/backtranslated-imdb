I saw this movie in 1970 in a cinema club in Germany. Most participants came from the local private school where I taught. I had seen some Godard movies before when I lived in France, and although they were not my favorites, at least I could understand them. Being able to speak French has helped. <br /> <br /> The rather harmless beginning of "Le Weekend" soon became a kaleidoscope of pictures, very good, maybe too well photographed, which soon did not make sense to me. For me, films like books must have a clear meaning. That was not for me. I suppose I am not "in" artistic films. Pictures still follow me from the movie. To this day, I refuse to eat rabbit meat, which is popular with the French. Those who have seen the movie may know why. Yes, materialism came through, but cannibalism, car accidents, and all the other scenes of destruction and horror just made me sick. I'm not sure I went out before the end, but I definitely felt like it afterwards. I promised myself that I would never see another Godard movie, and I'll never know. It was the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. Others might have been unable, stupid or stupid. I forgot these, while scenes from this scene will haunt me forever.
