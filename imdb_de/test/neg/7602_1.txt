This movie was so bad and so cheap and so hackneyed that I found this movie to be one of the most boring slow movies of the early '80s I've ever seen. I like most of the cheap horror movies of the 80s, but I would never rent them again. It just did not make sense. A family living in the forest invites their son, wife, and daughter to vacation with them, and during the movie, mother and daughter-in-law do not get along well for some reason. We can never find out why until almost the end of the movie, but until then we only see the fact that the mother has some form of ESP and the daughter-in-law has nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe concerning the incident. To the victims of this "thing" unhappy To make that we have no idea what it looks like, all we see is a bright light signaling its approach, and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of the Darth Vadar voices and a soundtrack who was stolen from various horror movies. When we finally found out what and who I did, I laughed. This "killer" turns out to be a type of WWII Japanese alien warrior who seems to have been brought back to life to challenge the mother and her family. And the mother just stands in front of the living room and shakes her hands at the fire or as if she's getting into a kind of cramp. This movie is pathetic! Avoid it, it's not even worth renting.
