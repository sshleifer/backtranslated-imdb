I am a chess player and I wanted to like this movie. The problem was, the content could have fit into a 30-minute documentary. <br /> <br /> Many corridors were shot and Kasparov looked into the hall where he won the World Cup. There were other recordings in which Kasparov had walked around the place of the 1997 match and was told where he was sitting and where Deep Blue was. This just looked like a filler. <br /> <br /> I also did not find it interesting to look in detail at where Deep Blue was now and tried an IBM technician who unsuccessfully tried to "open" him. What would we have seen of interest anyway - a little grandmaster? <br /> <br /> Also the last match against Karpov. I no longer follow professional chess to know when and where it was. It would have been nice if you had told me: Was this unique "just for the money"? Was it part of the World Cup cycle? What was the end result? The core of the movie was the game in Game Two. Could / would IBM let Kasparov "get into the machine"? There should have been the focus.
