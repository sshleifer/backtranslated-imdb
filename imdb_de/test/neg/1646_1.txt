This movie is one of the worst movies ever. I'm kind of upset that this movie is not on the bottom 100. it deserves a place at least number 60 or 70 on this list. This is not just a movie that I think is bad for some kind of MST3K. it's just bad This is one of the few films that I really, really hate. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same category of bad. <br /> <br /> So, in this case, the story assumes that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and comes back with Crawl (Shore) and tries to learn to be a farmer , Then the friend tries to set up Shore so that the girl can leave Crawl and return to him. It ends and what remains of the audience can go. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this film is that Pauly Shore gets a mug for the camera and tries to be funny; But I would say 100% of the time he fails. Their terrible inaccurate and outdated view of farms and farming is offensive and there is nothing worth seeing in this movie. If you remember to see it: not. The only time I saw the movie, it felt like I would see it for five or six hours. If you have already seen it; You have my sympathy.
