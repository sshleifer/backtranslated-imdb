I ate through every 2 hours. I do not know what was worse, the terrible conspiracy, the lame figures, or the Hawaiian girl sexually advancing Eddie's eleven-year-old child and grandfather, who was eighty years old. The money spent on it was simply washed down the throne. Matty Simmons should be ashamed. The original idea for this movie was "A Swiss Family Griswold" and it somehow became a mess. The only bright spot is that the reviews were so bad that we'll never see that on TV again. AVOID ALL COST ... RENT ERNEST SAVES CHRISTMAS or something else.
