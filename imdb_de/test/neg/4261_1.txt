And the worst thing is that it could have been good. But something terribly wrong. First, they should not be acting at all in this movie Amitabh Bachchan. He's too much of an icon to address such a sensitive and controversial issue, let alone the role itself. Second, Ram Gopal Varma should be ashamed to take Lolita's classic story and turn it into a pitifully predictable one Make slutfest. His lolita is called Jia (played by newcomer Jiah Khan), and as we meet her, she has no idea of ​​stolen innocence or the tender naivety normally associated with the intricate story of the original Lolita, is gradually becoming a nymph. Varmas Jia is already a whore with her price, even before she gets hit by the camera. And he does not exercise chastity in the way his films are his leading nymphet. From constant panning shots of the crotch to fixing her vulgar gestures and behaviors, Mr. Varma ensures that his voyeuristic, pedophile camera angles have left no person in the audience less uncomfortable. Oh, let's not talk about the nonexistent chemistry between Jia and her so-called friend Ritu (daughter of Bachchan). These girls are supposed to be best friends and yet look like the worst enemies even before anything goes wrong. Nothing they do together is believable until they become enemies. Perhaps Mr. Varma should have worked on this aspect of his screenplay instead of focusing on destroying any credibility that Amitabh Bachchan would have left as an actor. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is perhaps the subordinate portrayal of the character of the wife of Bachchan's character. Her role was so self-evident and ridiculously wooden that it is impossible to feel pity or sorrow for her. I actually felt like I was looking at the screen because I did not react like any normal woman. Instead, she just stood there looking irritable and helpless, as I can imagine that many viewers of this movie may feel after seeing the train crash of a movie. Watch at your own risk.
