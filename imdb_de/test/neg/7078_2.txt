I saw the movie yesterday and stopped at half-time because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea of ​​shooting a movie through the eyes of a Headsman - one of the "bad guys" in most fantasy and medieval films - is great and offers many possibilities, but ... the movie could not catch any of them. I had no sense of any of the characters, the plot was too predictable (to the point where I followed it), and the second time jump in the plot brought me down. Those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a former socialist are disappointed.
