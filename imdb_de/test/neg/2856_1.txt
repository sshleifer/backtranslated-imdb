.... you get this stupid excuse of a rip-off of a breeze! Man, what did you think? First they mess with a Rumpelstiltskin horror movie, then they make such crap. Fariy Tale haters! To be honest, I saw it as a kid and it scared me a bit, just because I was under Wah Wah Wah, assuming Pinocchio would not do that. But I've grown up thinking that this is a breeze, a fairy tale throwing nonsense and a lame Tales From The Crypt episode, or at least trying to be one, with a lame end that was stupid and there have been many storylines, and I still can not understand how it came about. Was it the work of a bad Geppetto? After a few evil deeds, what then becomes a real boy who becomes America's most wanted people? I personally think that the concept of a bad Geppettos sounds better, he builds an army of Holzkillern and begins a crime wave, witty. But that's terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible! DREADFUL! Stinky as a shoe and terrible! It sucked it sucked! If you want killer dolls, you should be satisfied with the killer doll, especially Child's Play. Or if you want to turn a fairytale character upside down, check out Leprechaun, or if you want Pinocchio, check out the animated Disnet version or live version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau instead. >>>>> -10/10 (negative 10)
