Big spoiler here: This movie is B! A! D! But enjoy, it is good bad. <br /> <br /> Bugged is the kind of movie you can not believe exists, with dialogues, plots and instructions handled so improperly that the Uncle Neds Carlsbad Cavern home video looks like an IMAX Experience works. Since it's a Troma movie, there are a lot of damn Gore on tap, but it's even stupider than usual. <br /> <br /> Most of the production costs seem to have bought sodas and sandwiches for cast and crew. The brilliant dialogue can best be summed up in the immortal: "% @ # $! What was that?" This is second only to the often shouted "What now?". <br /> <br /> Any knowledge of how people behave in a desperate situation is alien to writer / director Ronald Armstrong. When one of the friends is eaten alive by a Grasshopper / Termite / Chiapet thing, Armstrong instantly leaves the survivors with a cute but stupid "Divine" doorknob button. While she is being approached, Divine cooks on the stove a large, steaming pot of a mixture of rat poison and oatmeal. She stirs, smiles, stirs, smiles and never falls dead from the fumes! <br /> <br /> The killer bugs are as scary as pi√±atas, which they resemble too much. The effects with which they are moved are pulling over the tile floors, with the legs pulled behind them. <br /> <br /> The climax of the movie was likely to have blown up the house. Never had one before, so they did not even see a miniature go up in flames, but just let the screen turn black (eat Your heart from ILM). <br /> <br /> The cast is practically black. How can the NAACP consistently censor something angry like Amos and Andy (which is certainly no less than 99% of white comedy shows), but says nothing about Bugged. Well, it's best you do not know how humiliating this movie is for everyone involved (as it would be if played openly by a single ethnic group). Before putting the kabab on Bugged, gather with friends and get ready for Plan 9 by Bug Exterminator.
