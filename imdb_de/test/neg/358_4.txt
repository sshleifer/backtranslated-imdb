Despite the fact that this was a Made-for-TV movie (and an obvious movie about it: cheap-looking), CLASS WARFARE left with a desire to get my money back, and given that this lame production was partial financed by Canada dollars, I could only be justified. <br /> <br /> What prompted me was actress Lindsey McKeon, whom I've seen in her role as "goody-goody" for the last couple of years "Mara Lewis in the soap opera GUIDING LIGHT In turns, she is doing well, because Kristen, a spoiled rich, who suddenly finds herself dirty, but with an engaging track and a stroke of fate, will possibly change her fortune The trail of fate is found in the figure of Richard (Robin Dunne), a socially radical outcast who finds he just has not achieved anything and won $ 23 million for a lottery ticket. Now set Richard, Kristen, her boyfriend of Jason (Wade Carpenter) and her camcorder-obsessed pal Graham (Dave McGowan) get together for a weekend in a secluded cabin, cut off from the world by storms, and guess she just unfolds. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from overstaffing both the characters' story and characters and their motives. Everyone is pretty one-dimensional and it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that some things and some people very quickly become very bad. I do not think it is an original plot, and it does not matter to make yourself a little more. Acting is fine, McKeon is just right as a manipulative female lead, and Dunne is very good, maybe a bit too good, but it's not worth home writing. The only other loan I can give the film is the only turn I did not end up seeing (not quite at the end, which is so obvious that it hurts). Still, I sat through everything and lived to tell the story, so I can not say it was a complete write-off. <br /> <br /> 4/10. A movie that is "something to see if nothing else".
