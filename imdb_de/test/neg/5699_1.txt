I rented this movie because I love Kristanna Loken and I've seen her on many TV shows. Now that she has 15 minutes of fame with her new T3 movie, I wanted to find out what other movies she was in. > <br /> She's just okay with acting. Not good and not bad. She makes up for everything by being extremely beautiful. YUMMMMM <br /> <br /> Rodney Rowland was a surprise as a hero. He provided the only solid drama in the movie. He is a very good actor and should probably be an action star. <br /> <br /> Besides Kristanna being okay and Rodney really good, all else about this movie is garbage in its purest form. <br /> <br /> A computer hacker hacks from the ground into the system of an aircraft and tries to throw the plane into a nuclear power plant with a joystick ... or something. And of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and ruin his game. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst scripts I've ever seen, and no wonder this was a low budget movie. <br /> What's shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and he has too many similarities with the tragedies of 9/11. <br /> <br /> Why are they even making films like this? <br /> <br /> Panic * - a star (waste of too good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as aerial panic)
