Nothing to spoil, but this could be a SPOILER, so watch out. <br /> <br /> Special effects were at the level of a video game - about five years ago or maybe the original Star Trek. The acting was just pathetic - some cheesy-looking blondes wandering the desert while a voice boomed in the background. And further. And further. This was half the hike and the drone I actually made. The progress is interrupted by some fighting. Ships blast each other for no real reason, which seems episodic. It's also not that there's a real fight you would expect from a movie, more like a cheap video game. Boi-ing! Boi-ing! Ship explodes. Next ship Apparently, some of the ships are looking for the blonde. Here in the distant future, ships must be nearsighted and astigmatic, as many of them pass directly above the stylishly dressed futuristic baby in black, but never see them. <br /> <br /> Then there are some choreographed fights that look like something created by high school kids. Again, the gross video game mentality is prominent. The combatants switch to "combat mode" by twisting something on their wrists, and a loud computer-based voice resounds and flashes "combat mode". That must be a dandy design if you're trying to sneak up on someone. Then go to a big power plant that looks like today's day-storm and plug it in to recharge. LOL, I'm not joking, you can not make it up, it's like watching a crazy video game from about 2000, except that acting in the game is better. <br /> <br /> More trekking. Then she appears at "The City". (Lame Sound Trek gets even more Lamer here.) She gets into a fight with a 'Mech robot of the future, who can not beat her with his big gun, even though she runs right in front of him, about five feet in front of him. Obviously, robots of the distant future are about as useful as toasters in a fight. She throws sand in the eyes and knocks him to death, throwing stones at them. rofl, I was at this time about 95% of the tolerance, my nausea flashing red. In the next scene she is strapped to a rocket with a rope. I do not shit, tied directly to a rocket. This should be an advanced form of transport. At this point, I canceled. <br /> <br /> This movie is a shame for a movie that was made at the time. Just a damn shame. There was a murky story, but the movie distracted - someone was constantly blaring over "Mother." <br /> <br /> I gave him two because there were a few scenes that showed a pretty science fiction artwork as a background. Unfortunately, the plot, the drama, the action, the cinematography and the narration distract from this work of art and degrade it. Seriously.
