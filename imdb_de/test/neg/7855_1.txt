I accidentally came across this movie and wished I had not done it. Why should he make a sexually rude successor (and a bit of gore if a man is beheaded) of a well-known children's movie? <br /> <br /> Do not take small children with you to see that the title is misleading you. He has nothing to do with the original Snow White, except to steal the characters. Better yet, do not bother to go yourself, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I could not see anything, the poor (compared to Disney) comic graphics, and no conspiracy, other than how totally messed up a classic movie wanted to give me up and go.
