The Gun is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The direction of the comedians is very bad, the dialogue sounds like they were written by a 13-year-old teenager. After all, nothing in this movie is good. A big thumbs-up to everyone involved, and especially to the Montreal Film Festival, which presented this film IN COMPETITION!
