This movie is ... terrible and wonderful at the same time. I saw it for the first time when I was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a very nostalgic value for me. In this film, Cesar Romero actually plays the character of Octavio, the man who "discovered" Santana. There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (Sam, who tries to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (who plays the priest), who have big filmographies, and these are the only ideas that are in order. The rest of the acting and the movie itself all have B-movie qualities that some of us value. <br /> <br /> I recently tried to buy a copy of this movie for 2 years and it almost does not exist. I assume that it was discontinued shortly after its release. But at some point I found a copy and paid a nice cent for it. If you appear in a video store (unmistakably green green "Satan" on the cover) after Judgment Day, you are one of the Blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still have a working copy. A must for those of you who like to laugh at cheesy attempts at a scary movie.
