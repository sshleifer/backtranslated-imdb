I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie made the impossible possible. <br /> <br /> While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this movie has been an apprenticeship in abundance. As in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. It would have helped if the movie had had a little more movement in the storyline and in the camera. Instead, we only had awkward silence and a lot of slow movement. The acting was absolutely terrible and bordered on poor film grades for students while everyone was trying to write something called script. Did these people even get directions? Were they made to be boring and boring? Either the theory would not surprise me. <br /> <br /> What was worse, was the rather unconventional make-up of creatures from the other side. In any case, they all stank. Do not look at this movie. That's all I can say (unless you're an insomniac).
