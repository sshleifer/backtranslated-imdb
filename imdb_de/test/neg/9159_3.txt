I honestly thought that this movie would be cheesy, although I've liked Alvin and the Chipmunks for a long time! I was very wrong. IT WAS GREAT!!! It was the best movie I have seen since October! In my opinion, it is the movie everyone should see this Christmas time! Enchanted (I thought anyway ...) was awful, the Golden Compass was fine, but the end was pretty crappy for its Dark Materials fans, and I Am Legend, I have not seen it yet (or National Treasures 2) It looks good. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything away, but this movie is great for anyone, especially children!
