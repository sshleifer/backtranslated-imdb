This movie, like so many others (Remember the Titans, Miracle), follows the basic formula for sports movies: There's a man, he's an idiot. Jerk does bad Jerk has to play according to the rules of another player. The rules of others change Jerk, Jerk will be fine. Inserting tragedy (death, drugs, riots, etc.). Tragedy effects Jerk makes him totally different. Jerk has to play a championship game now. Many close-ups of sweaty players and balls. Jerk wins. Quote from coach or news or something that explains the title. Credits. Were not you touched? These films can now be used to sort out the idiots of society. Anyone who pays to see it in the cinemas has to be beaten.
