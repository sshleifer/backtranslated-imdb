J.S. Cardone directed the little-known "Video Nasty" titled "The Slayer" in 1982 and has since released a handful of feature films; including the garbage vampire 2001 The Forsaken. His latest feature, Wicked Little Things, has a decent plot and a scary-looking poster that I seem to remember a few years ago in connection with a film directed by Tobe Hooper. Well, I think he felt that this movie was too similar to his stupid zombie mushroom movie 'Mortuary', and rejected the movie. I do not blame him for that either. The plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters, who move into an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her deceased husband. What they do not know is that a hundred years ago; A group of miners employed as miners were trapped in a mineshaft. Of course, this is not the end of them, and they have managed to survive their agony and now go through the area in search of revenge? <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a collection of clich√©s; from the youngest child with an "imaginary friend," the mother who dismisses it, and all the usual zombie garbage. J.S. Cardone tries to get rid of the horror fans with shocks and bloody scenes (mostly with kids), but that's not enough. The story does not work out too well and really reminds me too much of the earlier Mortuary, and that's not good (though Mortuary is actually a better movie than this one). Acting is not something to write home about; Lori Heuring looks good, as does his eldest daughter Scout Taylor-Compton. but no one manages to perform an interesting performance. Chloe Moretz is a bit better than the usual child actor. The plot is hardly credible and, in fact, the script can not even explain the reasons why the kids are attacking the locals. It all boils down to a typical and rather boring ending and overall I have to say that if you know your horror movies, you can decide to skip it!
