This film shows all conceivable Greek clich√©s. In a particularly annoying scene, the tycoon says, "I'm just an ignorant farmer." As a grandson of Greek immigrants from Greece, who passed on a legacy of wisdom and love to their children and grandchildren, I found this film contemptible and disgusting.
