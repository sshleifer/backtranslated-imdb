The script is the worst part of this film as it staggers from one premise to the next, missing all the important parts that would have made a number of different stories possible. (This movie is confusing because the audience does not know what the story is.) I had no problem with the low production values ​​and the acting was not great, but this is a telly, so it was good. I do not mind if some scenes look like they were made in one take. However, such a nonsensical screenplay is completely superfluous. Did any supervisor actually read it before paying out the cash? Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> Especially the prologue was so poorly written that it needed a voice to fill in all the details that were left out. The prologue was rushed, it was not clear what happened, ie. The Russian revolution was reduced to "some riots in Petersburg", with the next scene arrested by soldiers. I know the basic story of the revolution, so I could fill in the details of "these annoying communists". The prologue is best ignored. <br /> <br /> This could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused who she is. She sets this requirement in the asylum. Then it might be hard for her to identify with the rest of the movie. No. The film assumes that she is the one she says she is (though there is still no empirical evidence). She creates a melodramatic romance, a love so strong that she will believe everything she does says. Okay, a limp romance. No, because it makes no sense. The love interest seems like a crazy madman breaking out in wild gestures. It does not work because the movie ends up dumb enough to tell the truth in the monologue. They never got married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Although there were many love scenes, I was never convinced why they were in love. I find rom com-romances to be more convincing, even though there are only one or two scenes that show that they even spent time together. <br /> <br /> It could have been a kind of thriller. The film assumes that she is the one she says she is, and she has difficulty proving her identity. No, the trial is summarized rather than treated. The bizarre voice comes back to once again fill in the details of a better movie. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing to remember is what really happened. Anna Anderson was an idiot who went to America and married another idiot, and they did crazy things together. She had crazy behavior all her life. None of it in the movie. There is a really annoying character in the asylum that emerges from nowhere and calls itself an informant with the title "A Flying Cuckoo - Next / Twelve Monkeys". Luckily, she disappears and has brought nothing to the story.
