I grew up in the 90s; So you have to understand that I witnessed the premieres of the biggest DCOMs first-hand. I was there as a Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc. These films are my childhood. When these movies hit, not only myself, but also whoever I saw them, was in awe of 1:30 am, talking about it for the week ahead, and picking them up again next weekend. I do not think words could express the excitement that Zoog Disney brought with it. <br /> <br /> Even though I look at it now, the dialogue does not seem so bad (in fact, so effective that I actually remember parts of the conversation, literally word for word, from movies that I have before) have seen ten years.). The characters are believable, funny, a bit stereotypical, but that's what makes Disney's charm ... <br /> <br /> I put my little brother in front of the Disney Channel to convey it and understand my feelings for DCOMs , Entering the suburbs ... my brother looked at me slightly confused and asked me if I had always been gay. I am now more disappointed and cheated than how could I compare that? When Han Solo learned that Lando had sold him to Vader ... <br /> <br /> Half the movie, and I'm not exaggerating, is flashbacks. These young actors (some of them older than me) have no talent. The plot is ridiculous; It feels like a bunch of old rotten business people sitting around a table in Disney wondering, "How can we make these teenagers look hip?" OK, maybe all DCOMs were like that, but at least they tried a little bit to make sure we did not realize that they think we're complete idiots. <br /> <br /> And apparently this kind of movie works ... Stuck in the Suburbs is rated almost as Zeno or Airborne. How is that possible? DCOMs became even cheesier and people prefer them now? (although the absence of cursive words seems sufficient to give some 10/10 people) Christ, it's a completely different generation.
