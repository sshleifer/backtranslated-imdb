If you are a bit masochistic and want to waste some time, you should try this. I have wasting myself enough time to see that I can not explain why it is so terrible. Be warned!!! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 lines or more. Now it starts: Every year, some people believe that it's fun to shoot a low-budget movie about the creepy monsters of the underground, which will hopefully prove a hit. The cave is one of them. I did not have high expectations of this, but acting is so bad and production so bad that I seriously think about asking for a refund. Phewww ... another line about a useless movie ... Oh, I'm done.
