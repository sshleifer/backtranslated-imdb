I am a music lover and was thrilled to see this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I was ready to leave half of the movie. I did not identify with any of the characters, which means that I do not care what happened to them and completely lost interest in the story. On the good side, Ed Harris looked just like Beethoven, and the Ninth Symphony is always a pleasure to hear, making part of the movie bearable. Also, the spots where they talk about the bridge have been almost the entire movie, but that could not last to the end. The actors did what they could with the one they had to work with, but the script was not enough to make it interesting even from afar. The little bit about "wash me" was total garbage. I wonder how many recordings the actors made for this movie (I could not say these lines without laughing). Anyway, such a shame it could have been a lot better.
