The movie begins with a little girl (Rita) who sees her father killed. He was apparently a criminal who squeaked with his fellow man. Later, and this part makes little sense, the girl has grown up and STILL follows her father's past! A little later, Rita meets a worthless and makes an appointment with him. During one of his dates he is a bit intoxicated and drives like a total idiot. The cops chase, and he races away - a pedestrian is killed in the meantime. Here comes the really stupid part. He persuades her to confess to the crime when he assures her that his lawyers will let her get away with it. Why, oh why, would she agree?! Nevertheless, she spends the next few years in prison and spends her !! Shortly after her conviction, this friend disappears, showing that he is an absolute heel. What an idiot !!! Later, after her release, she informs her friend (Jack La Rue) about the truth about the friend. Then, he explains, his friend's family is full, and she should shake her off for a lot of money, for all the trouble he does her with rap. To be honest, this makes sense - since she certainly owes her - especially because they knew she was going to jail and had every intention of using her and then tossing her away. The idea of ​​making money Bleeding the rich kicks is a good idea for action. However, there's no way this would have happened in the first place, because it's hard to believe that someone could be so stupid as to take the rap for a hit! In an interesting twist, the dumb lady decides on a criminal life - she wears a wig and grabs a rich man - takes him to the desert and robs him at gunpoint! Wow ... how it has changed! Apparently, she loves the idea of ​​stealing from "phonies" - d. H. rich hypocrites. And that made no sense, but she soon stopped using it and began tearing down her old friend's father - why she made some small robberies in the meantime made little sense. And it was a bit hard to believe that she was not interested in the old fool, but was interested in getting him to put his influence behind a mob-controlled man for the mayor. Strange ... very, very strange. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, another plot is developing involving a young Alan Ladd. He is a covert agent who has infiltrated the mob. He was chosen because he happens to be dead for a real rogue - what a cliche! What makes no sense, however, is that this real rogue is not in jail and committing crimes, while the fake infiltrates the mob in another city enough to issue the Mob-Kingpin's arrest warrants - including Rita. This is a case of very bad timing as she has decided in the meantime to become a decent and legitimate woman since she has met a really nice man she wants to marry! Wow, ... what are the chances ?! Overall, it is a stupid and pretty stupid film that suffers from a "kitchen sink syndrome". In other words, there are far too many plot elements and funny twists to make the movie a little believable. And since the movie lasts just over an hour, everything seems very forced and thoughtful. It's a relatively poor B movie by Crap-Studio PRC, intended only for the performance of Alan Ladd, before gaining great fame at Paramount the following year. Incidentally, this DVD was released by Alpha Video - a company that sometimes publishes wonderfully obscure titles (mostly public domain), but NEVER cleans up or adds subtitles. In other words, DVD production values ​​are in third place at best.
