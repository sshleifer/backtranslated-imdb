**** Probably contains spoilers. **** <br /> <br /> After a successful attempt to get attention (I would not call you for help before you die a "failed suicide attempt"), Joey finds out she is pregnant and Seeing pictures of ghosts. All in all, the movie was a bit slow, but entertaining enough to see it all. For a horror movie, there were only a few goosebumps and thrills. However, halfway there was a really good scary scene (but I will not reveal it) :) I saw this movie because I really liked the previous movie The Eye. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused. However, to determine that The Eye 2 had no relationship with The Eye, other than that it was a movie of "supernatural tension" by the same creators, * whatever *; different cast, different story. The Eye2 does not even have anything to do with eyes: \\ /> <br /> The film had some questionable scenes: Joey tries suicide 3 times (4 times if you count the time when witnesses say that she's Joey's) Jumping in front of the train), she is linked to the brutal persecution of an attacker, she freaks out in a restaurant and witnesses say she has "attacked" people and yet she is allowed to devote herself to her work, without as much a psyche rating or in the hospital (for reasons other than her pregnancy). <br /> <br /> The movie was not the best horror movie, the story was quite far-fetched (even for a feature film: P), there were few and / or nothing we have not seen yet. However, it was an "interesting" story, and once you know what the "truth" behind the spooks is, this was an interesting twist on the "ghost" story. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the movie 3 out of 10
