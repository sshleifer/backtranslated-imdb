With the abundance of repetitive and derivative sitcoms jam-packed in both autumn and summer, winter and spring, it's nice to see a show that stands out in more ways than the crowd. <br /> <br /> 'Earl' takes an unusual approach. It's not about the "everyday thinking of an eccentric family" (zzzz ..) and not about the other boring stuff you see in sitcoms everywhere. The show is about this little white trash thief (Earl) who scrape off a lottery ticket and make big hits. At that moment Karma took it away from him. Over time, he learns that this unusual incident is probably due to all the bad things he's done. So he sets out to correct any mistakes he has ever made, and he has written all his actions on paper /> This is an excellent prerequisite for a sitcom. Luckily, it landed in the right hands. The execution of the show produces extremely satisfying results: you get an innovative comedy that is genuinely fun and often touching. You can not help but fall in love with Earl's sincerity and steadfastness, Randy's simple mind, good heart and observations about life, Joy's wild, extravagant personality, and Darnell's gentle, chilled demeanor that easily covets him. <Br /> <br /> If you combine the show's innovation with sincere humor, good heart, interesting characters and well-written dialogues, you really have a guardian. With shows like this (and the unparalleled "The Office"), NBC is obviously attentive to something. Have you finally released one or two cabins for quality assurance? Let's hope so. And let's hope for more quality shows like these that will fill the line-ups. Shows That Will Make Television Viewers and NBC Owners Weep in the Long Days of NBC's Golden Days (Frasier, Seinfeld, Friends)
