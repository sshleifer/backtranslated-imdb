Honestly, I have to admit that I see certain stupid movies based on the hype they've generated or are currently generating. This silly feature by Salman Khan & Govinda is one of those stupid movies. Okay, by now we've all seen Hitch starring Will Smith as the date doctor, trying to help unusual people find the truth. Why should we then see how Salman Khan imitates this? That's the $ 64,000 question. In the event that you wondered, Govinda plays the comedy in search of the love of his life (an unattainable celebrity) played by Katrina Kaif. Lives Kaif plays her character pretty much as any role you've ever seen her. And for almost three and a half hours, we are tortured with parodies of other Bollywood films and characters or better, and yet we are spoiled with the lower achievements of previous hit movies. Rajpal Yadav co-stars. F
