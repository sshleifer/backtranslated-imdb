When reading most of the other reviews, I agree with most of the comments. The only thing I want to add is the incoherent way in which the film was judged and produced. I think some of these New Wave filmmakers think they are clever, use unusual (sometimes jerky) camera angles and jump from one scene to another. It works well at these film festivals and at some of these indie critics, but it spoils the film for me. In the reviews, I've found that none of the filmmaking films has become blockbuster. This might prove my point, as the movie feels like he has to hurry, which is why you wonder why such a beautiful movie lacks a smooth river. The comment that Kiefer Sutherland is a great name for the poster, I would bet if he looks at the last cut. This is a story of real potential, tainted by trying to be different in their production. Worth seeing, but not many would return to a second look.
