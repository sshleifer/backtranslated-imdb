This is pretty typical of the sci-fi channel: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot, and terrible special effects. We have some alien sock puppets all at once and Lou Diamond Phillips is doing his best with what he has for a performance. And save the day. All others are absolutely expendable; the ex-wife, who dislikes the venerable clich√© of Lou, will, of course, love him again in the end. The hideous State Senator getting plastered early, and a lot of boring guards walking around a lot. Then there is an eco-terrorist who has absolutely no reason in this movie except to give us 3% more running. He spends the entire middle part of the movie hiding in a box. <br /> <br /> The special effects really deserve their own sales. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air at about 100 miles per hour behind the flames. According to the physics of this film, atmospheric friction can cause you to go up in flames if you exceed the specified maximum speed in your car. Then it lands on the hood of a car and comes in horizontally. Like a velcro ball landing on a Velcro floor, I think. It really does not hurt the car very much, just bends the hood a bit. Lou later gets into a helicopter and follows the train. Although the train was only two minutes ahead, it takes a good half hour to catch it. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks as big as the hills it flies over. Then it flies into the side of a mountain - this effect has to be seen to be believed. It looks like they've taken a glass of gas, thrown it against a wall, and put the flame effect over the helicopter. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter could not catch up in time, he had five tons of nitroglycerin with him. Then the eco-terrorist finally blows himself up, but instead of exploding like all explosions in all directions, he explodes up like a cannon pointing in the air. Then there's the whole deal of not being able to stop the train because it could get the little aliens out, but it seems the aliens are actually flying faster than the train is going. I have no idea. All in all, if you have a few hours of time to kill, and it's because of this movie or the repeats in the Food Network of these chefs are kind of cute. Usually, these films have at least one or two things that allow them to sit through it. Maybe there is a sexy girl, something T & A or a character who actually has a personality, or a tension or something else. I really did not see anything here.
