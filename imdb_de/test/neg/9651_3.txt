I suspect the movie is based on a hefty book. Given the number of characters and negotiations during Katyn's, I thought that the filmmakers, perhaps the author or director, intended to create an epic film. But really not enough time to deal with the development of characters or stories. Terrifyingly, there were many unrelated side stories that could have been cut out. <br /> <br /> When I talk about the events that led to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I do not think the film explained why it was necessary to murder. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge? The interesting thing about historical films are personal motives or emotions. Instead, the killers of Katyn seemed like automatons completely controlled by Stalin, occasionally framed like a charcoal sketch. The depiction of the Russians and Germans was completely one-dimensional. (Are the Poles just mad at the Russians?) Apart from being badly handled and biased, or at least unrealistic, the choice of music and cinematography did not feel like each other and the film itself. I do not think you can record an epic war movie or a war event with a handheld camera. (But if the director had gone along with a character-driven story, perhaps by focusing on a single family, the approach of the cell phone cam might have worked better.) And if you're really using dramatic music, it has to be better matched to the guy be made of recordings.
