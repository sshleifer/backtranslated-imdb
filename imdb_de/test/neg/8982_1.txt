This movie was not like the book. <br /> <br /> Everything was mixed or changed. Most of the film dealt with things that were not even in the book. <br /> <br /> This film should never have been seen. It was a big disappointment to me as I enjoyed the book so much and then saw how this movie ruined the whole thing JD Robb. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie is not worth watching to see how off the book it really is.
