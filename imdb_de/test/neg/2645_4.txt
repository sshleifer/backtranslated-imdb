This was one of the most mixed films I have ever seen. Everything in the movie seemed to be attached to another element that was glued on. There is even a talking buffalo who wants his wet nose rubs to realize the magic. Even the brutal father seems to be incarcerated, just to give the children an excuse to fly away in a car. It was ridiculous, but uncomfortable, because of the serious subjects who were used only to plot the plot.
