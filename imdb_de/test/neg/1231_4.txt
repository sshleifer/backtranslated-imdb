Okay, so I forgot to watch and just caught the last episode because I thought it was the first or second. Honestly, I thought CM had at least one more rate to resolve plot points. The Rangers stay stranded in the plain ("We have to eat the horses"), on the one hand. Little Newt is robbed for another. What a downer! But my biggest complaint, especially when this was the final, was that the episode had no suspense, no big climax and no dramatic confrontations. Even the last fight between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was badly staged. The whole episode had a terrible pace, driving a western. Steve Zahn was handsome, Karl Urban (an alarm clock for Johnny Knoxville) played Call like a man with a jaw pack. All gloomy glances and ringing spurs and protruding chin. And what about the Rangers? They talked a great deal about cleaning up Texas, and then they moved aimlessly in the middle of the city and got drunk. And how nice of Hal Holbrook to lend Val Kilmer his Mark Twain wig and stache! The sentence from Austin was like the fake Rock Ridge of Blazing Saddles, all facade. I admit I got involved in the plot, but that's mainly because there were a lot of things that I did not fully understand because I was late in the story. If I had seen from the beginning, maybe I would not have come to episode three. Now I have to look Silverado to clean my pallet.
