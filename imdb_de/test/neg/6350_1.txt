If you want to see an example of how you can not make a movie, you need to see this. I myself, with no experience with movies, could do better. The script is ridiculous with a feeble action and no effort is required for an intelligent structure. To fix this error, would you think that the action would be decent, right? <br /> <br /> Since the film's acting, editing and overall composition is the only saving grace, the worst thing is the terrible performance of the lead actor. The reason he is the saving grace is that he is so bad at acting that he should win an Oscar for it. At least, some appreciation for making me laugh so much. <br /> <br /> Throw the body of a dead woman after a male shoot (where does she come from?) Pull the semi-automatic trigger ten times while the soundman plays two shot effects, the reflection of the camera crews in Kool Mo Dee's Shades only ONE song for the WHOLE movie, an unoriginal script without logic; is a perfect recipe for a really bad movie. It's actually more fun to discover the mistakes than to actually find something positive. Avoid at all costs.
