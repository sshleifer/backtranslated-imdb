Wow, where do I start? After suffering through this miserable $ 1.00 rent (thank you, family video), all I had to do was make a few comments. I did not bother to write down the names of the three actors in the movie, but hopefully you'll know who I'm talking about. A monster truck terrorizes the landscape and chases two fate-stricken colleagues to college. They meet a hot girl wearing sloppy clothes. I mean, that sounds fantastic in theory. I laughed hysterically over the DVD box as I took her to the girl behind the counter in the video library. <br /> <br /> Acting: The hot girl, played by Aimee Whatever, clearly laughs through many scenes She should be scared. The other two main actors in the film, the fat Prankster and the Vanilla Straight, are both terrible. The fat man thinks he's Jack Black. He is not. The other actor, our hero, transgresses and renounces all of his hints and acts like a generic character that you might see in a Nickelodeon movie about skateboarding in the early '90s. Look: I do not expect great performances in movies like this, but at least the actors can try not to be annoying. You can be an incompetent actor, but still be comfortable (eg, John Wayne). At least the Aimee gal is attractive. <br /> <br /> Script: Saint ****, who found this dialogue funny? I would not have the nerve to play this before my drama class in elementary school, let alone as a screenplay. Incredibly bad. Later more. <br /> <br /> Production: OK, here the movie is definitely successful. The production quality is amazingly high. The look of the film is very good. Apparently, the only talented person who worked on the film was the director of photography. <br /> <br /> OK, here are my biggest problems: 1) The man who drives the car never drives faster than 25 mph /> 2) The guy who drives the car is far out before he realizes that a fat man in a mask is in the backseat. He is said to be meticulous in recording gas mileage and keeping his old car in good condition, but he does not notice a 300-pound Jack Black imitator in the rear? Come on. <br /> <br /> 4) Characters never change their clothes. There are two hotel scenes. Showers are thought to be available to our characters, but in the three days this movie takes place, none of the characters gets annoyed to change. <br /> <br /> 5) Comedy. Carefree slapstick comedies do not mix with horror. Period. You can not let our characters run away from a monster truck for a second, and in the next second they'll have to play verbally with some stupid light / comedy music. This kind of pacing is ruining virtually any tension in the movie. Movies like Evil Dead 2, which mix comedy and horror, understand that tensions can be solved, but never completely eliminated with humor. Monster Man does not understand. <br /> <br /> I am irritated that a very funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought he was much smarter than he really was. Well.
