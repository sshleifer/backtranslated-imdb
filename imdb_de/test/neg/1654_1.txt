Oh dear God! The Beeb hit a new low with this discouraged act of political correctness. A mixed race family living in Birmingham with a disabled child thrown into battle for good reason. Anyone who has commissioned this goner should be hunted and thrown to the dogs. The usually funny Jasper Carrott is as funny as a bunch on this show and does not bring me to the others. You have the timing and subtle atomic bomb. I just hope the comedy gets better, but I doubt it with people like Little Britain and Catherine Tate. I think it would be better if you got the box for a decent comedy of yore, like Fawlty Towers or Bottom, if you want a laugh. <br /> <br /> BAN THIS SQUEAKY CLEAN RUBBISH!
