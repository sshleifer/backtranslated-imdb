I saw this movie at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. His reputation had preceded him, and although all my friends were of legal age, I had the courage to enter the video library and actually rent it. We gathered in a house where the parents had left the city for a weekend. Although we sat in the immediate vicinity, we did not address or otherwise acknowledge the other's presence. As it turned out, the film was both deserving and not the expectant shame we felt. It not only disappointed the unsatisfactory content, but disappointed in other ways. Caligula tries to overcome genres by combining a historical epic with an outrageous porno movie. It fails miserably at its ambition and submits the audience to the worst of the two worlds. The obvious selling point of the film is its pornographic aspect, and in fact offers much more than its share of real, graphic sex. By putting this gender in the context of Caligula's corrupt governance, it still pays tribute to the act even less than the average adult film. Sex without context may be at least physically pleasing to the consenting adult, but in the world of Caligula the joy and perhaps even the approval is largely absent. Sex serves at best as an idle pastime and in the worst case as an instrument of sadistic domination. In modern times, it is reasonably common to hear words such as "sin" and "depravity" describing deeds that are fun but considered taboo from certain moral or religious points of view. Caligula transports the viewer beyond the multi-faceted realms, depicting true depravity and showing that neither joy nor pleasure comes from it. The historical parts fail not only to meaningfully contextualise, entertain, enlighten and fascinate sex, or to interest the viewer in any way. They only offer long stretches of tireless boredom. Seldom has a movie proved so boring. The sex, after the initial shock and astonishment subsided, only contributes to the general monotony of the picture. <br /> <br /> Discussions about this film are rarely associated with violence. While many films are more violent than Caligula, few can compete with the shock of their violence. Relentless barbarism and hyperdependent sexuality apparently shaped Caligula's imperial era. The violence is even less for the faint of heart than for the sex. <br /> <br /> A review like this will probably generate just as much curiosity as it strikes. I understand why someone wants to see this movie; After all, I myself have succumbed to the same curiosity. I just hope that by clearly describing the lack of salvation value, my review will at least convey the knowledge to potential viewers to make an informed decision on whether to view it or not. My teacher in high school criminal justice described the work of the police as "hours of boredom interrupted by moments of pure terror." This statement describes Caligula perfectly. You were warned.
