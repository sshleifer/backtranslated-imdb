This was the worst movie my wife and I have ever seen. The only concessions are that we did not pay to see it in the movies, as we lent it on DVD from the video store. Simple - not an action worth mentioning (I only saw it five minutes ago and I forgot it already), annoying characters that were badly played by two-bit actors. In fact, we just laughed out of the movie that we made fun of it, that we agreed that it was really awful time. A travesty of the national Lampoon name, rating 0/10.
