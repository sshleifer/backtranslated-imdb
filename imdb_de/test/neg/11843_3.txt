I bought a DVD collection (9 films for 10 euros), in which this was included. It turned out to be the "uncut version," whatever that means. Besides the low average quality and short scenes, one of the things that was really weird - the soft sex scene. It started with a close-up of 2 bigger breasts. After about 2 minutes, I had an expression on my face that led to the term "booooooooooooring!" Fit. quite perfect. 7.5 minutes not even bounce off concrete like tits (at this time, the term breasts is a bad choice) is far beyond the entertainment. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was more like "people are not" / stupid are they? "<br /> <br /> I'm glad the DVD was scratched and I got my money back.
