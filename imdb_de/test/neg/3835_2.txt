I admit it now. This is one of the lameest movies ever made. But in the defense of Mr. Sj√∂grens, the "not really" scene was not all bad! <br /> <br /> And you have to love the effort to go to Sweden to find a sweet Swedish 15 year old blonde. Let her pose as the Jewish mother of Henry (Dennis Hopper) in Swedish. <br /> <br /> What makes this scene so perfect is that Henry's father answers the blonde Swedish-speaking (Jewish) girl in German ... <br /> <br /> The best actor / actress of all in Der Film must be the nun who cares about Henry's mother, this is a woman who has no experience with acting, but still represents the most compelling performance of all! <br /> <br /> Alles and Alles flick is personal nostalgia for me, after all, it has given me a post in the database of IMDb. : D <br /> <br /> // feel like a movie star *
