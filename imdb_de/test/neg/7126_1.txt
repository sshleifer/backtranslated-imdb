I went into this movie with little expectations. I went with my girlfriend and two friends, and none of them could tell me the story of Grudge 1. Well, if the first person could not make an impression to explain the conspiracy, then I doubted that would be better. <br /> <br /> Let me summarize what the trailers tell you: the Asian lady is back and so is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Luckily she is not very long. This decision may have saved her career. <br /> <br /> The film has three storylines, and none of it makes sense. And worse: none of them is developed. They almost begin to understand and then someone dies and the story stays behind. Okay, killing people could be scary, but I was more confused about the development of the attempted act than scared. They jump between all three storylines that are not related ... OR ARE YOU?!?! * SOUND EFFECTTT * ~~~ The timing of the three stories is postponed, and you can tell right from the beginning that the movie has a turn at the end. PREPARATION. Oh, wait a minute. Sorry, this is not a Fight Club or Vertigo quality twist, you could see it from afar. And probably imagined a much better turn in your head ... you should have hired me. Instead of the girl who made her "surprising" appearance, could it have been Michael Jackson instead? This part of Scary Movie 4 scared the shit out of me. <br /> <br /> The death sequences were horribly done. Unlike the horror films of the past, where a killer appears out of nowhere, for example, a cupboard or behind a door, and everyone in the theater hops (and the fat guy behind you spills popcorn on the neck) - this did not have a frightening pop-ups. They zoomed in on where the casual Asian woman or kid would show up and you knew exactly what was coming. Instead of making the music really loud, then softly, then a pop-up to filter it out, the music has actually given a timing to the scary scene. If I know it's coming, it does not scare me. <br /> <br /> The film started by explaining what "grudge" is. When a person is killed during a tantrum, a curse is placed in the place where it was killed. Why does the Asian woman, who is cursed by her mother, have a meaning for the story? And why does the resentment now move countries? This movie was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> All he did was treat my friends for getting me up and running - we should have seen one of those animated Pixar movies. It would have been scary.
