I had not seen this for many years. Acting was so good when I started this time, I thought, "Great! Another movie I misjudged as a foolish young man." But then the topic became clear and I felt the same way. <br /> <br /> This was Hollywood, the seat of glamor; So the concept should not come as a surprise. But it's such a condescending concept that I feel like having a shower after watching. In short, it tells us that even physically ugly people can look beautiful and even feel attractive. She seems to have been filmed with minimal make-up. Robert Young is injured in the war and feels scarred. His parents can not bear to look at him. He seems to have all his abilities, and some of the ideas of disability are outdated. Herbert Marshall is present as a blind pianist. His character speaks subdued tones and is omniscient. <br /> <br /> The best performance is given by Mildred Natwick as owner of the title residence. She is bitter and grumpy, but not made of ice. Her story is much more interesting and credible than that of McGuire and Young.
