I could not believe what I saw ... (once) brilliant actors who appeared in that terrible effort that was never to be done. The actions are terrible and the dialogue fades (at first I thought it was a parody), and the action was miserable. Everything about it is bad, from the cheap sets to the wrong scenes, a series of pictures enlarged. Respectable filmmakers are struggling to realize their vision, but this blasphemous, pitiful attempt at a mini-series makes it our TV, with 3 Oscar winners appearing. I can only assume that everyone involved violated the writer and the director and was forced (perhaps at gunpoint) to star in that worthless TV garb.
