After a fascinating start, this little drama quickly falls into the ranks of mediocrity. At the beginning of the film, two women (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meet while they wait for their girlfriends to come home from vacation. Natasha Gregson Wagner is a pretty-looking actress, and she plays Louise. a sweet girl whose beloved friend is an all-round entertainer; Music, movies, as you call them, he does it. As she tells the other girl, Carla (Heather Graham), all about her wonderful friend, it quickly becomes clear that the similarities between her two male friends are too big ... and it's obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy are. Oh man. Enter Robert Downey Jnr, the sleaze bag that has two girlfriends, while a poor guy has to get along somewhere without one. Downey plays the type the ladies like, but men are downright annoying; He is basically a mom's mom. The worst kind too; On the phone, the mother keeps ringing all the time, showering his girlfriends with ambitious (if empty) promises, etc. It's enough to make a normal guy sick like movies like Jules et Jim. This movie does not work. especially because of the fact that their story is so incredible. Seriously, if two women had just figured out they were with the same guy, they would not stay here and talk about it. Another reason why it falls is that it's just so clumsy. There is no end to the possibilities that arise from the situation that this film offers, especially in the claustrophobia of placing everything in a small apartment. but all the film does is lose yourself in dialogue. poorly written and poorly delivered dialogues. The film is also heavily dubbed; It's just unbelievable that people in this movie behave the way they do after finding themselves in this situation. Robert Downey Jr. is one of the many things that are wasted in the movie. With Natural Born Killers, he has proven that he can give brilliantly entertaining performances, and that's something this film can do a bit. The two women are not wasted because no one expected anything from them anyway, but Downey could definitely have been better exploited. A total of? Waste of time. Do not worry, see Jules et Jim or Natural Born Killers instead. That's my advice.
