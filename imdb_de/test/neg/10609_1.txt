It's Friday night, and you want to watch a movie. Anything you want is something entertaining, not too artistic, or anything that requires a long night of philosophical discussion. So you pay $ 10 to see the Mod Squad. The trailer for this movie should have given me a hint, but come on ... it's three of Hollywood's most beautiful people - Eye Candy. But that's it ... a series of Prada ads. And what have Hollywood producers forgotten? An action. Why are these children running after an unknown enemy through the streets? Where are they? But do not worry, after a while you will stop taking care of yourself. I was about to leave this movie because I thought sitting in my room and staring at the wall might have been more productive (and freer), but at that point it was over (90 minutes - it's just one Saving) grace). So still willing to waste $ 10? Go get a nice hot meal.
