Seriously, if I wanted to make a movie that makes no sense and never shows lesbian scenes as its only climax, I could do that. Anyone could have made a better movie, where at least some answers were given and the story was not so slow and lengthy. History means nothing without something at the end except the credits. What a waste of time. I will never get those 147 minutes of my life back and I hope others can learn from my mistakes.
