Hey guys and girls! Never rent, or may God forbid, to buy this piece of rubbish. I have rarely seen a movie in such a bad genre as this one. Acting is actually worse than me and my friends when we were 7 years old and had to act in the 1st grade in front of all parents and siblings. In fact, we would have been included in the rating of the Oscars if we were compared to the actors in Darkhunters. The story is awful, the make-up is terrible, the filming is horrible, the set is awful, the direction is terrible, etc. I really can NOT find anything worth the money to watch this movie. what my girlfriend thought was cute. Please use your money for other things than for this movie ... I could not see the last 15 to 20 minutes of the movie, it was so awful. If anyone really liked this movie, I'd really like that. I hear from you and I'll try to see if I can advise you in a psychiatric office in your area. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, if possible below, not possible. The DVD or the tape is not worth it running ..
