"Marathon" has a very interesting premise, excellent ambient sounds and a good backdrop. Unfortunately, apart from these aspects, the film falls flat on his face. For a woman who tries to solve so many crossword puzzles in one day, she spends a lot of time standing around, sulking and not puzzling. I believe that the film shows more on foot than their work on these riddles. Although I understand the point of showing so many landscapes, there are far too many of them. The movie is incredibly boring and out of focus. It's not worth buying, renting, watching TV or seeing in any conceivable way. I lost interest so quickly that I'm not sure why I've been through the whole movie.
