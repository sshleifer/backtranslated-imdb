As a fan of the reckless and humorous books by the author Gipharts (of whom Ik Ook van Jou is not the best), I was looking forward to seeing this movie. However, I did not see it in the movies and after seeing it on TV, I am very happy that I refused to buy it on video. With a good book, they managed to shoot one of the worst films in Dutch film history. All good parts have been left out, history is changing, not for their benefit. All humor was cut out. What's left is a badly working, dramatic, inconsistent movie I'd never want to see again. <br /> <br /> I pronounce Giphart with this result and am pleased that Robbert Jan Westdijk did a hell of a better job on Gipharts topper Phileine zegt Sorry. Go and have a look!
