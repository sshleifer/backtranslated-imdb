"Bland" is probably the word I would use to describe this movie. I only saw it because it had a good rating here and I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie is about racism in an America after 9/11, and the director went for it with a sledgehammer! The film had no subtlety at all and it seemed they were trying to give the movie a kind of magnolia feel - which is never a good idea as this movie was boring and confusing for three hours just to rain frogs in the end .. . <br /> <br /> All in all, a huge disappointment.
