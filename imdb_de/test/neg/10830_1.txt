This movie does not even have the salvation of being so bad that it is good. It is really terrible. It's more of a parody than a disaster, but unfortunately they were serious. Made for television, but not worth it. It contains every clich√© and cheese moment you can imagine. Oh, will he save the city from the flood? Will his wife admit that she still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I can not explain how bad that is. A terribly predictable storyline that makes you think it's so cheesy Bad Effects (though I've seen fair that I've seen bad water with bubbling) Bad script. Wistful spectacle. Terrible Actually so bad that you should probably get drunk and watch it.
