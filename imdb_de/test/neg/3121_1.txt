It's hard to say how bad this movie is. Even in the 1950s, when the intellectual search for the meaning of life was fashionable, and the rejection of physical comfort, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. by Beatnik was a common reaction to the complacent middle-class customs of the United States and Western Europe, this film would Doing so was a stinker. The plot is a mish-mash of several dei ex machina (if that is the correct Latin grammar); The spectacle consists of deadly stares, interrupted by occasional hysterics (both male and female lead roles). the free view of Catherine Deneuve's (or someone else's) breasts deserves a Budweiser commercial; The repeated cacophonic orchestral rehearsal in the deserted building is certainly important to the director, but to me it's just a stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie - I rant because my time was wasted on this scam sorry for an art movie. The scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot - but under his clothes this king has no substance.
