I bought this movie unseen at a sci-fi convention and got what I deserved to do something so stupid. Simply put, this film is implausible, boring and unsurpassable. <br /> <br /> I was so bored and disgusted by the lack of action that I turned off the rendition of Mythbusters. I understand that this was a very low stage or at least looked like a very low stage, but that does not excuse the terrible acting, the terrible conspiracy and even worse camera work. It looks like something a group of college students did between classes and got drunk. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the rogue were not so ridiculous and the conspiracy was something that could actually happen in real life in terms of the law enforcement can become so bad that it's funny. This movie is not funny, it is just bad.
