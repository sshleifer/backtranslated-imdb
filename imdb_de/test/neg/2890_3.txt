I made bad movies. This is a clinker about an arson attack and a psychopath. Tom Skerrit, whom I really enjoy, was quite young here. He is a master builder with a passion, but he has a partner whose profit motive is over-insuring and burning. In the mix come an agent who has drowned, his daughter and her crazy friend. James Mason plays the insurance investigator. Any idiot who'd received a little warning would know something was lazy in Australia. Nevertheless, they bumble through. The most interesting thing for me was that the huge hotel that was to be built was never more than a pile of sticks. Low budget, I think. The plot could have been interesting. Maybe you should have stopped a movie editor (who did that?). Half the time you do not know where the characters are, but I guarantee that a payout of $ 5 million would probably have forced the structure down. It does not work Although there is a lot of clean fire.
