This movie was cheesy and it was more than that. It was about this guy who curses and turns into a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the title. Before this guy turns into a gorilla, he marries. I was a little upset because she was not a gorilla's bride. She should have married him when he was a gorilla, then the title would have made more sense. There are also all these people in the middle of the jungle and they all want to go. This is not just a B-movie, but rather a Z-movie. I have not even seen bananas for a wedding present. Oh, right, he was not damned yet.
