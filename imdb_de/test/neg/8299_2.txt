Okay, if you like your monster movies dour, stiff, starchy and thundering boring, but with lots of thrushes, then turn right to "Lady Frankenstein," a costly Italian corpse walker. Joseph Cotten ("Citizen Kane") plays the crispy old baron himself and must have really paid for this condo. Sexy Sarah Bay, who starred in cow-less European B films, mostly as Rosabla Neri, including "Hercules Against the Moon Men," plays his ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a disheveled ball gown. Cotten makes an ugly, big-headed monster (it's really so hard to make a nice one?), Who instantly throttles Cotten (who took his Royalty Check & Run) and stuns everyone in sight. Tania (Bay) decides to swap her lover's brain (which is old and wrinkled) with the brain of a younger man (the "handsome" but stooopid) to make another monster, which is the first monster to do the cotten has, throttles that throttles through the people. Well, after long explanations and a few throttles, the two monsters are throttling a bit. Tania stabs the first monster in the back and then has sex in the burning ruins of her villa with the second monster - just to let him strangle her! Doh! It's so much throttled that you almost overlook that the movie is as exciting as a dead carp and moves just as fast. The alpha video version I saw for this review has been heavily edited, and one wonders that the cow has cut many nekkid people, not that the film would have been significantly improved. Director of Theurmer was previously responsible for a number of Euro Z garbage class Z, including "Jungle Warriors", "Island of the Dead" (as Mel Wells) and "The Crucified Girls of San Ramon". The MooCow says, avoid this corpse of a movie and find something moving on a full ... throttle. <br /> <br />; = 8)
