Having lived in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (30 miles from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I wanted to see this movie. It starts promisingly enough with a cursory understanding of the values ​​and peculiarities of U.P. Life. But Jeff Daniels did not appear to be satisfied with a cautious approach that would have been appropriate given the place and the people. Instead, he introduces extremely gross humor and some totally inappropriate mystical / supernatural elements. Although there is a good movie about this virtually unknown region of the US, this is NOT the case.
