'Felony' is a B-movie. No doubt. <br /> <br /> If you look at the cast, you may have high hopes for the entertainment potential. This movie is full of all those wonderful character actors you grew up with, the faces you recognize right away, even if you probably do not know their names. It's amazing that the filmmakers were able to bring all these people together in one project, almost as if they were choosing a B-movie reunion. The cast even includes some really first-rate actors: David Warner, whom most people know about "Titanic" (though my favorite roles are Jack the Ripper in "Time After Time") and Lance Henriksen, who wants to remember the bishop in many 'aliens'. These two actors have done a great job in their long careers and made some very good films. <br /> <br /> As impressive as this collection of actors is, their talents never show on screen. The authors of 'Felony' spent a lot of money putting together the cast of a dream team and missed their golden opportunity for one important factor, the common denominator of all B films: a stupid script. <br /> <br /> We start with a stupid premise. The villains are arrested on tape and commit a cruel murder, and they tirelessly follow the film crew to record the video and destroy the evidence. But honestly, why bother? In the time they were able to track down the film crew, a thousand copies of this tape could be made and distributed to every law enforcement agency and media company. The criminals do not seem to realize how futile their efforts are, and they talk as if the whole problem were solved by stealing and destroying the only videotape. Stupid ... but if the bad guys were so logical, there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> Then there is the dialogue. It is sometimes stupid, sometimes clich√©d and sometimes unbelievable ... everything you would expect from a B-movie. Of course, I have always believed that strong performance can overcome many weaknesses in the material. This cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances, and although some of the performers are not good actors at all and deserve the status of a B-movie, one might still hope that the stronger part of the cast would be in the Able to pour some life into their parts. However, it is disappointing to see that few actors in this film really seem to take the movie seriously enough to do their best. There is not much inspiration in these performances, but it's also a boring script. Well, I admit that some of the colder actors in the cast manage to increase the staging of their lines a bit, but frankly, even the very good actors I mentioned earlier seem to be disinterested and uninvolved in the role of the story , <br /> <br /> Speaking of history ... Even if the acting had been so high that the dialogue seemed a bit less cheesy, she still would not replace "Felony" that its author was the ultimate faux pas of action scripts on a low budget: an action with as many holes as a block of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie a hundred times and you still will not find out how it all adds up. In an effort to create suspense and always advise the viewer, the author throws in all sorts of surprises and unexpected twists in his script and ends up with a jigsaw puzzle, but when you finish, you find a lot of pieces that just does not fit anywhere others that are missing. I admire a good thriller that makes me think, but creating plot twists that only confuse you and that are not consistent with the rest of the story are moody. It has never been explained so much that in the end I was extremely frustrated. If you decide to watch the movie, be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> I have not mentioned all the other stupid things about this movie, but I will not bother about it. The funny thing is that in spite of everything I've said, I have to admit that I can not give 'Felony' 1/10 stars. Although I can not say exactly why, but actually I found this movie quite sympathetic. Stupidity can sometimes be fun when you're in the mood for it. Also, I really like some of these character actors very much, and although their performances are a little lackluster in terms of their talents, I still have a kick to see them from the perspective of a serious moviegoer. It is quite possible that I completely missed the point. Maybe it was the intention of the filmmakers to make a B-movie. Maybe the stupidity is completely intentional. If that is the case and if I would rate it under these conditions, I would have to say that "Felony" is a classic in the genre of tongues strokes. B-movie fans will love to see all their favorite actors in a movie together, they'll get a little chuckle from the script and be entertained by the healthy dose of cannons, explosions and pursuits.
