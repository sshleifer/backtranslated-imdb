I've watched a lot of TV over the years. So much so, that when I see new shows that basically look like repeats of old shows, I get offended. Fortunately, I'm not too sensitive because "Hot Properties" are updating everything that makes the cast of "Designing Women" (ie they make them sexier), and they're filed in New York City instead of Georgia. Are more TV-14-ish, but that does not make the show any better. The only thing that has proven this show is that Nicole Sullivan is so good that she could have made a show like "My Mother the Car" a classic. Her comic talents are reminiscent of a modern Lucille ball - just funnier. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy, which might be good for some mindless soap, but they're just not funny. <br /> <br /> Fred
