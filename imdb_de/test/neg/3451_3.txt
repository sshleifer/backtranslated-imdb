I saw this at my second performance in the world, a few days after it opened at the Dublin International Film Festival. When I went to another movie two nights later in the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier, and the rest of the cast and crew on another graduation program from Studs. I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed with the movie, I had by no means expected a masterpiece, but what I was presented lacked in my opinion all the crucial elements of the genre in which he had incorporated himself. Before I continue, two things, I accept that some filmmakers like to undermine generic expectations, this is simply not the case here. Second, I know it was a play (which I did not read, but was informed that it's not a shimmering piece of literature), but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that permeate the film. <Br /> <br /> My main problem with the movie is the script. Forget that it's based on a play. It just does not work as a sports comedy. The down-and-out team is trying to win a football cup, few The games are shown (if they are very short) and we are not satisfied because of their athletic achievements. If you've read so far, you might think that this is not a rigorous sports movie, but a psychological exploration of the relationship between a "charlatan" of a manager and his hopeless team. That certainly does not reach it, I'm not even sure if it was aimed. Any attempt to illuminate the story of one of the characters is fraudulent and peripheral. Overall, I have missed the script in many ways. <br /> <br /> I think the performances and the music were good and technically the movie was well done. Apart from those points that should be expected of an Irish movie at that time, I left the theater very disappointed. <br /> <br /> My judgment may be harsh, but I believe there is hope for a strong film of national Irish cinema in the near future, and this simply does not support this argument. Since Studs has become a recommended Dublin Cineworld movie (I was part of the audience at this screening), most people seem to disagree with me. This means that you should probably evaluate the movie yourself.
