As Genghis Khan fan, I was looking forward to this movie. After gobbling up Conn Iggulden's epic novels on Genghis and reading a lot of historical records, I feel like I know something about the subject, and was thrilled to share my knowledge of this movie with friends a delusion. This movie is from the beginning made to the end. There are some things that seem right, but mostly it's easy to believe in the authors. It does not have to be a problem, I like good conversation just like everyone else. Unfortunately, it is usually boring. Nothing of the size comes out in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would NOT recommend this movie if you know something about this topic.
