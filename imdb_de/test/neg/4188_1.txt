My spoiler is in my pants, because thinking about this movie made me so angry that I shit myself. <br /> <br /> Once you look at it, you stare in confusion and horror at the TV. Then tap lightly on the shoulder and a voice hisses: "They will die in seven days." You turn around and one of your best friends stands there with a touch of absolute hatred for the one who suggested this movie when you were in blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I will not lie: this is the worst movie on earth. I saw it with five of my friends, all 18 year olds, and these were our reactions: - One person actually started crying and beating - One person was screaming and fainting - One person got up and stumbled through the front door for more than an hour later, a person just got black (this one was me) - a person was babbling incoherently as if he had both cerebral palsy and Touretts syndrome - a person got into a kind of catatonic trance and did not respond to our voices for more than twenty minutes <br /> <br /> The movie is really that bad. There is a part where the retired cameraman actually stumbles (while holding the camera in his hand), but the producers decided to leave the camera there. Seriously, you hear him grunt and swear when he touches the ground. There is only one special effect, in the same way as a backward child trying to solve a rubix cube, something special: the camera rotates so that the action on the screen (action, n .) Some fools in a cornfield for 80 lost has Freaking Minutes) makes a drum roll. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should it be looked at, and the movie itself even alerts you to this fact. Do you know what the slogan is on the back? "Some warnings should not be ignored." I honestly think that publishing this movie is a sick joke to the public. That's not to say you should come by if you see it in the movie business. It would then stand on the shelf and see other poor guys. Instead, buy every copy you can get your hands on and send it to people who hate you.
