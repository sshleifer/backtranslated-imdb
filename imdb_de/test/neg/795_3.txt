Before you dismiss my post as "not received", let me say ... I'm one of the biggest fans of Richard Kelly and "The Twilight Zone". Donnie Darko is one of my absolute favorites, and I even thought Southland Tales had his moments. I'm a huge science fiction fan. I was very excited to see "The Box", could not wait for it to come out. <br /> <br /> After I said that ... "The Box" is terrible. Behind "Drag Me To Hell," this was the worst movie I saw in 2009. And he just does NOT end! Whenever you think you have reached the end, another change of action and you will be ready for more torture. At the end of the movie I actually groaned in the theater ... I could hardly stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with "The Box", no matter how you cut it or justify it. It's just that it makes little sense. Trust me, I got it, I understood what was going on. But that does not mean that it makes a lot of sense to look back. Take the basics, for example. The main couple ... Cameron Diaz and James Marsden play Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses her finances through her job and complains her husband that they are "living paychecks to paychecks." Sell ​​this f-Porsche your husband then drives !!! You live in a beautiful 2-storey house in a nice subdivision. Marsden seems to be paying heavily on NASA and Diaz is an accomplished teacher. And yes, Marsden drives too expensive a car. But they somehow live from salary to salary?!? You do not need to press the button, but reduce your expensive lifestyle a little! The film would have worked better if the couple had been unemployed and in serious debt. Instead, they seem desperate for money ... living a luxurious lifestyle. As I said ... you can understand what's going on, and yet it makes little sense! That's a rare combination. <br /> <br /> There was a horrible scene in a library that I believe is considered one of the worst segments of film history. It was idiotic, illogical and out of place. I can not really describe it, so I go over to a subplot that involves nosebleeds and possession of aliens. (Yes, I'm serious, unfortunately). A child is in Diaz's class with a wicked smile and a smile on his face (a sullen smile that seems to go completely unnoticed by anyone in the school). He begins to ask Diaz personal questions and literally embarrass her in front of her class. No punishment is imposed on the child ... he was not even asked to stay for a talk after class! Then Diaz is at a party ... and the same child belongs to the hired helpers ... ironed shirt, apron and everything! I do not know many alien-obsessed kids (who are apparently in junior high) who also do moonlighting as busboy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials ... but we've found one here! (See what I mean ... you can fully understand it, but it still does not make sense ... a rare combination!) How many things in the movie does the boy come and go ... no real explanation about him, no End to his character. It continues ... A woman goes to Diaz in a grocery store and tells her that experiments are conducted secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. Well ... hmmm ... if aliens have the powers to take over a body from afar ... and the aliens do not want to help Diaz ... who took over this woman's body and gave Diaz advice? ! Again ... The lady was trying to help Diaz ... and the aliens were not interested in helping Diaz ... so who the hell was controlling her body ?! Never explained I never talked about it again. No nothing!! It goes on and on, as it seemed to me, 2 weeks. It would not end! I wonder if this movie has ever undergone a massive re-recording. It was badly edited. Diaz's accent was there for a minute and the next one left. Negotiations began but never ended. The numerous push-backs of the release date obviously show the problems the manufacturers had with the final product. It is really a train accident. <br /> <br /> Pass this on ... there is no redeeming value. 3 out of 10 just because I like Diaz and Sci-Fi! But it probably deserves a 1 in 10th. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading! <br /> <br /> JD
