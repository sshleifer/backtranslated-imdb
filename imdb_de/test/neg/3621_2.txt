Zoey 101 is essentially a girl named Zoey, who goes to a boarding school for boys in the first year when girls go to boarding school. This raw action is, I must admit, a pretty good idea. Although this show was intended for children, a five-year-old could probably point out his deadly shortcomings. First, Zoey is a clich√© character, she is very popular, super attractive, super smart and there's nothing wrong with her; No girl is like that. It feels like the show is putting Jamie Lynn Spears in the limelight and raising her fame. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just mean. In my opinion, she was probably the most realistic character of all, which is sad that Dana is never nice. Nicole is too melancholy and behaves like a complete airhead, but mysteriously he just gets ones. Lola seems to fool anything with her emmy-earning acting skills. Quinn is supposed to be very smart, and although she's able to create the most unrealistic things, she's also weird and she never gets any men, though she's both pretty and smart while Zoey, Lola and Nicole get guys and they are all beauty and no personality. Chase and Michael are very similar and sometimes I even confuse them. Logan is unrealistically rich and distributes millions like dollars. Nobody is so rich. I've also noticed that every character in the show is mean for this Stacy girl who does nothing but act nice to them. That's not funny! This is mean and it affects just young girls when they act for totally nice people. Finally, the school itself adds the unreal cake by offering students 5-star amenities such as a quaint location, a sushi bar, a hot lounge with free soda vending machines, a pool & hot tub, a movie theater, and boy pay and girls can freely go to the dorms of the opposite sex. In most boarding schools, a boy would be excluded if he went to a girls 'home or a girls' home. <br /> <br /> In summary, Zoey 101 was poorly written and would have spent a few more years in the making process.
