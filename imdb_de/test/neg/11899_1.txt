Having just watched the movie, I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This takes away my worst movie award from Komodo, which is not an easy task. It is neither a porn nor a legitimate movie and it gives them a bad name. The drama, the camera work, the storyline, the script and the sound are all terrible. My personal favorite part of the movie is the duck who asks the bartender if he has grapes. Why was such a joke included in the movie? Did the director think? "I need a humorous scene to make up for the great spectacle, so I'm going to use a shitty joke that I read on a Laffy Taffy wrapper." Another retarded part is when Norman spills the invisibility potion on himself while trying not to spill it. Why did they even bother to rate the film with NC-17, did they hope to reach the widest possible audience? At least if it were rated X, it would be more sexual and the viewers would be distracted from the overall low quality. I'm praying for someone who has been working on this strip slip-drop to answer.
