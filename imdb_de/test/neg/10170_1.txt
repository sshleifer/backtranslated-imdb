This is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen. And believe me, I have seen many movies. The incredible twist that makes the movie - from an extremely poor "alien life-forms inhabit the Earth" movie with disgusting bad drama, to a movie trying to spread an Arch-Christian "The Fiery Debt of Hell" message - stunned me after being tortured for 85 minutes. Even religious Christians need to be ashamed or angry when they see their beliefs so published. I did not know what to do with myself as I watched the terrible acting that 7-year-olds could have done. Simply disgusting. I am not a Christian and not very religious. But if I had been, I would not be afraid of hell anymore. Rich Christiano has shown that it is much, much worse.
