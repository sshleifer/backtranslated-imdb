I collect movies with Ms. Weaver, so I only bought her because she's there. I find it really strange that her early career is filled with so many horrible films. It started with an incredible promise in alien, but then had a lot of bombs. These bombs include this movie, Deal of the Century, One Woman or Two and Half Moon Street. She also appeared in The Year Of Living Dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than notable. In the time between Alien and the sequel to 1986, Aliens, the only movie she made was Ghostbusters. I am sure that before the release of Aliens everyone thought this woman was on the way. Luckily she was not. <br /> <br /> Back to Eyewitness, however, the movie is boring. It does not generate tension. William Hurt seems like a box, and the atmosphere is just too dry. Sigourney is decent, but nothing to remember. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have to, but do not go into the expectation of a decent movie. Watch better movies with these two stars like Accidental Tourist and Working Girl.
