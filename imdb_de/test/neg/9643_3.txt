The story is not very strong. Do not expect a kind of "Bourne identity". It started with a strong Tara who spoke Russian and it even sounded believable. (Not that I'm an expert in Russian.) Moscow had that bleak, depressing look that gave this film potential, I still believed it. Too bad that it only took about half an hour to see that they really missed the spot with this one. The drama was bad, maybe because the story itself was not very strong. There is this part of the film in which Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) with the C.I.A. talking on the phone as if you were listening to a Chinese Synchronizer. W.T.F!? Too bad, the writer has not even bothered to lend depth to the main characters. A bit cheap and just over. <br /> <br /> The plus point is almost every scene in which Tara Reid is. But she looks really great in this movie. Overall, it was a disappointment. Rental equipment? Perhaps.
