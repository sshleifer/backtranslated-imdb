This review requires only three words: a piece of manure. <br /> <br /> If you've enjoyed watching the cartoon as a kid, you'll find this movie a complete waste of your time and money. The best part of your two hours in the auditorium is your feet, which stay on the floor. <br /> <br /> Yes, they use all names and keywords. The straight name of the dog "Shoeshine" (in relation to the dog "Shoeshine Boy" in the cartoon). They call the love interest Polly, but she is not Miss Sweet Polly Purebred. <br /> <br /> My wife and son deafen me to see this. They had to drug me to see it. <br /> <br /> The original underdog was pronounced by Wally Cox, the ultimate nerd. This is voiced by someone with a "Smart Alleck Teenager" who knows more than any adult. <br /> <br /> Being a stand-alone movie is terrible. In tribute to Underdog it is even worse. It is not a tribute. It is not a retelling of the story. It is not an update of the story. It's a sheer attempt to make money and create merchandising with a well-known title. The next time I go to the store, I'm afraid I'll see underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothes, and so on. McDonalds and Burger King were probably fighting for the childrens food rights. <br /> <br /> But the worst part of this movie is the soundtrack. YOU DO THE UNDERDOG THEMED SONG TO RAP (read that with a quiet "C" in the beginning)! Great, now that we want to destroy something, we go all the way. <br /> <br /> I knew it would probably be bad before I left. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local Plex 12. I found out that they opened it on the first day and were first shown in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four without stadium seating). Even the theater people knew that it would be garbage! Save money on tickets and invest better by buying the original series on DVD. It will be more entertaining and have better production values.
