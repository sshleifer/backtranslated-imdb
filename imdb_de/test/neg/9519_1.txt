What can I say about this movie, it is truly one of the worst gay-oriented films ever to come from the UK. I can only imagine that Diana Quick and Georgina Hale need the money. What a story is there is such a mess that you quickly lose interest. It should be based on real events. All I can say is that it is an insult to the characters of real life. The DVD is currently available in the UK. It's either available in split-screen format, which makes it even worse than the full-screen version I see. Gay movies can be so much better and we deserve more.
