Mr. Accident is a deliberate series of uninterrupted disasters and near-death experiences reminiscent of Saturday morning's Warner Brothers cartoons. Like the Coyote falling off the cliff five times per episode, the "leading man" (more like an overgrown klutzy kid) manages to postpone his meeting with the Grimm Reaper. <br /> <br /> This Australian "surprise" is aggressively offensive and sometimes even depressing, the two (out of ten) are for visual stunts (some that have never been tried by anyone before Daffy Duck) and use vivid colors (as in these high-class national detergent ads). <br /> <br /> There may be an age group where this "comedy" finds a following. I've definitely passed that age long ago. Call all preteens: Here's a " ha-ha "for you!
