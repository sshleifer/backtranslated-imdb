Hollywood will stop at nothing to earn money for a movie, even if they have to carry clich√©s and put them in the most impossible and stupid situations. This effort is a clear example of this, and I truly believe in my heart that a film like this is racially irresponsible. The story is about a divorced lawyer named Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) talking to a lady on his computer. When he finally meets her, it turns out that she is the opposite of what he had expected. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) is a stocky black woman who does not intend to go out with Peter, but instead wants him to look at her case, where she was convicted of robbery. He wants her out of the house forever, but she turns up at inappropriate times. To save his job, he reluctantly agrees to look at the facts regarding their case. <br /> <br /> ******** <br /> <br /> Peter has his children with him and Charlene proves to be helpful in the resurrection, but suddenly a newscast announces that a fled convict named Charlene Morton broke out of jail. Peter tells her to leave when the FBI snoops around, but he learns that she's actually innocent when her old friend shows up and threatens him. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Adam Shankman, who keeps things moving at a good pace and it's a good-looking movie, technically speaking, but the script is so unlikely and every character is a stereotype, that a 1970s movie titled "The Landlord" is clearly in line with racial relationships as this mess. I've always been a big fan of Martin and think he's one of the most talented people, but he loves to work all the time, and sometimes he seems to pick any script handed to him. On the other hand, I have always had a problem with Latifah, and the way she rushes into Martin's life is so exaggerated that she becomes instantly irritating. The basic requirement that Hollywood loves is the black hip, which turns on its head to relax and pass on a street logic that helps them with their lives. That's basically the story, but of course they have to dress Martin in black and make him look like a retarded Eminem, because Hollywood knows that's what the viewers want. Well, I was pretty offended by everything in this movie, and that's not because I have no sense of humor, but unfortunately (for Hollywood anyway) I use logic and common sense when watching a movie. Yes, I enjoyed Eugene Levy's conversation, but do we really think he would be attracted to Latifah right away? I suspect strange things have happened and how often is a lead actor shot just to be saved by something in his pocket? Would not a cell phone crack if hit by a bullet? Even if you're the most stubborn Martin and Latifah fan, I would not recommend it. I know, I've said that before, but this is not an attempt to make a good movie, it's an excuse to try to make money!
