I do not think Haggard was the funniest movie ever. I like CKY and Viva La Bam much more. I think many of them were just stupid and had no plan to be a movie. I strongly recommend not to pay much for this movie, but if you like Viva la bam, CKY or Jack Ass, you should see it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. I think Jonny Knoxville should have been in the movie because he's a much better actor than most people from Haggard and probably could have made this movie more fun. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor, and it should have been more.
