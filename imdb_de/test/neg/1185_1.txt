Please look at all 3 series again and do not watch this movie. The trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a poorly thought out 25-minute TV episode into the most painful 2 hours of my life, really a horrible movie. tubbs and edward are in for a few minutes, micky has a line, and her lipp just makes the same tired old word games, besides, the mister briss accent only changes about 5 times in the movie's tons of badly working extras, and really one Couple laughs that they seem to recycle for 2 hours I honestly feel that this series has been ruined by this horrible bitch. Batman and Robin are all forgiven
