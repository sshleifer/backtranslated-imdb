I searched for ATTACK on Precinct 13. There the movie is so memorable. Who is the star? Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I can not say who the main actor is, that's a pretty big point against the movie right there) Gabriel Byrne (who could not have needed the money so badly?) Drea De Matteo is stunning but only because of that her amazing body. It took me forever, until she finally found out that she is Joey's sister of "Friends". I agree that the so-called SWAT people who attack the station are pretty lousy in terms of tactics. In the RAF basic training we were even given a better basic knowledge. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, even if the snow does not want to fall on a bus full of prisoners! Very poor continuity. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague!
