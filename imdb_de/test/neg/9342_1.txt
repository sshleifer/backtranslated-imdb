I will not comment much, what should ??? Stereotype characters, absolute ignorance of the Colombian reality, terrible staging, bad color choices, NOT funny (it's probably a comedy, and you expect to laugh because there's some other music besides the nonsense scenes), Very Bad Actor (If you see these people somewhere, I mean the interpreters, then you know that they are at least good, but if you call this movie that way, it's impossible to guess that you're tired of the music ... this "comedy" has no rhythm, the only good rhythm, it is the rap song in the credits ... pathetic, is not it? etc ... etc ... It's been a long time since I saw a movie that bad !!
