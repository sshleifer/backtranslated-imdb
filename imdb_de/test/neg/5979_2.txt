After about five minutes, you are thrown into this brutally lukewarm cat and mouse romance between the two main characters, and it only gets worse. The biggest problem is the characters and how unbelievable they are. For example, 50-year-old producers and incredible Hollywood scriptwriters think that Stoner life is like giving a pot to the cast of Friends. Boring, boring, annoying and totally unrealistic. I despise this movie.
