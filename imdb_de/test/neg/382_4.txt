Begin with Fulci playing a version of herself and writing down some ideas on how people might die. Followed by a fake-looking cat who presumably eats a brain. The copy I watched was dubbed in English, which I always hate, but I was particularly disappointed not to hear Fulci in his own voice horror movie. His stomach turns when he sees things that are similar to the effects of his movie, and he begins to hallucinate that he is watching terrible acts. He visits a psychiatrist who hypnotized him and unfortunately did not think about his improved mental health. I was reminded of the psychiatrist who was played by David Cronenberg in Clive Barker's Nightbreed (1990). The shrink in this one is played by David L. Thompson, who is pretty bad. Probably a true friend of Fulci, he has a big grin when he kills people, though this may be Fulci's black humor at work, which I thought was pretty poor. <br /> <br /> The film consists of a lot of clips from Fulcis films, either as if Fulci was on set, guiding them, watching recordings on TV or witnessing the file. I've never been a big fan of TV series television shows, and I also think Full Moon Entertainment is pretty lame by Charles Band, which cuts in on their old films and puts three of them together as new anthologies. I think they have to make money? <br /> <br /> The shrinkage factor of Cat in the Brain refers to the theory that violence in movies leads to violence in real life. A Fulci employee talks about a documentary crew following Fulci to see what his life looks like. Many self-related things like this. <br /> <br /> In the end some characters sail on a boat called "Perversion".
