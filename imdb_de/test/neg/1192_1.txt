Do not get me wrong, I love the TV series of League Of Gentlemen. It was funny, twisted and totally inspired. I was looking forward to the movie, the premise was interesting and I was looking forward to seeing what they had done to the characters and where the bizarre plot would take them. <br /> <br /> For beginners, this was a total disappointment. The three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bits for the other characters (why not go for Mickey & Pauline, Papa Lazaro or tubs and Edward decide for the main parts?). It was thoroughly listless, half-baked gags and bad slapstick humor. <br /> <br /> The real mastermind was the just ridiculous period drama / comedy (and I'll loosely use the word comedy). It distracted from the main story and felt awkward, not to mention painless mischief. The direction of the film is appalling and often has the feeling that the lines within a take were delivered by the characters. Very rushed. <br /> <br /> Then - the three-headed plasticine monster monster. What was it all about? just ridiculous, it felt like the League of Gentlemen had marked them at the end. <br /> <br /> All in all, I looked at my watch and sighed with disappointment throughout my experience of the movie. What was once an amazing television series was stained by a terribly inglorious movie. <br /> <br /> If I could give it 0 out of 10, I would. Do not waste your money if you see this.
