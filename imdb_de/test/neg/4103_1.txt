My friend recommended this movie to me. I should have known he should not look at him because my friend is a video game nerd. But the name and the cover made it look good for some reason. I was so wrong. I mean, what's up with their suits? And the acting! It seems they have freed the people from Barney. Except for Ben Kingsley. And why was he even in this movie? Did he think it was a comedy? But I have to say, the special effects were pretty good. But that was the only good thing. I mean, seriously, the movie is worse than Pearl Harbor. And that's actually an understatement. Everyone must have thought "Oh, I get paid, so it does not matter if it's the worst movie in the world." I would understand why someone would make that kind of movie when he directed, acted, produced, wrote, and made his hopeless best friend to film and edit. Probably one of the worst science fiction films ever. A really beefed up movie
