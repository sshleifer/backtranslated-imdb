Bette Midler is the best thing about this movie. It's a BAD second after the 1962 original with Natalie Wood as Gypsy. The songs were much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bettes voice was great and she looked better in most costumes than in Cynthia Gibb. Only someone who has not seen the original would think that this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> There was not enough change between ugly duckling and pretty girl. When Natalie Wood Gypsy was, she was only considered beautiful when she first got into the dress with her gloves to perform in the burlesque show. If she has her hair down and then she is magical, everything is beautifully done and she looks so elegant. This is an important aspect of the movie, because it's also the first time that Gypsy sees herself as something special and that she's actually a star, not just a bad substitute for her sister. And the scenes, in which she is slowly becoming famous, were played through. It was an important part of the movie and they slaughtered it. It is important to show that she is more content with her future as a stripper, and the costumes are amazing in these scenes of the original. It was a big disappointment to see it in this movie. I was completely disappointed and would not have turned off the movie to Bette Midler.
