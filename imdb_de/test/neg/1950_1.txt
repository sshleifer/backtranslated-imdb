I had noticed that this movie had been a lot on Cinemax lately, so this morning I decided to look at it. I just finished the infiltrator, which is a great movie, and I thought that looked good, too. From the description, the cable had at least. This movie was awful. It's slow, the pace is awful, it feels like it's going to take 4 hours. There is no real conspiracy to speak of ... agh! How can anyone say something good about this movie? Rickman is good ... but he's always ... the other two characters work well, but there's no real story that supports any of that. After two hours and you sit and wonder what's going on on Earth, where on Earth is the conspiracy. It ends with a surprise that has obviously only made me sick. Do not bother with this.
