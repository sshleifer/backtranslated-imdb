Originally, the Spider was planned as a four-part series, and that shows. I do not like trains. They are usually ridiculous, confused and banal. This is no exception. In the first part of the spiders, "The Golden Lake," a wealthy adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals - the spiders - to steal Inca's gold. It follows a stupid love triangle with some cowboys and Indians. The sensationalism and the exoticism did not entertain me. <br /> <br /> You can understand themes from this two-part series on Lang's later, far superior work. And the filming is better than any other series I've seen from that time, including "Les Vampires" (1915). In the Spiders the camera is not so static and luckily this movie is fast. The tint and lighting is sufficient. None of this, however, is remarkable. However, it is almost unimaginable how much this series resembles the series of Louis Feuillade. The criminal gang dresses and behaves as in 'Les Vampires' - only the names and, to a lesser extent, the situations have changed. <br /> <br /> More comments on The Spiders can be found on the internet pages.
