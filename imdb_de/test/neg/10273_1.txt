I am relieved that the later reviews have gotten angry - after reading all the positive feedback, I began to worry that my understanding of movies (and life) was completely different from anyone else in the world. Everything in this movie was wrong for me ... the characters, the dialogue, the manipulative soundtrack, the stupid narrative, everything. As each scene unfolded, I always thought, "People do not act that way." It is ruthless and maudlin. In a way, I think the movie makes you like the movie, or pretend that you like it because it's serious, that it involves real people, and that you have questions. But man, it really did not work for me.
