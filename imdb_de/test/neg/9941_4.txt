I read several reviews asking the question, "Why was this movie made"? I found that question in my head as the hour and twenty-minute movie seemed to be in the middle, just to make it feel like it took off in the end, though in fact it did not do anything like that. So, "why was this movie made"? I think that's a great question for those who are passionately fearing to ask themselves. This reviewer is proud of director Knut Erik Jensen, who gave us this powerful image of hope, fraternity and inspiration with this all-male choir, but I do not think Jensen has done enough to bring a gripping story to the table. Let me ask this question: "Do viewers need more than just a direct story to keep interest"? My answer is yes, and here Jensen has failed. Heftig og begeistret was a good documentary, but it was anything but great. Jensen has done a terrible job with the history and dedication of the subjects. It was great to hear the songs, but over time these songs seemed boring, overwhelming and a bit precocious. From the opening scene where our men sing their hearts in blinding snow, I knew I was addicted, but as the movie progressed, I lost interest. Why? Jensen never took us, the audience, to the next level. He kept the playing field and eventually hurt the overall sound of the film. Was this a movie about the music or the men in the choir? The world may never know. <br /> <br /> Once again I would say that Jensen has done a phenomenal job to find an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely experienced difficult times and how they endure music, but it was as if the all-male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created. Jensen gave us the music brilliantly, but it was the characters, the topics that I did not know until the end of the movie. We had a 97-year-old man who still had his driving license, we had a big man in a tub who sang classical American songs, we had old men who were heart attacks in their teens, we had some tension between the teens of the choir and the veteran singers, and we even had a former drug addict who had been clean for eleven years. Has Jensen ever developed these interesting stories? No, he left her on the table. It was obvious that these singers were ready to talk further (see the political man who had missed his political days), but Jensen seemed to be freeing himself from those heartfelt moments and immediately went back to interesting places where he got the Could sing choir. For me, the music was defined at the beginning of the film, I wanted to introduce myself and hear the stories of these individual men. They were all fascinating, but Jensen seemed to ignore them completely. <br /> <br /> By ignoring the main themes of this documentary, Jensen did not manage to create tensions towards the end. Without betraying the end, I felt like Jensen was coloring the lines. Instead of being brave beyond the borders, he decided not to create a moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness or sadness. Jensen brought our subjects from point A to point B to point C, without asking us to get involved in any way. I can see how the national mood has made this film a great success in Norway, but more was needed for all the other viewers (ie H. ME). I wanted to feel for these guys. I wanted to know if they would do well on their journey or just be loved in their own city. There was no story, mostly no development of the topics. If you watch modern documentaries (the film was strangely filmed in 2001), you want it to be played like a Hollywood movie. You want suspense, realism and drama, unfortunately you get with Fierce og begeistret nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to ask the question again, "Why was this movie made?" My last answer, Alex, is that Jensen wanted to show how troubled times and a changing economy can make happy even in the coldest places on earth. I think Jensen wanted to show human commitment and how something as simple as singing can unite a population. Jensen has shown that perfectly in this film, but not created a good documentation. When you make a film of this kind, I feel like you need to look into the group, examine the chorus participants, and hear each one of their stories to reach an end that grabs your heart. The only thing that grabbed this movie was my attention span as he tried to leave the room at rocket speed. Again, I do not want to sound negative because the music was excellent and the men who sing aroused a sense of honesty, but I needed more. Since documentary films have become an integral part of the film community, you expect something more than what Heftig og begeistret has left us. I want to see reality and people, not just another song and dance routine! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** from *****
