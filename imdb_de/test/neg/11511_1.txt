I do not think this show is funny at all. I think it's a lot worse than any other horrible Disney comics. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice for Sadie because she can not act. The jokes in this series are terribly listless. All the worse, when Justin Bradley is the only actor to have a bit (and I mean a bit) acting talent, Sadie's brother is Hal. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo portray Sadie's friends. There were both really stupid and terrible actors. Two words that really can describe this show are terribly trite. It's a crazy humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet. Now I have explained my hatred for acting and terrible humor. What's next? The whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. She has changed again (not so scientific and ben loving) and suddenly nobody recognizes her anymore? It is feeble-minded. On the whole, I hate this show, but little girls who do not have a fun concept will enjoy it, so I think they choose quality. Although I can say so much, the first season is clearly better than the second. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM: ONLY NO MONITORING. <br /> <br /> My rating: Terrible show. TV G. 30 min.
