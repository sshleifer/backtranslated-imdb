Oh Gawd. I'd like to go back to the Monogram Studios and strangle someone in his 2-room front office for this sloppy musical. It's one watt over 60 minutes of just 61 minutes and then actually shows (for a thin minute, in milliseconds over the hour) that there are real-life talents that are poorly photographed. Look at the point, yourself to take care of some difficulties to make this film, which can be easily energetic and actually funny and lethargy as the main thing to see. The weird plot shows Grace Hayes and her curvy variety trouper gushing into a college where her son-in-law is a rich college clown. She'll fix his Playboy ways no matter what. Her real son (weird-looking) Peter Hays plays her screen son. His wife in real life plays her secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suspect this talent package was almost the goal of Monogram funding for this back-lot musical produced by resident bowler Sam Katzman. As with other Monogram musicals, it seems more like a reason to re-film recently purchased furniture and fixtures to show other studios that Monogram Pictures are "wasteful" in their B-class. Check out SWING PARADE OF 1946 in a gruesome way for real evidence: they've just built this gigantic nightclub set and then found an excuse for actors and musicians to roam everywhere. History? None. Nevertheless, ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where were Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed them? Presumably he was standing in front of the PRC Pictures boom gate, wondering if it seemed safe to enter. Junior Jive Hepster Roland Dupree comes to life and taps two wobbly dance numbers with his teen legs, especially in the finale of the "big show" in the new and expanded Malt Shoppe / Club set. The usual crumpled curtains hang loosely on the back wall, and the stage set with mismatched curtains even has a dark main lobe torn to and fro as each amateur sequence passes the previous one. The choir girls and their very simple-looking partners in this finale look as if Monogram employees borrowed for the morning shift (from the typewriter and carpenter trade). They have absolutely no dance skills and are so common on the screen ... ALL girls look like they're all called Joyce. There is even a costume catastrophe in which they wear ruffled hot pants ... only on one leg. It's all so dreadful and bleak ... and annoying if further adaptation of all those involved would make ZIS fun in the first place. The only strange thing is the dialogue between Grace and her son-in-law: it's delivered so casually that, despite the script and logic, it actually works. She has a very living presence, which is the only thing that makes the ridiculous story easily captivating. The Dupree kid is the real star. He can actually do something ... even though he looks like a tub. Liberace is dancing the teen ... you read that right.
