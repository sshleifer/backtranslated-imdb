Obviously, I did not expect much from this movie, which runs directly on DVD, but this movie is so straightforward that it is unbelievable. The only part of the movie you might find funny from afar is, before they even come to the island, where Eddie's son is blown up by a jet of water from the bathroom and then it's time! Why are they even bothering? The first Christmas holidays with Chevy Chase were brilliant and hilarious. This is not. They rely on jokes about a dog with flatulence and a character called Uncle Nick, who is about 80 years old and constantly trying to compete with beautiful women. When they approach the island by boat, the island in the background just looks so spotty and while Randy Quaid is funny in the previous movie, has just played too much and seems like he's trying too hard to be funny. You were warned!
