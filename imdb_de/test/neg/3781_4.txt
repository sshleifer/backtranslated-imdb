It is really easy to roast, fry, peel, and otherwise burn this film for all its many shortcomings. It was made by high school students and faculties and a whole community; it shows! Sure, I could investigate the script, which is just ridiculous. A monster created from the garbage of a growing Californian city is beginning to eat garbage and garbage bins all over the city. Soon, this huge winged beast starts destroying buildings and even plays the "Beauty and the Beast" with a young girl from high school. Luckily for her, there's a group of guys, her former boyfriend, nicknamed "The Penguin," and the town is drunk to help her. The direction is terrible, the production values ​​simply terrible, the action does not exist and the tempo slows down. The film is hard to sit through - point. However, it is also a miracle of a movie, considering that this thing was made by a whole community. You can see all the collective effort from the actors, the actual mayor and the actual firefighters and police to the site shots used. I was also really amazed at the resident companies who helped finish the movie, help fund the movie or in any way contribute to it. If you look at the film from this perspective, this is indeed a remarkable achievement. I did not know about it before sitting down and watching it. Well, since I've heard about it, I'm impressed. But do not make a mistake - I have no ... NO ... desire to go through it again.
