Harmony Korrine - hate him or hate him? Regarding this evidence, saying goodbye could be a better word. Of course not he, but everything he does. But it could have been so different because the first ten minutes of this movie promise so much, including the fantastic idea of ​​a Michael Jackson impersonator falling in love with a Marilyn Monroe impersonator. Fantastic. And set in Paris! That could be great. But unfortunately, Korrine can spark the strange decent idea, but since he is a terrible author, the story fails on every level and the tour of the audience, which I experienced in about an hour, is the best proof that he is the most boring and the most presumptuous movie there is. Apparently, the walk-out rate at the Cannes premiere last year was pretty shocking. Instead of focusing on the two protagonists, he stupidly changes the story to the boundaries of a castle to introduce a series of other impersonators that make the entire experience boring and narrative barren. When will independent cinema stop financing this rise?
