Crazy Six is ​​torture, it must be the worst movie by Albert Pyun. Even Blast and Ticker are better! I can not believe how boring this movie is! How did that even turn green? I saw this movie about 3 years ago and I only remember how bad it was. This is not a good bad movie, it's just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (½ from *****)
