This movie is a third attempt at a captivating, moody thriller that fails miserably on all three counts. I just managed to keep my attention as the protagonist slowly and predictably broke all the rules of life he had set for himself at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> But in the last 25 minutes, things are starting to really wind up. A vaguely plausible plot (and that's generous) becomes completely ridiculous, as suddenly new characters appear out of the blue and random and bizarre events are never explained. <br /> <br /> That would not be so bad if the scripting were not so cheesy, the acting so wooden (despite a strong British cast) and the direction so uninspiring. This is not an example of good British film production and should not make Tarantino bat an eyelid, at least not compared to his earlier work. <br /> <br /> My advice in this case, if it's hard to pin it down Do not waste the effort. If you're a Briton like me and you're in your local video store, you're fine. Perhaps you are watching the video titled "American Beauty" - now this is an example of a great British trend.
