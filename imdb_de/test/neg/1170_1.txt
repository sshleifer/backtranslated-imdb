The title says it all - Ed Gein, the Butcher of Plainfield. <br /> <br /> This is not an action-packed slasher movie made for teenagers who love energy drinks. That would fit into a well-established genre, as some people find it entertaining, something like "Halloween" or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre." <br /> <br /> This is dark, slow. filled with hacked corpses and softly angry. There are few shock cuts, no visual shots of a monster, no loud electronic notes. I do not know who it is - maybe ghouls. <br /> <br /> Among the credits, we already see photos of skulls, suspended carcasses, skins draped over the backrests of chairs, things like that. And they are so outrageous that I could not help believing that this film was going to make up for the Grand Guignol opening well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately not. The spectacle is equally terrible, as in a high school. The script does its best to sink under vulgarity. Ed Gein, who killed only two middle-aged women and possibly his brother, chases a screaming, bloody young woman through the Weir forest. She wears only a modern bra and a modern bikini and no classic underwear. Gein also beheads a night watchman, which he never did in the historical sense. <br /> <br /> The direction? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes, lawyers discover an abandoned car splattering the windshield with blood. There is no one. The pretty young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests to look for the victim who may still be around and live. The sheriff, who has no motivation, calls to him: "Now forget that! I do not want you to leave half of everything!" It should not be more than a business exchange. Why does the director have the sheriff so angry? Characters of various kinds listen to radio programs or records that play old jazzy pop songs - for example, Louis Armstrong's "Is not Misbehaving". This is - what - rural Wisconsin in the 1950s? And the characters insist on music that appeals to customers of the Cotton Club in Harlem in the 1930s, or New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. Nope. The radio would play Kitty Kallen's "Wheel of Fortune" or Theresa Brewer or, just as likely, Lefty Frizell. Not that the dysfunction between the music and the events contributes anything to our understanding of what's going on under the pictures. Someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs, that's all. <br /> <br /> Of course you can only do so much with a small budget, but it can be a few years ahead of the butcher. In "Ed Gein," with Steven Railsback, you'll find an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his tendency to dead bodies and to a budget that could not exceed this manyfold. These comments all relate to the first twenty minutes of the movie. That's about as far as I could. If anyone found this story to be good and fascinating, try to get a taste of it. It's under me - and I consider myself rather out of sorts.
