I'm a big fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt. I think the best qualities of zombie flicks are the sense of solidarity and the need to survive. This film focused more on a "let's just do it" view. <br /> <br /> The movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. As the zombies emerge from the ground and tear down the guy, blood is spurting from the hole. I did not realize that holes in aircraft floors bleed so much. And the original zombie lady, Kelly or something, showed the worst acting I've ever seen when she woke up feeling sick. I laughed a lot when she died. Deserved it in every way. <br /> <br /> I was a bit confused why Dr. Kelly could talk after she became a zombie, but then there was nothing that another zombie had uttered because of angry screams and screams. And they seemed to kill the zombies pretty efficiently by shooting them in the gut, but as Dr. Bennett is ejected from the plane into the engine and removes most of his lower half, he can still live in the end. <I somehow felt that they had changed things to make a "good" scene. As one of the bitchy girlfriends (I did not take the time to get her names, they played a pointless role) in the bathroom, she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. Was it a two-way mirror to see Mile-High Clubbers? I have never broken a mirror in a plane (bad luck and so on), but I doubt that there is so much space behind it, with the insanely cramped space of the actual bathroom and the few. <br /> <br /> The few The redeeming qualities were unfortunately too late. One thing the movie had were the smoking, hot flight attendants, but they felt the need to kill everyone but one. And I admit I laughed a hell of a lot when the old lady pounded on Frank's arm and he says, "She's gumming me to death" or something. Honestly, I'm sadly wasting my nine dollars on this movie. The fact that I bought it underage somehow solves it, but still ... It failed on many levels. Stay with Dawn of the Dead and 28 days later.
