Steve Martin has always had my respect for being a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor, and I loved "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and "Bowfinger" --- but "Bringing Down the House" definitely is not Martin's funniest works, and it does not even seem like it's trying to be what's just sad ... <br /> <br /> I do not know; Maybe I did not like this movie because I rented it together with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and "Phone Booth". Both are excellent movies, or maybe because I'm used to being much better of Martin, or maybe just because I'm in a bad mood today ... Still, this movie was just not that funny or entertaining and I never managed to do more as a smile or a faint giggle at Film Gags, which is really a shame, as the previews of this comedy were so promising! I expected "Bringing Down the House" to be a complete comedy bash, and I certainly expected more slapstick comedy and inter-racial laughter from Martin. Instead, we "face each other" with Queen Latifah's shaking on screen and trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character. The funniest thing about this clunker is Eugene Levy, but even if he does not get the screen time he deserves, I really would have liked to enjoy "Bringing Down the House," but I did not. I would find it very hard to do it for everyone recommend, except for the die-hard Steve Martin fans. Skip this and rent "planes, trains and automobiles" instead ... <br /> <br /> You have a much better time.
