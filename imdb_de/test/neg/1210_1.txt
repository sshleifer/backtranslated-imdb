As a retired USAF MSG (Aircraft Mainst. Spec) this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The fact that a teenager could ever get into the airline, let alone get into an F-16 is ridiculous. The military spends millions on every pilot to make him the best in the world, and this film makes the Air Force and all its members at best stupid. Yeah, I know it's just a movie, but it gives the message to the younger people that we're all idiots, and believe me, we're not. The logistics of setting up missions of every kind is very much involved. Even in the 1980s, military computers were too safe to be hacked by any teenager, and the other shortcomings in this movie make Peter Pan more believable. Sorry, for me this movie has no entertainment value at all.
