Harry Knowles has a quote on the front page of the DVD labeled "The Next Icon of Horror." Really?!?!?!? I've heard a lot of hype around this one, but I was not completely convinced. However, I am a diehard horror fan and will give any horror movie a chance. Regardless of the budget or rating, you'll never know where to find the next gem. Not here. Not Hatchet. Hatchet is poorly designed, badly played and not funny. Just because you have the actors who played Freddy Jason and Candyman, and a buffy chic that's topless topless does not make you a horror expert. I do not even want to describe the plot because it's so idiotic. Honestly, my money is on Rob Zombie. There is a man who knows the horror of the old school. Forget this garbage.
