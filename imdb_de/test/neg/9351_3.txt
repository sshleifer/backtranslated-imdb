Long ago, in a distant galaxy (sound familiar), water has become the most valuable asset (this must be familiar) and a small minority controls its distribution (which is a surprise, just a heart attack and dies of this surprise). A group of ice pirates (water renegades - wet bandits? ... oh, the last one was used) are trying to find the way to a fabulous, unlimited water supply with a beautiful, but spoiled (Druish?) Princess and a group of idiots? he? despicable villains in the persecution. <br /> <br /> This movie has the potential to be a really great comedy parody ("Star Wars", David Lynch's "Dune") being handled improperly. I think the term is "low brow" humor. It has not really been possible to be so funny, which is a pity, since there are Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich (hence the three stars), who are not exactly negligent in the acting department. <br /> <br /> Definitely a rental and definitely a drink directly.
