I recently rented this promising mini-series. I did not know that she was adapted for television. I was really looking forward to it because the book icon is one of the best spy thrillers I've ever read. What a disappointment. The plot is just loosely similar to the one in the book, the characters are completely wrong and there is a terrible spectacle. Really a shame. The story behind Icon is perfect for the screen, but I think the TV budgets are not big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book. <br /> <br /> Forsyth earns much, much better. Avoid and stick to the book, which must be read.
