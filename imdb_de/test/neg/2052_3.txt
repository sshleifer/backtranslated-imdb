What on earth? Like seeing an episode of Neighbors after drinking two bottles of cough medicine nightmare and making no sense at all. I've been waiting for the clever part where everything fits together and saves the movie. Maybe it was there and I just missed it or was lost with me. <br /> <br /> My biggest suspicion is that it's a thinly veiled attempt to launch a new drug on the street. I would not say "do not pay attention", but I'll say it's pretty poor at every level - like a drama in High Def. Beat unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup. Then it's just dandy.
