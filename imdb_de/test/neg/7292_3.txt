When I put this movie in my DVD player and sat down with a coke and a few chips, I had some expectations. I had hoped that this film would include some of the first movie's strengths: Awsome animation, good flowing story, excellent voice, fun comedy and an exciting soundtrack. But to my disappointment, none of this can be found in Atlantis: Milo's return. If I had read some reviews first, maybe I would not have been so disappointed. The following section is for those who saw the first movie and liked it primarily because of the points mentioned above. <br /> <br /> When the first scene comes out, it's a shock for you if you chose Atlantis: Milo returned from the showcase in your local video shop (or whatever) and had the expectations that I had. The music feels like a bad imitation of the first movie, and the Voice Cast has been replaced by a less fitting one. (Except some characters, like the voice of Sweet). The actual drawings are not that bad, but especially the animation is a sad sight. The plot is also quite weak, as it resembles more three Schooby Doo episodes than the single adventurous story we last received. But do not get it wrong, it's not very good, Schooby-Doo episodes. I did not laugh once, though maybe I chewed once or twice. <br /> <br /> To see the audience that has not seen the first movie or is not particularly interested in a similar sequel, here is a quick review of this movie as a stand-alone product: If you liked schooby-doo, you might like this movie. If not, you can still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suspect it might be a good children's movie, but I would not know. It might have been better if Milo's return had been a series of three episodes on a cartoon channel or on breakfast television.
