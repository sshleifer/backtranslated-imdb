In the history of cinema, there have been a few films that have deceived the viewer, such as Hitchcock's "Stage Fever", Alejandro Amen√°bar's "Abre los Ojos", David Fincher's "The Game" and this "Ausentes". At first I do not like this kind of filming, I feel like someone is trying to pull my leg. <br /> <br /> after watching this movie, you do not know what happened is such a confusing movie. Although kubrick's "the shining" may be a better or a worse movie, it is definitely more honest than this burden of pretensions and dubious situations. <br /> <br /> Technically it's good - nice photography, good performance and so on, but the script is so bad, I wonder what the producers were going to do to screw this crap out. <br /> <br /> and this movie notes that the three guys who wrote the script (Calparsoro, Loriga and Quiroga), lost in the cinema trying to create a masterpiece - or doing something to their stomach to meet and wait for more personal projects.
