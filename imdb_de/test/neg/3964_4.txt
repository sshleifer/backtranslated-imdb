Popular tale of the hero "Benji" ("Higgins" the dog), which represents many different things for many different people. In his busy day, "Benji" has breakfast at the home of two young children, talks to a law clerk, chases an old cat, and reminds an aging cafe owner to get started with the special of the day. Helpers for some, fun for others, companions for all. <br/> <br /> Trouble arises when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the deserted villa he calls home. From here we know that only "Benji" can save the day. <br /> <br /> Plot is routine by screenwriter / producer / director Joe Camp and he tends to exaggerate the slow motion effects. However, the audience will find it hard to resist the lovable little puppy, and children of all ages will surely love him. The cast would never be anything else as the background for "Benji". <br /> <br /> Not what you would call inspiration, but fun for the family. Oscar nominee for the theme "Benji's", "I Feel Love". <br /> <br /> Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video
