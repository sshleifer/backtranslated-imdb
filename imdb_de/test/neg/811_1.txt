Founded in 1945, Skenbart follows a failed Swedish book editor who decides to go to Berlin on a non-stop train. Unfortunately, for all around him, it is a disaster that causes chaos everywhere. The train also holds a man and his lover planning to assassinate the man's wife (who is also on the train), a soldier on his way home, two gay elderly gentlemen, an angry train conductor, two nuns, a host of refugees and even more people. <br /> <br /> Meant as a mixture of noir-ish thriller (which he does quite well - at least in the beginning) and comedy, the movie fails with both. It does not sit right because the movie changes the sound with each new scene. And as the train approaches its final destination, the movie becomes more and more bizarre and ends with a truly surreal touch. <br /> <br /> The good parts are wasted in countless pointless plots and characters. Skenbart is packed with famous Swedish actors, no matter how small the role. It feels like the filmmakers call everyone they've worked with and offered them a role in the movie. Too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script (Act your line - do not read them!). <br /> <br /> The comedy is more or less slapstick, with always the same jokes. The tempo is sometimes (often quite often) incredibly slow, with the scene continuing in particular for about ten minutes without any good reason. The scriptwriter also seems to think cursing is a good way to replace a decent dialogue. The film looks great in atmospheric B & W, but in every other department it's wasted on such inappropriate films. [1/10]
