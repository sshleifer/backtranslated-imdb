If you've seen Atlantis 1, you know that what made this movie really great is a brilliant animation and a good script. This movie was so sloppily drawn and animated. The story is stupid too. I was so disappointed with this half-baked dumbass that I did not make it in the first hour and MAN tried! The only thing that had this movie was that it expanded the "mole" character and made it both more sympathetic and three-dimensional. Take it from me, rate this garbage from the cover on the video box. The cover is badly drawn by Disney Schlock and clearly uses an unsuspecting parent. If this was a stand-alone movie, it would not be so bad, but if you walk on the fur boots on a shiny piece like Atlantis, it's absolutely inexcusable.
