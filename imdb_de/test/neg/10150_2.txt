So one day I was in the video library looking for a movie. I found it and rented it because it was a movie I had never heard of. <br /> <br /> Now I like Slasher movies in general, but that's just miserable, not even good for laughs. Besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all Slasher movie clich√©s and terrible acting, it has the most incompetent and unsuitable direction I have ever met. Now sometimes the above qualities can be present in a movie and it can still be a bit of fun, but not here. Painful example of homemade horror.
