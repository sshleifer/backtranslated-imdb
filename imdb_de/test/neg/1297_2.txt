This movie was totally garbage. I was just sitting there looking absolutely angry that this was being funded. They definitely spent their entire special effects budget, not the scriptwriter and the director AND some actors. <br /> <br /> At first, the acting was bland and rotten. The story was not well known to the audience. The narrative was not seen from the perspective of the peoples of the storm, but rather from government officials and the army, which is really no way to connect with them, since most of us hate politicians anyway. The author tried to add a human element to the unrealistic characters by adding the little subplot about father and son that had failed completely. <br /> <br /> As for the direction ... oh God, try his techniques and create tension and discomfort are repetitive and exaggerated. The accelerated camera movements and sudden flash breaks on a character's face when something terrible happened were miserable. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw him until the end was the special FX. This is a bad thing, as special effects are not supposed to do the movie, but just reinforce the story and the experience. There was no story. <br /> <br /> I really would not bother to see this, total garbage and embarrassment for the British film industry.
