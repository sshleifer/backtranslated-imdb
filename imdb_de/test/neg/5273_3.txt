Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the best actors of the 90s. After appearances in The Usual Suspect, Se7en and American Beauty, more and more are expecting him. That's why Ordinary Crent Criminal is a big disappointment. Michael Lynch is the most artful criminal in Dublin, who is never in a bad mood. His next robbery becomes an obsession as his partners begin questioning Michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, though that's the only thing he does when he's not playing a good dad at home. <br /> <br /> I think that's partly my fault that I did not pay enough attention to the thousand details that unfortunately turn out to be the "essence" of the movie. I gave the film a chance by calling it a parody and ... well, parodies are always funny no matter what they do or how they do it. So it was not a deliberate parody. It's just another scam film that desperately tries to be funny and fails. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of his "peers," Ordinary Decent Criminal relies too much on story development and logical continuity and forgets the main reason. The viewer decided on this kind of movie - to be entertained. This is definitely not a conversation. It contains one of the most ridiculous scenes of all time - the introduction of Michael's TWO wives. I do not know if it's a kind of mindless metaphor or a strange, dark humor, but the chicks are sisters. Remember that the character of Spacey has children. <br /> <br /> Ordinary decent criminals are complex and confusing. They are not waiting for a funny scene. Instead, carefully follow the dialogue, as it is possible to lose yourself in the boring, pale universe that inhabited the film. <br /> <br /> Let us return to Spacey. I wonder what condition he was in when he signed for this movie. It is not a misstep, but something worse. An insult to his work published in American Beauty, a year before Ordinary Decent Criminal. The character Michael is eccentric and talkative. Spacey is almost pathetic sometimes. The only cure for this is to think of Lester Burnham and Roger Kint. Gerrard Stembridge, the writer, should definitely rethink his screenwriting skills, and this time be more objective. Because the dialogue is very weak and the scenes are often meaningless. And we're still talking about a comedy. <br /> <br /> Ordinary Crent Criminal is a really bad crime comedy that does not deserve your attention.
