This movie is a disaster from start to finish. The film consists of 75 percent of scenes from HERCULES & THE HAUNTED WORLD and HERCULES & THE CAPTIVE WOMEN, which were poorly processed along with original scenes that yielded nothing but a complete rip-off. I'm a big fan of these two films and the scenes that were taken from them, edited and dubbed with nonsensical dialogues, made my head spin. This kind of cheap producer tactics to make more money by fooling an unsuspecting audience killed the Sword & Sandal genre back in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is a memorable scene in the new footage in which Hercules fights with the evil Hercules. The fight is cool and Giovanni Cianfriglia, who plays Antaius, is definitely outstanding. He makes Herc an unforgettable nemesis. But the rest is embarrassing at the border, which was probably shot in one day. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs!
