While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after the first five minutes of the film, I could have stopped there and continued my life. She receives some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not really enough to increase the validity of the film. <br /> <br /> I also felt that she had gone overboard with a lot of things. If a man said a dirty comment, grabbed her, or made a vile gesture to her, I'd say go away, bring him down, he's a pig. What bothered me, however, was that they would run around in revealing clothes and be surprised if the boys were watching them and making them hell out of human sexuality and much of who we all are. Men will look at beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just as women look at men wearing a tight tank or no shirt at all. Some women may hate me for that, but I hope not. I have a lot of respect for women. I was raised by one. I also come from a spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother was the center of my family for many years, but I do not think that has contributed to supporting women's rights, and as the filmmaker herself said, some women were offended by her project.
