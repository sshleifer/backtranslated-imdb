Step Up is a fair dance movie about some kids getting their big break. The movie is average in every way and slightly more for the viewer. A jock fights against external prejudice to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teacher who sees something special. The drama was good, but dialogue and direction had little to contribute to overcoming a predictable story. Still, you still feel pretty good about the result of the movie. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers going a bit overboard. This is a class B + movie with moderate continuity errors and dialog errors. The scenery was good and the characters stayed alive. It's worth the clock if you like this kind of movie.
