This movie is the worst I've ever seen. You may think that you've seen some bad movies in your time, but if you have not seen them yet, you do not know how horrible a movie can be. But wait, there are worse news! The studio will see this masterpiece (I'm ironic) soon for everyone again! The only thing worse than the plot of this film is the effects, the drama, the direction and the production. Bill Rebane, Ed Wood of the Poor Man (not Ed Woods of a Rich Man) (I like Ed Wood's films) manages to keep things in this movie at a snail's pace. It begins with the conquest of a baby bigfoot (a littlefoot? -She could not help) from a pair of unlikely hunters killed by their parents. As a result, the entire city in which the hunters lived went on a Bigfoot hunting jihad. That's pretty much everything for the plot. Nothing happens, even from a distance, and we viewers can never bother with any of the characters. If anyone is interested in the films of Rebane, I would recommend almost everyone else. As I said earlier, Troma will re-release it shortly to give birth to a new generation of movie goers.
