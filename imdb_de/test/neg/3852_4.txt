The only reason anyone would like to see this movie is John Leguizamo. I remember the previews and it seemed like another second-rate comedy. But the fact that Mr. Leguizamo played the main role, tried to solve it. His name, as known then or not, tried to sell it. <br /> <br /> I was quite disappointed with the performance of Leguizamo. His days at "House of Buggin" (a clone of "In Living Color") were his insider tip. There is a fine line between wackiness and idiocy, and we'll just say that Leguizamo crossed it ten times. He looked like he was trying to be outrageous and crazy for the camera. In fact, I say that he tried too hard. Madcap humor flooded into stupidity, and the movie got spoiled. I can not say that I blamed him. If you had this opportunity, you would try so hard if you could, right? Your appetite has cost you dearly, Mr. Leguizamo ... <br /> <br /> The Pest follows the tradition of every comedy movie and plays the "racing card" and more. There will be no group of peckers. Among the chosen are blacks, Latinos, whites, Jews, Koreans, Germans, homosexuals and blind people. Again, things are too big and too much trying to be faked in too short a time. The dissolution of the film takes only five minutes to clear up and return to normal. <br /> <br /> If you have a movie and for comedy reasons, deal with plot and reality, just make sure it's funny, or you only have 90 minutes of pointless movie. What Leguizamo's "plague" would summarize ...
