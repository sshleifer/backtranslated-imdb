I finally rented this video after searching it for many months. At first, I just wanted to see it, because I'm an absolute Neil Pearson fan (Patrick, a friend of Isobel, the lead role). The film, however, is very well placed without Neil (although he behaves very well in this film, he is overshadowed by the three main female characters). It's an eerie, intense movie, as the British do so well - definitely a "chick strip" of the house and the isolated environment that gives the movie an almost "Wuthering Heights" aura. The movie is full of excitement and ending, shocking but somehow inevitable. I'm glad I saw it, the wait was worth it
