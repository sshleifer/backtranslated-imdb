Big D.B. trying to maintain peace between the settlers and their red brothers. Boone (an aging Bruce Bennett) must try to prove himself to the local Indian chief (Lon Chaney, Jr.), who seems to be drunk as usual) that his son was killed by the leader of the tribe who also rifles has handled if nobody is looking. Faron Young sings, though he holds his rifle like a mop. <br /> <br /> Okay, a Western adventure run by two guys, none of whom has a lot of credits on their CV, but this movie is not bad and has a nice short running time of 76 minutes.
