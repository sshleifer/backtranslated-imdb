I researched something about Ed Gien and found some interesting things. For example, the fact that Ed Gien was quiet and a loner, not like this movie. I'll say I did not finish this movie, but I'll do it. I'll shudder by the fact that we all, Wisconsinites, speak as if we were from Kentucy. You know, the funny but oh so sad factor in this movie is that Wisconsin is not as hot as it looked. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just an insult to Wisconsin people because I'm a Wisconsin myself. But it's a complete insult to a man who has proven to be an insane, lonely man. He killed two people and the movie could not even do it right. Ed did not get so close and personal and scared people, he shot both of them and only the people he killed. Why are these films lying and saying "BASED ON A TRUE STORY"? This is not based on anything, but on the lies the director has found in his bad brain. <br /> <br /> A joke and nothing else! <br /> <br /> OK, I would like to add this. I have finished this oh-so-sad movie and would like to personally laugh about the director. Do your homework when shooting a movie. I want to tell you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been to Wisconsin) and oh there is no desert! Hell, there were more pines and snow in Ravenous, and that was about to be shot in California. <br /> <br /> OK, for those of you who do not know about Ed Gein, I'd like to give you your history lesson. It has been suggested that Ed Gein killed his family, but it has never been proven. He killed a bartender. She was shot near a bar when no one was there. He brought the dead bartender back to his house. 10 years later SHOT and he killed the store clerk, he stole the cash register and the loading cart. He was caught for this murder, he came the day before when her son was there and asked for antifreeze. The day he killed her, he was there and bought the antifreeze. The reception, which had only anti-fertilizer, was the only evidence that they had to launch a worldwide manhunt. He robbed graves, in deprived graves. He hates the people he has dug up and made Furinture; Lampshades, sofas, chairs and other things. <br /> <br /> He had a family he had dinner with once and they threw all the meat he ever gave them when he was caught, considering he was caught in their house , He was arrested and hid in a police car for fear of what might happen to him. How do I know all this? I read the book written by the judge who tried him. <br /> <br /> After the movie was over, after I had looked at the whole terrible thing, I was not only hurt by the terrible view of the directors, what Wisconsin women look like. I mean, it was hard to say who this guy had half the time on the record. You know that women in Wisconsin are all BLONDES. You're welcome! I am overly offended by the lack of homework this guy has done and the bad work he has done for this film. I have no idea who this Kane guy is, and I think he may still be okay, but he did a terrible job playing Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> After all, I'm so sad that I wasted $ 3.99 on the movie. <br /> <br /> Film after completion was completely untrue, this movie is like I said the world is flat and George Washington was not our first president. Come on, guys, that's your story, and that's the story of Wisconsin. How would you all feel when I make a movie and George Washington looks like Brad Pitt (some of you may think that good, but it would not be true) and he lived and was not the president and whatever. You can not rewrite the story.
