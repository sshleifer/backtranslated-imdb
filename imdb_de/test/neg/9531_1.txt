I'm one of those people who respects every filmmaker I've achieved, every respect I see, though I have to admit that I choose it carefully. No longer. This is really one of the worst scripts I've ever seen as a movie ... so much so that I felt compelled to warn others about it. The dialogue was truly incredible, the main protagonist was the last person I wanted to know more about. A scene in which an old school friend "says it's as if" only made me laugh because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of an already completed action. The direction is at best and in the worst case after numbers. To compare this movie with the atmospheric majesty of a movie like "Five Easy Pieces" is a travesty.
