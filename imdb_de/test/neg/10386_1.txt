Blackwater Valley Exorcism is located on a small ranch in the city where the dog Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) with dog blood wanders around. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch and are deeply worried about her daughter. Lately, she has not been herself and is seen as a danger to herself and others. Ranch Hand & Ex-Priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognizes Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession. When she starts to speak the old Latin with a strange voice, he becomes convinced of it. Blanche calls on priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo), the ex-husband of her other daughter Claire (Madison Taylor) to see Isabelle. He confirms Miguel's suspicions and accepts the task of carrying out the exorcism, which will hopefully release the demon in Isabelle & an innocent girl. .. <br /> <br /> Under the direction of Ethan Wiley, I was sitting in front of my TV in my home watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism. I asked the same question over and over again. Why do I do this? Why am I sitting through those horrible low-budget horror movies that look like being shot on a camcorder? Right, frankly, Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete and completely unencumbered rip-off of The Exorcist (1973). They literally tick off the most important plot points the two share. There is the obsessive teenage girl who starts to get very horny and suggest inappropriate things, the demon who uses past offenses against others, the worried parents, the way the possessed girl is shunned by a doctor who Priests with a worried past and the obsessive girl is tied to her bed. I suppose where the exorcism in the Blackwater Valley is different (apart from his total crap) is that he tries to give the whole character some time and to understand how the situation affects them, but it is so poorly written and It seems that in the end it is boring. The movie starts with Isabelle already obsessed, so we never knew her as a normal person, so we never really care about her or what happens to her, the rest of the character is poorly written and pronounced. Sometimes I wondered if the exorcism in the Blackwater Valley was a parody. There is a stupid scene in which a veterinarian tries to calm the obsessed Isabelle with horse calmers. After declaring that she needs a "small tail," he enters her room with a large hidden needle behind his back! There are some scenes in which people are accompanied by a strange sound effect. The film has an uneven tone as a result, as it lies between stupid spoof and serious horror drama, or at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> According to pre-opening lyrics, Blackwater Valley Exorcism was on "Actual Events", yes, true events from 1973 that took place in a movie called "The Exorcist" ... This text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest. There is not even a decent gore or exploitation to bring things to life, there is the scene of an arm, there is a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix and that's it. There is also surprisingly no bad language in it, though the demon tries to be offensive. I would imagine that the only reason why Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is a very brief scene where a pair of breasts is seen. A pair of naked female breasts is not worth watching or the money you could spend on it. There is no fear, no atmosphere and a really amateurish feeling for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 1,000,000, I have to say that I wonder where all the money went, the movie looks ugly & cheap throughout. There are no special effects to talk about, and production values ​​are low. The acting is very poor of all participants, the genre favorite Jeffrey Combs has almost the top billing during the opening credits, but has only a cameo, which accounts for about five minutes of screen time. Even if he must have feared how bad this would be if he hid behind a mustache and a terrible accent, he is better than this. Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete rip-off of the exorcist without anything, which has made this movie a classic & the creators are already 35 years late. A total turkey from start to finish.
