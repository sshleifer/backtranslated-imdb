Okay, there are a number of ingredients to this film: <br /> <br /> First, hire a lot of hillbilly truckers - good old guys who have a secret desire to take the law into their own hands. Second, in evil hillbilly-cops controlled by a Texas-bred outlaw. Third place in karate fight trucker, played by Chuck Norris. Fourth brought in a jerk-off teen when Norris's nephew was captured by evil Hillbilly police. Fifth show Chuck Norris fighting in slow motion. <br /> <br /> Now you mix everything together and what do you have? <br /> <br /> You guessed it ... a very mediocre movie!
