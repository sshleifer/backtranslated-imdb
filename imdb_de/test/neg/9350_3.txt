I can not shock this movie too much, because it's obvious he was trying to do the movie bad, or, if you like, "Campy". However, many of the pieces they actually wanted to make fun of are often just for the cheese factor. Take a look at the "Space Invaders" game, which is actually played in real life! Scratch your head on the limping robots ... oh, the crazy one! And watch how the whole thing goes far beyond the top with Time Warp! And the sexual allusions just keep on flying ... I'm actually surprised that got away with a PG. Well. A fun way to waste a few hours, but Star Wars is not, people. 3 out of 10.
