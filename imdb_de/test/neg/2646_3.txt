Although this was a well-told story, I found it too uncomfortable. The main theme is child abuse, which is never funny - a dirty topic. Add to that a lot of profanity from the drunken man and a GD from a small child - and this movie has made me as outlandish as I've ever seen him again. <br /> <br /> Again, punks were shown picking the two little boys, another uncomfortable viewing experience. The realism of the story makes a swan when one of the boys flies away with a homemade plane! Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The only positive, enjoyable part of this movie is the kind, loving and touching relationship between the two young brothers, played by Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello. The latter became a familiar face in the next few years with major roles in Jurassic Park, Shadlowlands and The River Wild. Of course, Wood was not tall until a decade later, but he became very big in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. These two children and the story of an unjustified Tom Hanks are the only facets of this movie that I liked.
