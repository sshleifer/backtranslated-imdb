Since I'm a fan of hospitals and medical shows, I've found them rousing and sometimes humorous (especially the scenes with Dr. Whitman) that brings a bit of loud relief. However, I was looking forward to the last episode because I expected the bad guys to be punished and the good ones to be reinstated. Instead, the hospital management makes an incredible fool of himself and it gets worse and worse for the good guys. You can not ask yourself what the unions are doing, or do not Rob, Donna and Maria know what unions are for? It's also a bit depressing to never see trees, grass and sunlight outside. Did anyone understand what the last words were? the answer that Rob Lake gave to the question of the children of Mrs. Strawberry: "Why are you telling us all this?" It was very frustrating not to be able to understand it.
