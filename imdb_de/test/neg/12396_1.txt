This was a pathetic movie. The alien was decent, but the film itself gave compassion a new meaning. The plot is something that has been done over and over again! This makes it the worst! The acting was c ** p, the scenes were often too dark to understand what was going on. Nobody was worried about the main character. The movie was far too slow, and the murder scenes that were there were stupid and did not look more interesting than the rest of the movie. There are some movies that are "shit" but can still be enjoyed due to the absolute indignation, but that does not even have that !! Whoever made this movie thought he could do something good and they failed miserably. The movie has nothing to offer except headache. Avoid it!
