This movie does it on the CGI. I mean, sci-fi. They did it. The original '' BATS '' is better, no cgi is used as in the sequel. In this movie, it's the simple people who run by mutant killer bats. and really bats in Afghanistan ?! The conspiracy is for US Army soldiers to find a terrorist and be attacked by bats and die <_ <, but the reason why I gave this movie 3 stars is that the camera blows at the soldiers. Acting is bad and that does not look like a horror movie. in this whole movie is a pretty good TV movie for sci-fi stations. But if you like sci-fi movies like this movie because you like channel 43 and if you fall asleep during the movie, do not be surprised. Oh, excuse me, I think I'll give you 2 stars instead.
