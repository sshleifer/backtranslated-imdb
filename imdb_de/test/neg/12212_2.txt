James Marsh's The King is a movie that puzzles me. I can not think what it is for. It is a story about a young man named Elvis, played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who after three years of naval service receives an honorable discharge, then searches for his biological father and behaves dishonestly with him and his family. It's all pretty sick. Elvis invades the family by seducing his 16-year-old sister, Malerie (Pell James). It is quite impossible to identify with this film from here in Central England. Preacher father and joyous Christian congregation; I could not figure out if the movie should despise her for her mindless beliefs. Or is the goal the happy family, and we believe that this is not viable. OR it just means that some people are lost and just seeking destruction. It's flat We all know that bad things happen. The interesting thing is why, but this movie just shows a violent act without enlightening the thinking that has led to it. "The king" is such a missed opportunity. There are some really interesting questions about honor; the Warrior Code; the changing concepts of bravery; Honor killings in Indian families and so on. Honor is a very varied concept. But this movie just does not add anything to the idea. However, Paul the projectionist has done more than his meager role suggests. The DVD projector showed all the movies in a green only sound. The only way to fix this was to send them to Belgium. He did that over Christmas. I think these post-workers and repairs and Paul went way beyond duty, and our reward was that grim movie. But you may see it differently?
