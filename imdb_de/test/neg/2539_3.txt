On a return flight from London, I saw her as the man; Apparently, Air Canada has a policy for crap. Maybe that's not the best way to start a review of this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves football so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to build a team at a boarding school in town. Even if you check your opinion at the door (on a 6-hour flight you have to), the story is implausible and ridiculous. There are some moments of humor, mostly from the comedian David Cross as a principle, but the complicated love polygon does not arouse emotions, though it is cleverly mixed (with the proviso of mindless plausibility). The end is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest. I think if I was a 12 year old girl I would really have enjoyed this girl.
