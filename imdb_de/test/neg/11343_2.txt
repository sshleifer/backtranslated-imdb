Dear Sirs .. Be sad (or look forward!) .. We are in the disgusting forensic TV series from Series-ERA !! Now count with me and make our fortune: "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Crossing Jordan", "Da Vinci's Inquest", "EVEN" Cosby Mysteries "! ... Did not we already have enough ?! <br /> <br /> From the late 1990s to the late 2000s, we have almost the same sick series about the ingenious criminologist a partner (or team), clearing up the crime by examining the autopsy ... and what a disgusting mission it is to do so you will certainly have many, many repulsive scenes where we can see the most horrifying shots in the history of TV. <br /> <br /> Oh god ... Once we had the great days, the good policeman (or detective) ERA like Columbo, Kojak, Magnum and Simon & Simon, or the good old sci-fi era like The Six Million Dollar Man , The Bionic Woman or Knight Rider and oh man, we also have the hot & sexy like: Cover Up, The Love Boat, Baywatch, even a flop wi e Thunder in Paradise. All were unforgettable, original and good. .real good thoughts, action, women .. Until the X files came .. And then it was the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact: the disaster! <br /> <br /> X files were undoubtedly one of the biggest, but there were a couple of slight drawbacks, we had agent Dana Scully (doctor and FBI agent) on every episode that did an autopsy, and of course you became Lap (how the series succeeds) Part of our living room, so The thirsty financiers were thrilled with all the physical terror and the exciting search for the truth. Therefore, they tried to repeat it in a different, not too broad classification: The Forensic! <br /> <br /> But it got so ugly, full of deformations and very crude like BONES. Plus the unsexy gift from Emily Deschanel and bleed like David Boreanaz (he was much better at Angel) and all those corpses. To the extent that every time I saw it, I found out that my self AAAAHHHHHH !! What a terrible money !! .. <br /> <br /> Please cancel .. You have canceled really good shows like (The Lone Gunmen) or (A Man Called Hawk). Here it is a bad one. So please .. Tiny grace and enough with the Bones ERA !!! .. or we are dying of nausea and monotony!
