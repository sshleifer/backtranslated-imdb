Guy Pearce almost looks like Flynn, and that likeness is the only one that this movie can claim. Nowhere in Flynn's autobiography is the character of Klaus Reicher mentioned, the homosexual encounter is speculative fiction, and the film's claim that Flynn has mistreated domestic work is groundless. Director Frank Howson has not made any memorable films, and I think it's a pity that he slandered Flynn for no reason to further his unremarkable career. <br /> <br />
