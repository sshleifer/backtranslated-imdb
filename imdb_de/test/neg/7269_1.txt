This movie is awful. At first I thought it might appeal to kids because of the cuddly ewoks, the angry little people of Stars Wars. After watching this monster of a movie, I am sure that not even a 4-year-old would find this movie interesting. The special effects are by far the best in this film and compare well with other TV movies of the 80s. The script is bad, the actors, especially Aubree Miller and incredibly bad and the movie is so predictable that I still can not believe I could not touch the forward button on my VCR. However, I was close to shutting down this mess more than once.
