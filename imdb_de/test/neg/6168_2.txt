Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ..... In my opinion, not a bad cast, but they were totally wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> There was no right direction, there were no unusual things In fact, the whole movie was very predictable from start to finish. Mickey Rourke had a really annoying buddy who just irritated you from the start. Rosario Dawson was totally wasted and there was little point in having her character in the film herself. <br /> <br /> I really think that this is one of those DVD movies that everyone will quickly forget. Too bad, because the movie could have been so much better.
