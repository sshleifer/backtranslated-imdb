..delete the good, memorable movies from such movies. It is not entertaining, touching, funny, interesting and sometimes feels a little subhuman. The principals behave as if they were put on another world in a worse way if they are to relate to each other and to the audience. <br /> <br /> Conventionally enough. Rich kid gets new car for graduation, but the Dean says he can not have the car until after the ceremony. Nevertheless, he enjoys riding and stays in the diner on the wrong side of the track to quickly quarrel with the local Jokeln. Smart asses the waitress / girlfriend of the boss. Shockingly, they play chicken until they accidentally burn down the diner left three minutes ago (are not they all five feet from the gas station?). They said they had to pay the price in court The only reason to get this fish out of the water to stay in the city is the scenario that both boys have to help rebuild the restaurant. Worse than that, the rich kid, when he was with the childless family's child ... in the room above the loft. This "room above the loft" has saved many people who need a bed. <br /> <br /> Inexplicably, the rich child is treated well by the girlfriend, who never mentions that he almost killed her. This is of course not good with her boyfriend and is never fully explained. You do not know why Sam (Leelee Sobieski) falls in Kelley (Chris Klein) or why Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it. <br /> <br /> Chris Klein is tolerable, Leelee totally unbearable and Josh makes no impression. The character with the most life is the judge, who condemns Kelley and Jasper to help rebuild the restaurant. She gets at least one funny comment that is more than any other. Everyone is so grumpy and humorless that you'll feel a little when you even think about smiling during the movie. <br /> <br /> The end is one way to finish the piece, not the most original, but at least it was over. I do not like throwing away a movie a little girl anywhere in the world could really love, but since I'm not one, I have to. The nicest thing I can say about this film is that it is not mean, and although it does not force it to come from a beautiful place, its innocence and its homely, insidious dialogues. 10.4.
