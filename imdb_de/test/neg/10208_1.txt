I worked on this cruelty ten years ago. Luckily, nobody knows that because I did not make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the cinemas, I was glad! My agents were driven crazy by the (apparently first) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily, and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. Later they told me that these "professionals" once in California (we filmed in Atlanta) had 4 1/2 hours of footage! Reduced to 90 minutes, it is at least twice as long as necessary. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise - what a waste of film!
