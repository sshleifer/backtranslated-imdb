I remember this movie with sheer feelings. , , Agony. More than half of the film is commercials (no, really!). The slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes (and it almost is!). The end result is a pre-fabricated love story of predictable shock, all of which were obviously jumbled together in a blatant commercial attempt to take Debbie Boone's peers a few bucks more. Yes, it was produced so fast ... the song was "inspired" when the movie was released, he was still big on the charts! <br /> <br /> Despite decades of watching bad movies, this one still impresses me for his extravagant, unrestrained, headless jump into the most boring, absurd and indelible cinematic malice. It really deserves to be on the 100 worst IMDb list ever, and has never left the top 3 on my personal "worst" list. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it for the pure masochistic thrill!
