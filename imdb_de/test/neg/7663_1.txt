I've just seen this movie on TNT and I can tell you, this movie was just cheesy and cheeky. But at some point I started to laugh at my socks and to tell the truth, they should classify this movie as a comedy rather than an action / adventure. The funniest scene comes when Delon and Kennedy make the 360 ​​Loop Loop to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy the Concorde. Our fearless leader, Kennedy, decides to shoot torches out of the window to stop the heat-seeking missiles. Stupid but funny - the kicker comes here - after a shot, the Flare pistol malfunctions, and Kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit. If you want to know what's going on, get this movie. One of the silly parts of this movie is the total lack of conspiracy ---- Yes, let's do something for 25 minutes to land in Paris and spend an hour lovemaking with prostitutes and flight attendants. Now let's go to the saboteur for ten minutes, then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that visually breaks up and the PASSENGERS DON "T EVEN YOU SEE IT?" --- Final rating for this move --- (1/10) out of 4 stars if action would be 2 out of 4 stars if it's a comedy
