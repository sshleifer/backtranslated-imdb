Thunderball and Never are two of the biggest box office shots and Never is a surprising farce from Empire Strike's back-hero Irvin Kershner. Klaus Maria Brandauer seems to steal the show as Bond's mission in the midst of the unfolding plot is more like the Hollywood fuss (at some point when Basinger comes in). How about Klaus Kinski? I still think that the casting of Largo either breaks the story or, as seen in both films, breaks. The worst is the attempt to reject the aging and very hairy Connery as a sex symbol, which he actually was in the 60s. The 80s were mostly barren for Bond-Flicks, though For Your Eyes Only is a great title. Sometimes, when I happen to waste some time over the holidays watching this movie on Bond's often-recurring bond festivals, I think the movie's best attribute is its score, and I'm not thrilled. 80s 'Jazz'.
