Really awful! There is simply no other way to express it. In fact, it is SO SO bad that the only reason I waste words is to warn other sensible viewers who want to be entertained intelligently. You lose I.Q. Points that observe this. Come to think, it is not even suitable for thoughtless vision due to the irritation factor. It is no guilty pleasure to see something so incompetent. <br /> <br /> Reasons to avoid it: <br /> <br /> 1) Terribly scientifically inaccurate, to the point where this is no longer sci-fi, It's just a sloppy, lazy fantasy. <br /> <br /> 2) It wears FX, which are incredibly cheesy. Not even a cheesy kitsch who's a minion and a nod, like the old Doctor Who, but just cheap and humble until he's offensive. The FX are so bad that they are not even ridiculous. They spent about fifty dollars on it, not more. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction is so weak and unthinking that the actors had the only chance of getting through until the end of the shoot, without endlessly depressed sleepwalking through their roles, even though Catherine McCormack was struggling anyway probably on principle and in spite of the director. In addition, this is not the only bad movie by Peter Hyams: His fins far outweigh the barely saved, of which Timecop was the last, and that was 15 years before this article. He had not had anything decent since then (End Of Days was just like Slapdash, Arnold was the only draw, and he needed a lot firmer direction than Hyams had planned). Hyams makes it more and more pointless when someone thinks about giving him more work. <br /> <br /> 4) The stories of Ray Bradbury deserve far better treatment than this. If you refuse to watch this movie, this message will be sent, not that Hollywood is particularly listening. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. If you do this and you turn off the movies altogether, you're just blaming yourself (and Hyams) for being more than sufficiently warned.
