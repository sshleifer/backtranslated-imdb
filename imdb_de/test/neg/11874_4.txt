Since Wesley Snipes descended (or went up) into the world of DTV action movies, the result was miss, so and miss. Unexpected was weak. 7 seconds were entertaining. The shooter was the proverbial scrapping of the sewage tank /> <br /> And what about the detonator? We will suffer anything but the Marksman. But the detonator has a small amount of merit, which is affected by a lazy star and a low budget. <br /> <br /> Sonny Griffith is a not-so-out-of-the-book criminal giving up illegal arms dealers in Poland. When his last job leaves a bullet buffet, he leaves behind a pile of corpses. Nadia (the always hot Silvia Colloca) in the USA. The problem is that Sonny is deceived by a traitor in his own organization, who keeps Gangsters busy with Nuclier Ambitions. Snipes delivers in the action department. Here he is in Half-Blade mode Well, in the first 15 minutes of the Detonator, before going into pure sleepwalking mode that has ruined the Marksman. Coloca looks more than pretty. There is some conviction for their scenes. Many of the actors look familiar and have last seen 3 or 4 Seagal / Snipes films. It's always good to see Michael Brandon again. <br /> <br /> The action is telegraphed here. But never boring. Racing, Chases, Fights.Director Po-Chih Leong seems to have gotten better after the Seagal Farce; Out of reach.He does a credible job.But the low budget is constantly hampered. Enough with the Eastern Euro Locations.Isn't the movie so expensive. This can not be so expensive br /> <br /> The detonator ends just average. He does not enjoy Seag al 'mercenaries for justice. But it's not nearly as entertaining as Van Damme's deputy. Not as exciting as Dolph's mechanics. Maybe Dolph Wesley should direct next? <br /> <br /> His high time. Producers are pumping up a bit more money and thinking about these DTV titles with the kind of money they earn. Is only fair. The result could be a bestseller. Snipes would be recommended to make this thing his last DTV action strip. It is sad to see that YET is another waste of the talents of this gifted actor.
