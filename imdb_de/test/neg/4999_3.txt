OK - I gave him a "3" just because they obviously did not have any money to shoot this movie, but I think he deserves the "2.3" rating when I came here. I help to increase the rating, although I was bored for the last hour and a half. I will save the "1" and the "2" for the scrap pieces on a higher budget. At least the makers of Rise of the Undead did not waste that much money. They have managed to waste 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The movie is too claustrophobic for me. The entire film plays in the same building, in dark rooms and hallways. With such a shot, there should have been more action or character development, but there's just a lot of meaningless talk. I did not meet any of the characters. There is a schoolgirl and a goth chick, but we never hear about it again. None of the characters seems to be really sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie with zero budget. No scary special effects. No tension. Really not interesting here, folks. I admit, I downloaded it from the internet. It was free, but I throw it away. <br /> <br /> Excuse the filmmakers. Good luck next time. This is more of a soap opera than a zombie movie.
