This is a semi-fictional recollection of an "international man" who has experienced various political upheavals over the last 30 years. <br /> <br /> I had hoped that this film offers unique insights into politics and war. I also hoped that it would touch and influence. This movie has disappointed me though. "Chico" was fragmentary, with the main character Ricardo, who was in a country for 10 to 20 minutes. As expected, no detailed action could be made in this timeframe. The excuses that he was moved to another location were often unimportant. The result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips taken in different countries.
