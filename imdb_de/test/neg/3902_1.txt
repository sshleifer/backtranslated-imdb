Wow, um, that was a different kind of movie. It's called a comedy itself ... but it did not laugh out loud at all. It was crazy. If you are willing to accept that 3 people will survive a catastrophe on a global scale, why not 4? or 5? ..... and why did it suddenly end without anything to happen ??? They could have done much better if they just had another element in the plot, like a stupid woman for the ugly guy or something ... zinc, ridiculous .... ahh. <br /> I do not know .. watch it ... it was not that bad ..... sometimes funny .... I guess ... <br /> <br /> schneider
