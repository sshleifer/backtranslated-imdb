CRAP! I accidentally saw this movie when I thought the swimming upstream was released in 2003. Too bad, whoever gave this rubbish an award. I thoroughly detested this movie - in fact I did not go through it to the end. After an hour I could not stand it anymore. I'm disgusted that people are amused at such a lousy script that tries to break off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD drama. PAINFUL. I rate it with 1 out of 10 stars. An amateur could make a much bigger movie.
