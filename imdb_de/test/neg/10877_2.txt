Quentin Tarantino once said that to succeed in the film industry, you had to make your own Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. Writer / actor / director Larry Bishop seems to have taken that advice a little bit literally at Hell Ride and to make a messy homage, borrowing too much in visuals, music, camerawork and time-varying storytelling. But to properly imitate a Tarantino movie, you have to be knowledgeable in creative conversations. Unfortunately, Hell Ride's primary derailment is the hideous chatter and the vulgar monologues that only disgust and confuse the audience, while pitying the actors just because they're involved. The anti-hero protagonist biker gang The Victors consists of several weathered vigilantes who are bringing their own bloodthirsty justice onto the lawless streets. The leader, Pistolero (Larry Bishop), is hell-bent on revenge and fire. Ghent (Michael Madsen) only tries to reconcile his chaotic psychotic symphony of life with the one who crosses his boss, and Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows with fierce loyalty and a mysterious past. <br /> <br /> On the rogue front, Deuce (David Carradine) is the mastermind who remotely orchestrates, though not far enough, and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits poison and lewd explanations for his tattoos while he does a harpoon cannon and a general disdain attracts life. While these characters might sound interesting on paper, all traces of coolness disappear as soon as they are forced to scream a horribly ill-conceived dialogue, faster than funding for Bishop's next film. <br /> <br /> While Hell Ride is rummaging through imperfections and missed opportunities, the main facets of doom lie in the ill-conceived conversations. And because Bishop's main influences are the melancholy films of Tarantino, there are many of them. The first twenty minutes of the film are almost incomprehensible and would probably seem silenced as well. By the time Pistolero's main squeeze is introduced and certain phrases are overwhelmed to nausea, you pray for death as well as the ability to turn off the sound. Even Dennis Hopper has problems staying cool when he spits out such stupid dialogues. <br /> <br /> Have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so often that it just does not sound right or does not make sense at all? Bishop starts there and then keeps up the madness until you envy the characters on the screen and cut off their heads. And when the dialogue finally takes a break, we get alternating shots of nude, female oil ring and neck guts. I'm not sure what effect Bishop hoped for, but I doubt he found it. Hell Ride would like to pay tribute to Quentin Tarantino films, Robert Rodriguez films, and any movie that idolizes the perpetrators of the devil's biker's Devil May Care attitudes. But though his intentions may be noble, the horribly crackling dialogue and hyper-stylized cut of the timeline prevent the audience from engaging in the generic hard characters. If we figure out the mystery behind the characters' motives (and it may take a while to even realize that a mystery needs to be solved), it's just too hard to handle. And although everyone on the screen is having fun, they have completely failed to translate this conversation to the public. <br /> <br /> - Joel Massie
