The amount of hype and great success that this film has witnessed shows our desperation for a good independent Saudi film. In fact, the great success of "Tash ma Tash" is also evidence. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to start how important filmmaking is because it's obvious to those with half a brain how to film movies I've changed the world. <br /> <br /> And I will not say how much our society needs a series of films to solve many of the problems we have in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and much more. <br /> <br /> There came news about the first Saudi Arabian film, which could have eliminated some of the problems we have, especially in the direction of youth. Instead, we experienced a bald movie. <br /> <br /> The ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious. It was as if a 13-year-old had written it. Now I've heard that the budget for this movie was huge. I would like to know where the money went, right? The effects were really ugly, the editing was bad. The script was kharabeet. You really do not know what the story is and what the director is aiming for with this movie. <br /> <br /> A reference to the actor who played the religious brother, his performance was good, but with a bad direction. Another thing about the role of the religious friends he had is how religious men do not behave here in Saudi Arabia! They are not "evil", as this movie foresees. In fact, they are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet, with a truly unusual way of life, and that's what should have been in the movie. <br /> <br /> The young people here follow the religious for one reason, and that is, the young ones are the most passionate and sentimental. With the well-formed principles according to which the religious live, the young follow them. Again, it should appear. <br /> <br /> We need another "first movie" with a Saudi writer, actor, director, composer and even a cameraman. So that they all work with passion for their experiment, not just for the money! <br /> <br /> And we should do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, and we should insert sentences from the Koran into the script of the movie. Since people in our society still view art as sin, the challenge facing a Saudi filmmaker is to change the mentality in this regard.
