If you continue from "Stalker / Slasher" in the episode, you will dash in the vein of "Wolf Creek", "Hostel", "Joy Ride" etc. with "Rest Stop". The most unoriginal and useless of all. <br /> <br /> We reasonably start promising the violent death of a pretty young girl in a dirty toilet. <br /> <br /> This is where our interest is lost. We then move on to a clich√© road trip couple on the way to LA, looking at the actor stars. , , What they do in such films, they will never reach. <br /> <br /> From the sexual amusement in the park, the two drive, arguing all the way, to a deserted and disgusting quiet zone, which the girl can use the bath. She is harmless enough until she leaves the house and misses her boyfriend. She realizes she's being chased by a lame version of Joy Ride's Rusty Nail. , , Only drive around in Mater from "Cars". Honestly, if directed, written / produced / handled by someone else, it could have been pretty good. But no. <br /> <br /> Because then comes the ghost story. Yup. , , You guessed it. "Oh, I'll help you, but wait, you're dead", "to wait, if this stalker is a person, a monster or a ghost". <br /> <br /> But wait? Who helps to save the girl's life and possibly the movie? This one lawerence brother. Excellent. Were rescued. (Sarcasm) Oh wait, no, we are not. <br /> <br /> You know. , If you want to laugh out of a pretty bad moment or get free rental deals like mine, give it a try. <br /> <br /> If anything, you will learn to NOT make a movie. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
