The frustrating thing about a movie like this, which has a real potential for size, is that it's almost fun on hard hands. We're talking about allegory, metaphor ... but the truth is that it's not about there being absolutely no action or real character. <br /> <br /> At some point, we know most about who the people are ... even though we never understand where they are going. Sheer arrogance embarrassed me every time I sought a truth in this film. <br /> <br /> Call it beautiful, great and fantastic ... I just call it "cheating". All style and no substance. Sure, it's a matter of taste ... but I would never take a confusing modernist symbol with symbols and splashes over the mental clarity of Jean Cocteau or Renoir. But if it works for you, I'm in favor of it. I think art is a personal thing.
