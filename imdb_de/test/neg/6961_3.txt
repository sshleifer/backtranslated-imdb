To describe what's really wrong with this movie, it has to contain some * spoilers *. So if you see him and be surprised, do not read this! <br /> <br /> I liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in a thriller like this, a credible conspiracy is essential. It works well when things are moving slowly, and the camera work and Portland scenes are great for a simple, unpretentious image. The dialogue is very good. Mason is a seriously retired teenager who works for a telemarketing company that sells insurance. His buddy from high school, Berkeley, is his employer and looks after him like a brother, although Mason is obviously mentally ill. Mason has nightmares that make him gasp and fumble for his inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest that he had serious problems with good-looking women in his past, and the film seems to suggest that he may be a serial killer of women. He meets a naughty, pretty girl named Amber and draws it in his notebook. She likes him and poses for him so he can paint her portrait. He sees more of her and begins to awaken from his withdrawn state, becoming almost half human. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder. She gets scared and pulls back. We wonder if her sudden cold will knock him over the edge. His behavior becomes more unpredictable. <br /> <br /> This is the setup for the revelation. To explain how this movie goes terribly wrong, I have to explain what happens. * Another spoiler warning! * For this plan to work, we believe that Amber, a really sociable, pretty young girl, chooses a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who, at least at the beginning of his friendship, looks blank and can only speak monosyllabic or not at all. He is far beyond Nerdy, he is on the verge of total catatonia. Yes, I know, girls can be attracted to all kinds of crazy people, but usually of the Charles Manson type or punk rockers, guys with a kind of evil manic energy. Mason is practically a zombie, he is not there at all. Every bright young thing would cross the street to avoid him. It's just unbelievable that this girl is attracted to him. Besides, there is no credible reason for Berkeley to indulge in crazy Mason, who is not believable either. <br /> <br /> But wait, there is a revelation. Amber does not come to Christmas dinner in Berkeley's house, where Mason is expecting her, and Berkeley, his old buddy, has to tell him that Amber and all his other former girlfriends, whom he has drawn in his many sketchbooks, do not exist! She and all others are mere figures of his twisted imagination: he has come up with them. <br /> <br /> Well, that explains why a normal sweet Amber would choose Mason, she's just a fantasy of his imagination. This could have been the final revelation of the film with the right preparation and setup, but unfortunately not. At this point, Mason walks back to his apartment and finds Amber there ... he is angry and kills her. But now we understand that Amber was real, not Mason's imaginary girlfriend. <br /> <br /> In the end, after proving that Amber actually exists and that Mason killed her, Berkeley has to admit that he was wrong and misjudged Mason. This would work if Mason had been reasonably healthy from the start, but since we've always been suspected by the audience to be completely confused and possibly a murderer, it's no surprise to us. We guessed what he was all the time and can not understand why Berkeley could not see it. But then we ask ourselves again: If it really were, why would Amber be interested in the catatonic Mason? <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, it's never clear to us whether all of Mason's other friends who were in the sketchbooks were real, or was Amber the first correct one? And if the others were real, did he kill them too? What did he do to the bodies? <br /> <br /> The problem is that the filmmakers simply did not know what to do with the material. Maybe there could have been a way to smooth it out and tell a believable exciting story, but this movie is not.
