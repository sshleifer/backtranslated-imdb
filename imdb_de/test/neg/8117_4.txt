Almost everything Stephen King has ever written seems to have turned into a movie or TV series. In fact, I am surprised that no one has tried to make a miniseries from the guy's grocery list. Let's face it, if not, it could not be less interesting than Children of the Corn. <br /> <br /> Based on one of King's many short stories, this 1984 horror movie features Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton, a couple who get on their nerves on a long drive when approaching the sleepy town of Gatlin in Nebraska, where all adults were murdered by children who worship an ancient evil lurking on the corn fields. <br /> <br /> Although director Fritz Kiersch creates a bit more atmosphere at first (after Hamilton's stupid song and dance, but before we meet the freaky Isaac, the leader of the killer children), he has messed it up with endless, exciting Scenes where Hamilton and Horton are being chased by the city's killers. Courtney Gains, being a violent redhead Malachai, manages to be truly menacing, but the rest of the children are not the least threatening; As a result, many "scary" moments of the movie do not work. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, when we finally see the malevolent force that inhabits the field around Gatlin, the movie becomes a wealth of terrible 80s effects that have probably been sinewy for almost 25 years They looked very ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> Children of the Corn might be of interest to King fans who want to see the writer's work put on the big screen, but your average horror movie fan will be the most unimpressed ,
