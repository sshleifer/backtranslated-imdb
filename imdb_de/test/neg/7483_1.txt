I do not think I've ever received a 1/10 rating, but it's easily rated as denomination. It's hard for me to just sit through one of his jokes. Not only is it that the jokes are so bad, but it combines with the fact that Carson Daily has no charisma, no punch line or can finish, and you have a late comedy recipe that really blows your belly. <br /> <br /> I have never quite seen the show, but still often. It just sneaks to Conan. I usually watch for a few minutes, just to see if Carson is still the worst talk show presenter on a daily basis. <br /> <br /> If you ever see him interviewing a guest, it's just an interview. I'm so sorry every time he has a guest and her confused smile tries to mask her screaming body language: "Take me to hell this freak!" I recommend seeing the show, not to laugh, but to think about how he went on air and what he still does there. See as much as you can, I think you will find his complete awkwardness ... interesting.
