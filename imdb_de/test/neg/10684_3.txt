After a weapon from the 19th century, which goes wrong, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. She not only becomes one of the undead, she uses her gothic seductress to get her talents as a cold-blooded murderer. This is a low-grade B feature that should have gone straight to video. The violence is vicious and bloody, but actually quite mild. The plot is so weak and the dialogue so accidental that it is hard to arouse much interest. Eileen Daly is the main character Lilith Silver. The cast also includes Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth and Isabel Brook.
