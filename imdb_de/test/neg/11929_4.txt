It's a bit irritating when a studio refuses to show a movie to the press before going on to re-release it. It's no surprise that a lot of movies are shit, but if a studio gives so much time in advance, the process of filming becomes a kind of passion play. Think of it as Hollywood's early Christmas present that "Aeon Flux" is not nearly the affront to the taste and propriety that one would expect given the above. Although she is eventually overwhelmed with her mistakes, she (somehow) has an idea to play with. The bad director Karyn Kusama seems to have little idea how to do it all. <br /> <br /> It's the future. There has been a plague. There is a dictatorship and rebels. The latter are known as the Monks, and far from being a cult of berets or tennis rackets, they are trying to overthrow the former, the so-called Goodchild regime. The regime is occasionally mean to the citizens, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and her friends. Through a kind of biochemical virtual reality technology, the monks receive orders from their dear leader (Frances McDormand), a mystical priestess-type who seems to have been crossed with a carrot. It's up to Aeon to tie up some form-fitting, futuristic spandex get-ups to execute the High Carrot orders, which are, of course, a version of "Destruction of the Regime." After seeing her sister liquidated by the Goodchilds years ago, she does not need much persuasion. <br/> <br /> It's not surprising that things get complicated. The Goodchilds may not be what they seem, and Aeon himself might have an unexpected story with him. Although occasionally confused, the central idea of ​​the film (of which I will not reveal) contains some pretty notions about the nature of human existence and survival. There is room for much more investigation that the movie does not exploit, but at least the ideas are there. The big problems of "Aeon Flux" are technical. Kusama made the startling decision to film almost all the action so close that we rarely see what happens. To make matters worse, there are a number of jump-cuts that have completely lost us. The result is a serious spatial disorientation that takes over the film. The aesthetics of "Aeon Flux" is a sleek costume, a strange angled architecture and nimble characters. Much of the action takes place in minimalist, open spaces, begging for unbroken long strikes that can convey the grace and lightness implied by the above. Instead, we get flying limbs, broken glass and related sound effects within seconds. <br /> <br /> There is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the swamp of "Aeon Flux". If you put this stuff in the hands of the Wachowski brothers, the results could be very different. Anyway, I felt like "Aeon Flux" purposely ousted me from a movie I wanted to enjoy. This film is not attuned to its own strengths. Like a novice who has played a royal flush, despite his potential, he finds a way to lose.
