If you have not seen the first one, at least you need to know someone who has done this, and you must know that it was painful to sit through. There was nothing good to say. So what's different about the second one? Why should you make a sequel to a pathetic movie? He does not take himself too seriously. It knows it was made for television and does not try to impress with great or serious talk. There are moments when one tries to become "serious" or "intense", but these moments are so crazy that you have to laugh at video games (besides the title of course). Do not go into this movie and do not expect anything worth mentioning for your friends, unless they are in the camp, lame zombie movies, or are interested in making this movie a drinking game. Take two shots if Ed Quinn's character mentions his dead brother! Take a shot whenever a bullet is better placed in the head of a zombie than to pump three into the chest! etc. etc.
