H. G. Wells turns. No doubt. <br /> <br /> Really, that would be a decent science fiction / adventure movie if it was not based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson. I kept hearing that this would be the final version of the novel. The result was a pathetic and silly bastardization. <br /> <br /> The novel is a great science fiction story, but what many people miss when they read it (probably because they read it when they're very young) is that it's flooded with social commentary , The Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of Victorian England class distinctions, and the general message of the film is that EVERYTHING IS BORN AND DEGENERATED, a satirical thrust of Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever. There is no love story, no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman ... in the novel, the Eloi are three-foot-tall, childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal. The time traveler befriends an Eloi woman, but he thinks he's more like a pet, and yet she was killed before the end of the novel. <br /> <br /> This film first tries to give us a completely stupid backstory "Why does he want to travel through time?" The terrible romance and the lessons he has to learn are enough to make movie fans vomit. <br /> <br /> The journey into the future is interrupted by a future catastrophe. OK, not bad, but it would have been more powerful if you had seen that humanity in general degenerates like the book. I'm thinking about the times when a nuclear war took place in the George Pal version. <br /> <br /> The general story? Pooh. A total misrepresentation of the novel. The Eloi are too competent and warlike. The Morlocks are too intelligent. The UberMorlock is embarrassing and there are no settings. He only appears in time to be killed. Yawning. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba is OK. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites, but he is often confused and painful. (Allegedly, he broke a rib while filming.) He also looks unhealthy and overly thin, as if he had been sick long before he did that. A sad, sad movie version of one of the classics of the world. H. G. Wells deserves better ... Much better. <br /> <br />
