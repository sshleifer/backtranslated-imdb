The director has no idea. I know ... that's the obvious comment. Maybe we should dive into the story ... the relationships ... what about the quality of the actors? <br /> <br /> The story is ... well, idiotic would be a simple but honest answer. <br /> <br /> The actors are ... they have made a great effort. Can you be accused of the director's decisions? <br /> <br /> All I can say is ... <br /> <br /> Why was this done? <br /> <br /> Well, is not that embarrassing for the Korean-American film industry? <br /> <br /> Should we be picky who we support? <br /> <br /> Am I too hard? See for yourself.
