Lazy movie made by a lazy director. The characters are grotesque. Despite the tragedy of this war, there are no emotions in the film at all. The symbolism is artificial and inefficient (and the old Bosnian woman giving Arbor a photograph of her son will "concretize" her willingness to awaken the super-mother sleeping in her, a corpse eaten by worms, to the horrors to show the genocide ...) much is sometimes worst than not enough). <br /> <br /> This movie is just a commercial, an empty elegy for a woman who is not a hero. She worked for the United Nations. Remember that the United Nations did not protect civilians in Srebrenica. Who are the true heroes of this war? A Canadian judge who led an autopsy on charges of cruelty, mainly because their organization had not prevented them? Where is the criticism in this movie?
