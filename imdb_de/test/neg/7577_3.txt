I've seen a lot of Japanese horror movies, and I have to say some of them are really interesting, but they're all pretty much the same. This is no exception. The ghost is a black-haired girl who terrifies his victims by doing nothing but walking and looking dead. The difference is just the motive for the haunting. The rest is as usual: black-haired girl, strange things with some media (photos), scary spectacle. As I watched this movie, I kept asking myself why I was wasting my time seeing things that someone else had done so much better before. some scenes were nice, but I'll give it 3 out of 10
