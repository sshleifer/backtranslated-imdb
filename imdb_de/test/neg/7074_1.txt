"Tamara" just felt like another teen who was following the trend "I know what you did last summer" and is painfully boring. An outcast in high school who deals heavily with witchcraft and black magic is accidentally killed when a cruel prank is performed by a group of mobbers who secretly bury them in the woods and swear not to tell anyone about it. The next day, the supposedly "dead" Tamara comes to school with a whole new image and seduces her would-be killers and has a little revenge ... This is basically a combination of "Carrie", "The Craft" and everyone else , straightforward video teen bopper turkey that comes on the market today. The actors are absolutely cruel and look about ten years to spend as high school students. There's a bit of gore, which is not that interesting, since the movie is so boring and I could not wait until it comes to an end. If you like modern garbage as I insist, choose this one, otherwise you will not bother ...
