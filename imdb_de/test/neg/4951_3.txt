After watching "Still Life," a short directed by Jon Knautz, I was really excited about his feature film debut "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer." "Still Life" had perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of "The Twilight Zone," and I was curious to see what Knautz could do when I took on the horror comedy. The Campy nature of the name and promotional material pointed to something like "Evil Dead" or "Army of Darkness." a funny, bloody horror strip in the style of the 80s with many monsters. While this was the case for Knautz, he absolutely fails to capture the fun or entertainment value of these films. <br /> <br /> The problem with "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is that there is a total lack of understanding of what made these horror comedies that it tries to summon, so great from the start. Two-thirds of the runtime is dedicated primarily to the film's hero, Jack Brooks, a plumber and college student. He goes to class and tries to cope with his uncontrollable outbursts of rage. There is hardly a monster in sight for most of the film, hardly a drop of blood or the slightest attempt to do anything with horror. Even if "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" had cut out subsequent amounts of blood, they would still be entertaining. "Jack Brooks" is not. It's just boring, worst of all, what a movie of this kind can be. Jack Brooks himself is not particularly interesting, at least not enough to justify the screen time he gets. Everything you need to know about him is revealed in the first ten minutes of the movies. From this point on, he is not worth seeing if he does not hit the monster's pulp (and he rarely does). The movie does not go anywhere, he follows him in psychiatric sessions and brawls with classmates. <br /> <br /> Ultimately it gets worse. Jack Brooks fights some monsters, some heads are down, some people are butchered and then it's over. Just like that. Everything within a period of about fifteen minutes. It's a good fifteen minutes. The monsters are all quite imaginative (and made entirely in the camera), and there are some big gag-gags (it's best to hit a zombie in the head), but after seventy-five minutes of pure boredom, fifteen minutes are easy do not finish cutting it out. <br /> <br /> This is really all that belongs to it. I could talk about acting pretty well done (especially the horror icon Robert Englund in a non-traditional role) and how the prosthetics of creatures is a nice throwback in the days when movies did not use CGI, but really Not. It is important. "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is absolutely boring and while Jon Knautz obviously has the talent to make a good movie (again, the last fifteen minutes are a killer and "Still Life" was unbelievable? Check it out), "Jack Brooks "misses the target completely. It has its successes (acting, make-up), but that does not change the fact that it's not very entertaining at all. The show where I captured myself had the director and the cast with me. One piece of information that I found out was that there was a sequel to development and this time it was more focused on fighting monsters than "creating a hero." My tip: skip this and wait for the sequel.
