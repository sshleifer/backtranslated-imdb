<br /> <br /> To put it succinctly: I hope that this film is not considered a groundbreaking work for the "generasian" American filmmaker. The acting was below average and relied on stereotypes, sublime voices and exaggerated eye disease to convey their message. chris chan park does not delve deeply into his characters, leaving them caricatures of angry / frustrated / distant / non-communicative Asians. These representations do not make characters mysteriously appealing; it makes them confusing and unsympathetic. I like to think that we asians are more complex than that. <br /> <br /> I did not come away convinced of the movie. not convinced that these characters had a lifelong, blood brother-like relationship with each other to make the effort they had made to help their buddy. not convinced that the main character had more than a superficial pull on his girlfriend. not convinced that hard-working, immigrant parents would not pay for their son's college education. not convinced that all the characters were even necessary, ie: janet, who is put to bed in the back of the car and quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> the action that I considered potentially appropriate was not the case for two reasons: 1) flat characters for whom I had no sympathy / affinity, 2) the action becomes meaningless Non-sequitur scenes overshadowed, such as ridiculous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I commend Park for his efforts, as I'm sure it took a lot of hard work to even produce the movie, and I'll even give him the benefit of this as a rookie time Director / screenwriter, but I sincerely hope that next time he goes a little deeper. Just because the film is one of the first of its kind in terms of Korean-American experience does not mean that it's automatically good.
