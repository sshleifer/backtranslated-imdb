How can each of you describe this propaganda as a family movie? This is nothing but a PC, an offensive insult to churchgoers in small towns. The film depicts a woman as the great white savior of a small Midwestern town, and everyone else in the city (mostly men) are just girls in need who are not honorable and can not decide for themselves. This movie is just a love affair that the producer has with an undisciplined, arrogant, intrusive little squirting that he expects the audience to admire him seeker-sensitive church and had the freedom to litter little church members as crazy lunatics and not the majority dispose. The same people who give money to the Salvation Army at Christmas time by raising funds to help missionaries, the poor and the homeless, to sing, to be companions and to make friends. What's wrong with this modest group that insults these self-righteous traitors? Most Christians in this world would step in and give their lives to anyone in trouble, even if they disagree with them. Most Christians would not mind if the pastor or a community worker of a church put on his coat (or shirt). They would not judge her. This movie is ridiculous!
