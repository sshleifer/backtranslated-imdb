Sorted is a fairly transparent attempt to withdraw money from the thriving British club scene. A film that is promising in certain departments, but otherwise little. A fugitive thriller plot (which is just to string the club sequences together), variable gameplay, and a rather ridiculous script, all prevent Sorted from being the showcase that director Jovy obviously intended. Sometimes he is too lenient especially when he uses the often poorly fitting dance music), he shows potential, and the absence of an anti-drug message is enormously refreshing. Overall, though, the movie is a wasted opportunity, and the prospects for a great clubbing movie stay out there somewhere. Still observable.
