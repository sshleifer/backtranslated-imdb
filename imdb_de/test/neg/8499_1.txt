I would not have rated this movie so low (2) if its average was not ridiculously high, but someone had to reduce it to something more reasonable. I sat most of the movie, looking scene after scene from tagging and shoplifting. No dialogue, just tagging and shoplifting. Finally, the two Tagger kissed. Something happens. But then back to the marking and shoplifting. I left the screening. I recommend this movie only to those who are impressed by demanding film productions. I did not like the director's previous film (a self-righteous defense of male-boy love), but at least this movie had a story, interesting characters, and dialogues. The graffiti artist had only scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting. I want more of a movie than this.
