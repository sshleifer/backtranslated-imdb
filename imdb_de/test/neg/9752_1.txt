"Take Fame" and "You Have Got Served" and jam them roughly together and what do you have? This god terrible movie that was designed specifically for dull normal teens. The plot follows very closely "You Have Got Served". Three Ghetto Afro teens, this time living in John Waters Baltimore, not far from Peckers' home, spend their time getting bad grades in high school and in run-down, 100-year-old buildings with Hoochy Moms dance. To finance their expensive, hip-hop hipster clothing taste, they steal cars and deliver them to the local chop shop - not unlike John (Tony Manaro) Travolta, who worked in a Brooklyn paint shop for his polyester disco gear Buy /> <br /> Tyler Gage, one of the three Black Musketeers, is caught devastating Fame's local high school and doing janitorial duties. He meets Nora Clark, a 26-year-old white high school student, and discovers he's Irish-American, much to the chagrin of his black buddies Mac and Skinny. <br /> <br /> As in 'You Have Got Served', crime does not pay off and Skinny, the youngest member of the trio, is shot dead by a Bad-Bad-Leroy-Brown guy. But that does not stop the music and the breathtaking finale.
