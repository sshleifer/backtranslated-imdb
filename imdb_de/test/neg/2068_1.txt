As a film critic for a local gay magazine, I automatically get every piece of trash sent, if a homo is in it. Chicken Tikka Masala whirls in the background as I write this. I devoted my undivided attention to 53 minutes before involuntarily screaming - like a suffering tourrette - "This is the test movie I've ever seen." We have just come to the emotional climax, where the son gives a speech with his father at his wedding. Father seems to take it pretty well. A murder attempt at this point would have animated the movie at least a little. And made it funnier. <br /> <br /> I did not like Beautiful Thing, for example, but at least I could see why other people did it. It was done with some professionalism and I think it had at least a few good lines. The joke in this movie is amazing - even the most mediocre sitcom shows recognizable jokes. The film closest to this movie was closest (at least in the first 53 minutes) to the subtitle given to the fat unattractive female lead. "Look at her with open legs - she's like the Mersey Tunnel." Totally funny and I did not smile, but I would imagine that someone with a low IQ (who might be working in a chip shop) enjoys it. If not, I can at least console myself with the fact that the lenders lose a considerable amount of money, as even a low-budget British movie will throw someone back a few million. Seriously, if I had met the most beautiful guy in the world, and when I returned to his place to find sweet love, I found a copy of it in his DVD collection ("Man, I love this movie"), I would probably kick it in the nuts and leave immediately. And that of someone who has been gone for about six months without the sweet love mentioned before. Oh god, I hate this movie.
