To quote Clark Griswold (in the original Christmas holidays): "BAD? How could things get worse? Look around here, Ellen. We're on the brink of hell." Chevy Chase did not know that he described the "sequel" of one of his best films. Christmas Vacation II sets new heights in bad movies (or maybe it should be LOW). My wife bought this DVD because she thought it was indeed a continuation of the original, but we were deeply disappointed. This movie is LAME. It bears no resemblance to the original, is an absolute waste of film and an embarrassment to the otherwise good actors who had the misfortune to be part of it. It must have made an entry in the IMDb for the worst reviews. I really think we have a good reason to win a class action to regain the money that we consumers have wasted on this film.
