I rented The Matrix Revisited with a friend of mine. We both loved The Matrix and we both love filmmaking, so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of The Matrix. It turns out that The Matrix Revisited tells you little about the art of filmmaking or even about how The Matrix was made. It's basically a huge commercial for The Matrix, a movie the target audience of The Matrix Revisited has already seen! <br /> <br /> If you really want to know about the process and the problems and the stress and detail After creating The Matrix, you'll have the bonus features on The Matrix's original DVD in view. There are things that they show in these documentaries that I did not even know had to be done or were made. The Matrix was such a difficult and challenging movie that it deserves more recognition than a "documentary" that is as informative and interesting as an MTV special.
