Years ago, when DARLING LILI was playing on television, it was always the Pan & Scan version that I hated and decided to watch the movie in the correct widescreen format. So when I saw a cheap DVD of Julie Andrews / Blake Edwards Opus, I decided to buy and watch them once and for all. <br /> <br /> Boy, what a horrible movie. It's so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start, where and when it goes terribly wrong. Looking at it now, it's obvious to every movie fan that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife, simply because so many other directors have struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHL MODERN MILLIE, etc.) also because Andrews had starred in the projects Julie herself made famous (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc.) because Hollywood thought she was not sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake has created this immortal effort to present his wife in a bizarre mixture of spy stories / war movie / romance / slapstick comedy / musical. DARLING LILI suffers from several personalities, without knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective, but on the whole it just does not work so embarrassingly that it is very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The version on the DVD is the "Director's Cut" "or in this case" we rescue whatever we can from this notorious Kinoflop. When the DVD was released, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19 !!!!!!!!) from the bloated original version into this streamlined yet remarkably ineffective version. The film moves without any idea of ​​what it is. We're 25 minutes in and still do not know what's going on or why we're watching what's going on. What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for a person's death? Instead, we see a completely bored rock Hudson trying to woo a completely bored Julie Andrews. With the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love, things are not helped much. Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why with him and not with other men she dealt with? There should have been an ex who wanted to win her back or tried to unravel her secret. This would have given us the much needed contrast to the confused action. This would have made us the lazy procedure impetuous. There is no catalyst in this story. <br /> <br /> You just have to look at the cutscenes to see clearly that Edwards and the author had just ideas inspired by the earlier successes of Andrews (and Edwards). The best (or worst) example is the scene where Andrews and Hudson follow a group of children singing in the middle of the forest. Edwards Channeling by SOUND OF MUSIC. No wonder he took it from the DVD. In 1970 this scene might have worked on a certain level, but today this moment smells of despair. There are other plot elements inspired directly by Andrews / Edward's other films. The endless scenes of Dogfights are inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment "I'll give you three guesses" was created to make fun of Julie's MARY POPPINS persona, who in fact becomes "slippery" with Julie during a strip-tease. The end, bird's-eye view of Julie running towards Hudson's plane, is another "wink" at SOUND OF MUSIC. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born of a German father and a British mother who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story is going. Some moments are poorly edited. Like when Julie and her "uncle" are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints in the middle of a sentence. I am like "what happened here?" <br /> <br /> The comedy pieces are inglorious and scary. Every scene with the French police is pathetic. Where is Peter Sellers when you really need him. The plot is unimaginably stupid. When Julie and her "uncle" are on their way to Germany with this train, Hudson's squadron shoots the train and almost kills Lili. Brilliant. The funny thing about this scene is also the two who leave in the middle of the night on the train, but Hudson and his squadron reach the train, although they leave the next morning. That's a slow move there. <br /> <br /> The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the entire movie (and the reason why I rated this movie 3 stars), but its effect is greatly reduced as it repeats at the end. Speaking superfluous, did we really have to watch a can-can dance, crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too? The "girl in no-man's land" is alright, even though it's obviously bled, but that moment makes no sense at all, because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers in a French hospital and asks me: How many soldiers are there? were indirectly injured by the result of their espionage? <br /> <br /> The whole project is listless and without energy. The romance is 100% incredible. Rock Hudson is far too old and tired (look at the museum scene). Julie looks dazed, as if she's with Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie, who plays a German spy. Edwards wanted to eliminate the Mary Poppins syndrome affecting his wife, and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she is not Greta Garbo, who did so well in MATA HARI. Funny enough, even if Julie plays a German spy, she still looks nice and sweet. <br /> <br /> How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since the release, Blake Edwards felt he needed to work on it for the DVD release.
