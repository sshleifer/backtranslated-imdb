OK, so this movie is well played. It has a good direction, but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years. The hetero "Deciding to be gay" and the gays "Deciding to be straight" I enjoyed it until the last 20 minutes, after that I was really offended. What normally happens in these films, the straight actors play the lead roles and the gay actors the secondary roles. The leads are played by good-looking men, but do not let that distract you from the fact that this is a movie that makes you feel unfulfilled. All the romance and relationships you hope for would not happen. Unless you are a priest, and in this case God blesses a straight woman who heals our homos.
