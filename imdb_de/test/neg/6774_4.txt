Luckily, a short riddle about a telephone operator who was discovered as a kidnapped daughter of a railway magnate. The discovery causes an attempt in her life that Charlie Ruggles disregards as a "criminal." Things take a turn for the dangerous when everyone lands at the title track and another attempt is made in the girls' lives. Your enjoyment of this movie depends on your tolerance for rugggles and its nonsense. I usually like Ruggles, but there was something about that role that rubbed me in the wrong direction. I think it did not help that the mystery was not very good, so there was nothing more than the characters you could observe. Yes, the finale on the train was exciting, but it did not make it all right. It's not worth looking for, but if you stumble upon it, try it.
