I was very disappointed in this movie. The director has shown talent in his other endeavors, but this only seemed to be filler. It may have been a deep meaning behind it, but it just seems to me to be a director who has access to some toys. As I watched it, I always thought it would recover after an initial slow period, but it never did. At the end of the film, I was neither entertaining nor moving or thinking in a new way. I could only say, "What was that?" <br /> <br /> There were some really eye-catching parts of the movie, but not enough to go through it again.
