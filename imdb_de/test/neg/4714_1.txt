Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so cheesily filmed, the focus is not even on this supposed "real caste," but rather on the crew that comes from Hollywood to shoot the movie. No cinematic meaning, and if I could take back the nearly one and a half hours that I've spent with this movie, I'd feel a lot better being filmed a bit generic, like a real Hollywood production. But then they enter the story and it is filmed so horribly. It's actually an interpretation of the Blair Witch Project, because they pretty much use what they would call "real camera material." It is not, do not be fooled have ever seen. , On the positive side, it contains a half-scary scene, and the visual elements of the semi-caste were not all that bad. DO NOT RENT
