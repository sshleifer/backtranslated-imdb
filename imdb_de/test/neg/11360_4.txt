... "Flight of the Living Dead" Sports production scores, the inadequate screenplay by director Scott "I'm a producer, can not you say?" Thomas and two hacks who are supposed to be nameless because I'm sorry they have to attach these no-names to this turkey. Apparently shot in the movie, this direct-to-DVD release has virtually nothing you have not seen or heard a hundred times. Despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors such as Richard "Three O'Clock High" Tyson, Erick "Stargate" Avari and Raymond J. "Little Children" Barry and a whole host of others who are not so recognizable, "FoLD" mostly filled with cardboard, most of which end up soaked in unconvincing false blood. There are a few (precious few) gags that work (the umbrella and the zombie trapped in his seat come to my mind), but most scripts are dumb, pedestrian and comic books. re talking pedestrians and stupid. You will never believe for a moment that "FoLD" is anything but a cheap deposit movie with a cool claim. God forbids that the episode always produces their idiotic final promises. <br /> <br /> Strictly free consideration, depending on how inadequate your local library is, and otherwise only suitable for insomniacs and unbelievers.
