There was a good tension everywhere. The cinematography was surprisingly good considering the minimum budget. We occasionally see good plays, but they are quickly drained by some cheesy lines. Understandably, there is no intellectual conversation when you are sitting on trees while a crocodile is following you. Silence would have been golden here. There could have been more tension than just bleakly saying, "I was sitting in the closet for fear of my brother ..." Something tells me that there is a small difference in hitting a brother than a powerful 15 Foot crocodile to be eaten. You decide. Throughout the movie, I seem to find no connection, or sympathy with the characters. Maybe that's because they do not develop character throughout the movie. There are occasionally good scares when the crocodile sneaks past the figures and is overshadowed by questionable scenes. In one case, we should be afraid of an ear soaring in the water, but later we sit next to a decapitated, limp corpse and worry only about a broken finger. A definite roller coaster ride of a movie when it comes to logic.
