Huge, waddling, distorted tree trunk threats fake "natives" on a "Pacific Atoll" (suspiciously Southern CA ...), laze and avenge themselves. In contrast to the stupid stumps in "Navy VS The Night Monsters" the Tabonga is actually a full-grown tree. Well, grown in two days: I got used to those Miracle Grow spikes ... Anyway, he does not come from hell, but from the tomb of a fake native, Kimo (Greg Palmer, "The Zombies of Mora Tau"), Murdered by the local elders because they hang out with these terrible American scientists. The scientists include William Arnold (Death Andrews, "Hang 'em High", "Under the Planet of the Apes") and Professor Clark ("John McNamara," Colossal Beast War). Rounding out the cast is Linda Watkins ("The Parent Trap") as the disgusting Mrs. Kilgore, whose obvious comic relief triggers an obvious false cockney accent. In fact a great cast !! Anyway, because his devilish, vacant wife Korey, amateurized by Suzanne Ridgeway ("Dear A-Poppin"), is helping set up, Kimo declares his revenge on her and all the elders. Then the stupid American scientists uproot the tree, bring it back to life "in the name of science" and allow it to stroll slowly across the island and kill all who have done it wrong. Of course we all know that evil monsters kidnap beautiful girls. The Tabonga grabs the lucky scientist Dr. Terry Mason (Tina Carver, "Hell in Frisco Bay") and waddles with her. A good ally, a good shot with a Remmington hits a knife housed in Tabonga, and it falls dead into quicksand. This ridiculously stupid cowncept is one of the cheesy all-time howlers. The Tabonga is probably the slowest monster in the history of Moovie, at the top with the rickety, over-built robot of "Robot Monster vs the Aztec Mummy" and the perverted slow carpet monster of "Creeping Terror". Do not try to laugh as you watch the Tabonga throwing false natives off hills and quicksand, avoiding spears, and slowly rumbling over the "island". Shady writing, woody performance and juicy direction indicate that this pulpy fertilizer has far more bark than bite. This lukewarm pile of wood was the last hurray of longtime director and director Dan Milner, who disappeared quickly into well-deserved darkness after this film. First you put it through the grapevine of MooCow: "From Hell it Came" is a compost classic !! : ??
