I saw this last night with an open mind. Sorry, it's still bad. First, the movie is too loud and you can not hear what people are saying. The accents are bad, especially Richard Masur. What is the French chick doing in this movie ??? Abuse worst. Walken's makeup is funny. The Harvard scene is useless and is not needed. Kristoferson's character is unlikely and I wanted him to be killed and leave. Meanwhile, the walking character is killed too soon and easily (despite make-up). The settlers are all stupid. ORGANIZE Heap of Hicks people come to kill you !!!!! John Hurt's character offers a sense of humor, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this excessive crap. The only good thing is that it ruined the director's career and killed United Artists. Still Crap after all these years.
