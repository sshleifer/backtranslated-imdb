Ok, let's start by saying that if a Dutch movie is bad, it's really REALLY BAD. Here in Holland rarely something with some quality (Lek, Karakter), but not often. Costa! It's about four girls who go to Spain to go on holiday, party, get drunk, lie down (you know the exercise). It's also about the world of clubbers or proppers. Professionals trying to lure the crowd into their club. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how long it took to write the script, but I suspect you're between 15 and 20 minutes because you're watching a series of random scenes for 90 minutes. Nothing, and I mean, nothing is believable in this movie. It is almost too ridiculous for words to happen with the plot. Suddenly the movie turns into a kind of karate action. In a duel with "the evil in black" and with clich√© chases by a water tank car (it can be cheesier). The words character development and casting are also unfamiliar to the creators. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Traffic" 3 days ago, I fell for pure brilliance, from a work of art to this one. This is the filmmaking that is saddest. And do not start with a low budget. Because even with a small budget you could write a better script. It almost seems like the filmmakers have been too busy celebrating themselves to make a decent movie. Anyway, the chicks in the water managed a bit in the end, but for the rest, do not waste your money on such garbage.
