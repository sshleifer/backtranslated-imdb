I wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before giving up. The main character is completely unaware and surprisingly disagreeable, but there is no humor in his drudgery. As soon as he arrives in Germany, the scriptwriter pulls the old "There is only one room in the hotel, you have to share a room with a pretty girl". Come on, at least you could let her develop her relationship first. Watch "It Happened One Night" to see how you can do it right - or one of a thousand movies ever since. <br /> <br /> The acting is consistently third-rate and the improvised dialogue should have been maintained the schneideraumboden. It meanders without any plan, though the film telegraphs the goal of the relationship from the time Greta is introduced. <br /> <br /> The first song in the boardroom is mildly funny but badly sung. The rest of the songs (of course, I only heard them in the first half hour) are just pointless and horrible. Most singers are painfully moody, but not in a deliberately humorous way.
