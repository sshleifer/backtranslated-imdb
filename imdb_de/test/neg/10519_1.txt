What can you say about a movie about a crossdressing gangster? Not very much. With the average indie-style filmmaking, this movie has the timing wrong. Editing is just awful. As for the gangster story, it might have been deducted if the gangsters lacked any character. Everyone seemed to be there only for a kind of punch line. None of it was funny. The usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold, the dying mafia father who wishes his son would legitimize his business, the best friend with the "crazy" monopolists. But the main character, the gangster who likes to dress like a girl. Only his motivation to disguise himself like a girl is that he was attacked by a woman? Strange. The end of the film had to be the nail in the coffin. It was anti-climatic, to say the least. I mean, I understand that indie filmmakers do not have the equipment for a real shot, but they might as well use water pistols. All in all, I would say the hype that led to it (premiere of the red carpet in Vancouver) was a disappointment.
