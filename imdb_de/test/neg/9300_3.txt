Frank Falenczyk: I'm not sorry I killed her. I'm sorry that I killed her hard. <br /> <br /> Wow! Talk about a momentum and a failure. You have a great cast and a great action with endless possibilities ... how do you like that? Well, apparently John Dahl has found a way. With a gruesome script featuring witty jokes like a malaria epidemic and such a painful dialogue that none of the characters are sympathetic, "You Kill Me" might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007. On a positive note, Ben Kinglsey is another great achievement as a Polish alcoholic trying to get clean, but the material he has to work with is crap. Tea Leoni is good, as are Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall, and the rest of the cast. I think the best way to describe "You Kill Me" is a horrible movie with good performances. Note: D +
