I hope that Matt Dorff's original script was much better for that (there are signs - dialogues that were supposed to take place well before big f / x scenes (to introduce characters) that would make sense much earlier) will be published later in the Time pinched). Line, maybe the original script was a longer run, but maybe not - definitely that smells. Every character is uninteresting, and * everyone * speaks expressions as if they were speaking the word of God characters who are completely out of control - Dianne Wiest's "Secretary Abbot" is just terrible, telling her assistant (and, by the way, us) things in endless talk that NONE would ever say to anyone in real life (if she is not) to her assistant explaining things she already has There are characters that are totally one-dimensional - the evil Power Company guy, the pilot who does NOT care about his personal SHUT SHUT life and focus on his job. The "well-intentioned" superdooperuber hacker guy who can crash everything in Chicago (including the phones) - and then give the oh-what-what-I-talk (but not leave behind?). The crusader reporter who gives up his principles in no time? The supervisor of the electricity company, who breaks off his position in the midst of the worst crisis in Chicago since the fire - without consequences? Hospitals abandoned by doctors and nurses during the crisis (I'm not joking, that's in the movie.) Oh yes, and it's full of Hollywood stereotypes about morality - women are generally good, men are evil, unless it is influenced by a woman (the ultimate is punk with the weapon - robbed of the influence of a woman, he literally goes insane); a nasty stupid act (as the reporter did to Hacker-Bozo) is fine as long as you mean 'good'. Evil men die, capitalist villains die as horribly as possible, everyone else lives (well, except Randy Quaid). And did I hear someone say that the nuclear power plants had to be shut down because the safety systems could not be powered by electricity (think about it)? <br /> <br /> There's a ray of sunshine (If you forgive the expression) - Randy Quaid essentially plays his character of "Independence Day" (you know - "Hello guys - I'm Baaaack!") - this time as a storm hunter with an infinite range of SUV and Superdooper batteries for its camcorders. Still, they kill him - mostly it seems so the audience appreciates that tornadoes are pretty dangerous things (somehow flat, that.). <br /> <br /> Give this one pass.
