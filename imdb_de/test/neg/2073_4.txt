Stupid drama, weak script ... the worst Spanish movie in years ... I was attracted to the (naked) beauty of Paz Vega, but as an actress she is in vain, you almost can not understand what she's saying ... <br /> <br /> There is not much coherence about the story ... we have heard of it before, but as this is a "modern Carmen", we find a few changes: - The French soldier is now one Basque soldier. -Merimee herself is a figure in the story. - Carmen is a dangerous "bandolera", in love with a famous matador, and she can speak fluent Basque ... <br /> <br /> Can anyone understand this mess?
