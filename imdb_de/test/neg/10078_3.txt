It's clear that for this movie the story should be driven by the characters. But immediately the story causes you to dislike the new main characters. The overflight of the island and the underlying dinosaur had no influence and almost looked like a caricature. The action entrance to the island is just a reissue of parts from JP 1 and 2. The story is predictable to the point of annoyance, and it's totally unsatisfying, which made me feel cheated. This gave me no choice but to reward the film with 3/10!
