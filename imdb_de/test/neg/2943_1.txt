At first I thought it was bad, because I had high expectations for this film, but after I thought about it, it's so bad. I was almost entangled in hks advertising for bad stars in bad movies. Hk's new generation of actors and actresses, not to mention bad scriptwriters, is slowing down the industry. At the moment, I'm still trying to figure out how big it is. Normally you can not lose in a movie with Donnie Yen and Ekin (forget Jackie, he has passed his peak). But then I should find out when twins were on the cover. it's cheesy, pugnacious, very cheesy, I try to laugh at some jokes, but not only the effect is very low, but the jokes are very recycled and not funny. I am sorry that I bought the movie. The only reason some people think that it is so good is that they are brainwashed because the twins are cute and everyone likes them and everything they do is good and funny. and if you like twins then you're up to date ... sigh ... i miss the good hk movie days when jet li and stephen chow movies dominated the box office ... <br /> <br /> <br /> films from mainland China are much better than these, and they are being shot for lower budgets.
