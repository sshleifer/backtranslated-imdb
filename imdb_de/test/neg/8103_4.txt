"Black Dragons" is a second popular propaganda film from the Second World War. It's not as bad as some would think. <br /> <br /> A secret meeting of the distinguished Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke) is interrupted by a mysterious stranger named Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly thereafter, the participants of the meeting appeared murdered, their bodies were placed on the steps of the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay), who is trying to help him. The reasons for the action of Colomb are explained only on the last role. Until everything is explained at the end, the story is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, who appeared in a series of low-budget quickies at the time, is really good in this case. He must not exaggerate as much as he used to, and thanks to director William Nigh. Lugose's figure slips through the shadows, reminiscent of Dracula to the full close-ups of his piercing eyes. Clayton Moore, a one-dimensional actor, could single-handedly become a TV a few years ago. Joan Barclay is a good hero. <br /> <br /> Although "Black Dragons" is a bit older, it is not a bad opportunity to spend an hour.
