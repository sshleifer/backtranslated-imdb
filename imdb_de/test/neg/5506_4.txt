I can not help but think that this is Franco's "damage" to the Marquis de Sade's "Thousand Days of Sodom". People (in this case women) kidnapped to serve as a slave to a privileged elite? Check. Naughty sex? Check. Torture including flogging? Check. Victims who were randomly selected to be killed? Check. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, Franco has not given anything and has introduced the cinema crowd to the joys of coprology (and coprophagy), another perversion that keeps appearing in de Sade's boring and disgusting saga. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that this movie falls into the category "So bad, it's good". But also the rush of naked flesh and numerous sexual encounters could not compensate for the dreary dialogue, the horrible spectacle, the fleeting conspiracy and - to raise only the metal hat - the synchronization AND the English subtitles (a belt and braces are not available) woman costumes). The Alsation performed a very professional job. <br /> <br /> Of course I can be wrong about the de Sade-Winkel. After all, I did not realize that the actor who plays the main guardian in Prison was transsexual. I have to pay more attention to the size of people's hands in the future. <br /> <br /> According to another reviewer, the movie was banned in the UK. Well, it's definitely not anymore, though I cut the nipple scene to please the censors. On the DVD that I watched, this was clearly visible only on the Spanish trailer (which, if you ask yourself, compared with English). <br /> <br /> The DVD also includes an interview With Jess Franco, you need Spanish better than me to understand it. If I'm not mistaken, it's not synced or subtitled. And it indicates that the person sodomizing the character played by Franco is Ajita Wilson, who is disguised with a mustache. A bit ironic, assuming he had removed the required tag surgically.
