The series does not start as it goes on. Although the first two seasons are filled with incredibly average episodes and numerous duds, the tempo is picking up again and one of the best space opera is born. The first episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" is remarkable in two ways: It is a most gratifying introduction to all the leading actors and the particular accent of Marina Sirtis, which would later disappear. Seeing how it all started is very satisfying and rather moving with regard to the rest of the series. Otherwise it's a very mediocre episode with Q and some giant jellyfish. Right.
