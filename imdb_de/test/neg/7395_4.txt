Imagine a GILLIGAN'S ISLAND in today's African desert. Add people who are not nearly as happy as the skipper or Marianne - and scared enough to occupy the office of a German psychiatrist. Take an action that is interesting only episodic and literary parallelism that is never deep enough to really satisfy. Season with a really sullen topic that has been exploited since the first world travelers felt very, very lost. <br /> <br /> If THE KING IS ALIVE was not the product of the reigning Czars du Jour of Dogme 95, would this be a problem that attracts so much attention? Dogme 95 is to Hollywood as Danish Modernism to Rococo. This Scandinavian movement is a by-product of digital technology and attempts - quite dogmatically - to eliminate the artificiality of filmmaking by using more natural elements and returning to the core of storytelling. For example, PEARL HARBOR is the dogma antichrist. The saga of director / co-author Kristian Levring considers interpersonal relationships and human nature when exposed to a life-threatening situation. Eleven people in a bus driving through the Namibian sand dunes are suddenly stranded in the remains of a deserted city. An African native who does not speak his language serves as an observer and narrator (whose findings are among the harshest films). While the fittest embarks on a five-day walk to the next village, the others stay behind, surviving on canned can carrots and surrounding their probable future as vulture feed. The former Thespian Henry decides that this rather unappetizing crew needs a distraction and memorizes KING LEAR by hand. He assigns roles, and the group spends many days learning and rehearsing lines to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable. Gradually the occupation loses them and the wildnesses of their nature? or, William Golding could say, human nature is beginning to dip. If you have ever seen LORD OF THE FLIES, you know that these things can become ugly, that even Mother Teresa can be transformed into the position of a lifeboat to create the PMSing term of Calcutta. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed with an international ensemble of American, English, French and South African actors who, as the dogma dogma dictates, are developing themselves and their roles quite organically. THE KING was also chronologically filmed, adding a sense of realism to the ever increasing despair of its characters. After up to three handheld cameras were digitally recorded, the results were transferred to 35mm film. <br /> <br /> The most convincing performance comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays a boho-pop tart trying to enhance the mood of the group in every possible way. Henry (David Bradley) is another finely played character whose passion for life's work ultimately saves the gang from utter desperation. It's hard for the others to be sad. Cruel wives and their Oaf husbands, long-established women's cooks, capricious French intellectuals, wealthy men who have more important places than in the Namibian desert. Beckett may hate this question, but why does this group ever travel by bus through far-off Africa? Life-threatening morbidity! Total despair in graphic details! A relentlessly boring pace! Enjoy.
