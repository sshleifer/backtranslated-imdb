OH DEAR GOD! After such a promising start, Critters 2 repeated the karmic rule of what is going on. Obviously, few things were thought through in making this film, and what happened to Scott Grimes, who has an ear! This should have been the last expedition to the Critters saga, but more garbage was on the way. That was the main reason why I did not see Critters 3 and why does every bad movie series have to have an episode in space? (Critters, Friday the 13th, Goblin in Space, Hellraiser, etc.)
