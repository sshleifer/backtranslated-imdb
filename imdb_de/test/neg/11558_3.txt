This was done in this popular time of the 80's and filmed in my hometown of New York City. In fact, this has become one of my favorite sci-fi movies. Oh, sure, it really stinks to hell, but there's so much to make fun of, laugh at and enjoy that it gets more bearable after each viewing /> Try to find the similarities between this and ... well , OK, there is nothing like this. Well, except Castle of FuManchu. <br /> <br /> Sock dolls can be dangerous to your health. > Let yourself be carried away by "Valeria" (wonderfully played by Angelika Jager) to deliver some of the most mesmerizing lines of all time !! <br /> <br /> Many men and women in a post-apocalyptic way (also leather bikinis, loincloths and dead animal skin) <br /> <br /> In the end, be horrified! <br /> <br /> I am on my way to a salad. Toodles !!
