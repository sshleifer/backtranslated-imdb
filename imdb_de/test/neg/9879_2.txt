From the creators of Underworld we have by far the worst Werewolf movie I've ever seen. It's basically a reconstructed version of Underworld, but it lacks vampires (no big deal), cool effects (a BIG deal), and in general almost everything you can do to make a decent movie about lycanthropy (the biggest deal) to produce Of all!). A twenty or so Lycanthrope chocolate maker, Vivian, has been living in Romania since her family were executed and executed as werewolves in America before their years. There she belongs to a small company (or a group of werewolves) and is apparently chosen to have the pack leader Gabriel, whose son - some toads with a British accent - involuntarily marry, take the hunt outside of the pack. They seem to have been discovered in other countries before and want to settle in Romania by avoiding negative attention. Therefore, this activity is considered prohibited. Finally, Vivian falls in love with an American artist who is unaware of her involvement in the group of bloodthirsty predators. When they discover the secret relationship, things become messy when someone is killed and man is forced to join a deadly tradition of being let into the forest and being hunted - giving the pack the chance to be in it All that really is is a big jump before they light up and end up as Wolf - very funny effects.The whole movie is like a tamed underworld with dripping, romantic montages and very little action Theater, I could not wait until it was over, a devastatingly boring disappointment.
