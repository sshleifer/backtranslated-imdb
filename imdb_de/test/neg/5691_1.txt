In a world where people can live forever, they spend the entire movie wishing they would die. First of all, if you insist that this movie is watched, first mute two things. Do not worry about missing a conspiracy. Hell, they do not even speak the first 70 minutes of an 87-minute movie after you've muted them. Now you have to press fast forward until the main chick dies. Do not worry, even if you're not paying attention to why or how she died. Once you get to the "good part", take it mute. Oh, how do you know that? Waiting for an elevator scene with two idiots in space suits with weapons from the Second World War. These weapons do not seem to be much until you find that the first protagonist had a laser tag gun and a bandoleer of CO2 cartridges. The only remnants of a plot are between a glowing ball and a half-hot chick that looks like it has been attacked by Wolverine. After listening to the "conspiracy," you want them to stop talking. Of the four people in this film, none of them can act remotely, not even a bit, and you'll be happier with acting in a kindergarten theater. <br /> <br /> To comment on the special about the special effects, just let me say "wow", no, really, you'll spend the whole movie saying to yourself, "Where's the budget of 1.8 million dollars of this movie gone? " Seriously, it will leave you on the scale of incompetence. The best "sets" are basically Windows wallpapers. The ships are basically flying wrenches. Waiting a few are barges that somehow look like whales. I've never heard so many fictitious words in my life. They have buttons on the wrist (large pedometer) that allow them to be put in "combat mode" and super run mode. This seriously drains their energy reserves, but they find pieces of cable that they can chew on to regain their strength. The explosions were less impressive than my fourth of July, I only had sparklers. <br /> <br /> So the plot, as far as I know, is something like "mother", is a spaceship captain and goes into the desert. For a while a rocket dies. Then her daughter remembers 6000 years in the future (no, I'm not exaggerating) about her mother's memories through a kind of capsule. Anyway, they row for another 10 minutes and then there is a big bang. Yes, the same "big bang" that our solar system started with. It explains how it goes back in time or something. It does not really matter what happened, I think. Seriously, the whole script was compassionate on a sheet of paper, unless one of the terrible battle scenes was actually described in detail. After watching the credits, I've now laughed more than the whole movie Jobs, which were created like a catering supervisor "Galactius Sarcophagus," and the special thanks to George Lucas was simply the best. <br /> <br /> I really did not expect so much for a movie that I paid 99 cents for, but seriously some body owes me for that. The most common comment that comes after the movie "I want my life back". One must admire that investing time and effort in this film, but seriously, why?
