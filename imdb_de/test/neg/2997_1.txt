This is a good time to say how well I feel about this site: It gives me the opportunity to answer all the frustration I've experienced for two hours and wait for something to happen, say something, shown to be subtle shown for a symbol, idea or whatever. No, just long, endless violins, alternating from a tired piano. Tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. Boring is the long death of the mind, and from this point of view this film is a public enemy. How many thousands of live hours are stolen from thousands of innocent bystanders. I do not demand my money, just for my time and the time of the people I invited to see this thing ... oh god!
