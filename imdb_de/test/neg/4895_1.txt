How do you turn a story from one of America's most famous American authors into a totally unsightly movie? Watch this movie and find out. Maybe I override the author Carson McCullers, but I was impressed with "The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter" and hoped for something memorable. Forget it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave looks like a man with her short haircut and clothes. I've never found them exciting in pretty much any movie anyway. Rod Steiger as a preacher? How offensive is that? Improbable characters, one after the other. Well, maybe that's the book too, and I'm unfair to this movie. I know the story only about what I saw on screen, and this was a movie that was so uninteresting that I could never recommend it to anyone. Apart from a few nice films here and there, there is nothing to recommend. It's amazing how someone can sit for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> I did not even know how bad that is. There is good news: this was the only movie Simon Cowell staged.
