This movie is a shame. How do you turn one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time into a kind of half-hearted love story. The entire beginning of the film was not in the history of H.G. Wells and did not have to be. The Eloi were completely wrong. They built houses or formed some kind of real company. They did not care about it at all. That was an important part of the story. The way they had created a world that was without difficulty or complex emotions. They were hardly aware of the Morlocks. I do not know why this movie was made this way, but some stories should be told as they are or left alone.
