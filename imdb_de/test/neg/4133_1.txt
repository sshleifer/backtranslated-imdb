When making an exciting movie, it is important that the "villain" is not more sympathetic than the "victim." And that fails miserably. It was so horrible and frustrating to see that I was actually asked to register and comment. OK, so the husband is rich and cocky. There are worse vices, and the cabana boy and the woman show a lot. The husband is an idiot because he did not agree that the cabana boy physically attacked this woman - the witch who had absolutely nothing to do with the conspiracy. The cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly tries to seduce the woman. Then he forces himself to her - what the woman finds so hot, she stops thinking of rape, and begins to think that she wants him. Um The misogynistic, inferiority complex thoughts that the director shows are just disgusting. It's one thing when a good movie like American Psycho purposely tries to get us into the bad guy, but in Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy, but the director did not make it unlikely, but him hate the victims. What did he think ???
