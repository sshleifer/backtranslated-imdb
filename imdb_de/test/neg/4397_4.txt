This movie is best described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom. How many vague humorous misconceptions can you put in just one movie? Notes are misplaced, bags are changed, conversations are mixed, people are messed up, situations are misinterpreted, and somewhere along the line people are supposed to laugh at something. The authors really have trouble keeping everything running, which makes the dialogues really forced. If someone in this movie behaved like a real person, it would all be done in about two minutes, and everyone could return to their lives, but he has to keep up the misunderstandings. Sometimes this movie tries to make some youthful laughter, but everyone remembers how funny "American Pie" was. The scene with the nerd asking the hooker (of whom he thinks she is a foreign exchange student) to "eat his sausage" goes on forever, and not a second of it is funny. However, I have to give some credit to this film: it's not as boring as it could have been because of the subplot about stolen money. It also has a laugh here and there, but unfortunately it is another misunderstanding. Overall, this movie is too lame.
