This movie was so horrible that I can not even describe it. I was amazed that I even sat through this pile of rubbish. I could not believe that such a movie was thought. It was a serial killer clinging like a chicken. He does not just clap a couple of times, he does the whole movie without interruption. He even embraces like a chicken, which is even stupider than anything I've ever seen. I could not believe that this came out in 1990. I thought it came out in the early '80s or something. Then the daughter is also not very smart, because she has protected the geek or the man's chicken. The end gets worse and is the worse ending I've ever seen. This movie is just chicken. I laughed more than I was scared, and I strongly recommend buying a bucket of fried chicken instead of watching this movie.
