This film is full of sentimentality, unprofessional flying that terrifies a pilot like me, and irrelevant material. Why, for example, introduce Rachel? She has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, except that her "Follow Me" truck can run wild and crash against Dorinda's fence. This must be one of the dumbest sequences among many in the film. Another is in the end when the plane (it was a B-26 or an A-26 - both designations will be used in the film) with swirling props and without chocks left. This, of course, serves the plot, but uncovering would be a dreaded spoiler. In this case, the aircraft would have started to roll control without control. The end (again avoiding spoilers) requires far too much talk - as at the beginning of the sound films in the 30s with all these closing speeches. Here Dreyfuss babbles on and on. The ending also contains other radical violations of the aircraft protocol and some improbabilities / impossibilities that I will not describe. What a boring and incoherent effort!
