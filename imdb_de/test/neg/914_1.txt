Oh my god, I had to see this movie FOUR times in my sister's house. It was a terrible story about sex and guns and a very cheap, inexplicable acting, unless you are at gunpoint to avoid it, avoid it Ving Rhames has also shown the most horrific drama of all time in his films. There was no part of this movie that made me laugh or make me appear or feel. I would be surprised that people really enjoyed it. I have some horrible movies in my life But that would be in my five worst movies where the music was not good at all, and the action I think was made by some guys who ordered a pizza and just sat down, wrote ten points and made a film absolutely terrible
