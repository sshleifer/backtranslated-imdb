I've watched a lot of movies over the years and am a big fan of comedy. <br /> <br /> But this so-called comedy almost moved me to tears. It's without a doubt the BAD movie I've ever seen, the worst. I remember hearing this movie from a friend and decided to look at it. If I could, I could turn back time, I would. I'll regret it as long as I live, the time I spent with this garbage. <br /> <br /> The story is so crazy; it just does not make sense and makes you confused. There is a Scottish mob and a German headhunter following Pestario's 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish mob after $ 50,000 and the Germans after his head. Attempting to escape the plague takes the form of many disguises. But we experience some of the most annoying, worst, most amazing spectacles, dialogues and sounds in cinematic history. This movie has annoyed me so much; In the end I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I spent so much time watching a movie that would surely lead the depressed people to almost certain suicide. I mean, how can there be hope if a movie like this can be given permission? <br /> <br /> I know that people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people really like it. Why? What is funny about a man who is annoying from the first to the last minute? A man who can not act? Who has an annoying voice and a confused face? <br /> <br /> I sat down and thought the movie would get better, it certainly would. It has not. Usually you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans or the Scottish mob to find and kill The Pest, which brings me out of my misery. Nothing funny, interesting or normal happens in this film, it's just annoying and confusing. The jokes are already dead, even before they are told. I'm sorry for the cameramen, who have no control over how the movie is made, but actually have to film this drivel. I would not be surprised if they get a consultation. <br /> <br /> If you want to stay reasonable and be part of society, I recommend you never watch this movie. I would rather lock myself in my room for 5 weeks and forgo food and water than watch this movie again! <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll ever hate anymore.
