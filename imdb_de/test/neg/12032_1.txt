A low budget can be an excuse for bad acting talent and pathetic-looking spotty bleeding. However, there is no excuse for bad writing. It is a talent to be able to write dialogues without being compulsive and mechanical. The dialogue in this film was comparable to most instructional videos shown to fast food employees in training. <br /> <br /> I also understand that you have to make a few exceptions when you have only $ 20 to spend on acting. With these words no reputable director would have looked at these scenes and said: "That was perfect". I see a better character playing on Canadian television. <br /> <br /> This film had a thin plot, bad acting, bad dialogues and no intelligent ideas whatsoever. It just proves to me that some independent films are like this for a reason. If you are looking for a quick fear, rent everything else. Even the "Cable Guy" was a terrifying movie. After watching this movie, I would have rather seen a re-run on the X files.
