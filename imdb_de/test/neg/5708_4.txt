A woman who deals with art begins a passionate love affair with a man named John. They love each other wherever they go, and they play sexual games. The problem I had was that was all they did. There was no action in this movie or I just did not see it. The hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie, but I wanted something else to happen. Maybe he could have been a serial killer or she could have kept a secret. I just needed something and all that was there was a lot of love scenes. Not that it was bad or anything. I just wanted more things to happen in the movie. Maybe a co-worker slept with him. Something! I was very excited that this was all there was. Mickey Rourke was so hot at the time. I wonder what happened.
