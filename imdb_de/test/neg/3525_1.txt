Let me see ... I've seen every movie Lou Ferrigno made. I have seen Batman & Robin twice. I memorized the dances in Breakin '2: Electric Boogaloo ... I've seen incomplete Blade Runner student films ripped off ... but this movie is the most painful I've ever seen. <br /> This was the first movie for the "Direct to the Video Market". So you can thank Blood Cult for all those mysterious Michael Dudikoff movies in your blockbuster. You should know that this is not high quality video. This is a consumer quality. This is your father's video camera that he never uses. This is what you have to look out for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with details of the plot, as I get tired when I think about it, but I'll tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. I only see this movie when I'm angry with myself. Therefore, I recommend this movie if you are suicidal or if you want to face a daunting challenge. If you borrow this movie (God, have mercy), you'll know what you're after for the first 10 minutes. This is when you get hit by the usual horror movie intro. You know the drill. There is a lot of tension and building up before a girl dies. Yes, you've seen it before, but not like that. This is the most boring intro I've ever seen. I honestly believe that you could get a camera from ebay for ten bucks, grab your butt that smells the most of gin and sweets, and tell him to cook your mother's dinner, and it would be more interesting than this intro , It bored me to tears. I cried like a baby. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that makes this movie so incredibly painful are its actors. Yes, I saw bad acting. TRUST ME I've seen Oliver Twist's 4th grade with more realistic dialogues. The lead actor makes me sick. The "supporting" actress is a train accident of a human being. <br /> <br /> I will not even comment on the friend. True horror. <br /> <br /> Borrow this movie if you can find it. You will never be so depressed that you spent $ 3 on something else.
