I do not understand the point. It is heavy. The animated people are scary (look eerie valley). Scenes go on and on and on. The storyline is skeletal and must be filled with a lot of meaningless dramatic, screaming roller coaster rides, as if Disney or Spielberg are planning an amusement park ride based on the movie. Most characters are annoying and unlikely. Some of them keep popping up as if adding something important to a climate scene. They do not do it. They simply disappear without lasting effect. Someone put it this way: "If you do not believe in Santa, you'll be kidnapped on Christmas Eve on a train." That sums it up pretty well.
