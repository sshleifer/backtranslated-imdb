I just watched this movie last night, and after reading all the reviews, I expected a good, emotional sports movie. What I got was a bit clichéd and boring. Yes, I thought it was boring. I saw the All-Star injured long before the match. I thought they might wait until it breaks down until the game is over before the big one, but I think the first game is good enough. <br /> <br /> Parental relationships were also very clichéd, with the dominating drunken father (I'll say, McGraw impressed me though) and the boy who wants to stay and help his (sickly?) mother. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the random girls (Melissa and Maria) who were in the movie every 5 minutes and sat down to give the soccer boys some field action. I thought "ok, how does that work again?" Maybe I missed the point, beyond "Well, they play football in a city that loves to make the girls throw themselves at their feet". <br /> <br /> The sports action had some good points, but most of it was so rushed! I think the first game lasted longer than the montage of the entire playoffs! And I was not so sure about the continuity of the pulled down clock in the last game. <br /> <br /> I think I could see that this movie wins the ESPY for the best sports movie if it's the only one that's been released. Honestly, I found it a boring movie full of people obsessed with pigskin. For a better football movie, visit Remember the Titans.
