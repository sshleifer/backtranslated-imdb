The renowned Argentine horror film Emilio Vierya conducts a screenplay by Jack Curtis and Antonio Ross. Cheesy and ridiculous is the mixture of the method to insanity. The son of a doctor approaches his early death until his desperate father transplants a monkey heart into his chest. As expected, things get strange. When this young man turns into a mask carrying a monster, he strips the beaches and picks pretty party girls to make his slaves. When heroin is injected, its beauties become zombies. The monster conjures its stunned minions with strange organ music. So bad ... well, it's just awful. Cast: Jose E. Moreno, Alberto Caneau, Mauricio De Ferraris, Gloria Prat and Gina Moret.
