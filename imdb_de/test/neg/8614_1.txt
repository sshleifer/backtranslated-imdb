The plot is simple: an American couple is on holiday in Thailand. Somehow they are attacked by the 'all-powerful' Chinese vampires, and the girl is kidnapped by the big boss of the vampires. This is OK so far. The girl's partner still has to look for her. And now the horror begins. He meets a strange group of half-vampires or something (they just drank animal blood). These vampires have been in conflict with evil for about 800 years. However, with the help of the "good vampires" the guy starts to search his girlfriend. Now the fight scenes start, what a karate film without a fight? Another thing I noticed is that the vampires are very ugly people. I mean ... a vampire is an old-fashioned guy (he's been living forever ...), he's got style. There are also modern vampires, but in this movie the vampires are ... weird. So, come on, they ride bicycles, they are all dressed in leather and destroy everything in their own way. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that you can clearly see that this movie is a low budget movie. The script is boring and the actors are not too talented. The music is pretty good, but the effects are not great. <br /> <br /> To summarize the movie, it's not great, but if you have a free afternoon, look at it and tell me if I'm right or not.
