I've seen worse, a backhand, to say how bad this movie was. The conspiracy is ridiculous: A student shoots a police officer and five others take him hostage? In a dimly lit, smoky New York school - and somehow it takes 24 hours for this stereotypical kidnapping to be solved? Are you serious? A daylong hostage-taking - with a wounded NYPD officer, it takes no less than the whole day? I realize that this movie was made before 9/11, but still. I looked at the clock and wondered how they could possibly pull this exaggerated plan for another hour and 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> The acting was mediocre at best and the characters were thought to be from seventh place Pupil The child with child abuse, the pregnant frightened girl, the violent gang wannabe, a confused unfortunate victim, the wise, cracking white. You're welcome. <br /> <br /> Are you trying to make this kidnapping a mission for "more textbooks" and better school conditions? Please - this is a weak attempt to write a movie about a child who shoots a policeman. They are confused, ignorant idiots who interfere in a stupid, far-fetched situation. Do not try to paint them as noble at once. The most ridiculous is Ziggy, who lives in the attic of the school and Michaelangelo so much admired that he paints these eye-catching scenes on the walls. You must kid me. <br /> <br /> The sign "no racism" in the protesting crowd? A black kid shoots a black policeman and a black negotiator tries to pack everything up. This is a random message. <br /> <br /> I understand the overall message that has been misrepresented, albeit by some actors who have made a respectable career. <br /> <br /> But this was a joke the red sniper lasers on the roof? The worst scene was the boy who fell fake snow and died in the arms of his roommate on the roof, "promise me", etc. How original. <br /> <br /> The epilogue "I went to jail, but now I am." I'm a prerogative at XYZ University "... a fitting way to end a film joke.
