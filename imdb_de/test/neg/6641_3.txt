This movie is stupid. It can not get around. But that's stupid and stupid. Mind you, stupid and dumber is much funnier. However, I love to watch silly movies (Tail Sting) and laugh with a group of good friends about how bad it is. Call me, but watch this movie and you'll find that you can only laugh if you do not laugh about it.
