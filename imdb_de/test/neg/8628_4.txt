A couple is separated during a vacation. Early scenes make us believe that Barney, Jeff Bridges' character, has kidnapped the girl in an inexplicable but deliberate kidnapping. The film takes place a few years later, when Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland), despite a new love interest, is determined to solve her disappearance. <br /> <br /> The plot is definitely fascinating, but some really bad decisions were made The filming of this film culminated in a rather modest work. <br /> <br /> OK, here we go. The Abduction Scene - Apart from two major continuity flaws, there is a point where Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland perform a small signed pet-love ritual that has drowned in excessive sentimentality to nausea. We know that you are in love. The speech, "I swear solemnly never to leave you," was generously grateful only a few moments earlier. Jeff Bridges' robot accent is another example. What is it for? Starman is back and it seems he has gotten mad after a decade on the planet. The entire conspiracy can then be resolved by the introduction of an unnecessary character that possesses miraculous powers of observation through a rather fortunate turn of fate. Essentially, the climatic sequence itself was only much, much better. It is fraught with further annoyances and another blinding continuity error. I could go on, but something positive has to be said. Kiefer Sutherland is the only one who can save face with a pretty decent performance. <br /> <br /> The eponymous original from 1988 (modified from the Dutch title 'Spoorloos' for English speakers) was recommended for me only for an online rental company to accidentally send me this later Hollywood version. I was surprised to see that both were directed by George Sluizer and I would be interested to hear his motivation for the remake. I am reliable and thankful informed that it has a much higher quality in all areas, including land. Horah for it, but it does not really need much.
