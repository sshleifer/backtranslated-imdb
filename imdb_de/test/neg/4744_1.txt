Turd Pie: <br /> <br /> * Take x2 franchises * Par Boil for 5 minutes * Stir in mixed cardboard figurines (no actors work best) * Add 2 tons of clich√©s and bake them in Your Plot Get Microwave until bored. * Serve with a pinch of Dawson's Crack (no typo) <br /> <br /> Voila! - Money Spinning Brain Red for the Emo / World of Warcraft Generation <br /> <br /> Looking for the keys in the drain was the best (?) <br /> <br /> Except for the first 5 minutes , it's one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Utter, Utter, nonsense.
