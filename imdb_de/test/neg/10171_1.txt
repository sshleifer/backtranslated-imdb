How many comments about me, me too, although this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately not. I found it rather condescending and preaching. <br /> <br /> But that's not the only comment. The scenes are very "artificial" (not like in Scifi, as I'll explain in a few moments). (The next movement is a small spoiler.) The film represents more or less a discussion between two groups. In the physical environment of a discussion, usually two or three men stand side by side, the middle one usually speaks. In the worst case, the other party is represented by one person. <br /> <br /> The interviews with the reporters are also very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. For example, the discussion is sometimes between the reporters (I mean, from a point of respondent, "akward"). In addition, the interviewers always remain calm, they say everything without normal emotions. That you can not tell if they are lying or not, if they are crazy or not. They show almost nothing. <br /> <br /> This is also very unprofessional, the "Christian" reporters always believe everything they are told by the people who interview them. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: <br /> <br /> All conversations included: <br /> <br /> - Facts <br /> <br /> - Arguments for Arguments <br /> <br /> There are no lies. No one is lying (The next sentence is a spoiler, ignore it if you still want to see the movie.) The only lie is to show how "bad" non-believers are a B-movie It's the "Plan 9 from Outer Space "(from the '50s) is very similar, but this film also has an annoying, wrong discussion about aliens and the Christian faith. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I have no intention of offending Christians, people who believe in foreigners or anyone. This is a thought I have about the movie, not about people. <br /> <br /> Also, I'd like to say that I do not know if the actors are bad or just got horrible screenplays.
