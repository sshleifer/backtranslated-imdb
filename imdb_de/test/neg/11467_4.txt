I just saw this movie with a friend. I looked and read quickly a short summary and found it interesting. We came out of the movies and did not feel very sure if we would like it. <br /> <br /> The acting was good enough and the connection to the characters was fine. The main character that I thought was someone like Van Helsing. Yes, it was pretty entertaining. <br /> <br /> But the storyline that I felt as if it had been used by other films. The script was a bit weak, I'm not sure why every time something bad happens, the main character says "oh my god," Spoiler) The main monster at the main peak reminded me a lot of the Balrok of Lord of the Rings. Overall, the movie was ok, but I felt like it was finished. Go and buy all means, but do not expect too much.
