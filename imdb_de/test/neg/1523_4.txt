The first time I heard of Guest House Paridiso was in the "washroom" after watching the Fight Club. In each urinal was a small, round black circle deposited. When the circle came in contact with moisture (to put it mildly), a color image with photos of the two stars and the name line "You'll laugh at yourself" was created. After you had washed your hands, the circle had dried and turned black again, and it waited until the next "victim" was surprised. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe the punchline was not terribly clever. But you have to admit that it was innovative. I think I can honestly say that I've never seen anything like it in my life before, and these days, with more than a century of cinema and marketing, it's a real accomplishment. What a pity that the movie that came with it failed to live up to its promise. <br /> <br /> I hate panning Guest House Paridiso and I am grateful to Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their engaging television series it was the invention of The Young Ones (1982-1984), Bottom's Salon Games (1991-1995) or even solo work like Rik in the New Statesman (1988-1993). In fact, this would have turned into a funny 45-minute TV special. Unfortunately, it is an 89-minute film. <br /> <br /> There are definitely some virtues and I had to laugh continuously during the protracted finale, forging the Exorcists and the Lost Ark Robbers and ... well you have to see the play for yourself , Often, however, the pace is lead-free, and everywhere there is a sterile atmosphere. The two stars (Edmondson takes his usual backseat, this time due to the fact that he has sufficient direction) never really get into the first gear. Mayall only sporadically shows the stinking mania that makes him love on the small screen. In fact, the authors' assumption that we already know the characters leads to a submission to the public. The minor intimations seen in the series (Richie's females, for example, failed social climbing) are absent here, and instead there are parodies of parodies. <br /> <br /> The Fawlty Towers charge passes water, complete with drunken boss and unseen waiter "Pasquele", who is uncannily rhyming with Manuel. Some ideas, like a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a children's swing hanging over a cliff, are very funny, but in the end the frenetic pace is stolen, the two are constantly looking for a studio audience that is not there and all the "dead ones" Laughing "Areas of random" comedy "music that would have been dated two decades ago in a carry-on movie. <br /> <br /> Paridiso's brand pueriler, sadistic, perverted humor is funny, and I'm sure it makes you laugh ... but not as often as it should.
