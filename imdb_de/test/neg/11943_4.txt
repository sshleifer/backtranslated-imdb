Yes, that's what I wrote correctly. This movie is so predictable, the word needs extra letters to illustrate the predictability. From the moment the main characters and the situation are introduced, it is painting by numbers where this action will lead us. The foreboding was as subtle as a two-ton sledgehammer. They could take many dialogues and foresee the role they would play in the end. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in unpretentious roles and Abigail Breslin played the cute role admirably. It's just that the movie has brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre. The romance was lukewarm and the laughter was weak and little. Sure, it's an OK movie if you have nothing to see, but you will not miss anything if you miss it.
