This movie is very similar to any other modern horror movie. It is predictable how it will be built and developed, and it never manages to bring something original or shocking to the screen. This is really the biggest disappointment of the film, that overall there was still a promising main concept for a film of this kind. <br /> <br /> This movie can be described as a big, modern horror film cliché. It contains all the elements that modern horror movies often do not do well. One of these aspects is a groaning and very naive little child. Why do you always put these things in films? The same applies to the kind of drama aspects that affect the family. It just does not work for the movie and is anything but interesting or effective. Instead, the film is often pulled in pieces and felt as annoying. <br /> <br /> So, all the clichés are there, but you can not bring one of those clichés to the screen. As a horror movie this is just a very bad movie. She can not handle her horror or her tension well. For the fans of the genre, there is very little to enjoy. The film and its story are not all that well connected in the movie. Too often, the movie sleeps in parts and does not allow its horror to be fully effective. <br /> <br /> The film is also often too dark (no doubt an attempt to hide its relatively low budget) and it also shows very little thrill, mostly due to the fact that you just do not always see things so well can. <br /> <br /> One can only see from this film that director JS Cardone does not have much talent for the genre and does not know how to handle the latest ingredients. He has made some attempts in the past, but all his films have failed so far. he just keeps trying. Who knows, maybe with the right people behind the camera (like Tobe Hooper, who was originally a director), this film could have been decent. <br /> <br /> It's a poorly populated movie with mostly big unknowns in it. The biggest name in the movie is Ben Cross, but his role is just too small and, in a way, not really relevant to the movie and its story. It did not even seem like he had much fun playing. <br /> <br /> Just skip it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
