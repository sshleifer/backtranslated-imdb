This is a terrible remake of a very good movie called "Up In The Air" starring Frankie Darrow, Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds. I only got about 20 minutes to get through before I shut it off. Almost all lines are identical, I have no idea why they would repeat the movie. I totally agree with a previous post that does not like the songs (completely alike). In the original, the vocals are first class. I'm not sure if Marjorie Reynolds actually made her own vocals. Later added, and the songs are very good, surprisingly in a "B" movie. If you have the chance, you will see the original on DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
