Is this movie as bad as some claim? In my opinion it is so. I did not mean to comment, I've noticed some comments have been made that range from "terrible" to "not so bad" ... "But I can not resist. <br /> <br /> What are you doing from a movie that can be seen on the DVD cover, the phrase "The true story of" Ma Barker and her boys ... "and the standard" Any resemblance to actual persons ... "Disclaimer in Credits? I'm not naive, but in this case it's a pretty relevant observation regarding this movie. <br /> <br /> There are several comments that speak about the performances: they are pretty awful, Roberts, Russell, Milano and Stallone have listed something like 315 movies and TV shows they are least likely to perform. <br /> <br /> However ... the dialogue is not to my taste and sometimes unintentionally funny. The story arcs did not seem to be anything but the least necessary to band certain scenes of violence and melodrama together. <br/> <br/> The direction and writing of the screen must be flawed: Amyrillis chuckles after seeing Ma Barker's fierce temper and ends with "Take The Girl!". Whatever you think Alyssa's acting skills ... a scriptwriter wrote that line or reaction and / or a director shot at it and said, 'OK, that's good enough, no. To take it up, that's believable ...' Footnote: I picked up my copy for $ 1.99 or $ 2.99 in a grocery trash can; The runtime is displayed as 91 minutes, and I notice that the runtime in IMDb is 95 minutes. I do not know what 4 minutes I miss, but I admit that my rating could rise to 3 or 4 out of 10 in the right way, it's 1/10 I have to choose.
