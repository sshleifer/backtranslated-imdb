A film about a mysterious love letter that keeps a small town close to your ear should be fun, romantic and laid back. Instead, this film is more about things that are not said or expressed, so that you get to the point where you are grateful, if anything is said, even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - <br /> <br /> If the relationship that says the most is the one that is least visible on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know that are in trouble. But these two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie that screams for some real people. <br /> <br /> END OF THE SPOILER <br /> <br /> Capshaw's mission is not to create a figure of much and she is not quite successful. As I said above, the topic seems to be oppression and I understand that this is an element of life and love, but I do not want to see a movie about it, at least not this one. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend that despite the very talented cast that has to be left to itself.
