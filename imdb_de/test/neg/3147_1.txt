I did not watch this show that often when I was little. I think I just saw one episode about railroads, I think, because I like trains and I still do. I thought back then that it was a baby show. I mostly saw Arthur. The songs are also pretty funny. And I do not think it's that educational. They sing only a few stupid nursery rhymes. This is a stupid show, all adults who like it are crazy! If you want good children's shows, look at something like Arthur, Mister Rogers Neighborhood, or even better, Pee-wee's Playhouse. I found Sesame Street boring when I was little, but even that's better than Barney. Trust me, this show is pretty stupid, there are other kids shows that are better than these. I can see many of the reviews here that many people do not like this show. Now there are some mature people. I hope they take this show off the plane soon.
