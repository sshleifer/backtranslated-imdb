Rather a frisbee-like turtle with fangs rising like a warthog. More battles with people in bird suits who look like people in bird suits. A ping pong ball spaceship. Two cheeky guys who know how to do it all, including getting into the spaceship. Boring music. More "Gamera is the friend of children". I remember when Godzill and Rodan came out. The movies were a lot of fun because the monsters were actually a threat to humans. Now they are just a parade of stupid costumes with very little behind them. The adults are all ridiculous and idiotic. As in American sitcoms, the kids are the bosses (when in fact they can not think of a paper bag). These monster movies have to be the Japanese medium to celebrate these little snots. Most of all, however, that after seeing three of these films (with the same conspiracy over and over again, check the footage), the final conclusion is that they are boring. If you have not seen this, do not bother.
