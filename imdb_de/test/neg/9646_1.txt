Generally, I like Sion Sono's work, but this film has been completely slowed down. But unfortunately not retarded enough to delay it entertaining. I just sat with my mouth open and wondered when it would end. The action makes only a whisper sense. I think it should be Campy. I mean, Haunted Hair Extensions - how could it not be? But the humor, as it was, fell flat. Not funny. Not scary. Not bloody. I would say, maybe Sono was a committed hand for this project, but he also seems to have written that boring trash. I have to fill a few more lines, what else is there to say? I could say I could say in the end, better luck next time, Mr. Sono.
