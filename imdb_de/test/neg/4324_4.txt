Perhaps the weakest film in the "Kharis" series, despite the presence of John Carradine (abused as Egyptian High Priest) and George Zucco (as his predecessor, who is most uncomfortably disturbed by a bad case of Parkinson 's disease) Lon Chaney Jr. supports Titular Creature - if it really was him under the bandages, since his contribution is negligible at best! I think it's 60 minutes for themselves, but the standards have dropped significantly even compared to the previous two entries, and the end result is strictly routine and unimaginable. The only interesting thing is the fact that the female lead is the reincarnation of Princess Ananka, which has been mentioned a lot in earlier films but has never been seen before.
