It is a pity to throw away such a good idea. The main idea of ​​the film is the journey into past lives, which fortunately is not a time travel, but a journey into the human being, which has neither the past nor the future to do. (Maybe they should not be labeled as past lives in the movie because I think of it now ... Another minus, I think). It's all in the present, in another room ... Very interesting, without causing much religious suffering. <br /> <br /> But the music is totally repetitive, melodramatic, sentimental and inappropriate (let alone "western"!) There should have been more variety and more thought about where music should be and where it should not be The romantic scenes of the flashback take up a lot of space and running time and are completely unnecessary.Acting is not bad, though the language has kept me from understanding better. <br /> <br /> I think the idea needed a little bit more thinking, developing and unfolding the interior scenes could have had better background shots as they are in many cases unreal and overall I would say this film leaves much to be desired ...
