Fortunately, you do not need much "learning the book" to understand where this is going ... Obviously, there's a poverty dispute at Universal's big hit THE WOLF MAN (which was made just a year ago), the always-win-win George thinks Zucco in another of his patented "crazy doctor" roles as a brilliant, vengeful scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who has settled deep in the swamps of Louisiana Bayou, is seeking revenge on four of his former peers, who both humiliate him and force him to resign. They mocked his claim that he could mix humans with the beast to create an unstoppable army of Wolfman creatures that would prove useful in wartime. Fortunately, Cameron has found the ideal test object for his wolf blood injections - a huge, childish half joke called Petro (Glenn Strange). Petro is pretty clueless about what's going on, does not ask too many questions, and lets him drop him off at a table and shoot him up with everything in his syringe. This leads to a time-lapse change of the person who turns into a werewolf. Cameron lets him emerge through a secret passageway out of the mansion, so basically one is wearing a big man (Strange was 6'5 ") in jumpsuit with bushy beard, hairy paws and oversized plastic teeth running around the woods most of the time An eyewitness has seen the animal and a little girl was killed, the locals grab their rifles and organize a farce to hunt it down Dr. Cameron, who can control the animal with a whip and also has a useful antidote to the Turning around the effect, Petro also moves to the city to track down the professors who made fun of his original theories, destroying his reputation: Cameron's daughter Lenora (Anne Nagel) and Lenora's curious reporter friend Tom (Johnny Downs) first inclination is that it is a straightforward prehistoric creature (!) <br /> <br /> Although it is a t ypish chintzy's PRC strip is in many ways, with nondescript sets, cinematography and m ake-ups, and a rather mild side cast thanks to the histrionics of star george zucco. I have no idea why Downs got a top billing. He's been there for half an hour and really does not have much to do, nor is he so impressive. This is Zucco's show all the way and he's great at ranting and raging, talking to himself and fantasizing that he's talking to his colleagues ("I'm not interested in your moronic mouthpieces!") And getting temporarily into the mind. Strangely, his performance as the hilariously na√Øve and slow-talking runner seems to be dominated by the entire work of Lon Chaney Jr., from his round as Lenny in MICE AND MEN to his performance as the aforementioned WOLF MAN. Anyway, Strange and Zucco do a pretty good job of playing each other out. My favorite part is when Zucco calls him "a guinea pig" in front of a colleague, while Petro just sits there staring at a doorknob, grinning. Some of the foggy swamp scenes are also pretty atmospheric.
