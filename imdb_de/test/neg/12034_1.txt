I'm so glad he did not see that. This film is a debauchery of his work. I agree with the other commentator - this movie was a terrible disappointment. I would give it a zero, but I'm forced to give it a 1. <br /> <br /> The story was faint, reminding me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a film back then and realizing how awful it was. Bad actors, family and friends and someone stupid enough to fund it was the way it was done. It's really amazing how you can pull the strings to achieve something. If this film made it in public, it puts great hopes on other indie filmmakers who have a talent that has a damn worth fighting for! This movie made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. In all circumstances, this was not meant seriously as a comedy. A scary movie is a better game in a horror genre - this movie is just crap.
