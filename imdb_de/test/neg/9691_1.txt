This is the most inaccurate and shameful biblical film I have ever seen. I would like to know why anyone on earth could look like this. I am so surprised that a big name like Jon Voight is ready to behave in that nefarious garbage. Many people who may not have read the Bible will now be misled if they believe this film is accurate and the thought of it really bothers me. I think the creators have a lot to answer. The worst part is that I believe that no one could make such obvious mistakes with a biblical film because he can search the Bible for the truth. I think the creators deliberately twisted what the Bible says, and no one has the right to do that, and I find that very offensive. There are no words strong enough to describe exactly how I think about it.
