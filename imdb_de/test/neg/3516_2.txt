In no case should this overly simplified script be interpreted as having essentially one character as feature entertainment. In fact, it has about enough material for an eighteen minute, and even that would seriously affect your attention span. Null characters beyond Noble Willingham are being developed. The never-ending close-ups of lips and phones cause sleep, and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could have written it. In fact, the whole sad thing should not even have been shown in the movie. A tape recording would have been more than enough to put you to sleep. Definitely not recommended. - MERK
