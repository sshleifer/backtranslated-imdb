I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work. It only took a few scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! The only fun I had was to laugh at the technical mistakes (example: the background "car sounds" just disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). The production shows a complete lack of imagination (example: slow motion machine gun fire repeats itself several times). Sandra Bullock essentially plays a small role and is completely unnecessary for the plot. To say that this film actually has a plot does more justice to Scripture than it deserves. The antique computer hardware is somehow interesting. This film was released in 1982 (not in 1987, according to the IMDb database). At that time, "High Tech" was an amber screen on a 4.8 MHz IBM PC with floppy disk drives. Maybe the PC was the real star of the movie ... At least it was interesting. <br /> <br /> We got this on DVD for a few dollars in the bargain basket at WalMart. As the other reviewer states, we have overpaid!
