Hey guys, I can not believe that "Shades" of That Thing You Do have taken on this role. I do not think Cory Feldman would have taken that role. This movie was a steaming pile of crap. Save money and time and look at each of the top 250. I swear, I wanted to knock the lady in the blockbuster stupid, because I allow myself to rent that. Stay away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Mr. Hipp
