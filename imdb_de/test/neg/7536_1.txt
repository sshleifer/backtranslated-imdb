I think we should think, what wonderful salt-the-earth characters. Unfortunately, this is lame and tedious. <br /> <br /> As always with every production in Newcastle, there are numerous recordings of the Tyne Bridge and frequent attempts to show what great "characters" Geordies are. The viewer must never forget where the movie is playing, as if the rest of the world was taking care of Newcastle and its inhabitants. <br /> <br /> If you want to be well watched, educated and original work remains clear.
