Why do "romantic" films that never really go anywhere always start with lousy jazz? It is not smart and makes it look like a bloody TV movie. This movie was juicy, slow, boring, unoriginal, made of wood, and did I say boring? Harrison Ford was probably trying to be mysterious and rude, but he was just a crawling, mumbling policeman who seemed to be going into the congresswoman's house as if everything was alright when he behaved like a pervert - staring at Thomas with a perverted stare , hardly busy talking. <br /> <br /> And why the hell are they always British? Actors who set shitty accents - they work because they're famous, and everyone knows they're British just because they're famous!
