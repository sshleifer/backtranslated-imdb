Caveman or The Blade Mater or whatever it means is in one word: VILE! I saw this on MST and I laughed not only at the great running commentary but also at the incapable filmmaking that was shown. Sunglasses, tire tracks and where did Ator get a kite? Then they get some shots from another movie, Where Eagles Dare as Tom Servo. To show just how cheap this movie really is, you can watch the scene in which Ator and Thong fight invisible swordsmen. Or better yet, look for the huge tube that's disguised like a snake wrestling with Ator! And what exactly do these scenes in the credits have to do with the film?
