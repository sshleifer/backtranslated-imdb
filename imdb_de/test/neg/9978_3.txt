I rated this movie as 3 and that was generous. The scenery is cumbersome and colorful, the drama is for the most part terrible. I think Peter O'Toole did a good job (Tiberius), but he must have been hurt when he saw the last movie in the film. John Gielgud, however brief his appearance in the film, still seemed to play a role of Hamlet. The hardcore pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they continue the story. Okay, Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was good looking. The guy who played Claudius looked more like the traditional portrayals of Nero and certainly did not agree with Robert Graves' image of Claudius. The sounding (?) Assassination of Caligula, wife and child, is inaccurate, as she shows him lying on stairs in an outdoor area after death, when he was actually murdered in the underground passage on the Palatine Hill, which ran along the front of the Domus Flaviana, which still exists today. There are places in this movie where practically everything attracted my attention - compassionate distractions. If you want history, read Suetonius or Tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, have a look at Passolini's "Salo", but be sure to stay away from this movie.
