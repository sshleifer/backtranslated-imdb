Normally, I enjoy seeing Laurel and Hardy, but this is obviously one of the films they made when they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team on a joke; how strange Kilts and Scots are. And that's it. Okay, there are a few other jokes, but I did not find them funny at all. They are outdated and (I guess) were not very entertaining when the movie was first released. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie has two of the most charming faces in the story and they make the most of the movie's uncomfortable story (which I did without a script) and the scenery is beautiful to look at. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, watching is only worth it for Laurel and Hardy fans, others should stay away from it.
