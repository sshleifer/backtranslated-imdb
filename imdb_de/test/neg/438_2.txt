I wanted to see An American Werewolf in Paris for a long time because I loved his predecessor, but this movie did not impress me as much as An American Werewolf in London. To be honest, that did not impress me at all. <br /> <br /> Tom Everett-Scott and his buddies go through Paris and save themselves from death in an absurd bungee stunt in front of the Eifel Tower Wolf baby Julie Delpy. Before you take the time to find out if the constant raid and lump dialogues are the stuff of comedy, a full moon has been hit and the brats are being chased through the Paris sewers by terrible CGI werewolves /> The script is disgusting bad, the actors were made to make this movie, their horrible performances correspond to the status of the movie. From start to finish, this movie is never entertaining, captivating or even easy to see. I had a hard time watching this whole movie without raising my dinner, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are not exciting, the jokes are not funny and the werewolves are not scary. In short: Miss or be persecuted forever. <br /> <br /> I rate an American werewolf in Paris with 2 out of 10.
