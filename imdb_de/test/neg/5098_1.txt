In the mid-19th century, when the British left the New Zealand wilderness to build colonies. The daughter of a British army surgeon Sarah (Samantha Morton) falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. The Maori are an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people that Europeans have to deal with. When Sarah's child, whom she calls "boy," is born, his father is dead. At the age of six, "boy" is kidnapped by his father's family, and Sarah falls in love with a man (Kiefer Sutherland) is looking for him. Twice Oscar nominee Morton is definitely the star of this movie. Sutherland is a total waste. The cast also stars Cliff Curtis, Stephen Rea, Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Pene. This movie is rated R for sexual content and violent combat scenes. I find the title of RIVER QUEEN very misleading and the DVD cover only with Sutherland, letting you believe that he is the main star should be a crime.
