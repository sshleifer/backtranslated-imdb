The terrible production is not considered a "movie". It was obviously recorded on videotape and very bad! There is a constant screeching noise (sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that sometimes you can not understand what the characters are saying. Badly recorded music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the entire editing of this thing is NULL! <br /> <br /> The plot is imaginative and ridiculous. A gay late-20s man trying to hide his beloved lover from his parents' visits? YOU'RE WELCOME! And the mother's reaction when she finds a picture of her son kissing his boyfrioend is melodramatic and rolls outright stupid. Talk about a stereotypical view of gay life! Acting is worse than a porn movie and the direction is very bad! <br /> <br /> As far as "production" is concerned, there are none! <br /> <br /> This title is simply a lame, video-taped attempt to call itself a movie. There is no lifeblood to give even the slightest praise. <br /> <br /> It's just a stupid waste of time, so avoid it at all costs! Bad action BAD WRITING! BAD DIRECTING, and the title of "Producer" is vanity, as that trash probably cost them the price of the videotape they were shot on. <br /> <br /> This garbage has no business that is being deceptively published on a DVD as a cunsomer. I can not stress how horrible this "SUGARPLUM" crap is! <br /> <br />
