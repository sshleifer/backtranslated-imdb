This is by far one of the worst films I have seen in many years. I started to watch the movie, did not expect much and exactly what he brought me ... not much! In fact, it delivered even less than I expected. When I saw the first parts of the movie, my first reaction was that I would probably rate a "4". I thought there seemed to be reasonably good photography and a haunting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As the movie progressed, the rating in my mind dropped off mainly because of pedestrian and conspiracy. In the beginning, it was just stupid and tasteless to be stupid and disgusting in the end. When the movie was over, I did not want to rate it as a "1" anymore. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money.
