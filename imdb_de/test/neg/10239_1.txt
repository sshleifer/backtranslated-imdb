I've seen several stage and movie adaptations of Alice in Wonderland, and she has to take the cake as the absolute worst. My family bought the DVD unknowingly and could not even survive the first half. Later I went back and forced myself to see it (it was a Christmas present for me) and was just horrified) is Mark Lin-Baker, who plays Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent. It is one of the few moments in the piece that has a real charm and something can be taken seriously. Apart from that, the songs are half-songs, the melodies are semi-melodies and even Meryl Streep can not make this direction look good.
