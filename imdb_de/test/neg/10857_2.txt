This film is a juxtaposition of various malicious, extremely evil types who are loosely connected but have no real action. Some scenes are filmed nicely. If they took the same cast and crew and made a movie called "Ghent", which was the coolest character in the film, and invented an interesting and ongoing story, it might be decent. Prepare yourself for a lame series of tough guy characters who ride their bikes through the desert all day long causing trouble, while they never sunbathe, keep their hair and their clothes perfect, and do not have to look for a home or money, etc There was a kind of backstory about the characters where different people died and a treasure that was supposed to be the plot.
