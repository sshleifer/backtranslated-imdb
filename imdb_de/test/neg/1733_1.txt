Honestly, the only reason I picked up this movie from Blockbuster was that Aaron Carter was there. Okay, let's go first. Do you notice how ugly Aaron Carter has become? I mean, he used to be so cute, but now ... with that lanky body and blotchy skin - EW. I think he should stay singing and the directors of the film could have found a much better-looking man who could do lip-synching. No offense. I thought that this teenage movie was mostly lame - and that comes from me because I'm a teenager myself. The "mean girls" are so predictable, the acting is so amateurish that sometimes you have to twitch (especially from Aaron), and overall I just did not like it. I'm giving out points for the storyline - that was fine, but not realistic at all. Be sure to stay away from this movie unless you have a lot of money on hand and have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time. It is not worth the $ 6.50 !! <br /> <br /> (P.S, this review may not apply to younger children under the age of 13!)
