OK, it's a piece of historical film art that caused uproar, shocked and banned people. I give it that way, so I gave it a 3 instead of a 1. It may have been ahead of time, but it is certainly far behind in time now. I'm a big fan of Salvador Dali and I loved Un Chien Andalou. This short film enchanted with one creative scene after another. L'age d'Or was far too long and boring - it was just a yielding piece of pompous filmmaking created only as a feeble attempt to excel Un Chien Andalou with a feature film (and to shamelessly use Dali's film) name and fame, although he had little to do with it). Total garbage except for (very) few shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long stretches of boring non-action. A waste of time and money. My two thumbs are at the bottom. It will go on my shelf, never to be watched again.
