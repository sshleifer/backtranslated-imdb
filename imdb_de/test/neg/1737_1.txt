Worst.film.ever More does not have to be said. Aaron Carter is totally dismissive and the rest of the cast should immediately dismiss their agents. It's really a terrible horrible movie from start to finish. I wish I could make many (oh so many) mistakes eloquent in describing the films, but I can not bother / be too mad to make right sentences. <br /> <br /> In short, I absolutely hated everything about this film and not in "so bad" good condition ... <br /> <br /> It was unadulterated. <br /> <br /> Gavin
