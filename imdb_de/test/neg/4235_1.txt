The director gives this film a false depth by repeating a gimmick throughout the movie. EVERY single shot in this movie is three times longer than necessary. You could easily cut out 1.5 hours of this torturously long, 2.5-hour long film without eliminating it: a word of dialogue, a picture, an event or a bit of movement. <br /> <br /> This was one of the most unnecessary wastes of film I have ever seen. Other reviewers have called it presumptuous, which is an understatement. L'Humanite is a pseudo-intellectual rubbish designed as anti-Hollywood for Cannes judges to claim their independence from the Oscars in overdrive - forcing audiences to slow down and some of the smallest and most common features of life to look in detail. "You would have to be catatonic to stare at some of these images for so long and concentrate so slowly on those characters, this is not a real life unless you are heavily drugged. <br /> <br /> Finally I had the feeling that Scott's portrayal was a sad rip-off of Peter Sellers' masterful "Chauncy Gardner." He uses the same facial expressions and postures, he even has gardens! In many ways, there are parallels between these two films, the main difference being that "Being There "is always moving and not relying on shocks and gimmicks to create a meaningful experience while questioning various things that we take for granted in life.
