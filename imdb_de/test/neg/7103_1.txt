Sometimes a movie can not be easily classified. One such movie is "Tank Girl", a part of the comic, part of the comedy and part of the action movie. I'm sure there's an audience for "Tank Girl" somewhere, but it's extremely small, maybe punk comic readers. Most viewers will look for an early exit or live with the fast-forward button. The only quality of salvation is short jokes for humor "find me a microscope and tweezers," but those tiny moments of comic relief are far outweighed by the sophomoric action sequences. Do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid - MERK
