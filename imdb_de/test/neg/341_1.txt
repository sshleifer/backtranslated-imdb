I need a deep breath for this ... <br /> <br /> Terrible special effects that go well beyond the budget. Crass and outrageous plagiarism of other science-fiction movies (like Pitch Black). Terrible spectacle. Endless slow motion scenes of characters running aimlessly through sand dunes. Meandering dialogue that does not bring history forward. Characters wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns. A "cargo" ship occupied by a camouflaged crew of armed soldiers (why would you even need a forest camouflage in space?). Some of the worst casting decisions in the history of budget-less filmmaking - a steroid swollen "captain" who looks more like a muscle beach jock than a trusted commander, and a "convict" who sees himself as dangerous Hare. 70 minutes in length, of which 35 could have been cut off if the director had had a concept of "condensing time by editing" ... <br /> <br /> I will not go on. Suffice to say that some components of this terrible movie can (and should) be abandoned due to its low budget; The bad idea, ridiculous plot holes and the snoring script are unforgivable for any budget. The end result is a boring, boring waste of time. I'm sorry, guys, I hate being so tough in an amateur movie, but you have no excuse to get that kind of work out.
