There is not enough room to explain how this movie is a disappointing mess. Stupid special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the slightest problems of this film. The film looks as though it was conceived in the mid-eighties and muted until it was completed in the early nineties. The frightening "hero" (complete with the fashionable "Miami Vice" three-day shadow beard), the Ham-Fisted-Slam with Ronald Reagan, it would be fun if he did not take himself so seriously. The movie is just pathetic. I'm really sorry for the poor actresses who have wasted their beautiful nude scenes in this horrible movie.
