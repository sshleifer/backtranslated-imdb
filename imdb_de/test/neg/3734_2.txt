The first time I saw this movie was with this sweet girl I was attracted to. We had a lot of fun laughing and having fun in general. My impression was that it was terrible, but the cheese value was to be taken care of. For the anniversary, we then saw it together again on video. As it turns out, the movie is just terrible and hard to beat. It's amazing how cute girls can change the look of the world.
