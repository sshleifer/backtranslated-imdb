Hey, what a great idea to open a movie - show someone his home movie. Acting schools must be full of idiots! There they take acting classes, hoping to become the next big Hollywood event, if you just have to send a home movie to a studio. Hey, I think I'll send in the video of my wedding and call it THE BIGGEST EXPERIENCE I've ever seen, or I'll send a volume of my honeymoon and call it the BIGGEST SEX EVER LAKES. Oh wait, I'm not married and have never been on a honeymoon! Do not worry, I'm sending a video of someone who is wedding / honeymoon. <br /> <br /> !!!!! MILD SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> SHARK HUNTER could only improve with such an opening, right? As shocking as it may seem, the home movie is the best-directed, best-written and best-played part of the movie. However, it's always downhill from here when the family walks in a tricycle (in reality a mist-shrouded pool) on foot yacht, where mom and dad are eaten by a CGI fin and their son Spencer vows to avenge himself at the fin , To this day, the French are an underwater research base for oil production. The only thing is - and it's so obvious you can not miss it - it's not filmed underwater !!! The director has made no attempt to use even the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through an aquarium. The underwater research base is blown up by the shark (maybe it is hired by Greenpeace?). All are killed. Spencer is now a grown man to hunt the shark that killed his parents and a group of Frenchmen. What else happens? No idea because I decided to look at something else. <br /> <br /> No hard feelings when one of the cast and crew reads this and I hope Matt Codd becomes a big fish in Hollywood. Do you think you know Matthaie? You have not seen anything yet
