It seems superficially like a romantic airplane, trains, and automobiles, but sometimes he tried a little more where he miserably failed. Some may like the untraditional end, but the attempts to gain a deep insight into the world of marriage did not really go on. <br /> <br /> But if you're interested in the story, the movie tries to distract you from other methods. The unnecessary special effects, of which the falling rain was most obvious, were nothing but trouble. The camera work is unpredictable at best. <br /> <br /> A note on caution, however. Overall, my overall movie experience was less than satisfactory as I was sitting in the front row with a group of young people.
