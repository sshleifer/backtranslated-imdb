August 25, 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Sean Connery is one of the greats, and I've been a fan of his since the 1950s. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the lead actor. I had read no reviews or had previous knowledge of the film. The movie surprised me a lot. The scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal and ridiculous. In my eyes, this was not one of his better films, it could be the worst. Why he chose this film is a mystery. For me, visiting this movie was a waste of my time. I will continue to go to his films and add his films to my video collection. But I do not see a waste of money to add this movie to my collection
