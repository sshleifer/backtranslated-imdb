A satire about greed and money, huh? There is more greed in the intentions of this fiasco than in any of the topics that make them too pathetically funny. Jim Carrey's reign was undoubtedly short-lived. He is an unbearable presence on the screen. The insincerity of his portrayal is scary. He also produced this "masterpiece," so he can not blame anyone here. "The # 1 comedy in America," adds the desperate television. Jim Carrey should of course guarantee full houses, but the game is over. When I sound angry, that's because it's me. I spent a sunny afternoon in California, as well, between tickets, parking, shallow cokes, etc., nearly $ 45 for this thing, starring, produced by Mr. Carry. Not anymore, do you hear? No longer.
