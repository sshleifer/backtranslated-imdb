Poor Casper Van Dien, his career has moved far from Tarzan and Starship Troopers. <br /> <br /> In Meltdown, he is a police officer who happens to be with TV reporter Stefanie Von Pfeten, and her brother is a scientist who is trying to deal with a raging commentary on Earth. But in the volatile comet industry, even a near-miss has some real problems as Earth orbit gets out of balance. <br /> <br /> From the survival of the earth we go to the survival of Van Dien and his immediate family. Ryan McDonell, his daughter's gangbanger friend, proves to be useful, especially if he suspects that a man he knows to be a sick cop might do a lot of damage to Van Dien's group. My only question here is why did not they have Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of the crew to deal with the nasty comet? <br /> <br /> Take care of people.
