Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had. I think my eyes started to bleed. After looking at it, I actually got sick in the night. I do not even consider this as a movie. Films should be worthwhile and entertaining. This is terribly wrong. I could not make it through the whole movie. Since the end could be the biggest phenomenon in movie history, it gets a 1 for that little chance. Otherwise it would be a flat 0. <br /> <br /> I can not see how National Lampoon or any organization would sponsor this cruelty. Borrowing this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life. Just look at it if you want to create another movie you'll ever see, great. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.
