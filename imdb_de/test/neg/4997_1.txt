Hey, I'm a fan of such bad movies, but there's nothing bad about Rise Of The Undead. It's just so bad and that's it. No redeeming cheese, no unintended humor, nothing! - boring apocalyptic zombie (The "Undead": a few people with barely make-up) Nonsense with lame special effects (if you can call these effects), stupid plots and annoying actors. They also have their nerves breaking and citing from other (better) movies (Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead and Night of the Comet) and managed to put me on the side. However, it was "Rise Of My Eyelids" after the credits rolled. My advice: Save your money. It's not even worth a rent, unless you want to get away and / or put some people to sleep, then go for a ride. You have been warned;)
