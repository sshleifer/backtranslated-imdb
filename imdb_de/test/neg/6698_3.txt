If anyone thinks this is a great sports movie, it's probably the only sports movie they've ever seen. A sports movie can have different aspects. Be it professional or college or high school. Examples of sports movies I like (and I have not seen many) are Jim Thorpe: All American, All the Right Moves, Any Given Sunday, Eight Men Out and Rocky. All these films had something more than just sports. Be it the rise of a man and then the descent from height or a man who loses a dream through the actions of a vengeful coach or the impact of money on professional sport. There is not much content in Hoosiers. It did not even seem like the movie had a beginning or an end. There was no character development, we were all forced. I could sum up this movie by quoting a very bad coach: "Get out and try to score more points than the other."
