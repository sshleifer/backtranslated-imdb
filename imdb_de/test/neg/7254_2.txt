When I looked at this movie, I was wondering why did Universal release such films? They had a wonderful series of films with all the classic horror movies. The heyday of the nuclear age brought with it a rush of gigantic creature films. Spiders, ants, praying mantis. With The Deadly Mantis, a giant praying mantis flies through the Arctic, terrorizing Eskimos and being pursued by the armed forces. The fault reaches a tunnel in New York, where the soldiers finally destroy it. Of course, all this is much more visible if you watch it on MST. Who thought it would be a good idea to start the movie with a giant map?
