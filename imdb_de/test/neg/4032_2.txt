I can tell by the other comments that NEVER ever really could enjoy this insignificant crap, so I felt too. <br /> <br /> The whole time I saw it, I was horrified that anyone could make a movie that was stupid! What is the world for? I guess it's my fault because I've been through the whole movie (ugh!), But it was like a bad car accident, I could not look away. <br /> <br /> If you are a child under 8 you might like this movie. Otherwise, stay away from it at any cost. It's the stupidest movie I've ever seen. Everything is stupid - the story, the script and above all the acting, everything! As you watch the movie, either turn off the TV and think, "How can a movie be so sadly stupid," or keep looking out of curiosity to see if things can become more stupid than this (they can not). <br /> <br /> These filmmakers (if you can call them that) have to seriously return to their day job, none of them has a talent talent, and I doubt you can live on it from dreadful, useless garbage that nobody in the world has Head would ever see! <br /> <br /> Just pulled out BS Do not waste your time.
