Hello - I usually love movies. I am 19, I have seen many and I do not like one or two. This time, however, when it was done, I had to pull my sister (who wanted to see it) by the arm, and I burst into tears as soon as I came out because it was such a ridiculously horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Why it was awful: - All cows had udders, especially the MALE with udders - none of the characters was unique or captivating, except perhaps the most important Coyote Dag - the thought of keeping cows against Looking at coyotes is simply ridiculous - the "funny" moments are repeated and become simply a sequence to surpass the last - the themes of collaboration that should eventually exist were nonexistent. Instead, people get the impression: Well, I take it all on me and in this case I was lucky that my friends decided to support me without my knowledge - all moments that resemble the Lion King (as mentioned below) ). There was no flaw, even for a children's movie <br /> <br /> and ... worst of all ... PARALLEL OF THE LION KING IN ANY UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITY Responsible father figure who is killed by coyotes (the coyotes are im Essentially the hyenas, with Dag, the leading Coyote, who represents the equivalent of scar) The farm falls into chaos, Odis (the cow, although basically Simba) wants to mess around and is shocked when his father died, Although it is in this movie his guilt was, he confronts the Coyotes and gets a donkey abruptly, whereupon Dag asks him to leave, and Odis decides to go up shortly to save some chickens (of course he is completely surprised, unaware that they will help him ). <br /> <br /> Other things that were taken from Lion King: Stars move as signs, Father figures relate in a mystically loving way to stars / signs that are obviously circular, as the father Od Odis found and looked after him Has. and how in the end Odi's love interest gives birth and he has a similar experience. Birth in the end? GOOD GOD, what the hell ... and even similar music, which in the end is completely pinned because it is completely different from the previous music. Honestly, this is the first movie I have ever seen. I've never seen where I was for the bad guys - I never understood what other people said so far. <br /> <br /> BELOW: Do not waste time to see this. Convince the children not to see it, and watch the Lion King again. Either that or take the Ant Bully, who is creative and artistic.
