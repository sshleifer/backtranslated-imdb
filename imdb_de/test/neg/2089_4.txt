I bought this DVD for 3.99 on Roger's video to get enough points to get a better movie for free. I never intended to look at it, but it started to arouse my curiosity, and I finally decided to place the DVD player in it. The effects in this movie are terrible and cheap. Some of the dialogues in this film sound like they were written by a happy 12-year-old boy. Acting is in some places very cheesy and the "action" scenes are completely ridiculous. You will laugh in some parts, which was positive for me, because it kept me mild. The plot is that a girl has a curse that makes her vomit snakes, so a shaman has to take her to Los Angeles. There are also two girls who try to smuggle drugs, and a few other people who are unimportant to the plot, not that there really is an act. Do not expect anything from this movie and do not listen to the cover, there are not 100 passengers and 3,000 Vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes. <br /> <br /> As far as the DVD goes, there's a trailer that's almost as ridiculous as the movie, a blooper role that's just a shot of an actor trying to say train, and the deleted scenes are really pointless if they were not. Not good enough to stay in this movie, they have to be pretty bad. There's also a really bad featurette production that does not really show much, except that the people involved in this movie were idiots. I do not recommend it, unless you want a really bad movie that you can use to laugh with friends. I give 2 out of 5 cats.
