I'm used to being patient with movies because I've found that that usually pays off. But some works take boredom to a new level and enter the provocation ... "Last Year at Marianske Lazne" comes to mind. Well, "Pola X" is not "Last year in Mariánské Lázně". On the one hand, I can count on the number of films I have seen over the years. "Pola X" achieved membership in this August group. In my defense, I believe that I have valiantly tried to assert myself in the hope that things would change. However, I finally threw the towel just over the 90-minute mark - quite respectable. "Pola X" does not live up to the promise of Carax's earlier work. After a 10-year break that must have been really bitter for him. Melville is still spinning in his grave!
