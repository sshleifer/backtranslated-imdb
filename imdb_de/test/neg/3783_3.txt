I give him three instead of the lower number he deserves because of his history. A full-length movie of students! It also shows, but that's part of the charm and the appeal. Learn about what George Lucas did at UCLA. that's better. Maybe as a group work. <br /> <br /> A monster of toxic waste and too much garbage - these kids were way ahead of their time! - begin to devastate the city of Milpitas during a dance at high school. The monster destroys randomly and leaves garbage and stinking footprints. <br /> <br /> The film has local TV and radio players, the mayor of Milpitas, the director of Samuel Ayer High School, and a number of high school students and their parents, not to mention the mayor's daughter the interior. <br /> <br /> Mute? Yes! Fun? Yes! Great screenwriting? Come on, they are untrained high school! Copy this comment for acting, cinematography, directing and more. Milpitas is located next to San Jose in the heart of Silicon Valley. Maybe one of the graphics geniuses will somehow update the video. Now there is a challenge.
