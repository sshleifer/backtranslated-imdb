Come on? AWESOME DRAMA ON THE SCREEN? Are you kidding? I would not even let terrible Molly Gross play in school! Where did these people learn acting? Do some newspapers borrow actors from their neighbor? Terrible plot, terrible spectacle. Heh ... why are you taking us for an idiot? What else can I say? I understand that this is a TV production and the acting should not be that of Citizen Kane. Nevertheless, they should make more effort to earn their money. And besides, what can you say for such a simple movie in 10 lines? Do you want an article in the morning paper? To say something? Bad movie in the decade? OK, you want it - you have it!
