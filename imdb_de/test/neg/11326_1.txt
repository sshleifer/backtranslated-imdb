Years ago, I deliberately saw bad movies. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture sounds true. No facial expression fits the scene or the action. I have never heard such inappropriate music for a movie. In the final scene, I wanted the car to roll over this ridiculous kid - one of the worst kid actors ever. Just a name I've ever heard of - Wilford Brimley. He must have been very hungry to participate in this part. <br /> <br /> DO NOT ADD IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, SHOW THIS FILM !!! YOU WAS WARNED !!!
