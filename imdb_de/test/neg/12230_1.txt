Do all spoof films require pure stupidity and the lack of any kind of intelligence for humor? Is there even a single really funny parody movie? All I see are zero-quality movies that look like a few petrified students got bored with a video camera in one day. These films are not funny, they are not smart, they are not entertaining, they are useless in every conceivable way. <br /> <br /> The comeback was a movie that tried to hide its hideous trash by not calling itself "sports movie". It is the same, however. There are a few different authors for these films, Wayans have some, Freidberg and Seltzer others, and I'm sure there is another couple. To be honest, I can not even tell the difference in direction or humor, it seems like the same people write and direct it. I can not say if the comebacks were made by the people who made Scary Movie or the guys from Epic Movie or anyone else, it's just the same jokes of everyone else. <br /> <br /> If you've done any taste or value for humor, do not see this movie. If you have a sense of self, do not try to see it. If you have respect for filmmaking, you should not consider it. Do not see it in a broken, run-down theater that can still carry it, do not rent it, do not order it on Netflix or Pay-Per-View, do not record it in Redbox, and do not even look at it for free on OD. Avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> The only conceivable reasons I can see to watch this movie are the following: <br /> <br /> A. Masochism. If you like torturing yourself, there are few better options. B. See a good example of why you should avoid EVERYTHING that says "Fox Atomic". C. They receive considerable amounts of cash. <br /> <br /> I would not really look at the whole thing if someone offered me $ 100 for it. It's just insane, agonizing torture. <br /> <br /> You can watch Zohan as well.
