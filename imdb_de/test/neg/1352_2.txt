To say I was disappointed is an understatement. An amateur movie by professionals. I wanted to leave the theater two or three times (something I've never done before). I was really stopped by Cloris Leachman. It sounds true, the only one I should say. These new women are less modern than the George Cukor women of the 1930s. These "act" for us when we try to be there, but their "conflict" is exactly the same as in movies. The fun of the original was based on a crisp, funny and very funny script. A masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast. All elements missing here. TV actresses mingling with models and Oscar nominees / winners. There was nothing organic about it. The whole thing felt like dressing, improvising at the moment without a clear goal. 2.10
