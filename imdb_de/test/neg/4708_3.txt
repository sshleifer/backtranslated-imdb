I know ... I know: it's difficult (if not paradoxical) to have a "believable" fantasy. But for me, there is such a state in which TOO MUCH INABILITY disturbs or detracts from the overall view of the film. The latter was the case for me in relation to Goliath Awaits. Not only did I have too many unanswered questions about the plot, but some of the acting, I thought, was a little over the top. (But perhaps it was the writing: Ask them to recite too many banal, predictable, clich√©d (over) reactions.) I just wish it was done - and, I think, MIGHT have done it - more convincingly. S: This is a FRESH commentary on this movie - I just finished it a few minutes ago, not a memory of years ago.
