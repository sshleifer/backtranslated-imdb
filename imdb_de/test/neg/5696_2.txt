So it's a space movie. But the budget is low. They ask, "What about the effects?" The effects are sometimes good and sometimes really, very bad. I mean bad And I noticed that I started with the effects. <br /> <br /> There's a story here, but it's told in the order that I think is wrong. I do not mean a wrong order in Tarantino style. I mean, it's narrated in a completely nonsensical arrangement. Mostly this is a mother (in the future because you know it's sci-fi), as told by her daughter, which is mostly a narrative portrayal from the daughter's perspective. Only when you've gone through the first lesson and hear Paul Darrow's voice as a computer will you realize how much more bearable the permanent narrative would have been if he'd read it. This narrative is so constant and inclusive that the actors on the canvas barely say a word in the first hour. Want some action? Otherwise your battles will look like they are in BATTLESPACE. And notice that the title contains the word "battle". <br/> <br /> I think that's the classic scenario when trying to make a movie based on nothing but a concept. And some effects. My biggest surprise is that the IMDb cost this movie as 1.8 million dollars. Comparing it to something like PRIMER, which scores better on a budget of a few thousand, you realize in low-budget filmmaking that it's all about the story. I did not expect much - but I was still disappointed. Two out of ten stars.
