I hate being too critical, but this one was really bad. I like the Baldwin brothers, I just wish that more talent was evenly distributed between them. I liked the general conspiracy but there was just too much "trying" and not enough actual "doing" in terms of quality work. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was the bald guy. It reminded me of Dmitri Valtane (Jeremy Roberts, I think) from Start Trek 6: Undiscovered country. Only without the hair. <br /> <br /> If you have Hollywood Video's MVP program and are really trying to make some money, get it with one of three MVP movies. It's worth it for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> The most impressive special effect throughout the show is the sound of Stephen Baldwin's gunfire. I suppose that will let you know about the quality and excitement of the rest of the show.
