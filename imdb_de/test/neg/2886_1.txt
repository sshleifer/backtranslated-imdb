A man builds a hotel with a partner. He finds out that the hotel is overinsured. Things are only getting worse. This movie has a lot of scenes. They must have been put together in the sleep of some people. It jumps from place to place. It does not stay focused on anything for long. The end begins on Christmas morning with a hotel fire. Then it goes to a night scene of this fire and then back to the time of day. The DVD soundtrack is terrible. It takes a fair act and becomes the worst movie I have had in a long time.
