That's not a good movie at all. I can not believe that after fifty years, this film will receive the National Award, if there were such gems from the Marathi cinema that were so systematically ignored. This is a very overrated movie that became very, very happy. It has been honored with the National Award, harvested the popular opinion and will now represent India in front of the international audience. Anyone with a poor understanding of good, good cinema will know well that this is not even nominated at the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I can not understand where to start. There are just so many things wrong and wrong in this film that it was amazing that it was even considered for the National Award. The fact that this film is awarded as the best film to hit the market this year shows the biased judgment of people who hold the reins of Indian cinema and the poor understanding of the people who blindly appreciate this film Great. It is important that such films are made? but only from people who can handle it. Sandeep sawant is not up to the task? not even close. His direction is nervous, confused. There is no clear train of thought. He tries not to explore the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. He can not show the grandfather's initial horror, fear and then hopeless detachment and insurmountable courage. He wastes our time in the hospital when we should be shown how many couples are together. He tries to stuff everything without priorities. He does not understand his topic properly and that really counts against him. <br /> <br /> The cast does not help Sawant either. Worst work? Amruta Shubash. She is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting job. How did she get 'Tea Phulrani'? Very happy and / or extremely influential and / or extremely miserable casting. Nevertheless, she does everything to make a terrible job in this film. Your act of MSW should have gone to the more responsible actor? Sonali Kulkarni. Amruta Subhash did not understand. MSW works under constant emotional stress and yet it is important that they project a calm, strong appearance, as this gives the patient a calming effect. Amruta Subhash's Asawari seems to be even more afraid and needs support than the people she works for. <br /> <br /> Second, worst ?? Arun Nalawade. I have never seen a wooden face in the Marathi film industry (though it can be found everywhere in Hindi cinema everywhere). He is the producer and so he chose himself. no second thought, no consideration. Any good actor would jump to that role, even if he had to pay the producer, but Arun Nalawade would not allow anyone else. He is ambitious and dull and helps bring the film together more than anyone else. His acting lacks research and even basic acting skills. My choice for this role would be Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> The music is not inspired. The movie is missing technically. It could have been an FTII project job. <br /> <br /> On the top; brilliant performance of Ashwin Chitale. It is amazing that such a boy can do such a respectable job. He has shamed many of today's actors. Unintentionally, perhaps, but he brought his own innocence into his character and that made him a memorable achievement. Sandeep Kulkarni has also shown a very credible performance. Really in all his efforts and it shows. The script is also well written. <br /> <br /> "Shoestring budget" can not be a valid argument for this movie. The lack of funds donates all Marathi films. Cricket and Hindi films are all spongy and the rest has to fight for the leftovers. It's a sad affair, but still no reason to praise immature films that come out. 'Doghi' was a brilliant movie and it was done with little money. 'Doghi' was also missing technically, but it was well researched and well done. It was rich in details and was supported by wonderful performances by all, making it a rich cinema. Why did not it receive the awards it deserves so much? ?? just prove that I reject a biased judgment. <br /> <br /> Lack of research and non-financial resources make Shwaas such a bad movie.
