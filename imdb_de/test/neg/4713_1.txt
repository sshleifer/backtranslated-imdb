I remember seeing that at my local blockbuster and picking it up because I was curious. I liked movies about mythological creatures. I like watching movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. This is based on Half-Caste, a half-human half-leopard creature that hunts people in Africa. The actors are terrible! There is no script! It's all improvised! The whole thing is filmed at night because they say that this is the only time you ever see it. It's obviously bull * bleep *! They film at night to make it scary. But they did not scare me. After the first person was killed, I put them back in the case and brought them back to Blockbuster. One of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Now you probably say that I have no right to repeat a movie if I have not finished it yet. Well, this is one of the films that did not deserve to be seen all the way. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars. That's really bad!
