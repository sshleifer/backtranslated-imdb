This movie was awful, plain and simple. It's probably worshiped by those who see only "movies" and not "movies," and I'm sorry that I understood so little about the theatrical brilliance of this film, but I'm sure enough to say this one boring, self-stimulating and painfully stretched film was a waste of two hours and nine dollars. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to see this through the inexplicable good reviews he had received and which he got theater thinking that these reviews were written by over-excited film students and the aforementioned group of people who are regular Avoiding movies, perhaps for fear that one day they will actually enjoy. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite a promising man - a man is incarcerated for 15 years without knowing his kidnapper or his crime. He is then released abruptly and given only five days to identify the identity and cause of the man who detained him. However, the grand concept soon falls into a pathetic joke as Oh Dae-Su runs around, hitting people and trying to have sex with a young girl trying to use the restroom and eating a living, crawling squid (presumably for dramatic effects, there is absolutely no other reason for that). He's always trying to figure out what a terrible thing he did to earn fifteen years in prison, and when he finally finds out, it's both ridiculous and a serious failure. His nemesis, a man who allegedly went to school with him as a young man, looks like a twenty-year-younger model of the banana republic. Hey, I know that the prison Oh Dae-Su has done hard, but is it too much to find an actor who comes closer to his age? Of all the things that are not true about this movie, this movie seems easiest to fix. <br /> <br /> And the big secret - the one that kept me in my place for 90 minutes when I could have gotten something productive - is a joke of a plot line with incest and a rumor that started in high school Has. Come on! Throwing a bone here - was that really the best thing they could do? I sat through stupid dialogues, exaggerated, gloomy sets and unnecessary violence. (By the way: I'm not against violence in a movie at all if it fits in with the story, but in that case I was forced to see our hero ejecting his front teeth and cutting off his own tongue with a finger to stop me from finding out that I was spending my afternoon on presumptuous garbage). <br /> <br /> Take my advice - do something different with your time and money. Or take your nine dollars and watch a nasty "movie" - one you can actually enjoy.
