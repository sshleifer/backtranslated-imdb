Oh my lord, what did you think of this? It is not only hectic, but worse, a very good original has been brought into the trade. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, has actually shown in the performance of her life in this area. Even better than where she plays the whore in the other so-called performance of her life. Maybe she's just flat as a crook. At any other time, wow, what a waste of time. But she and Segal work wonderfully together. So, if you even catch a glimpse of something funny in this baby from a distance, you should catch the anvil that has been beaten to pulp. Because it is very little remains, to this horror. Nothing in this baby is funny from afar, except perhaps for a few moments when Dick and Jane can be bowed as lepers and not kissed ..... and um, ........ oh my lord, that's it? Well, looks like this. <br /> <br /> It's really a bad movie.
