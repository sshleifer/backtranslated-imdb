To be honest, I've always enjoyed seeing this show and seeing it regularly, but now (thank goodness!) I do not understand why I've seen it. Sex and the city is one of the most meaningless and offensive TV shows I have ever seen. I really do not understand the meaning of this show, although I tried. People say that sex and the city is funny. In what way? By cursing all the time, talking about vibrators and the size of the penis? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the conspiracy: we have four girls trying to find a perfect man by sleeping with every dork that passes by. This show is about four spoiled chicks sleeping with every man in town, but in the end they admit that the penis vibrators are having the best pleasure. And yes ... the show tries to tell us that sex is the most important thing in every respect. If you can have good sex, you are a good husband (or a good wife). It does not matter if you want to be loyal and have a good heart. The size is important. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is bad behavior. The four leading actresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis) are so bad and unconvincing that it only makes me sick to just see this show. Parker screams and complains all the time, Cattral shows off her old breasts and always says "the f-word", Davis smiles (and nothing else) and Nixon looks as if she's always bored. And yes ... Men are sex hungry pigs in this show. Judging from this show, women are not much better. This show is offensive to both men and women. The women are shown as primitive and emotionless as if they had no heart, only hunger for sex. It's offensive to everyone. <br /> <br /> Sex and the city is one of the worst TV shows and I am glad that the show ended because it provides bad acting and senseless stories. The world is not all about sex and vibrators.
