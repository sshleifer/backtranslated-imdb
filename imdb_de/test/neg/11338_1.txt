When I visited this movie, this was already a forced decision, as my original intent was sold out. What was then enough was terrible terror, this movie is so bad that I could hardly bear it. The story is not worth mentioning. A gay goalkeeper forms a gay football team that plays against his old team, who when he discovered his sexual orientation made it difficult for him. Loaded with unbearably old and overused clichés of gays, the thin storyline fits perfectly with the inhuman dialogues ... It's absolutely amazing that actors like Dietmar Bär or Charly Hübner are wasting their talents and their time with such nonsense. 1.10
