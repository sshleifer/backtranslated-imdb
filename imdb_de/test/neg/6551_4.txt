Another of those threadbare stories, paired with the most forgetful numbers of music. Powell and O'Keefe as fighting publicists are pretty much forgotten. However, there are two bright moments. Hubert Castle is the most incredible tightrope walker you'll ever see - his "drunken gait" on the tightrope must be the most spectacular piece of balancing ever recorded in the movie. He must be seen to be believed. The other is Sophie Tucker, who makes a turn at the end of the film. Their magnetism, their professionalism, their simple talent of being themselves - well, charisma is not learned - they have it or not. A great lesson for all cabaret artists. A sad note: W.C. Fields in his last movie Cameo is completely forgotten.
