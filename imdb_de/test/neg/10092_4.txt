Wow, I was really disappointed. I did not intend to see this movie in the theater, and I wish I would stick to that plan. It really should be a TV movie. I was kind of excited to see that because I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie does not do her justice. I am a bit disappointed with the acting. What a terrible cover-up of Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. <br /> <br /> There was no flow in the movie, it was very difficult to get into it. A scene in which we get angry, turned up, we want blood, the anticipation rises, then the director leads us to another scene to show the love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been more gratifying to follow if it were split into three Sunday sectioned paper comic strips. The gangster leaders were skinny people, not very believable. Matt Dillon boss of a gangster organization? Come on, give me a break. There was simply no intimidation. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack ... wow. I think that's one of the worst scores I've ever heard. What terrible guitar solos, my god. I am sure that the sound of my teeth was more pleasant for my friends. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is a positive comment that I want to make to the film. The settings were well done. I liked the colors, a good job that gives this time.
