Are you ever wondering, what's the worst movie ever made? Stop wondering. I tell you, Michael is it! <br /> <br /> It's not "heartwarming", "entertaining" or "Travolta at its best". It's just shit. If I had children, I would have them look at Deep Throat in front of Michael! <br /> <br /> A sold-out John Travolta, a washed-out and balding William Hurt and dying anytime now highlighted by Jean Stapleton This shitty movie. <br /> <br /> But wait ... you'll hear Andie McDowell singing! Yes. Hollywood is really all about us!
