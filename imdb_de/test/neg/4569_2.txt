I'm generally not a fan of high school comedies, they rely heavily on humor in bad taste and rarely deviate far from clich√©s and characters and a downright boring dialogue. However, part of my guilt was with me, especially when I was still in high school. The oh so recognizable teacher figures to see how their buttocks are kicked, has always cheer me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case. These movies only work if at least one of the characters is immediately likeable. This was not the case with Cheats, especially not the protagonist. Of course, it did not help that the actor in the play was one of the most irritating, not talented and arrogant kids I've ever seen in a comedy. <br /> <br /> To act in a comedy is no joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery has to be right or the material is lost. In that case, there was not much good material at the beginning and the jokes, which were half funny, were professionally screwed up by the cast. <br /> <br /> This movie felt like 3 hours, the director had never heard anything of pace obviously. Stay away from this, there are many other funny teen comedies like 10 things I hate about you, your daddy and Superbad.
