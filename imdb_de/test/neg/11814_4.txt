If you find the hopelessly amateurish acting, the uninteresting story, the fake blood, and all the mindless shooting bearable, you may have a pretty good time watching this seedy, low-cost commercial. You may also want to try a pretty good catfight sequence that is offered, though this is not good enough to make the rest of the movie worthwhile. (**)
