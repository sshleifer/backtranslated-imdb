Maybe this was * An Important Movie * and that's why it's rated so high by the people, but honestly it's not very good. In hindsight, it's easy to see that Chaplin (probably all of Hollywood) was incredibly naive about what was really going on in the ghetto, so you can not blame him too much for the disconnection that affects a modern-day viewer, but the connection remains consist. <br /> <br /> Even more disappointing, the film is just clunky; It's as if Chaplin has no idea that movies have evolved since the dumb era. The standards that affect both the Jewish barber and the dictator do not flow into each other; They simply sit like discreet lumps of action that progress in and out and move INITIALLY but never come to a resolution. Some are funny, others less. <br /> <br /> What charm the film has is absolutely in the person of Chaplin. His parodies of Hitler's speeches were the best part of the whole, and there is no denying that he had a physical grace that was delightful to contemplate. But practically everything he surrounded himself with was ANNOYING. Hannah was too damn American. The Storm Troopers were TOO MAD Americans. <br /> <br /> Oooh! Oooh! Just one thing! I do not know for what purpose it served that garbage was the source of evil behind the throne. It almost looks like the movie is saying that without evil influences like garbage, Hynckle would not have been such a bad guy.
