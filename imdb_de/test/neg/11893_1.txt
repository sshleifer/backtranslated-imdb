Can you please stop people from believing what this man is saying? Get <br /> <br /> your facts before praising this liar. He is not even from Flint. He only says that his "blue collar" will look the same. He is <br /> <br /> from a rich suburb next to Flint. I mean, he went to a private school. <br /> <br /> His parents paid for going to school. Wow, that really seems like they've been suffering a lot from Flint going to the garbage dumps. He was also born in Canada. Oh wait, that makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he would just move there. Instead, he lives here in his $ 1 million New York apartment. That's working class right there. I can not wait for his DVD set to come out. I want to talk about how the big companies are bad. Where can I get these DVDs? Oh yes, at Target and Wal-Mart. The two largest corporations in America, which were also the only two stores they could sell.
