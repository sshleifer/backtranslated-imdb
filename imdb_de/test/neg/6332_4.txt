I have to say, I'm a big fan of this 'Last House on the Left' rip-off, even the ones that most people seem to hate are often pretty much valued by me. But one of those movies that I did not like very much was Aldo Lado's "Night Train Murders", and unfortunately Trains and The Last House on the Left do not seem to mix because Terror Express is another dull crack. out. Something that really needs this kind of movie is a thoroughly unpleasant main character. and while Terror Express offers three potential candidates, none of them join this villain and leave the flaw in the main area. It really starts out well when three young men in a passenger train irritate the guests on board. This makes the audience believe it has more to offer, but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene is done. From there, the trio finally takes the train and uses its new power to terrorize the guests and rape the women. <br /> <br /> It has to be said that there is a lot of Sleaze movie here that will please many viewers; but there is hardly any blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think he could replace the blood with sex scenes, and maybe he would have got away with it; if he could film a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men have taken the train by force comes out the window as soon as it comes to sex, as the people that you would expect to be powerful and powerful, all too happy, have a good time for their women show, despite a very tame "sandwich" sequence, no gender is particularly interesting. Since a large part of the film is absorbed by these sex scenes, this becomes a massive problem. In films like these, it often lacks style, suspense and credibility. But you know you look bad when it bores you. As expected, nothing is wanted of acting; and especially the central three are characterized by garbage. The direction is lacking in style and there is very little tension or tension; it's hard to worry about what's going to happen. All in all, this is a pretty shitty example of a commercial, and I can not recommend it.
