It's hard to believe that there are some people in the world who consider this a worthy vehicle for Charles Bronson. <br /> <br /> Bronson is a good actor who can do more than lift a gun and fend off bad guys. He moved quietly in the TV movie "Yes Virginia, There's a Santa Claus" and showed in Sean Penn's direction "The Indian Runner" a lot of class and style. <br /> <br /> In "The Evil." That Men Do ", however, Bronson plays again a character who sees injustice and corrects them with fists, knives and of course weapons .. There is nothing that you have not seen in the last five" Death Wish "movies. > <br /> Wait, I'll take that back, this was the most sadistic and repulsive movie Bronson has ever fallen into disrepute, not just in torture or torture scenes, but in the fact that these scenes are only in one Film shown were selling tickets and Jose Ferrer, what in blue flames has he done here? !! I mean, he won an Oscar for screaming !!! <br /> <br /> Okay, excuse this Let me just say that "The Evil That Men Do" must be one of the worst films I've ever seen and that was based on a book, yes, that's right, I wonder if it was written for Bronson ? <br /> <br /> No stars, look instead for "death wish." At least the IT was up to date.
