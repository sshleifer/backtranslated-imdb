A man kicks a dog 2 'in the air. <br /> <br /> A woman kicks a cow out of her bed. <br /> <br /> A man is kicking a violin along the sidewalk. <br /> <br /> A woman is sucking on the toe of a statue for 15 seconds. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a blind man in the stomach. Jesus rapes a young girl. <br /> <br /> There you have it. I just saved you an hour of your life. Surely there are those who would address this "shocking avant-garde of filmic expression". But I did not find it any different from the puerile, separate videos I shot with my 9th grade friends. Apart from the fact that we never had a real cow. <br /> <br /> After hearing endless sermons from beardling art connoisseurs about how important this movie is, I thought this would be worth the time. Do not make mistakes, that's crap. When I hear another person calling Buñuel the "father of cinematic surrealism," I think I'll beat someone. From the surrealistic beginnings that his seniors Fritz Lang (Metropolis), F.W. Murnau (Faust) and Robert Weine (Caligari) 10 years ago, he took a big step backwards. This made a joke out of the whole, as if Buñuel did not have the self-confidence to really accept the art-as-sarcasm, Sans l'absurdité. It would take Buñuel another 40 years to refine his style to something admirable. Skip the early stuff and jump right to 1970, if you want to be more impressed by his work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure he would agree. In 1977, Buñuel himself stated that he would happily burn all the prints of his old films. In that case, I would like to fill in the lighter liquid.
