I looked at it because of the description and the cover graphic and once again deceived. I'm tired of saddling all these new fools right on DVD horror movies. Once in a blue moon, everything will be fine. It started with a confusing scene and then jumped up for 30 years and showed a couple one night during a thunderstorm, which was OK because I like storms and set a good mood. Then it became a cool road trip where they ended up in a diner. I encountered bizarre people. The rest became strange and then confused me. I watched until the end, but was even more confused when it ended so badly. I had more hopes for this film, but it was more a science fiction than a horror and that's what TV should have done.
