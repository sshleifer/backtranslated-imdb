I do not know what some of these filmmakers think by making the same clich√© film over and over again that the bad guys (in this case, the bad girls) win. Weak acting and very predictable. Nothing original. The same movie was filmed again and again - not unlike GOODBYE LOVER (1989), SLOW BURN (2005) or at least ten more films with the same storyline and the same ending. There are also many holes in the movie. It's like they run out of money and they just stop filming. Or maybe they did not have any ideas anymore. But do not waste your time with this. It will only upset you if you have wasted your time looking at it.
