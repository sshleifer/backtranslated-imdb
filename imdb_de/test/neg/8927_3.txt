Poor action movies are the graveyards for aging martial arts stars. In such films, they endeavor to uphold the dangerous behavior that has made their early work successful, but they all fail. Seagal is too old for that kind of role, but he does not let go ... no matter how stupid he looks. Some hope that his current work will somehow bring the magic back, but there is no magic left. The late '80s and early' 90s were part of Steven Seagal and his work made me a fan. I could fit him well in a slot in the sopranos where his overweight body, flowing facial features and sullen posture would have found a home. I wonder what the return is when it goes straight to video?! Since he produces them, I assume the $$$ is more than satisfactory. If this is the deal, in the late '60s and' 70s we'll be exposed to badly made action movies by Seagal ...
