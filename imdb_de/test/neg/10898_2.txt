I've never done one, but this movie was literally so bad that I had to comment on it. <br /> <br /> I'm all for independent film productions, as was the case last year The worst (in my opinion) of Hollywood's shows is that the mainstream just lost touch with what good ones are about Movies. This means that movies like this really independent movie give a bad name. <br /> <br /> The characters are boring and too stupid to empathize. The direction is terrible, the conspiracy is terrible, the conspiracy itself is terrible, stay away, far away. Just a short scene with the naked breasts of a woman, and even that was worth a second look. <br /> <br /> The scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ​​ever having to watch it again. I gave him a 2 and not a 1 just because the performers were visible and the sound was audible - for each of these qualities she deserves a point.
