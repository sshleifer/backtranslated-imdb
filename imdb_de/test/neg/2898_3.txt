"Ninja III" is not as bad as "Enter The Ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it's still a very bad movie. Fans of martial arts films will not like it because there is not enough action, but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by ridiculous excesses and unnecessary violence. As if the film were not already weak enough, the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic rip-off "The Exorcist". The only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the "dominated" heroine. She is a beautiful and sporty woman, whom the director does not exploit in a different, gloomy way - she happens to be an aerobics teacher. I do not mind a bit of softcore exploitation, but it can not pretend it's something else.
