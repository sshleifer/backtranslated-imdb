The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) gets rid of the music of Joe Cocker: You can open your hat! That was the best part of the entire movie. Not because the scene was good; just the song I'm not saying it was a terribly bad movie, just not so good. Disappointing! <br /> <br /> Especially if research into male and female sexuality could have been extended. Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust, obsession, and perplexity, and where it can lead, he inconspicuously moves from one idea to another. For example, when John (played by Rourke) lets her on the Big Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is not convincingly baffled because of the bizarre experience with John's sense of humor, but Liz willing to do less in his sexual exploits; And as one reader has mentioned, it is unconvincing for a woman who loves sex to experience the dangerous side. This "dangerous" side is not exploited enough in the movie and you get a feeling of anti-climax from the perspective that everything could go horribly wrong. The subject of bondage often occurs, but only brings to the edge of danger and then everything goes well. Is the message sent in the movie that this kind of "foreplay" is FINE! If the film highlights the pitfalls of bondage and the ugly effects of sad masochism, then perhaps it makes a good moral point. Instead, the film jumps clumsily from a "sizzling" scene in which Rourke feeds Basinger and blindfolds her. In a movie that might have been good, he falls flat on his face because he does not broaden and broaden the themes that the movie may be trying to narrate. For me, there is neither an action nor a topic, but only a mixture of ideas.
