Peter Hunt started out as a very talented film editor and made his first attempt to direct when he directed the James Bond movie "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" (considered the best in the series by many Bond fans). Other titles in his filmography include epic adventure films such as "Gold" and "Shout At The Devil," both based on Wilbur Smith novels. "Gulliver's Travels" is a strange one on his list of films; It seems strange that a director of Hunt's style and expertise would make such a movie. The film is a half-life action / semi-animated retelling of Jonathan Swift's classic satire. The movie was twenty years old, even if it was made, and frankly, it just does not work. And there is no damn thing that Hunt (with his usual eye for fast action) or star Richard Harris (who normally can revive the most stilted roles) can do to save them. <br /> <br /> Lemuel Gulliver (Richard Harris) is a brilliant medical student living in Bristol in the 17th century. His father (Norman Shelley) wants him to go to London to earn his fortune. However, Gulliver prefers to receive less pay but a bit more adventure than a ship's surgeon aboard a ship called Antelope. During a trip, the antelope is held off course during a storm and hits a reef. The ship sinks and all are lost except Gulliver. which washes ashore in the Kingdom of Lilliput. As Gulliver passes by, Gulliver realizes that the foreign land where he was washed ashore is populated by unbelievably small people no bigger than his toe. He looks like a giant to her. They persuade Gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny humans living on a neighboring island. But Gulliver does not like being manipulated for reasons of war and devastation, so he plans to run away? <br /> <br /> Harris has to carry the entire movie here. His first scenes feature other actors, but as soon as he's been shipwrecked in Lilliput, he spends the rest of the movie walking across knee-high sets and acting alongside his animated colleagues. The idea of ​​mixing live action and animation was not new at the time, but certainly not much was done. A few Disney movies like "Song Of The South", "So Dear To My Heart" and "Pete's Dragon" had manipulated the idea, but it was still in its infancy. "Gulliver's Travels" is not a particularly well-animated movie, but the scenes that show the interaction between Harris and his comic stars are at least proficient. Occasionally, the film tries to be true to its satirical origins (there is a scene in which we learn that Lilliput went to war because of his eggs with his neighbor!?! -!). But at its core, this is a children's movie, and the satirical overtones are barely audible. Have all parties done better things during their careers? "Gulliver's Travels" may fill an otherwise empty afternoon, but otherwise it's an unforgettable experience.
