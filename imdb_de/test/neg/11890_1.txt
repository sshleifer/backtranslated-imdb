I was forced to watch this movie for my World Reigonal Geography class. This movie is what's wrong in America today. Instead of finding out how to find the best way out of difficult times or situations, we prefer to complain that it is someone else's fault. This movie goes through the downfall of Flint, Michigan, making General Motors 100% responsible. Moore does everything in his power to make the executives of General Motors rogue just because they do their jobs in a capitalist society. Moore is filming several evictions throughout the movie and does not even ask if the person is being evicted due to a GM layoff. In addition, he never questions the landlords of the filmed tenants. Moore is keen to change historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of pure propaganda.
