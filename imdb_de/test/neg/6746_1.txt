I'm still trying to figure out what the goal of this movie was: 1) Whether I should show how stupid, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant the police are (I could certainly add different adjectives here, but I think that's clear). , 2) Whether to show how a twisted rogue who does not know what he wants can create chaos. 3) Whether to show whether a persistent detective will solve a case by repeatedly asking the criminal the same stupid question until the criminal answers are available? 4) Or was it just to show that every 90 minutes of footage can still be called a movie? <br /> <br /> This was one of those movies that in a sense - did not disappoint. From the first 10 minutes, I found out that this movie is not nominated for the Best Film Award, and surprisingly? This was constant throughout. It was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupid it will continue and end? and I was not disappointed there. <br /> <br /> Was it a complete time span? YES. What raises your question? Why did I check it? Well, I was trying to fall asleep, and I thought that would be a good candidate for that, but unfortunately I had too much coffee before?
