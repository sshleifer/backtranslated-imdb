This is a pretty simplistic romance. Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe that delivers a wonderfully varied dramatic / romantic performance that deserves an Oscar nom. Equally beautiful are the special effects of aerial combat. <br /> <br /> Moore plays a French girl whose mother handed over her field to a British air squadron during the First World War. She is the "daughter of the regiment", loved as a little sister. In this mix comes a fill-in for a rundown flyer, Gary Cooper. First they hate each other, then they love each other, then the entire squadron is sent on a suicide mission. Cooper returns, but crashes in the village and a unit of the Red Cross removes him. Moore is looking for him, is told in a hospital, he is dead, then wanders through the streets, until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited. Recommended for fans of Ms. Moore and Mr. Cooper
