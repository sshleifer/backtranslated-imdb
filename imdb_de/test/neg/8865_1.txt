Let me first say that I love God terrible movies. Especially horror movies. I have seen hundreds of movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000 without pain. But that's the worst movie in the world !!! I had to turn it off, it was so bad. It was not funny and just unsurpassable. Give me three flashbacks on Mano's The Hands of Fate or Monster A-go-go every day. Avoid this movie like the escape !! Excuse me as I scoop out my eyes to cleanse them of the filth I had to watch to get a proper verdict for this movie. Only a decent gag in the part I was watching was that the hitmen are now an extermination couple for Hitmen Exterminators. That was not great either.
