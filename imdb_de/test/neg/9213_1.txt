Why I did not like the movie, apart from the sheer ugliness of the actor himself, somebody could actually believe such crap. <br /> <br /> First, the Second Coming of Christ will be at the end of the words. and when Jesus Christ comes on the Day of Judgment, he will not come in the human form as before. He will come in his full glory as God and we will be judged not only for our sins but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone will! Secondly, I have portrayed the eternal gay pride in this movie with the undeniable "I read the Bible last night and it's not written anywhere". Well, it is. Moses cites on three separate occasions that men who love other men, or women who love one another, should be killed as husband and wife, as they will never inherit the kingdom of God, since they are rude! If we were to follow the Bible word for word, there would be executions right now, right? But I think that misinformed people do more harm than they do ... That was in the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> There are many insane people on psychiatric wards who consider themselves the Son of God, but make a movie after really thinking about how many idiots out there can make a movie.
