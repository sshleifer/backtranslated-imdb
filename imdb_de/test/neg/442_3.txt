I was a fan of the AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON movie and was curious as to whether a 16-year-long sequel with French and local re-cast major, minor and minor characters could be performed. Tonight I watched the "FOX Network" version, which was a kind of curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequels. The scriptwriters and directors pay homage to some of the key concepts of action: tourist gets wolf bite, full moon comes out, boy meets girl, boy becomes a beast, boy dies heroically after helping a ghost victim. For me, the strangest aspect of this "formula" teen horror special effects ride was the auditioning of the educational interest of the TV comedy "ED" as one of the unwary victims of the werewolf, which more or less completely affected the script lines they handed it to her , I have not seen another horror movie that this movie is "Sequelling" (a vampire combat movie entitled BLADE), but I think parts of its plot must explain how rogue worms (they are spoofish) threaten the "good". Werewolf couple during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris subway, a la SPEED. This 1997 studio product is a weird hybrid of a movie because it has a lot of technical effects for technical purposes, but in my opinion it has completely undermined the authentic horrors of the original. Such a strange description of the werewolf legend and the "film mythology"!?! My suggestion to anyone considering this in the video library - instead, you should opt for a classic top class thriller: Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!
