Movies like these just make me angry because they do not deserve the funding that allows them to get into my DVD player. This film is ambiguous in its blurb and even more impenetrable in its cast decisions (why is Ms. Song romantically interested - did they just want to have an Asian wife in there or give their unconvincingly wise figure the story a fresh perspective on this "message film")? There is very little to approach this film, and still less, as the story progresses. But after a good hour in the process, I realized that the casting agent is just finished with the dull casting, the unconvincing character studies are the result of the authors' minds, and the story is amorphous and unmarked by the clues People's suffering plagued capitalism, materialism and progress in the postmodern world. Towards the end of the film, just before I nodded and missed the last two minutes, I felt that "Everything's Gone Green" was a product of "connections" in the world of film - someone with very little talent knew someone with very little Director skill, knew someone with absolutely no marketing sense (but plenty of disposable ego) and rushed out this boring and inefficient attempt at ridicule and humor - with a certain conscience nonsense. And that's the craziest thing - how many infinitely better scripts have been overrun in favor of this almost unsurpassed trip? Skip this movie and feel good about it.
