Plunkett and MaCleane are two street workers who rob the rich to give ... the rich; comparatively, they are the rich. But we know that they are the good guys, because the man behind the forces of law and order, a Mr. Chance, is just so bad. He rapes women - or tries. He opens his subordinates. He commits a murder. He has bad breath. He does not shave properly. He has no sense of fashion. He tortures puppy dogs. The last one is just one conclusion of mine: we do not see him torturing his puppies. But I'm sure he does. Little of Chance's villainy has a lot to do with his pursuit of Plunkett and MaCleane. It's just something he does in his spare time, a kind of hobby that makes him absolutely sure we do not like him. He should not have tried so much. Nobody in this movie is sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Let's take stock. Appealing characters? There is no: I think we covered that. Swashbuckling? No momentum. Instead, we have a kind of dirty, heavy breathing. Line? Sparkle? Force? I've all gone the way of rejecting, I'm afraid. Realism? None of it. I think they were looking for realism, because they were all so dirty, but the characters and the action had all the plausibility of Errol Flynn - without a sense of amusement to support them. Beauty? Nope. Good camera work? For a television crew maybe. Humor? You can chuckle once or twice if you are in a benevolent mood. Maybe not. Dialog? See "Humor" above. Music? Do not even understand me with the music. In comparison, the music in Ladyhawk was incredibly fitting; and at least the false aesthetics of this score was a consistent one. <br /> <br /> Ugh. I apologize to `Ladyhawk 'for even thinking about it in this context. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: There is a lot of positive bad and NOTHING good - unless you count Liv Tyler I think about. <br /> <br /> I feel I just got one Report written about the smallpox. "Not very good," says the critic. It would be much more interesting if I could somehow defend the smallpox, if I said that the critics of smallpox had misunderstood everything - but I do not know how I would do that.
