There's really only one reason to watch this barely adequate and totally predictable film about cook-cook Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones), whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister's car accident has died. And that's the reason to look at Aaron Eckhart (Nick), who, with his flabby haircut and appealingly gloomy attitude, looks good enough to beat between two organic pannini slices and a dip of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette pair of finely chopped sun-dried cubes to eat tomatoes. He reminds me of Sean Bean. The thought of taking his shirt off was the only thing that kept me awake until the end. He pulled off his apron several times convulsively, but to my disappointment I never went on. <br /> <br /> I can not be too critical as I have seen them at home from pay-per-view, so did not cost me the price of at least two movie tickets, and I was educated to pay for small graces to be grateful. But really, that's Rome Com from its most formal side. Zeta Jones gives a very flat, monotonous idea, she seems to be completely dispassionate (possibly because of the time she seems to have spent in the cold store of the restaurant.) Thirty shots can not have been fun) and her face Films barely changed. Abigail Breslin was pretty good as a niece, she's such a lovely little girl that it's impossible to criticize her, and yet I loved her in Little Miss Sunshine. Patricia Clarkson is always value for money and I can not blame her for being a restaurant owner as she was under-challenged given what a good actress she is and how little she has to do here. But the whole thing is just a clich√©, much of the dialogue banal and the result so obvious. This is the cinematic equivalent of color by number, and Zeta Jones and Eckhart produce little heat on the canvas. <br /> <br /> Nick likes Italian food (no doubt shows his burning inner passion) and cooks to Puccini's sounds. His appearance at Kate's Kitchen at 22 Bleecker (the name of the restaurant) predictably confuses her feathers, but his uncanny ability to connect with her niece by cooking pizza and building a Bedouin tent in the living room brings Kate around and despite some stumbling along By the way, she gives him her precious possessions. No, not her honor. But her recipe for saffron sauce. <br /> <br /> I'm very unfair here, right? I mean, Rome Com is Rom Com, and we all know what we're getting into when we sign up. But does it always have to be so dull?
