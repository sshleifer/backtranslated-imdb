Since I'm not a big Steven Seagal fan, I thought this was a pretty good movie. It is obvious that his fans are very dissatisfied with this drama, which lacks of overabundance in martial arts and brute force. Gailard Sartain plays a self-proclaimed patriot leader of a militia in an altercation with the ATF weapon injuries. He gives himself up with the intention to release a deadly virus. Seagal is a former CIA agent who becomes a country doctor. He insists on finding the antidote to the deadly bug that has knocked out a small town. The herbal remedy from America's grandfather is part of salvation. <br /> <br /> Remarkable performances by L.Q. Jones, Camilla Belle and Silas Weir Mitchell. My personal favorite in this movie is Whitney Yellow Robe. She is gorgeous and seems to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role. Despite the far-fetched end, this was a decent movie that could use a lot more action.
