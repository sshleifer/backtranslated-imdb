"Get Shorty", "Out of Sight", "Jackie Brown" (and even "52 Pick-Up") - people have finally gotten Elmore Leonard right and made good films out of his work. Despite the warnings of my students about how bad this movie would be, I could not resist renting it. I thought, how bad can it be? Oy, what a mistake, especially after reading the book, which was lame (and too circular in itself) compared to Elmore Leonard's other books. Still, the book was better than the movie. Leonard again trumps the weak and unskilled scriptwriters trying to take over his book. The dialogue written for Steven Tyler was painful to look at. And the lyrics to the first song of the character Linda Moon? My middle school students write with more depth. Sad sad. Sad. Why do you even give a star? Because Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman still see fun on the screen and Andre 3000 was not fooling.
