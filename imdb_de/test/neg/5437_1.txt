Let's see: there is a civil war, a lost city, a talking gorilla, a few regular gorillas, a hitherto unknown species of killer-collo-gorilla, the most powerful laser humanity has ever known, a lot of diamonds lying in the mine. Hippos, an active volcano and a hot air balloon packed in a suitcase in a fallen plane. That's not too much, right? I had more coherent fever dreams ("... and then the Romanian caught up with a bunch of diamonds because that was a lost city he was looking for or something, but then the common gorillas we'd seen before.") Now the talking gorilla had somehow returned from the regular gorillas, and when a kind of earthquake or volcano began, the industrialist built a gun with a laser and that big diamond she was holding in her hand found her dead fianc√© ... "). It's freaking to see more ammunition against the detrimental influence of Michael Crichton on American entertainment (and world entertainment), and how much of that cynical and half-hearted attempt fell on his face in the box office. But unfortunately those responsible - Crichton, Sceenwriter John Patrick Shanley, director Frank Marshall - have probably never lost a penny. Shame on her and that's what I mean. 1.10
