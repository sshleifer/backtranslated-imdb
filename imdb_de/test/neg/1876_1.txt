This could be for those who have been to summer camps, but it is certainly not an entertaining camp. I've already gone to one, but I did not have to scream for joy. Instead, it hurt me. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is that Bill Murray did have hair in the 70s. Yes, and he did not mind running a lot. But to get him to work, you would have to give him a wife to chase after. <br /> <br /> It's not that some stunts can not be funny. For example, jogging with one of the councilors who always wakes up elsewhere due to the movement of his bed. Instead, the jokes and stunts are badly set up and executed. It just was not funny. For someone who loves comedy, this is a pain. Others are glued to it for life. I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6, but does not come close. "F"
