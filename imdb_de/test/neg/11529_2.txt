Well, I went out with some friends to see this movie. We left one hour before the show started to get good seats. As you can probably imagine, we were excited to see this movie :). But this excitement soon became a horror, this movie is a total failure, it's just too hard to be funny, it's sad, the script is badly written and relies too much on the actors to make it up to scratch ... <br /> <br /> The only good drama in the entire movie was of Stefan C. Schaefer, who was great, the plot was weak and even the "funny" scenes felt forced and unnatural when you did Considering that the main characters are some of Iceland's best comedians It's special ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone because it's too hard and never really delivers.
