When I saw this movie for the first time in the 80s, I loved it. I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing ... everything. I recently watched it on DVD again, and I was really struck by how extremely stupid the plot was - holes, inconsistencies and, frankly, a lot of crap - and how awful the dance was. I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have got into this ballet repertoire ... The whole thing was pretty pathetic. The character development also lacked depth. I think that was a product of the 80s: The film does not last today!
