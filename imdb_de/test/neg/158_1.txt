I tried to see this adaptation, but it was so terrible that I could not torture myself so much. The performances were quite below average, with the exception of Ariel. Fonda was far too exaggerated in a role that should be treated with subtlety. I studied Shakespeare and saw many adaptations, and this is by far the worst I've ever seen. I have to wonder why someone made this movie on Earth. Shakespeare can and has been beautifully adapted in many cases. This is not one of them. If you need to watch this movie, can I suggest a drinking game? Every time you drink something from the original idea, take two drinks each time Fonda overreacts. You should be pretty drunk in no time.
