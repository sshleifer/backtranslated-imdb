TV Award shows that he has half of his time for nominations in, comic relief, chat shows, quiz shows, game shows, charity shows, Brighton. Just when you're finished thinking you could find salvation in the wireless system, the lisping twang of the good old JR. Hits you like a freight train that does not drive from Texas to Downtown New York. That lost an hour and tried to catch up. <br /> <br /> About this show (FNWJR). <br /> <br /> It's a normal chat show format with JR As Host and a house band that had four gay men (ha ha ha, thank my aching sides.) and Season 1 had Andy Davis, but he left or was released to yield to Ross's ego. Ross will use his guests less than props and you really will not hear them Because of his attitude "It's my ball and I take it home," you also see that the bigger the guest, the more willing he is to lie and to show up to them to come with the big boys (like the weak kid) at school hanging around with the bully). <br /> <br /> However, when a small reality TV star shows up, he will happily humble them, ask personal questions about the past and tell them about their lack of stories, not to laugh. Sometimes he will underestimate a guest's popularity, say something to vilify him, and if the audience is shocked, he will quickly become a hangman. The best example of this was "Life On Mars" star John Simm came in and said how someone like you gets work, your OK, but not good looking (Bare in mind, that Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry were in the green room), he said really just tried to understand it before you were even on the couch. When the audience was shocked, Ross said quickly, "What, I'm reckless because I wore this corset, I do not know what I'm saying." If he does not have low forms of television life, he simply resorts to the four gay men on the piano, the jokes being more outdated than his fashion. <br /> <br /> It's a whole different story When a Hollywood A-Lister or a major TV star arrives on the show, he tells them stories to amuse them. If an actor declares that he was in a support band, then Jonathon Ross will say something like, "Wow, well, whenever I go to a band, I wanted to try to get involved with the support band, so they feel as desired. " "with an underlined message" like me, I was probably one of the people who cheered you when you were in your band. "With an audience of Ross fans who are so excited about every bad old joke and bull , this is really a bad show. <br /> <br /> If you prefer watching US chat shows, they are more script-driven, but not nearly as hard to watch.
