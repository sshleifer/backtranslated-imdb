In four words, Captain Corelli's mandolin was "totally out of tune" with the book. The novel had plenty of background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters had to overcome. The scriptwriter decided to ignore the details. Ignoring them (eg the role of the priest first as a buffoon, but later as a spiritual leader, the inability of the fianc√© until he was taught by a socialist rebel, the advice of the bomb expert Corelli and his eventual ironic death), the story and the figures flat. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I ever went through halfway. Interesting cinematography, great actors do not make a movie; History does it.
