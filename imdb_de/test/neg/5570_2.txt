I just looked at it because I saw some good reviews for that, so I expected at least a half-way cheesy movie. Toybox does not even deliver that. There are so many problems with this movie that I do not even know where to start, so I'll list a few major issues (Again, spoiler alert, just read it, it'll save you the trouble of looking at it later) , <br /> <br /> This film begins with the mythical folklore of both Celeste Noir (a witch the main character claims to be the reincarnation) and Folker (or something like that, a bad man with a big smile who slices people with hooks and sells his heart in pies). I liked that, it was a sweet concept, everything that has to do with cake is just fun. But then you watch the movie and it's all about this idiot girl and her boyfriend (and how was the deal with him, was he psychic, did he have powers, right?) And they meet their crazy family. Not really crazy, they just argue a lot. That's what makes up most of this movie, and they barely touch the supposed myth, except in a few confusing scenes that you can not turn heads or tails from. <br /> <br /> In one scene, Berenice (the main character who is in contact with the witch) wanders off and performs a ritual by candlelight. It seemed pretty important, but it was absolutely NOTHING after she did. It just wasted more time. <br /> <br /> And who the hell was the guy with his dog? You see how he approached the house from the beginning with that evil red-eyed dog, and then he finally comes and gets killed? What the hell?? Was he the fellow man? Was his dog obsessed? Has anyone killed the dog? They have never really shown that. Besides, every scene involving the vicar was completely pointless and only served to explain the lame end weakly. It was as if they had all these interesting character ideas and they went nowhere! The friend who obviously had some strength but never explained it. The grandmother, who apparently also had a kind of witchcraft, never used it. The Vicar, who ... OK, no matter, there was no reason at all for his existence. And then there was Berenice and her stupid amulet. Could it really do magic, or did it just reflect light and blind people? This was a complete waste of time, and the only reason I give her two stars is that a) Berenice is kind of cute and b) it mentioned Pies. Save yourself the money you are hiring and dear God, do not even think about buying it, unless wasting money is a new fad.
