"Crimes of Passion" is a movie that is disappointing in most cases. Where should I start? The plot? It is desperately simple and sketchy. The direction? Reminiscent of a cheap B-movie. The acting? John Laughlin is utterly unconvincing in his role as "well-meaning husband of a frozen wife" Bobby and Annie Pot as "frozen wife" Amy, and it's only Kathleen Turner (above average) and Antony Perkins (awarded), the passable-looking notes to get. In particular, Antony Perkins performs excellently as perverted reverend Peter Shayne, while Turner manages to satisfactorily portray the roles of the sexy China Blue and the frail Joanna Crane. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the performances of Turner and Perkins alone are not enough to give the film a grade over 4/10. Look at it, if you want to see Turner in some sensational scenes (though the film itself can easily be matched by the competition in this regard - for example, "Basic Instinct"), otherwise avoid it.
