This is the worst case of dubbing since the silent time. Not just one or two actors, but virtually the entire cast. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were fine, but the rest looks like the first time he played the acting. <br /> <br /> So the budget was not huge. Many costumes and costumes were believable, but there were many things that appeared to the viewer to let us know that they could not retest or get any props that matched the period I can not imagine any aspect of the movie I liked or did not shake my head. Your time is better spent burning fluff taken from your navel.
