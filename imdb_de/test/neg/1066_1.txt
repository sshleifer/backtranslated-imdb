I really hate and despise the movie and the filmmakers behind it. <br /> <br /> Sure, I'm all for making a tough and honest film about youth and youth culture. In 1987, "River's Edge" is a great example of a well-made teen drama. What I take as an exception, however, is the infantile, grubby and sensational approach taken by the makers of "2:37". <br /> <br /> An outstanding example is how it raises so many issues and yet it is meaningful to be able to comment on or make a resolution on one of them. <br /> <br /> My other major problem with this film, apart from its complete plagiarism by Gus Van Sant "Elephant" (surprised that Van Sant does not complain) being "bull loose in a china shop" is the attitude to pretty delicate ones Topics like incest and above all suicide. <br /> <br /> In short, avoid this movie like the plague and everything this filmmaker will deal with later. I've heard that his motivation to make "2:37" may be based on lies or not. After seeing the inferior result, it does not surprise me in the least. This is a glorified student film exercise that has no room in a movie theater or on DVD. Pure and easy.
