Exaggerated and modest; and sometimes too darkly lit. The scenario of DARK REALITY is not nearly original. Dark and damp cellar. Prisoners kidnapped. Fearful survival. Carey (Alisha Seton) tells her family and friends that she will be hiking all over Europe. She is not from the city. She is seized by a rainy sidewalk, stunned and awakened in a dungeon. She finally realizes that she is not alone, and when she has met some of her prisoners, there are different thoughts of survival. Their cellmates are gradually dying off. Can she gather enough strength and courage to see daylight again? Others in the cast: Laila Dagher, Rachel Oliva, Eva Derreck, Arthur Bullock and Jen Parker.
