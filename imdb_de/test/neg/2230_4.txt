My Take: Usually routine and lazy for direct video try of Disney. <br /> <br /> Disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog. Many films have committed themselves to stories that deal only with the best friend of man. Disney itself has made a handful. They've also made a handful of those who are literally dogs. Add this to this heap. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the original for a long time, so I'm probably not the right person to judge if this direct video sequence is better. Who is over seven years old, is not the right one. Perhaps only the youngest among the boys will want to see LADY AND THE TRAMP II: SCAMP'S ADVENTURE, and even they would grow up and say it's not the best kind of family entertainment they've ever seen. I think, to be fair, I can say that it guarantees a rental, but that's not much to say. <br /> <br /> This sequel picks up on the parts that have lagged behind the classic classic. Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel puppies ... and a mischievous half-breed called Scamp who's a chip from the old block. Instead of running into the confines of his own home, Scamp wants to run away with the city's other junkyard dogs, who are not known as one of the roadblocks by his father's own past. To capture the charms of the original, this throws the same poor dog love story, and vice versa. Scamp falls in love with one of the junkyard dogs named Angel (and who would not call it that with a name and a voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). Que Replay of the famous spaghetti scene! Apart from the "cute" factor, this lazy direct video effort has nothing for every audience. Stay with the original. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** from 5.
