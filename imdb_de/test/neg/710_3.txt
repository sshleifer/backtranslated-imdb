Oh, why did it have to end like this? Laurel and Hardy's last film, from the coarse twisted cuckoo theme (with false credit from Hal Roach) to the final "Nice Chaos" / "I could not help it," Schtick, this is the duo as a grotesque parody of itself. In between, their relationship now consists entirely of uncertain action, a dialogue and half-hearted slapstick. People are planning the King of New York, but Chaplin's last outing was far from insignificant here. <br /> <br /> What really hurts someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the performance of the two comedians. The video cover I hold in her hand shows her at her best, all boyish smiles and glowing skin, with a blurb on the back: "The photograph on this sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the Films. "Necessary? It does not even come close. The actual movie looks at least fifteen years older than the photos that adorn the sleeve, whereby Ollie is desperately overweight. This is neither humorous nor funny fat, as it would normally appear, but bad-looking and on the verge of obesity. After a series of blows, he would have been dead seven years after this movie. Stan, who suffers from prostate problems and dysentery, looks scary when his weight has dropped dramatically. Every time something bad happens to him. Being squeezed between a lifeboat and a table, you fear for his life. Even if Ollie gives him a traditional slap, he worries that he might be killed. After the completion of this film, he lasted fifteen years until he finally died in 1965 of a heart attack. It is annoying to think of such esteemed performers who grow old and suffer painful deaths. It is disturbing to observe the deterioration of both health and performance on the screen. If I and I are sure that almost everyone else thinks of Laurel and Hardy, I think of Way Out West, Busy Bodies or Our Relations. Seeing her in such a physical illness and performing sinister routines at the end of her career is a failure of my happy memories of her. <br /> <br /> The warning signs are from the opening credits, the list, clearly not only four writers, but also someone who deals with the concept, and a recognition for "gags". So if Monty Collins wrote the gags, what were the other four? And why did Monty Collins pay a fee in this case because there is not a single "gag" throughout the movie? Over 40% of the film is spent traveling to the island of the same name, where we experience some of the most painful scenes the boys have ever been involved in. When I saw the bat scene, I wanted to curl up and die, so great was it childlike incompetence. What makes the movie dead, however, is that all support members are dubbed and can not speak English. This not only makes the film incoherent, but also the reactions of Stan and Ollie to their co-stars. Flanked by appalling film stocks and absolutely gruesome cuts, this completely denies the alleged $ 2 million spent on it. Honestly, it looks terrible, and while a DVD release might clean up the image, the sound and image quality is far inferior to any of Hal Roach's work. Stan and Ollie 'Friends', Giovani and Antoine are charisma-free holes that stand out strongly from Laurel and Hardy's old repertoire. This is another big problem of the movie as none of the minor characters are funny or the boys' innocent mentality. The synchronized hardness that L & H ("you - the fat one") has shown makes her stand out as an isolated social outsider, not a lovable sub-anarchist. There is evidence of a darker political satire - though Duck Soup is not - and the concept of an island without rules is an interesting topic. Perhaps more relevant than ever, a film dealing with the issues of immigration and the US Constitution is suddenly the most up-to-date in 2003. Sadly, however, outside of an amusing scene where Stan is elected "the people", this is not the case of actually going anywhere. And this slightly black humor has its hard edges - or is it a movie by Laurel and Hardy that directly implies rape and threatens Stan with a bottle for a man just to accidentally blow someone's face, your idea of ​​a good one Time? After all the years Stan and Ollie shared a bed, we also get a clear reference. Stan accidentally kissed him - Ollie wipes the kiss in disgust. Worrying is the suggestion that the illegal immigrant friend of Stan and Ollie, Antoine, is ending his life by being eaten by a lion. I never thought that I would see a Laurel and Hardy movie in which they should also be hanged. The need for intrusive and straightforward storytelling is another clue to how chaotic the whole thing is. The American version (the same version available as video) hacks for 16 minutes to improve it. Almost totally unsurpassable, this terribly made, unyielding film only serves to affect the reputation of Stan and Ollie - avoid at all costs.
