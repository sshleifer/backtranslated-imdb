Well, I thought the movie was bla 1/10. Anyway, the best part is the first 5 minutes of the movie with the nerd's or whatever the girlfriend had big hooters, did I think that this really is a random actor? Heck, no, it was not really a model by the name of Larissa McComas, but you already knew that <br /> <br /> That made sense, but that had something to do with the rest of the movie (which I have anyway) seen)) did not care about 4 and did not bother to look at the rest. That's all I needed to satisfy C, 2 of you who are just making sure they're okay
