There are so many things in this movie that it's hard to pick just a few. Let's start with the stupid and annoying songs. Like "Ride Little Cowboy", which just emphasizes the urban look of Klinton Spilsbury. The silly kiddie cowboys played in the background during the film hurt the credibility or momentum of the story. <br /> <br /> I saw the media hype before the release of this movie and saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on various TV shows and had a very sweet, sweet, beating voice. His body language was not exactly what people remembered, fans of Clayton Moore and the television series Lone Ranger. Spilsbury did not help by acting like a diva and talking to Trash about Clayton Moore after the producers obtained a restraining order against Moore, who refused to appear on conventions and other events as the original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore was not even allowed to sign as "Clayton Moore, The Lone Ranger". He could only sign as "The Masked Man". The unbelievable amount of negative publicity this movie gave the film was only added by the spiteful attitude of Spilsbury, who told reporters very quickly that Clayton Moore would soon forget when the movie came out! <br /> <br /> Even after the movie was a total flop, the company owned by The Lone Ranger refused to lift its injunction against Clayton Moore, and he was never allowed to do anything other than "The Masked Man". and he could not put his black mask on a public appearance, and he certainly did not help make a good impression on the public between Spilsbury's diva personality and the negative publicity the film got Weeks before the release of the film, it was revealed that Spilsbury's voice was overrun by James Keech, as the producers believed that Spilsbury did not sound convincing as a cowboy, the ridicule and ridicule that this news brought on the talk shows and comedy shows of that time , put the last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> But then there was Merle Haggard, who was telling his way through the movie. Apparently the producers were hoping that The macho image of Haggard (one of the Outlaws of Country Music) would give Spilsbury credence as The Lone Ranger. The story of Merle Haggard was just another trouble the audience had to deal with. Sometimes Haggard rhymes with his narrative and it sounds like a funny children's movie. Combine the lavish narrative with the "Ride Little Cowboy" songs, and any credibility that Spilsbury could have mustered was dashed by Haggard, and the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Tonto was played by Michael Horse and horse had much more personality than Spilsbury. In fact, perhaps because of Spilsbury's supposedly combative stance during the shoot, it appears Horse has received much more dialogue and screen time than Tonto would have expected. Tonto takes the lead and is often the leader instead of the Lone Ranger. I had expected (or hoped) that Billy Jack, as Tonto's brother, would make a cameo (that would have made the movie a lot better). Horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury, he says more and has better scenes. Maybe it was a case where Horse stole the show from Spilsbury. However, as the movie was so miserable, Horse did not get much recognition. Horse had a very prolific career in the film industry, unlike Spilsbury. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the last drawback of this movie is the powder blue outfit by The Lone Ranger. The material chosen for Spilsbury was more powdery blue than what Clayton Moore usually wore. This color choice for the outfit made Spilsbury look even more feminine in his role. In the comic version, The Lone Ranger also showed a red shirt and black pants, and this alternative outfit could have tempted Spilsbury to be more convincing as The Lone Ranger. Everyone looks like they're working on a TV episode, and nobody seemed very convincing. Even the villain Cavendish lost his edge due to the people around him. Overall, I'm sorry for Spilsbury. Not only has he done a terrible acting job, it's also obvious that the production and public relations work was terrible and sabotaged any chance of the poor man. Even if he had been an excellent substitute for Clayton Moore, I doubt the film would have performed well due to the other factors. It looks like this movie is sad in a sad way.
