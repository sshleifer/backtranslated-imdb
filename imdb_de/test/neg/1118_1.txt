I'm speechless. Matty Simmons did something I thought was impossible. He made "The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island" look like "Citizen Kane". Painful, this piece can not even describe ... I do not know. The premise sounded weird, but now that I've seen it, it's funny that putting an anvil down on the scrotum is funny. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to describe the premise. As the title implies, if I say only, I do not believe that there was literally a funny thing in this movie, not one, not even the monkey bite. How could one of the funniest characters in the vacation franchise, the shabby white trash Eddie (Randy Quaid), become so dull? I've never had that much sympathy for an actor in my life. I was also with the other actors who took part in this "weird" cruelty, Miriam Flynn (Catherine, Eddie's boring but sunny wife), Dana Barron (the original Audrey Griswold), Fred Willard and the stunning Sung Hi Lee (perhaps Der only reason to watch the movie if only the sound was off), except for the old commie, Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), he had let it come. Unfortunately, the audience did not. I'm just saying "Thank goodness" that Chevy Chase, who has been in crisis for years, has freed himself from this diarrhea spatter. It's the smartest career move he's ever made. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you are religious like me, but I know I will pray to the Lord tonight to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life to make up for the time I spent watching TV Never come back. <br /> <br /> Hot water burning baby says ZERO of 10 stars (If you take a few blows from the bong AND drink the water, maybe 1/10 of a star of 10)
