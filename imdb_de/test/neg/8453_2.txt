This movie was absolutely painful for me. I understand that indie movies do not have the same resources as other mainstream movies. However, there are basic elements of filmmaking that you normally want to stick to. First of all, the cut jumps. There are numerous 15 minutes to the beginning of the film. There are recordings that look like two separate takes of the same recording are being edited together. What I mean by that is that a character says half a line of one take and the rest of the line comes from another take. Second, the dialogue. I understand that many authors are looking for a very realistic and true dialogue for their films. Since this film is very site specific, the dialogue must also be spoken in a specific tone (example: make a movie in Boston, but use a West Coast slang with a Chicago accent). Despite this understanding, it is still difficult to get through some of the lines that these actors present. These are just the two liveliest problems I've encountered in this movie. There were a few others. I do not want to sound like a sharp critic who knows nothing. I have years of experience in the film industry (especially in the low budget indie movie). I also understand that many directors often have a method for their madness. I could not discover this method in this movie. This makes it difficult to decide if I see this film as an example of a unique style of filmmaking, or just another low-budget movie with a poorly composed film. I honestly hope it's not the last one. If someone has an insight into why things were done in a particular way, or if they have their own thoughts / views on this film, I would like to hear them. I hope I can understand this movie better and my current opinion can be changed.
