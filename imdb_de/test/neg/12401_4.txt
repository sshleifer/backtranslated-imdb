Of all the movies in the history of the movies, I can not imagine someone sitting down and saying, "I want to spend X dollars (or pounds sterling) to restore this flawed classic movie called 'Breeders'. Many stories have been made into movies in which meteorites came to earth and something sinister lurked in it. Why not invest your money in a spectacular 3D remake of "It Came from Outer Space"? Why look for a dingy nude movie that only exists to show a rubbery set of monsters and some naked students? Was the screenplay for the 1986 version of "Breeders" so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time? The only reason this movie exists is to show Britcom Cutie Pie Samantha Janus. But if you want to make a skin film and take advantage of Sam Janus in it, you should take it more naked than this and more often than this if you want to succeed. <br /> <br /> Meteor lands. .. monsters flees ... students duff their clothes ... monster eats people ... and another "what if?" Ends follow. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I never thought I would recommend the original breeders to any other movie, but this would be the second place.
