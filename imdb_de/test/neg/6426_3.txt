The movie starts well enough. It is a truly scary scene when some escapees fleeing the law rip open an innocent family in a secluded country house by killing mother and father. The young daughter can only escape with the help of a mysterious ghost who kills the two attackers while she is in a cupboard on the ground floor. Then, 15 years later, we meet as a drug-addicted student researching the supernatural. She lives with her promiscuous aunt and is cared for by a mysterious redhead. She has no real friends, was almost raped at a party, and always has bizarre visions that nobody else can see. Yes, life is great. Things get a lot more enjoyable when she deals with her mother's sister, who is later found dead in the bathtub under suspicious circumstances and has 11 etched into her forehead. Hmm, I wonder who the main suspect of the police will be. This is soon followed by more deaths, all associated with her relationship with our heroine, who had bad relationships with them before her death. Could it be the culprit or could the explanation be more ethereal? Note: If you think of the first, you have bought the wrong movie from Blockbuster. Go back and get the right shortsighted bullfinch. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was ready to move on quickly to the good parts, knowing that I did not miss anything but a mediocre suspension kettle. But the first ten minutes grabbed me and I decided to give him a chance. I was quite positively surprised: it was certainly not a masterpiece, but the acting was good enough and the script always produced fascinating situations that I was glad to find the solution to. In 45 minutes, I realized that my attention began to wander during a long sequence in which the main character walks through a library and does nothing. Then we get a cheap fear, followed by a quarter of an hour of God fearing the paranormality between her and her new boyfriend. From there it only got worse when the promising beginning was thrown out the window as we pursued one unconvincing act after another, followed by an end that was as anti-climatic as being promised the moon and instead of dealing with a tiny meteorite. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> If it were bad the whole way, it would have been much easier to swallow it. The fact that it starts at a gallop and barely ends with a whimper is not only disappointing, it is heartbreaking. How can something that started so promising become so formulaic? I do not know and I do not care much. I'll just give the author and the director some advice for the next time: Do not spend five weeks writing the first part of your script, and finish the rest in five minutes. You tend to notice these things in the final product if you treat your project as sloppily as here ... 3/10
