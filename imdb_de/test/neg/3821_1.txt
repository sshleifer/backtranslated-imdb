I read the last few comments and could not wait to see the movie. But after spending 80 minutes of predictable "surprises" that did not even force me into an unrealistic villain, I was very disappointed. I thought cartoons were the only movies that lasted only 80 minutes. I thought that might be due to the edits to classify it as 'R', but the original contained only ten more minutes of "Kill Bill" blood. When blood gushes like hoses, reality loses its appeal. Add the killer, who is supposed to be a "ghost," but can tear someone's head off the jaw (ala King Kong with the T-Rex), go through everything, and have an end similar to that of the Sopranos finale, and You may have been the most hyped movie of the last year. After watching the movie, I felt I had seen countless films with the same plot and method, and felt largely dissatisfied. I do not know what everyone else saw in it, but if you're looking for a good horror movie this weekend, see Halloween, it's definitely worth the $ 10. When it comes to Hatchet, we hope the next IS is based on the book.
