For a lost soldier, Voor a lost soldier is a sad example of how one can not translate to film a touching, complex psychological study about the most magical time in a man's life when he is still a child but begins to become a man. The novel tells about the experiences of Rudy van Dantzig, the young Jeroen told during the Second World War at the age of 11, while he dealt with his incipient sexuality and sent his deep fears of abandonment in the province of Friesland, North Holland, by his parents because of the food shortage in Amsterdam and has not heard from them for months as the postal service has collapsed. The arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film is depicted in a painful manner git, with the soldiers entertaining vaudeville-style. A soldier, Walt, Romance Jeroen, and the couple are presented as two male men completing their love in a sexual experience. This was taken by the 11-year-old Jeroen. The reality was a bit different: Jeroen describes his encounters with Walt, six in total, but in a crooked language. But there is no misunderstanding about their nature. Walt is aroused by an intense passion of Jeroen, in which he treated him roughly, so that Jeroen gets bruised on her last meeting and suffers a painful wound on the shoulder where Walt bit him. During this encounter, Walt Jeroen raped twice. Jeroen could have easily avoided Walt after their second encounter when Walt attacked him for the first time, as Walt is clearly anxious to keep his abuse of the boy away from the other soldiers. Why Jeroen Walt always visits is a mystery of the human heart and for me anyway not explainable. What the film omits is the consequences: the nightmares, the bleakness, the desperate search for the chance to find Walt, because Jeroen loved Walt, and nothing could shake that.
