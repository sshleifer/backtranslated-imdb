I've seen part of the first part of this movie and tiny bits of other parts. Maybe I'm wrong, but I do not think it's really worth watching this movie. The strange characters and happenings attract your attention and are quite interesting, but there are also bad things and some rough things. The magical and mythical side turned me off, and for most Christians, this film would not be particularly appropriate or worthwhile.
