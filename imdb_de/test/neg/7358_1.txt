If you've seen the grudge, another mediocre ghost movie, then you should know what to expect, just worse, far worse. This time we are not with all English-speaking people in Japan, but with all English-speaking people in Spain. It's interesting that not a single shot of this movie actually looks like Spain and may have been completely shot in a studio. Oh, and a place with swings, because there are good 5 minute shots of swings that show nobody. The acting by the Lameinator, mom and dad, does not help at all. Anna Paquin is the only person who does a decent job in the film, but I hate Anna Paquin so you can imagine my private hell movie. <br /> <br /> But there is a good moment in the movie. When a villain tries to explain Anna Paquin's character the intricate conspiracy, and she does not understand it and asks a few stupid questions, and he says, "You IDIOT, you have not understood anything!" lol. Well, I happen to understand that this movie is a piece of garbage. 0 stars
