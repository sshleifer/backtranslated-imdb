When I heard the male lead saying, "That's amazing!" once again I would have barfed. The film is a big clich√©, with fake "settings". No man in this film has a redeeming quality. reminds me of films from the Soviet era with highly politically oriented messages. I could not even understand why there was attraction between the leads, nor could I wait for the end.
