Recently I showed my friend a great movie, Stand By Me, a movie I showed many people, and they absolutely loved him, but for some reason he did not like him. He lends me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me that he showed it to a lot of people and they were excited, instead I hated this movie. I do not think I have hated a movie so much for some time. How this movie even has a rating of 6.6, I do not. I could not keep up with the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin becoming a fireman, the random sibling rivalry, the random love stories, the story of the arsonist, the investigator, the fire that has a personality it's just I have a problem that this movie can not compete with all these stories because it is not balanced well enough, which makes the movie interesting. I would have preferred it if this movie was about being a fireman or an investigator and how he came to do it, or what exactly he is doing and why. The film tells the story of a group Chicago firefighters, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, the older brother, is obsessed with hitting the fires he fights. Brian, the younger brother, left the Fire Academy a few years ago and started a number of other unsuccessful careers before becoming a firefighter again. He is looked down on by his older brother, who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a firefighter. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is a fire investigator dedicated to his profession. He is called because a number of fires have similar connections. Martin Swayzak is a city councilor in the city council. He has obvious hopes of being elected mayor, but had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. Many of the ordinary firefighters believe that the cuts he has made jeopardize the lives of firefighters. However, Swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffective after firefighters have been repeatedly killed in flames. <br /> <br /> I just could not get into this movie, I do not know how anyone else It was unbelievably unrealistic and the firefighters were all misrepresented. I loved it as there was every action clich√© in the book that matched this action movie. I just felt that a great talent for such mediocre roles was wasted, Donald Sutherland, a great actor, but a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser-known man who had the up-and-coming talent at that time. I know Ron put a lot of emphasis on quality, but I think it was a mistake doing so big actors in small roles. I even had to make a joke while watching this movie commenting that the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there, I did not enjoy it and honestly would not recommend it to people. I will follow the recommendations in my relationship from this point on. <br /> <br /> 2/10
