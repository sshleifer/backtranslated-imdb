After searching for months for this Bruceploitation and accidentally buying it cheaply, it was disappointing. I heard about it on a DVD-R page and it sounded crazy. <br /> <br /> But no, what I got was a pretty bad martial arts movie. The kung-funging was not so bad, but the rest of the movie was pretty awful and made the movie really long, much longer than the 85-minute run. <br /> <br /> Positive Notice that the monkey was funny for a few seconds (especially when I think he only took the close-up of his face from another movie), and the black guy who is up Halfway there, it was funny because of the one line he said: which invariably made all Blacks look like complete Simpletons. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was not enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
