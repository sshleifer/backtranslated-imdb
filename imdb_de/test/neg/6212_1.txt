This film is widely admonished as a copy of the Will Smith feature Hitch. This movie was boring. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as boring as unbearable. Govinda looks far beyond his prime. He is not in his best shape when he does such roles. It's just as unconvincing as his performance in Deewana Mastana. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is by his winking "Best". And that's in the few scenes in which he remembers to get dressed. It could only have been through the nepotism that the scenes of this feast of the eyes could be salvaged from the wastebasket of each cutting bottom of a film. Another case in which the Bollywood public majority was embarrassed by the fact that this was a hit.
