In the opening scene, you feel like you're in high school. But I have seen high school games with better acting! Each line was so obviously delivered that I felt that I was watching actors at work rather than seeing characters. I found the character development bad and the acting very forced! After 25 minutes, I found out that I really did not care what happened, because the plot was too obvious and I was bored. I stayed there waiting for the movie to break itself, but it never happened. Sister Theresa was overly sweet, even for a nun, but was impulsive and easily manipulative. All in all, I was very disappointed.
