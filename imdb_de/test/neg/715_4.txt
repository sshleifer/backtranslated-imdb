"People who were stranded in a country house during a storm find that the house was an unresolved murder years ago. At a dinner briefing on the incident, the lights go out and when they reappear, they discover one of the guests was killed Fear for their lives, the guests try to find out the secrets behind death before others can occur, "says the summary of the DVD case. <br /> <br /> There are a few clever twists to this murder of the "Old Dark House" story, with "Play in a Play" the most interesting feature. The direction, however, takes more getting used to, which indicates a certain cheap production. As with most films of this type, there is (or should be) an ensemble of fascinating characters. Only Broadway producer Richard Carle (as Herman Wood) and his fey secretary Johnny Arthur (as Homer Erskine) are interested. **** The Ghost Walks (12/1/34.)) Frank R. Strayer ~ Richard Carle, Johnny Arthur, John Miljan
