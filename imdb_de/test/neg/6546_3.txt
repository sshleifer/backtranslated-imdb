There are some good performances in this film - and that's all it has to offer. The leads, especially Pauley Perrette, are appealing. (Although some of the bit players seem to be acting from a teleprompter.) The material - that's the problem. I feel as if the scriptwriter / director watches the entire run of Felicity in one sitting and then sits down to write a script without sleeping. It really reminded me of Felicity - a thoughtful young woman who finds herself, finds love, with a harrowing approach to the characters and their relationships. Apart from the fact that, although I usually enjoyed seeing Felicity, I was cold. The writing is just awful. It's amazing that the cast can do as well as they do, because the dialogue is boring at best. In the worst case, it becomes banal, stilted and amateurish. There is nothing original here, with plotel elements recycled from gimmicks that were not that brilliant at first. (Angel and fortune teller, come on.) In the first half of the movie, I searched for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience. In the second half I only wished that it would end. My sympathy for the cast, who deserve a better vehicle for their talents.
