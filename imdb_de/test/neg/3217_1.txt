It's amazing that this uninspired actor Chapa made all these famous stars appear in this grim, pathetic, cheesy and overlong movie about a gangster with a low age who looks white, but half Mexicans are well-known stars in this trashy movie get a script that was created by a 16-year-old. I am sure that this film is the career focus of actors like Dunaway, Wagner, Keach, Tilly and Busey, which I am sure would be very embarrassing that they ever appeared in this turkey of a movie. I doubt many people have ever heard of Chapa, and after this terrible movie, I'm sure he'll forget where he belongs.
