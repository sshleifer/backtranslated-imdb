I rented this movie together with my girlfriend for a good laugh. We were actually laughed at by the employee in the video store because of our questionable film taste. Unfortunately, I do not remember the first half of the movie because I was just staring at the huge metal braces Jane was wearing. and I have not heard anything because of the incomprehensible Lisp. The other thing that caught my attention beside her metal mouth was her questionable fashion sense. This movie was filmed in 2005, but it seems like the wardrobe people have jumped back to 2000 because of the clothes. If you remember the days when Aaron Carter was considered a "pop star" and you like high-waisted jeans, ankle socks and knee-length skirts, then this little journey into the past is an ideal place for you.
