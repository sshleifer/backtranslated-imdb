This movie is awful. It has absolutely no laugh. The Hebrew hammer (Adam Goldberg) sets out to save Hannukah from evil Santa Claus (Andy Dick). Perhaps a promising basis for an action, in fact, the film does not go beyond this premise. Although there are (far and few) nice accents and the plot is relatively coherent, it is tedious, apostate and ultimately boring without thinking. This despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (Hammers customer / love interest) all have a considerable screen presence. Although this movie is being played for something you might call crazy over-the-top gags, this movie is all about mid-range middle-class filth. Do NOT waste 85 minutes of your life with it. (Note - the music was good ..!)
