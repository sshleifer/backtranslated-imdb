This show shows the depths into which the UK TV drama sank before the turning point. With those boring scripts, mediocre plays, bad plots and terrible dialogues, one is forced to watch a DVD of an old ER episode to see an excellent hospital drama be able to actually act! <br /> <br /> If you want a poor quality but are easy to hear, this is the show for you. I personally like something with more meat on the bone. Like all other licensees in the UK, I finance this slag.
