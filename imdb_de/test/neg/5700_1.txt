It must have been a long time since I saw such a bad movie. I have to say, it's really hard to make a good and / or realistic movie about the air disaster, but this movie was such a waste of time and money. I also think that this is an unofficial way to get a bad name on Airbus. First, the cockpit looks like an Airbus cockpit, second, you have a stick, and third, computers have the ability to control rudder / elevator / ailerons via "fly by wire". When I saw this movie, I thought the movie's intent was "not to fly computerized airplanes like Airbus, but to use Boeing, instead they have a direct connection between steering and rowing." All I can say: bad story, terrible drama (most actors), worst movie trick ever ...
