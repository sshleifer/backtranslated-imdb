'Bloody Birthday' is a strange and sometimes humorous low budget horror movie based on Mikey or a less intelligent version of 'The Good Son'. <br /> <br /> Set in a little Californian In the city, three babies are born at the height of a solar eclipse, where the orientation of the planets means they are somehow born without emotions. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths are having a murder rush and avoiding parents, siblings, teachers, and anyone else who irritates them. Only a teenager knows the truth to stop them. There is no explanation why babies born at the same time are not equally twisted around the world, but let's go! <br /> <br /> For a Slasher movie, it's very tame in terms of violence and blood, which I suppose emphasizes the problem of acting as murderers to child figures, since there's only so much that you can do Young actors can expose. Instead, it is amusing and somewhat disturbing that three ten-year-olds are plagued with murder and their plans carried out with weapons, knives and crossbows. The main reason that it does not get completely ridiculous is that the children actors are very persuasive in their roles in playing the little innocents in front of undifferentiated adults while showing their dark sides to the girl who knows the truth /> <br /> "Bloody Birthday" is more mediocre than a horror movie, with little fear and little blood, but because it has the shock of having kids as murderers, it's a bit unique in that way. One to watch out for, unless otherwise stated.
