This movie describes a really terrible event to be sure. But everything falls on bad performances of all actors. It is impossible to feel the emotions of almost any character, as all emotional scenes are like a parody. For example, a character is filmed at the beginning of the movie, and you get the cliché desperate: "Shall I make it, sergeant?", "Yes, it's nothing," but it's like a sketch from a Wayans Brothers movie (I do not know if he shot the war movie yet) or something with Leslie Nielsen. <br /> <br /> The sergeant played by Sean Penn reminds me of Al Bundy by Married With Children, Fox is the best self-ironic cliché you can imagine ... thank God, he curses and smokes. <br /> <br /> His emotional "NOOOO !!!" is definitely more suitable for comedies such as Back To The Future than for so-called serious movies like these. <br /> <br /> Some of the "main scenes" are their merit ... (without giving too much away where they are actually doing pretty horrible things) ... are well done and let's take the issue seriously. But that's despite, not thanks to acting.
