You have to watch this movie, it's a big footnote in the history of the movie. When this movie was filmed, the American movie industry reached the bottom of sucking. Watch this movie, laugh and regret that you wereted the last 2 hours of your life. It's the worst I've ever seen and even worse governance. The villains laugh as if taken from a clown circus. If the guys who made "Scary Movie" want to parody superhero movies, all they have to do is take the script of this movie and do a remake called Black Scorpion III: the threat of really bad movies that somehow make it, the production companies to lure into a suicide.
