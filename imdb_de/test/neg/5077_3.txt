I just watched this movie on DVD this morning and was so disappointed he even thought it would be a good joke for the audience. In other words, the creators planned to make comedy, not drama. In the end, however, I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio had taken this movie seriously. That's a pity, because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fish fairy tale! Poor Ryan Phillippe - despite his efforts, his character in the movie is probably his worst performance! What to say for Jason Statham - Lack of all sorts of skills to develop the role that is an imaginary fiction ... That's why I agree: 3/10
