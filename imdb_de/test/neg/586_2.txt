The very strange script by Cameron Crowe (followed by "Fast Times at Ridgemont High") has little inspiration and stumbles on stupid gags. At least, "Fast Times" had some sense of satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick (thanks to a good director, Amy Heckerling, and Crow's undeniable fondness for capturing letters that are perfect for teens). Chris Penn (Sean's brother, Natch) is the fool who makes life for the straight arrow Eric Stoltz hell, and the filmmakers seem to think he's weird. Jenny Wright has some good moments as a mall worker, but Illan Mitchell-Smith loses herself in a raunchy subplot about a teenager who seems fascinated by a shocked ex-soldier. Queasy, confused nonsense with a shiny glow and a soundtrack full of pop rock songs, but characters you want to avoid. Supportive players Lea Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Ving and Sherilyn Fenn are squandered in stupid roles. * from ****
