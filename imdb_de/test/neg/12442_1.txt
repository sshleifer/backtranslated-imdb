I could shit a better movie. This is a waste of time and money. It makes me sick that movies like these are actually made and the people who make them think they are good. I like teenage comedies, if they are done well. However, this film brings this genre to a new low. With such films, people think it's okay to do this mess and ask unsuspecting people to pay for it. It is sadism.
