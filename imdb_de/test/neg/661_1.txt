OK, let's start with the best. Building. Although it was hard to believe that after 35 years there was electricity and running water and a fire, the cruel walls and strange objects that could be found everywhere were interesting. Apart from that, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> As far as the bad ones made by WWE movies. WTF? Is that supposed to make you see it? If anything, stay away. a horrible, terrible idea to make movies and direct Gregory Dark. bad choose. The previews were previously more interesting and entertaining. I can not even begin to discuss how bad this movie is. untalented actors and a disappointing, vague action. Apparently many actors from this show come from "All Saints". It's a wonder why I've never heard of them or their show. Apart from that, the bus driver you never see, only when he closes the door, has more action than everyone else. At least he's doing stunts for a couple of decent movies. <br /> <br /> I like watching scary movies. But this one has blown so much that the entire audience laughed at it and cheered the characters halfway around. very annoying. The kid behind me screamed more in the previews of other horror movies. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie to see, much less if you have to pay for it.
