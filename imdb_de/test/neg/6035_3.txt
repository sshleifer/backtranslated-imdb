Reeves plays Haji Murad, a hero in Russia from 1850. <br /> <br /> This is a poorly dubbed film, with June Foray playing some of the voices. Unfortunately, the one who was supposed to synchronize the voices with his lips was blind, since the words never matched the lip flaps. Who says that Japanese movies are bad, has never seen this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is instantly forgotten, so I forgot about it in the time the movie ended and I sit down to sit down. Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of many that Reeves has made in the hope of moving from plot to more action-driven films. It may have been a good thing for Reeves, but it is deadly for the audience to go through Nooze festivals like this one, which is all about judgment that intrigues with very little action. <br/> was a good actor, he just was not lucky enough to pick movies that were good. They all looked great, but few did not let the audience fall into a coma during the movie's running time. <br /> <br /> This movie puts you in a coma. Watch it only when you need sleep and all other gentle means have failed.
