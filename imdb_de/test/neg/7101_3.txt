"Tank Girl" should probably be the "Buckaroo Banzai" of the 90s and was marketed as such. The comparison is admittedly appropriate; In both films, there are so many things going on in a particular film frame that it's impossible to sort the story, but it's not boring. <br /> <br /> "Tank Girl" is fun if you turn off your brain before the movie starts. Otherwise you will get a headache like me.
