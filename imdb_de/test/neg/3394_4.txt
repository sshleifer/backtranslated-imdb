A friend invited me to see this in the cinemas. <br /> <br /> After half an hour we went out and went to the next multiplex (yes, we broke the rules) to catch the beginning of Against All odds. <br /> <br /> I remember too many apes dancing and saying, "Oog, Oog". Very little about the characters or the introduction to the story captured one of us or was even memorable. It has only moved to the point where it is painfully boring (and believe me, every excuse was good enough to spend time with that particular friend). <br /> <br /> was a major studio release, and we came to see a movie, no art gallery. It seemed that Ralph Richardson and Andie McDowell were wasted in such a badly written film. <br /> <br /> If you make it through to the second hour, there may be something worth seeing. I do not have that much patience with my time. 4 out of 10.
