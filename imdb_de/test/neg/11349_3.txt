All Law & Order's, CSI (pick your city) and Homicide: Life on the road is the weakest episode of Bones' strongest episode. David Boreanaz is stuck in shitty fishing mode. and Emily Deschanel also portrays "Bones" ... unrealistic. The actors have terrible scenes together, either with forced acting or terrible lines. <br /> <br /> The killings become predictable after some time, as the predictions and clues are too obvious. > <br /> Music is okay, but sometimes really superfluous. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bones is hardly the show I would recommend during the weekdays as it is a copy of the better shows with unreal characters and boring stories. <br /> <br /> Skip this if you can.
