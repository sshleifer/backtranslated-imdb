This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it does not know if it's an intelligent political film that is "artistic" or an exercise is erotic. As a result, it fails on all accounts. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is abominable, the narrative is outlandish and the supposed symbolism meaningless. <br /> <br /> Klaus Kinski is probably the best of this movie but that's not good. Sure, he has an intense and "unique" look, but in the end he can not really act. Just look how he reacts when his mistress leaves ... <br /> <br /> Do not really look at this movie, some say it needs repeated visits. I say, one is too much.
