This movie is so bad. It's weird to see what a bad story this has, where two pea-pressed American twins who know nothing outside their school can come to another continent and do unimaginable things there. It's just so stupid and so bizarre. How can they only find two Frenchmen, beat them and kiss them in the end without knowing anything about them? It would have been more realistic if the boys had taken her away and raped her, which could easily have happened in such a situation. As far as the part where the French President drinks "bad water", that was only lame. I do not think he was too happy in real life. Everything was too easy for the girls, and they could often have been in real trouble in the film if they had portrayed real life at all. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0/10
