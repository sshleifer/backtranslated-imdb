This movie was awful. If it had never been done, the world would be a better place. Come on, a flying car? What did they think? This was a substandard movie with a terrible catch, and I'd like to have a written apology from the studio that produced this movie, along with a few cookies to refund the time I wasted on this mess that I was never get back. If you paid for this movie, I'm really sorry I saw it on TV on a Sunday afternoon when I had nothing better to do, and it pretty much ruined my whole week. A flying freaking WAGON?!?! And that should make up for the terrible mother, who cares more about her own needs than her children? No wonder they do not have the wisdom to tell someone he's beating her, their mother does not teach them, but what she wants comes first and foremost. Absolutely terrible
