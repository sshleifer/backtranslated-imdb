There is something fascinating about disaster films. The simple, original condition can lead to several great stories. Granted, most disaster movies tend to explore familiar terrain, but I can usually live with it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Flood is probably the low point in the history of this subgenre. No doubt, Robert Carlyle is the star of the film, even though the screen time is divided into different locations and characters. He gives a pretty decent performance. Joanne Whalley is also very uneven. Experienced actor Tom Courtenay (he played in Doctor Zhivago for God's sake) is particularly bad. I mean, his timing is mostly over and his characterization is extremely bad. What an embarrassing performance for this man. The rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad, with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig, who I thought might be there as a plotter / eye candy, is by far the most compelling performance. Does not mean much, considering how bad everyone else is, but still nice to see that she took care of it. <br /> <br /> The script is really bad, confusing and clich√©d. Some of the worse lines that I've heard in some time are being delivered by the actors in a row. You have seen this story a thousand times. It uses all the dramatic hooks and tears you've seen in "Outbreak", "Armageddon", the Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many more. <br /> <br /> The direction is terrible. No sense of time, nothing inspires. The recordings are mild, dialogue and action are not flowing. Editing is bad, but how do you work such a mess? No doubt, this movie has relied too much on (rather bad) CGI. The human factor, the drama and the battles of the characters are dubbed. Scenes in which the characters actually have to face the flood are rare and poorly done. The TV feeling gives nausea. Someone should shut down a rope from a helicopter? No problem, let's show him in a helicopter and do a really bad editing job and have the next picture safely on the ground in the most obvious way. <br /> <br /> The film music is rather poor. No timing anywhere. <br /> <br /> The end is probably the worst thing I've seen in a while. Very much as if the ideas ran out of them. Scrap that, you can not go out of your way if you've never had it before. The budget has been used up. <br /> <br /> This is really an amateur job. I give a 2 for using London as a location, which is a nice change, because Gilsig is actually an important supporting role and for the few CGI recordings that were decent (the water that closes off London and the gates) , <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch Day After Tomorrow or just a disaster movie before that. These include older classics like The Towering Inferno.
