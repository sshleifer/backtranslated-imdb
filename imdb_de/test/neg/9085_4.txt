During the eight years of the eighties, when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by any company other than the Cannon group: "The Evil That Men Do," a TriStar Films pickup by Sir Lew Grade, ITC Entertainment. Bronson was already in the midst of his collaboration with director J. Lee Thompson, who went through numerous actors until 1989 Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects. <br /> <br /> Expectations for Bronson and Thompson may be quite high A better funded outfit like ITC, but "The Evil That Man Do" is a big disappointment on many levels. "Evil" is still from the low budget of the B-movie form of the 1980s and offers interesting potential for a great movie. However, everyone in the production department made an easy way out and sold hacking that did not seem to justify Bronson's imprint. "The Evil That Men Do" had a concept and technical tools that could be used to make one of Bronson and Thompson's best films, but will instead be considered one of the most basic of these films. <br /> <br /> This 1984 political thriller / actioner brutally opens with Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), a British doctor who holds his special education for political leaders in Suriname. The gray-haired, passive Molloch is an expert on torture and is used by numerous political regimes. For the first seven minutes, we witnessed Molloch using electric power to inflict unbearable pain on Jorge Hidalgo (Jorge Humberto Robles), a dissident journalist. As you might expect, the scene is awful to see and was cut off from the original VHS release. <br /> <br /> Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), a retired killer who enjoys life in the US Cayman Islands. Holland was approached by the journalist years ago to liberate humanity from Molloch, but rejected the offer. A Mexican professor named Hector Lomelin (José Ferrer) visits shortly after Hidalgo's death to persuade Holland to finish the work and brings videotapes of testimony from the doctor's victims. While Holland initially agrees with the rejection, Holland finally agrees to the dirty work and aims to attack Molloch and his cute sister Claire (Antoinette Bower) in Guatemala. Holland comes to Guatemala City Enríquez with the help of a consultant, Max Ortiz (René); He poses as a tourist with Hidalgo's widow Rhiana (Theresa Saldana) and little daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas) in tow. As with most of Bronson's later appearances, his character knocks Molloch's henchmen one by one, crossing paths with a sloppy American diplomat (John Glover) and his supportive hit man (Roger Cudney). A brutal ending takes place in the columns of an opal mine, in which the doctor is about to receive deserts from several of his victims. <br /> <br /> "The evil men do" is based on a forgotten novel by R. Lance Hill and jumps in the 1980s on American political business in Latin America. In fact, "Evil" is tough in every way, using sensationalism and brutality doses to cover up the great weaknesses of conspiracy and character development. For every plus that this film has, there are three or four minus points that result from studded craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> While 'The Evil That Men Do' has a great concept, the movie is never really more than an excuse for Bronson to eliminate foreign foam. In the style of bad pulp fiction, "Evil" is filled with cardboard figures that we will never get to know or understand. Although Holland is played heavily by Bronson, he never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him to become a murderer. Rhiana, a terribly weak match for Theresa Saldana, is disgusted by Holland for much of the way, but later feels very comfortable with him. Where does her love come from, especially after seeing how Holland killed several people and just wanted to go home a few scenes before? <br /> <br /> The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire, because there are so many questions being asked of them. Of course, we never find out what brought them together so close to where and how their torture began, what Claire's role in their business is exactly. These plotting holes can go on forever, especially with the paint-by-number story seeming to invent things over time. Why is Hidalgo's daughter put in such a dangerous situation, unless she is conveniently taken hostage by Molloch? When Molloch's bodyguard Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques) saw Holland and Rhiana in the cockfighting arena, why is he so kind to them in a bar after the words? Is his memory so short? And what was the purpose of Holland, who dumped Molloch's chauffeur Cillero (Jorge Luke) off a window sill when the murder in Clay's apartment could be handled more discreetly? is decent and somehow Bronson gives one of his strongest performances. The direction of J. Lee Thompson is missing in points, but may be affected by time limitations on the ground. In addition to Evil's shooting in Mexico, ITC's presence is highlighted by better production values, cinematography, and music. Rural areas are well used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of Latin America, and cinematographer Xavier Cruz offers rich colors and clarity. The orchestral score by Ken Thorne ('Murphy's War') refreshes in an era of synthetic garbage. Strangely, these positive effects only contribute to the emergence of a good movie that wants to scream. The adaptation of Peter Lee Thompson is better than usual, but with more laughable continuity mistakes. <br /> <br /> "The Evil Than Men Do" was the perfect Grindhouse material for the early 80's and I can not recommend recommending 21st century action fans The Columbia TriStar Entertainment DVD is a neat presentation and offers widescreen and standard format with four-language subtitles. While the video quality is well above average, 'Evil' was originally recorded in mono. The movie trailer is offered and actually feels like a grindhouse, with eroded color and blurred sound quality. <br /> <br /> ** from 4
