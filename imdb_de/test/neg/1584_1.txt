I'm not surprised to find user comments on this film that are full of nonsensical nonsense, for example, that this film "proves that love will find a way if it is predetermined." I'm not starting to criticize a particular reviewer this way, but because that quote marks the hyperbolic, uncritical bagpipe that was cast on this movie even before it hit the cinemas. Even the best films "prove" nothing and are not intended. The best movies entertain and move the viewer, and "The English Patient" fails on both criteria. <br /> <br /> I remember the promotion of The English Patient: "From the producers of" Amadeus "and" One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, "he proclaimed magnificently, an ignorant or careless listener could miss the crucial word "producers" in this insincere statement and mistakenly associate the misleading director of "The English Patient" with the really great director Milos Forman, a comparison that is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman. <br /> Although the novel by Michael Ondaatje, on which the film is based, is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film was unable to capture any quality of the book in any way apart from plot elements that just seem to be similar Film bears little resemblance to the novel Despite concerns that started when I heard this shamelessly misleading advertising, I went to this movie in the theater As I began to develop, I realized that the novel's peculiar magic had failed to play, that the actors knew their words, but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, boring, and incoherent. The film was a complete travesty of Ondaatje's novel and a fully-fledged cinematic artifact of the worst description. Those who rave about this movie like to talk with adjectives like "sweeping" and "grand" and "hypnotic". Well, that's not one of them. In fact, not even Ondaatje's beautiful novel could be described as "sweeping" or "grandiose." It could be described as "magical" and "hypnotic" - but these are the qualities that the film did not deliver. It's almost as if Minghella as a reader had completely missed what was valuable in the novel and was able to drag out only a pale, skeletal version of celluloid, a version that not only missed the spirit of history, but focused on the subject He produced a cinematic transliteration that not only had no respect for the metaphors of history, but also no recognizable knowledge about them. <br /> <br /> Minghella took the central focus of Hana and Kip and put her on patient and Katherine Clifton missed the narrative track of the novel as well as the "essence" of the novel. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas performed unassailable, uninspiring, unpretentious, emotionless performances that were evidently a great, impelling, passionate love affair with the viewer, but that was only an inexplicable, fleeting connection between Two flat, flat, uninteresting adulterers delivered. Both actors are physically and emotionally inappropriate and unexciting, and both performances gave the viewer the great emotional response that was apparently intended by Minghella's grandiose and exaggerated presentation. <br /> <br /> The "grandiose, sprawling David Lean-like" qualities to which the many indiscriminate reviewers of this stupid movie like to relate are simply nonexistent. The comparison with David Lean ("Dr. Zhivago") is an insult to another great director. Take, for example, the Sandstorm scene of the "patient," which is undoubtedly a scene in which those "big, sprawling" qualities probably (or should have had) their seat: The sandstorm is not great - it is not even convincing. The ensuing burial of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm, which was no doubt intended to dramatically and emotionally affect the viewer, was totally lacking either drama or emotion - in fact, because it was so obviously weak, it had a breeze of comedy about where comedy was was clearly out of place. <br /> <br /> This movie failed. It failed as a rendition of the novel and as a movie. It seems to have been the "anointed Oskar vehicle" of the year (joining such exaggerated cinematic slosh as "Kramer vs. Kramer" or "Terms of Endearment"). One can only thank God that even the hype-driven Acadamy <br /> <br /> had the best feeling of awarding Frances McDormand the Best Actress Award for her truly deserving performance in the truly outstanding movie "Fargo" to lend. There was not a single performance in the hideous "English Patient" that was neither embarrassingly overwhelming (Willem Dafoe) nor truly forgetful, mediocre drama (Fiennes and Scott Thomas). Why not? The identity of a film preserves a circle of fanatical (and clearly tasteless) devotees remains a mystery. Fortunately, the sands of time will permanently bury this mediocrity of a movie, and luckily it will not have the strength to ever dig.
