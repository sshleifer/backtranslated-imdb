With a catchy title like the Butcher of Plainfield, this Ed Gein variation and Kane Hodder playing it will undoubtedly fly off the shelves for a few weeks. Most viewers will be bored with this latest version of Ed Gien's life. <br /> The film focuses on Ed's anger and gives us (a few) insights into his psycosis and flat in Plainfeild. His scenes give the movie a much needed jolt. What ruins This is the constant focus on the lives of other characters and focuses less on Eds.Big errors here. <br /> <br /> Kane Hodder is a weird choice to play Gein, but he does it pretty well and earns more acting credits than he gets these days. Prascilla Barnes and Micahel Barryman also show up. <br /> <br /> 3/10
