This movie was such a mess that I refunded the price to my friends whom I forced to do so. The only reason I wanted to see him was that my friend was an apprentice during the shoot. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie should be Campy, but the approach was so cumbersome self-reflexive proved to be really shallow. Judd Nelson plays a role as a submissive garbage man, who incidentally is a hacking comedian. His life is hell and worsened by his obnoxious and presumptuous companion Bill Paxton (for whom I feel embarrassed - this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor). An unusual accident changes Nelson's career path, causing chaos. <br /> <br /> The attempts of humor were hackneyed, predictable and often groundless and tasteless. Wayne Newton's cast as a talent agent is a novelty, but adds nothing - weird or different. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a very weak and uncreative attempt to awaken the camp humor that acts like a balloon airplane. At least you could laugh at Plan 9 from outer space. Here one wonders only who believed that this was a good idea to finance and film. One of the worst bombs of all time you'll ever experience.
