This is the situation of an emperor's new clothes. Someone has to say, "This is not a funny and original movie (etc, etc.), it's an inferior movie, do not waste your money." The movie is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer waste. They are too realistic only to themselves. They have no lines, they do not act. The American Dream is not about producing poor quality or poor quality and poor quality films. It's about achieving something of quality and therefore success. Only people desperately trying to praise a movie that was not filmed in Hollywood (it could not have been done in Hollywood, could it?) Would try to attribute some kind of quality to this movie. It's worse than "Ed Woods," another film about a filmmaker without standards. These movies should not have been made and you should not see "American Movie".
