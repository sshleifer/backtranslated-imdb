I say one thing for Herman, USA: It will probably always be good for the audience in Minnesota. I can not imagine that there is another place in the world where a reference to Bemidji's quick life or a line like "I knew something was wrong with Iowa boys" would overthrow the house. I really enjoyed the first lesson. Basically, a few lonely country boys take out a personal ad and find their city is filled with willing female applicants (are the applicants a gendered word?). It's not progressive, but it's kind of charming. Too bad the filmmakers felt the need to touch a fictitious subplot about a rousing Golddigger and their violent husband. All in all, it's just too lousy for your own good, but you have to give a movie a few props to give a naked love scene to a man with Kevin Chamberlin's build. I will always find the portrayal of people who do not meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual and caring, but that's not enough to save Herman, USA. Jello Biafra is a nostalgia for a time that has never existed.
