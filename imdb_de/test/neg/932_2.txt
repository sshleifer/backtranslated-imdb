It's like someone has taken a fantasy video game and put it in a blender, and the resulting scene mishmash is what we have to go through. <br /> <br /> Now let me tell you how much I love Chinese fantasy movies. From fun and fool, to martial arts, to the more dramatic and romantic types, it's a genre I really enjoy. Films such as "A Chinese Odyssey: The Pandora's Box" and "A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella" (both written and / or directed by Jeffrey Lau); "The bride with white hair"; "Butterfly & Sword"; "Green Snake"; "A Chinese Ghost Story"; "Swordman II"; "To: Warrior of the Magic Mountain"; "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"; and other. That's why I was looking forward to "A Chinese Tall Story". One of the characters of the film is the "Monkey King" (also known as Sun Wukong), a figure well known in Chinese mythology, first told in the stories of "Journey to the West", the epic adventure that precedes Was written 500 years ago. (The monkey king's story and his students are also in the focus of the "Chinese Odyssey" movies, among many others.) Other familiar characters featured in the film include Zhu Wuneng (the pig character) and Sha Wujing. <br /> < br /> So, how's it all going wrong? Let's take an example known to the Western public, how about the mythology of Robin Hood? A well-known story from the old days, let's say our Robin Hood movie had Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood and Haley Joel Osment as Father Tuck Maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez Let's give Sir Robin an Uzi, too, because you never know when you need to waste the Nottingham Sheriff You may also need Rocket packets, and while we're at it, give them a tactical nuclear weapon, because that might come in handy, if you think that sounds like a really nice retelling of the story of Robin Hood, then "A Chinese Tall Story "the movie for you! As I indicated above, this movie is a mess. In the first 30 minutes, we will not only introduce Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing, but also the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, a "Millennium Bug Dug" (the laser shoots) Beams, an underground God of the Tree, a lizard vaccine strain, an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg, the Lord Chancellor Tortoise, a Sea Dragon King, a constantly changing magical golden staff, a Chatterbox imp girl, wormholes in space and the Four Heavenly Knights. All this would not be so bad - the stories and myths handed down over the years certainly have all sorts of fantastic elements. But I guarantee you that Chinese mythology does not include much of what we are exposed to in the last half of the movie. (Helpful Advice for the Filmmakers: Just because your computer effect guys can come up with cool looking spaceships and depictions of an intergalactic war does not mean they SHOULD). <br /> <br /> You know that your Chinese mythology film is the center of the wrong title, as the director asks (and I do not mind that - it's a direct quote from the commentary) "I asked the composer if we can have rock-and-roll music when it turns into a kind of android-like stuff. "Is there a story somewhere? Yes. Yes there is. Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Tse "Gen-X Cops," "Time and Tide," "My Schoolmate the Barbarian") and Meiyan, the Lizard Imp Girl (played by Charlene Choi and a computer). Choi is the best in this movie. You may know her as half of the Canto-pop group Twins and from other films like The Twins Effect and Just One Look. The poor Choi, a lizard, is barely recognizable with her warts, has scratched out teeth, her doughy nose and has cowered back. That's until the computers reach and beautify them, which makes it somehow worse. Tse is passable, but all supporting actors were miserable. A few recognizable faces in small parts are wasted. <br /> <br /> Once I thought to myself if "A Chinese Tall Story" is a parody. I could almost convince myself that the intergalactic egg-girl (played by a very pretty fan bing-bing) came out and lit a Marlboro (!) Kindling while talking to Tripitaka, who practiced martial arts dressed in a spider man costume (!! ). But it is not a parody. Of course, there is the typical Hong Kong stupidity, but the movie takes itself seriously enough, with enough scenes of romance and pathos (with a sleigh of violins and evocative cellos) and rousing action and adventure games. <br /> <br /> You may think that you could see this at a Netflix rental and it would cost you nothing. (Oh, but it costs you all right). <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say? For sure. The colors are alive (they are the best thing about this movie). And the filmmakers certainly worked hard. Too bad that all these efforts went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game.
