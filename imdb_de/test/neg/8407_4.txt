Um ... okay, that's very bad indeed when compared to the first movie, the critically acclaimed Rosemary's Baby. In fact, it's a pretty bad movie in general. Yes, there are some redeeming qualities, but I'll come to that later. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been a while since the last movie was played ... actually it was quite a bit I think eight years. Rosemary is still trying to escape with her child and influence him in a good way rather than letting him succumb to the evil future that the coven (or "tribe" as he is called here) has laid for him. As she runs away with him picking up an empty bus, picking her up and leaving her child behind with a hooker, the hooker raises him until he is of legal age, where Satan tries to possess him, for he has his evil heritage in every moment refuses way. <br /> <br /> Obviously things are not going as planned and then there is the end that I would have been really ashamed of if I had not seen it since I heard it was a sequel to "Rosemary's" gave baby! "Okay, when I was about eleven years old, I witnessed the masterpiece of Rosemary's Baby and then read the continuation of the book, thinking that this film is an adaptation of it, I tracked down this film and understood it. I was a true fan of this "franchise" and I can say that I saw the sequel and I have an idea of ​​what happens after the events in the first film ( which speaks of both.) this movie AND "Son of Rosemary", Ira Levin's own book that is not yet adapted to the movie. <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon, who starred in the first movie Minnie, is in this Movie shown a few times but why - oh why is the coven so and so ers? The knife Rosemary dropped in the first movie is out of the ground, but Minnie pulled it out! The coven is now called Stamm (as I said). They go now in hooded capsules and shout "Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ... Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ..." and so on and so forth. The gothic building is now like a two-story house on a meadow in the middle of nowhere, it looks like a little beautiful suburban house or something! And the kid himself looks pretty normal, his eyes only become "foolish" when he gets mad and kills someone or something in vain. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, it is quite poor in all areas except Stephen McHattie, who plays a very adult Adrian. Pattie Duke Astin, who replaces Mia Farrow as Rosemary, must have one of the best WORST appearances ever filmed! It's so bad that it's almost not funny ... when you say "OH MY GOD!" and yelling after the fifteenth time in the movie, you're like "Okay, it's not funny anymore," and then, when she's gone and the movie has only been running for twenty minutes, you're like THANK YOU, I DO NOT HAVE TO HEAR IT , SAY "OH MY GOD" EVERY LONGER !! SHEESH! In the end, this film has very, very few redeeming qualities, enough to get at least four stars. However, if you think of it as a serious continuation of the first movie, it is pretty much nonexistent.
