Holy crap, the beginning started where the first one stopped (good start). Then it goes downhill from there. You looked like you were watching TV, and you're constantly switching between that teenage soap opera, a Predator movie, and a crappy detective show. The characters featured in the first ten minutes have nothing to do before the last 45 minutes (the characters of the teen soap opera and the actual alien story). <br /> <br /> In the end, the producers quickly ran out of money and decided to end the movie, so they decided to leave the city in the air. <br /> <br /> PS: What's the crap? You can not say what's going on? Seriously, filmmakers do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight.
