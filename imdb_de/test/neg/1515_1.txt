Yeah, that must be one of the lameest movies I've ever seen. It's absolutely tasteless, has no style at all, the story is so thin that you can watch TV through it, and the whole movie has so many holes you could drive through an oil tanker. Sure, I appreciate a good B-movie as well as most male white homo sapiens. But that must be the worst thing I've ever seen. In fact, it's so good that it lacks everything that makes a B-movie interesting. <br /> <br /> The entire film is based on enchanting artifacts such as the characters that beat each other, different body functions and the total lack of reason on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny. On the contrary. I sometimes found it boring because of its extreme predictability. <br /> <br /> I think nothing good about this movie. It was a waste of time to watch it, and I hope others will not make the same mistake. If you pay for it, you should have a serious brain test done.
