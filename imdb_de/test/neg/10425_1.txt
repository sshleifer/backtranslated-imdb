"Wired" would have to be rated as one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. The lyrics and direction show an amazing lack of imagination and I'm sure most actors still scare when someone mentions this movie as an accurate portrayal of his short life. <br /> <br /> A mindless mess without redemptive features.
