What a shocker. For a start I could not stand the constant screaming and the loud panic. It did not make me anxious, appalled or sympathetic to the characters; it was just annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The plot was just like any other cheap horror. There were a few pathetic attempts to give some depth to the characters, but that did not really help the rest of the story. And then there is the end. I'm still not sure what to think about it. I suppose it should be a clever twist, then put some light into the situation, but it was just stupid. <br /> <br /> The case had some of these small award winners / nomination symbols, so I thought it might not be that bad. I was wrong. If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.
