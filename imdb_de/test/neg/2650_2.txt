To quote a review of the film, "it began slowly and stopped." The plot was credible enough (although some of the character's actions seemed very, very random), the script was pretty well written (since the dialogue did not seem forced), but everything went way too slow. There were too many breaks between the lines, and the way the lines were delivered was not great. This movie had potential, but it blew like a teenager turning to drugs. My advice? Wait until it appears on TV before you see it.
