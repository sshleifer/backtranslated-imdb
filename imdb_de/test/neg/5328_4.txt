I know that I loved this movie when I was 12-14 years old. Now that I'm 24 years old, I've looked at it again and I wish I had not. Because all the things I laughed about when I was younger are not funny anymore. So that's one and a half hours without fun. For me, the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish. So the same thing I loved about the movie as a kid is what I do not like about this movie. Besides being funny, it's not believable at all. The evil character is very poorly made, but I think that's the kind of movie it is. And the last 20 minutes of the movie are pretty lame with bad fighting sequences and so on. But when you are young, you will probably love it. I rate this movie as 4/10
