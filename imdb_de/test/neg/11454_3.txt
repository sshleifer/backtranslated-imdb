Like many early-sounding films, Cimarron must be viewed for historical interest rather than persuasive entertainment. The Hammy drama by Richard Dix, who was nominated for Best Actor, can be excused as a relic of the silent drama school. But Cimarron is also a dubious drama - a bloated film that moves from a non-contiguous sequence to a non-contiguous sequence with little dramatic impact. Officially, the film is two hours and four minutes; It feels like four hours when you see it. There's no need to waste your time on it, unless you want to see every winner of the best picture, or have a great interest in the early days of sound. In my opinion, Cimarron is the worst choice for the best picture in Academy history, and the award should have gone to City Lights or Little Ceasar. Cimarron is hardly remembered today, and would have been remembered without an Oscar victory.
