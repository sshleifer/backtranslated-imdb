I was recently in a stage version of this piece. And on the last day of the run, I was excited to see that it was on TV. I plugged in a tape as it was late at night and I looked at it the next day. I have to say, I was very disappointed. The actors of the film have made few discoveries that are in the script. That's understandable, since the resersal process is probably different, but it was annoying to see. Much of the original script was also changed for the movie to make it better for the screen, but I'm not sure if the movie ever helped. I only gave these 4 stars because I know the script and writing is much better than what this movie is about.
