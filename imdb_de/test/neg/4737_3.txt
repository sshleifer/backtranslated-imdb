Anyone who has seen "Alien vs Predator" must have known that the conventions of the "Alien Quadrilogy" were not exactly suitable for the film. Unusual elements included the aliens' rapid growth over minutes, aliens with extremely long tails and so on. The idea that the Predator species kick-start city and temple construction to hunt would be that warriors sounded so appealing that I could not resist. Do not be the impetus for this sequel, and unfortunately I have I was wrong. For those who had forgotten how the first movie ended, the dead Predator had burst an alien through the chest, bearing the traits of both species. For this movie I'll just go through a movie list of "good" and "bad" properties. <br /> <br /> The Good: Many great people, especially the men. <br /> <br /> The Bad: Many great people are eaten by both the mutant Predator / Alien and the Predator. <br /> <br /> The Good: An interesting idea of ​​the Predator planet. <br /> <br /> The Bad: An inconsistent scale of a city. It is a small town without many possibilities, but with a very sophisticated (that is: big city) sewer system and homeless people. Is it a small city or a city? The police consists of a sheriff and three deputies, so I counted. <br /> <br /> The Good: Um ... <br /> <br /> The Evil: Why are these mutated aliens / predators growing? so fast? In five minutes they seem to have reached their full size. I mean, come on ... what are these things ... Chia Pet Aliens ??? And while we're dealing with this topic, why does not an alien mutate in the body of a predator, but an alien does not mutate in a human body? Does this make sense? <br /> <br /> The Good: To think ... <br /> <br /> The Bad: Why would only a Predator come? And why does it pour acid over all the remains of the "aliens," but it decides to murder a cute MP, then skin it and turn it upside down. I mean so much for Incognito! <br /> <br /> The Good: Ah ... I'm stuck. I think there are many loud noises! <br /> <br /> The Bad: How are these mutated alien / predators developing? Apparently they find a pregnant woman and put in a kiss-like motion several children in the body of the woman. Yes, exactly what you would like to see, right? Pregnant women whose bodies explode into mutated aliens - as if the previous path was not coarse enough !!!. I mean, there is not even an alien queen. <br /> <br /> The Good: Did I say that the guys in this movie are beautiful? <br /> <br /> The Bad: When a nuclear device blows up buildings, how can a helicopter survive the explosion? And how sticky it is for one of the passengers to sneer at the pilots: "I told you not to crash!" I mean, given the nuclear case, when he wakes up in the morning, he has no hair! Mutated Alien / Predator breaks through Dead Predator's body, grows over a few minutes, kills all Predators, and can crash on Earth. More mutant alien / predators are created as UNIQUE Predator comes to Earth to destroy this new mutated species. Predator kills people. Mutant Alien / Predators kill people. People kill people. It's a shit to be human in this movie, right? <br /> <br /> If you are impressed by a lot of pangs and bumps, you will love this movie First, I suggest you skip this sequel.
