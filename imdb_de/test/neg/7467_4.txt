Not a terrible movie - my 10 year old boy loved it, and he would be the target audience, so I think they are just right. Pretty boring for an adult. <br /> <br /> It's hard to refer to animated Lego characters, even fashionable high-tech characters. <br /> <br /> I thought to choose the three great virtues of the Bionicle The world was a bit strange - unity, duty and destiny. Am I the only one who thinks that sounds just a bit fascist? Especially the fate. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.? <br /> <br /> Well, it will sell Lego. Slightly boring for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute commercial. Could be a lot worse
