Seriously, I thought it was a parody when I saw it in the rental business, but I realized it was just crap. I can not believe I did not turn it off, as if we all know that these snakes are not rattlers, but pythons and gardners, the acting was lame, and I still can not believe the end is one When you see it, the end is just to see it. It was really priceless much better than the sixth sense. I do not even know if the creators of the movie are real. I thought this title would fly, the only time he'll actually fly is if I put him in the bin ... just see if he laughs , It was hilarious in the stupidest way. DO NOT BUY JUST RENT.
