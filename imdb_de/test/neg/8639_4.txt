Theresa Russell once made some decent movies, and I still hope that one of her efforts over the last ten years will score at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). However, DARK WORLD is only the latest in a series of disappointments. The first 90 minutes are very hard to see. The lines are delivered by the lead actors as if they were read at a first rehearsal or even at a casting session (where the actors do this for their agents, but they do not really want to read the parts they are perfectly suited for ). The sets and props are somehow "off" (what kind of police department would allow a detective to organize a whole living room wall with file owners?). The screen is constantly dotted with meaningless time and data lines that appear without rhyme or reason. If the scriptwriter were to stand here after the lights came out of a Filmfest show, they would undoubtedly learn how all these inadequacies really are really clever pointers to the breather in the last five minutes of this dropout. Well, for those viewers who only have movie experiences on TV: THE MOVIE and SURFER, DUDE; They could be bamboozled so they nod in agreement. However, it is hard to believe that EVERYONE who has seen 10 or more movies in his life and is not a close friend or relative of a DARK WORLD cast or crew member could fall for such a lame fool. Despite what the d.v.d. Box might make you believe this film is about as similar to SUNSET BOULEVARD (dead teller) or Hitchcock (schizophrenic protagonist device) as a drained Jim Beam bottle filled up with urine!
