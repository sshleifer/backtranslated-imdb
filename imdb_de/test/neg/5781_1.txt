Fear of anyone who likes this movie. They probably breathed too many color chips as a child. It's so terrible that I refuse to relive a conspiracy. Oh yes, there was no one! This film is a true definition of what Hollywood creates for people who do not want to think in the theater. Will the bad guys win? Will the good guys win? Who cares!
