The films of Shirley Temple for Twentieth Century Fox are not negligible, since they are made bad (after all, Darryl F. Zanuck has supervised most of them); They are not "classic" among movie enthusiasts, especially because they are burdened with the syrup-like optimism of Hollywood's depression. The audience in the 1930s was appeased by the joy of seeing a dull, often-orphaned sun-girl, who looked stupid to the adults (they got angry and clasped hands as she danced their problems away). Many years later, Temple's vehicles are barely making history (always backed up by musical sequences to reinforce content), and their timing (always too perfect) and exaggerated responses can overwhelm most modern audiences. Nobody could possibly be blamed for their desperation about the performance of Temple (screaming lines at the top of their lungs) or for the perversity of their dance steps, which was conducted with a lot of sailors to "At the Codfish Ball". Nevertheless, the fantasy aspect of this particular story, previously filmed in 1924 from Laura E. Richard's book, is enough to captivate her with the right saccharine spirit. It looks like Shirl was pulled out of a shipwreck by a government-appointed lighthouse keeper, but when a state-level officer finds Tyke out of school, she threatens to take the boy. It does not really matter if the modest officer has a point that Temple is not properly educated (the woman is almost instantly turned into proverbial villainy); You can see right away that Temple can assert herself and take care of herself and her elderly guardian in the deal (as well as the local widow who works for the captain). Temple is not the only one who rehearses too much. Guy Kibbee's January is wide-eyed, so you often wonder if he could not film them all in one day. The dialogue is full of metaphors on the water ("You can not bring down trout!" ... "Well, do not dump the ship!), And something about the whole company seems strangely pixilated. *
