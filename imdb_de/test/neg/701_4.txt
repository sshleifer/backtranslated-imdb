"Riders of Destiny" was the first of several Westerns that Wayne had produced for the Lone Star arm of Monogram Pictures between 1933 and 1935. In this entry, the producers try to make the duke a singing cowboy by the name of "Singin 'Sandy Saunders" with witty results Every Wayne fan knows that the duke could not have had a tune if his life depended on it , His voice was apparently dubbed by Smith Ballew, whose deep baritone does not sound like Wayne. Wayne looks awkward when he "plays" the musical numbers, thanks, the singing cowboy experiment soon ended. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie itself is concerned, it includes a Western Standard Plan "B" for the fight for water rights between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the indigenous rancher: Duke of course plays the hero, he had his character on the Canvas not yet developed and still looked like a cowboy out of poverty. <br /> <br /> Also featured in the film was George (before Gabby) Hayes the heroine's hero Cecilia Parker as heroine and Yakima Canutt as "one of the guys" playing his "stunt of the race horses under the wagon" while doubling Wayne. Both Canutt and Hayes would appear in most of the other posts in the series with Wayne. In particular, Canutt would have a profound impact on Wayne's future development, including teaching him how to move, fight and look good on a horse. <br /> <br /> Since "B" -western do this, this is not the case. pity, but I have to rate it because of the "singing" bad.
