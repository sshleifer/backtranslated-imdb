It's Valentine's Day and we decided to stay there, have a good dinner and watch this movie on TCM instead of going out. We're in our 40s - 50s, love romance and both are "softies", but this movie bombarded us (it's hard to imagine that he was nominated for an Oscar, but I think that was then). The cinematography was beautiful, but the movie as a whole is terribly outdated. Jennifer Jones' character has given so many clues to her as Eurasion that we started counting and after a while we giggled every time she said it. Add to that the "theme song", which was played throughout the movie, and we could not wait until it was over so we could watch the evening news.
