Tycus is one of the worst movies I see directly for video. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this product does not appear in the cinema. I do not understand why in this movie the great Dennis Hopper and bad screen appear without meaning. My alternative: Armaggedon or Twister. SENTENCE FOR TYCUS: Do not look at this movie.
