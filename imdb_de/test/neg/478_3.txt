I'm 35. Bruce was the guy in Evil Dead and I still like to watch ED1 and ED2. It was also cool to see him as king in Bubba Ho Tep two or three years ago, showing versatility and great acting talent. But this screaming brain adventure is certainly not for Bruce's early fans. Either I'm getting too old for this SH17, or I just do not belong to Bruce's target group anymore. I am positive, children between 9 and 13 will love this movie. But this overlong matinee sci-fi comedy contains about 5 minutes of interesting moments, and the rest is cheaper kid's slapstick humor. Campbell had better talk to Sam Raimi and scream their brains together for one last Evil Dead reunion photo to arouse my interest. At least there would be a good director behind the camera ... I'm sorry, Bruce. Take care of.
