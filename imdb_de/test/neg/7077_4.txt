STAR REVIEW: ***** Unavoidable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You could go out for a meal instead. * Avoid at All Costs <br /> <br /> The Story of Titular Adam (Mark (Halloran) and Paul (Tom Murphy), two heroin addicts in the Dublin slums who romp daily in their mindless lives to move on to the next On the way, they try and reconcile themselves with close families and friends who have come down and destroyed them over the years.I know many Irish people who like to drink, but it seems to have some they have I also have problems with heroin, including the appearance of this film, I know there is a drug problem there, as is the case in many parts of the world, and another humorous attitude on the subject is not entirely unexpected. <br /> <br /> Me not I remember the last Irish movie I saw (the movie was shot in a style that makes it stand out from any movie I've seen lately!) And judging that , b in me, obviously not as familiar with her humor as i could. The movie is pretty funny in some places, but it's obviously another comedy that's not afraid to bring laughs up close. The scene of depriving the mentally handicapped boy behind a lane is certainly the same as what some junkies might do to feed their habits, but it's still extremely despicable, and I'm not sure it's darker Whatever humor was meant, but it certainly did not bring a smile to my face! It is also a stark contrast to their previous actions, where they are seen as their soft side sways a baby back and forth. In view of this, some may find the end sad, others may only consider it as desserts. <br /> <br /> Overall, I just did not see the meaning of the movie. I have not seen any motivation in the "story" that told it. It just seems to work without involving the audience in any way. Unlike Trainspotting (which dealt with similar topics!), For the most part it was an unsuccessful effort, and I was about to nod in spite of the very short 83 minute run. Really not more enjoyable than two real junkies to spend a day. **
