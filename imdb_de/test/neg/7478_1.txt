When I was in between jobs for a while, I was in the habit of watching the evening talk shows. For a while I had a good selection: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel ... <br /> <br /> Until I reached the time window at 1:30. The time between Conan and X-Files on SciFi. And the only show that took place at that time was (and strangely still is) Carson Daly. <br /> <br /> His show fascinated me first. Younger, casually dressed and with the hips of an MTV host, I thought Carson would bring a later aesthetic. I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> He has no comedy timing. His jokes are just not funny, and his monologue is a painful matter of self-confident chatterbox. I began to believe that he was simply unable to deliver a comedy (and I'm right, he does not have one), but it became apparent over time that the series' writers must have chosen it for him. The writing was idiotic and too far-reaching and the skits screamed badly. And at the end of the show in the studio, the authors had Carson drink alcohol on set with excitement on every show, a forgetful Carson grinning from emaciated cheek to emaciated cheek as he sloshed through interviews. No interview skills. None. He tries to be friendly / talkative, but is in the end bob and rude. He talks too much. He cuts off his guests. He asks them rude or embarrassing questions - if he even finds a question. And as someone had pointed out, the guests literally stare at him or squirm on their seats, obviously uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Now the show has left the studio and looks like it was taken with a handy camera. Carson refuses to take the hint from NBC anyway. Once Carson did not even get a cameraman, he had to film himself for an episode! Wake up, Carson ... this handwriting is everywhere on the wall. <br /> <br /> I see the show is being produced by Carson. I can only imagine that it is the reason that he is still in the air, he is paying for it himself.
