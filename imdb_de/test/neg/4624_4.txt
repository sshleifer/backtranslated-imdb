The film started with some promises: big name lineup, good-looking sets, but then he fell apart. <br /> <br /> Mostly he can not say if it's a serious movie or a comedy. In a minute they talk about the fact that there is no joy in killing, and in the next there is a fight scene with funny music and funny banter. Some of the acting is pretty bad, mainly by Patrick Swayze and Piper Perabo. She also gets a few moaning lines like, "When I marry, it's about love." <br /> <br /> But the worst part about this movie is that it's just boring. Not enough action, not enough humor, not enough action, not really much. Just a lot of clich√©s and cheesy moments. <br /> <br /> Also, a movie with "dragon" in the title should contain a lot more dragons than the few (and pathetic CGI dragons) that appeared in this movie. <br /> Can the SciFi channel * show no * good movies?
