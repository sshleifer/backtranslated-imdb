After a meteorite lands in "Boston" (actually somewhere on the Isle of Man), a heinous alien monster is released, which starts at a girl's school, causing chaos and turns the students into zombie-like creatures. This movie is apparently a loose (and I stress casual) remake of the eponymous movie from 1986, as it has the same monster but a different storyline. Both films are terrible, but to honor the 1986 version, she was seen. This is not the beginning of all the problems - the acting, especially of the main professor, was very, very bad. This movie is supposed to be in Boston (we know that because the filmmakers had the ingenious idea of ​​basing "Boston Police" or "Boston Gas Company" on everything), but everyone seems to have messed up British accents I did not try Boston To use accents, thank goodness). The script is a big messy mess. The best example of how stupid the writing is when it is determined that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by removing a necklace with a piece of meteorite. Are our brave heroes doing that? No, they run around the zombie students instead. Kind. Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote / directed the faint 1995 monster movie Grim, does not know how to work with his films. The film is terribly boring in some places. The lighting is terrible. The film looks cheap and bland. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of remarkable blood. In 99% of the death scenes, the creature emerges from a dark corner and drags someone away, while we hear them screaming "horrified" in the distance. This convention has never worked well in the past and certainly does not work here. The visual effects were AWFUL. The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created for the sake of heaven in Microsoft Slideshow! The "explosion" of gas storage at the end was just as terrible. Okay, I like to think of myself as a fair critic, so I'll state where the credit is due - the creature effects were actually pretty cool. I have to love those closeups of slimy, drooling teeth! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "Breeders" is a horrible, cheap horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1,5 / 10.
