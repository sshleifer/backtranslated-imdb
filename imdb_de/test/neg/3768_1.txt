There is a sentence by experimental filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky, who says some films are structured like a camera mounted on a dog's head going down an alley, tracking everything in the movie. The structure is "Kurosawa began as a baby, then became a child, then a young man, then a film director, then he started making" masterpieces ", then he became old, The End." The word "masterpiece" is often used in this film to describe Kurosawa's output without explaining * what * makes his films so good / great. Just because the off-screen speaker who reads a script says that a movie is a masterpiece, should we kiss his epilogue and accept that a particular film is one of the great works of art of the 20th century? And one more point. The voice of Paul Scofield is used as the voice of Kurosawa when extracts from the director's memoirs are read off the screen. He brings pear-shaped Shakespearean sounds into the text ... but why? If you were to make a documentary about Billie Holiday, would you use Dame Judi Densch as her voice?
