It is terrible! It's like someone gave a broken video camera and $ 30 to a kid and told him to make a movie. Even then you would get a better and more professional movie. The story is so stupid that you can say there are none. I do not think the guy who made it even knew what to do - watching foreign art films all day long is not enough to make someone an instant director. Acting is very bad, really kindergarten-level and writing is just awful. The only scene I did not hate was the one with the caravan accident, but even that just means it was a little less dreadful than the rest of the movie. How do people get money for this stuff? I do not care about alternative films, but should not they at least be a big, steaming cow dung pile? I would call 'Price of Milk' amateurish if it were not an offense for amateurs. This would not even be a good movie when you are drunk or drugged!
