Impressive! I just do not know where to start, what made this movie so awful. Perhaps I should first say that during a "heated confrontation" between the antagonist and the protagonist, I had to leave the theater because I laughed so much. Yes. Acting was really so bad. Acting, however, was not the worst part. The plot was almost completely shown in the previews. The characters are all underdeveloped. The dialogue and the "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. The villain is a caricature of a runaway, drunken power, sadist. <br /> <br /> But the actors are pretty.
