This is undoubtedly the most annoying and frustrating game I have ever encountered. Every time you turn around, the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can not go through. The cutscenes give you control over your character's movements, but only to a limited extent. In addition, you must play the game for about 2 hours to get past the intro / tutorials. It is terrible! I'm afraid if I play this game even more, I'll break something in the end. This game is shit. The graphics are good, but nothing special, but the gameplay is terrible. To say I hate this game would be a huge understatement. I got it for sale, but I want to get my $ 20 back. What a waste!
