Few films have disappointed expectations and annoyed me as much as Fire. The movie is presumptuous garbage. At the artistic level, it does not achieve anything. The only thing he got is a ban in India. If only because of the poor quality of the filmmaking and not because of the current controversy, the ban would have been more legitimate. <br /> <br /> Now that I've solved my plight from my system, I'm more able to analyze the movie: <br /> <br /> * From the beginning, the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start talking in English. Of course the director did not make the film for an Indian audience; However, it underestimated its international audience by simplifying it too much. It is too unreal to entertain the character of the maid in perfect English. <br /> <br /> * Next, get regular insights into Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They come as staggering and obstruct the flow of the movie. I still wonder how this philosophical dialogue is related to history. I had the feeling that surrealism was lost. <br /> <br /> * The love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for the audience rather than being a strong statement. In any case, they will not reach either. <br /> <br /> * The names of the women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and were therefore chosen to shock the audience. However, since the film was not primarily intended for the Indian audience, the shock-by-name selection should not reach its destination, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the direction is very poor and some important and sensitive scenes have been treated badly. A better director could have made the subject a strong emotional drama. <br /> <br /> * The acting felt wooden, although Nandita Das brought some life to the role, the others were wasted. I've always thought that Shabana Azmi is a good actress, but her talent is not apparent in this movie. The male leads were downright garbage. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the earth and want to see more director, stay away from it. You're welcome.
