What a boring movie. While it had fun parts, it was just boring and boring (for a 90-minute movie). I think the cause was a lack of action. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I expected white blood cells to fight the evil viruses, but no such luck. It was more that the virus was thwarted than defeated. <br /> <br /> The movie had promises, but since it was meant for small children, it did not fulfill its potential in my opinion.
