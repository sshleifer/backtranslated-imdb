The movie was a pleasure if you are a fan of Stooges. The story is told from the point of view of Moe Howard and his relationships with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, as well as his lifelong friendship with Larry Fine. The film mainly deals with the camera-related climaxes and the pitfall of Stooges' more than ten-year career. The casting director and make-up artist have found in the right way actors who resemble the famous ensemble. The actor, who plays "Curly" Howard, has modeled the pre-camera camera of the most popular Stooge. A must for every fan of Three Stooges Shorts.
