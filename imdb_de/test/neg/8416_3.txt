This is a stupid parody of private eye thrillers as a writer (Michael Cain) is asked to "Ghostwrite" an autobiography of a colorful, dwindling Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). Sometimes stupidity becomes disgusting. This is not Kain at his best. Rooney is far surpassed. Notable support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and the pretty Nadia Cassini. Not easy to see.
