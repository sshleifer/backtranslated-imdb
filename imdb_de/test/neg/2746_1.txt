I love basketball and that seemed like a fascinating movie. However, in the first ten minutes of the movie, I knew it would be miserable. It was played badly and way too slow. It was also very, very racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and homophobic. Sometimes the introduction of racial, ethnic and other types of insults has a meaning that illustrates the existing bigotry. There was no sense in that movie of terrible bigotry, and no one learned from what was said. Part of the problem is that it's an adaptation of a play and a remake of a movie from 1982 that dealt with a basketball team from the fifties. If this movie took place earlier, it would have been a bit more meaningful. It was not good for the modern age and the writing was terrible. I do not know how the piece was originally written, but I can not believe that a movie is as bad and hateful as this movie did in 1999 for television and video. It was disgusting. Do not waste your precious time with this.
