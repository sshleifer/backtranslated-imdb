Let's start with the fact that there are three types of horror films: good, bad and extremely embarrassing, that make the whole genre suffer in every way. Dark Harvest promises great success with his Artisan DVD cover, but rest assured that the show ends here. After a grueling opening montage, we quickly realize that the film consists of a very poorly written script that is extremely poorly qualified (even for a beginner's film), acting, catastrophic lighting, and even worse special effects. Seriously, no one could afford more than a mask for the bad guy, or did they just think it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, so is it good enough for us? Well, it did not work at all to create an eerie villain. In any case, this is one of those movies where you control your watch, sigh, and curse your own credulity. The timing in each scene is painful, and the entire production has a sense of middle school (if you think about it, I've seen better middle-level productions, right down to the special effects). I'm trying to find a way to end this review positively. Let me suggest that all copies of this train be donated as coasters, frisbees, wind chimes ... I would say "see yourself," but that would be just cruel. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the remaining reviews from this production company and you'll find the same for each of their films. They claim to uphold the contract between the film and the audience (ie, please the fans), but all they've done is giggle and throw a load on our heads to get the money (of that I'm sure they did not see much for that). <br /> <br /> Sorry folks, the high ratings and cheap reviews are obviously being posted by those who are directly or indirectly linked to this travesty. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars, as this is the lowest possible rating. There is even one who annoys me.
