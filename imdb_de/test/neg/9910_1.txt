This movie must be the worst I have ever seen. There is a reason why it was made to be a MOW (Movie of the Week). The continuity was completely wrong (palm trees in Chicago, although filmed in Toronto, Canada), the effects left much to be desired for 2004. HELLO. Lord of the Rings had better CGI than that. But I think they also had the money for it. The budget will certainly affect the outcome, but those who call this MOW more than two must return to the film and television school. Next time, remember that diligence and time will not make a classic rush for a tornado cash register or TV smash hit. <br /> <br /> Also, I know that networks can reuse footage from old networks or partners, but use 80s footage for 2004. It's hard for me to buy that.
