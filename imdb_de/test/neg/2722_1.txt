I am disgusted and appalled by the positive reviews this film receives. It's not just hokey, manipulative and melodramatic. It is also shamelessly offensive. The character of Radio `Gooding Jr. 'is presented as a cute little stuff, like a puppy that is so cute that you just want to take it home with you. 'This mentality is shameless; Radio is never treated as a human being, but as a manipulative means to draw sympathy from its audience. Even more cruel are the numerous moments of the film in which radio is struck in the head / tripping / falling / etc. These moments of slapstick comedy let the audience howl with laughter just because it is "weird because radio has been left behind." That's shameless. However, this seems to be the attitude that the film takes: "Radio has been left behind, but that's okay, because it's cute and we like it." Gooding's portrayal seems to be better suited for John Waters film than an inspiring family drama. To make the injury worse, the film is incompetent at every level. Debra Winger is in the role of "stereotypical housewives" who laugh at the memory of their vile monologues' insight into all who see the movie. The score of John Horner is a pure juice, which always overlays the tired cinematography with a crack. Ed Harris is decent in a role he could have slept through, but manages to get the audience's attention throughout the movie. In conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent person, ignore this travesty of a movie, read the book, but otherwise leave out this terrible movie about an interesting character from American history.
