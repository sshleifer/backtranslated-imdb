Largely an unforgettable story in which the mercenary Kerman and his employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren's missing sister. Despite its connection to the cannibal film family, this film is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardona's "Guyana Crime of the Century." Clearly Lenzi aims to take advantage of the (then) current Jonestown massacre by portraying a rogue, self-righteous fanatic with a penchant for bigamy and just a touch of megalomania (played with reckless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) who captivates his moving crew even leads to oblivion. Kerman & Agren try to stop the rotting, but after several coup attempts, they flee to the Green Inferno to surprise the locals and their notorious appetite. <br /> <br /> One of the many excessive Gore festivals that came out in the late '70s / early' 80s, and every new signer seemed to be contesting a one-upmanship contest with his predecessor, trying the bloodiest and most most graphical display ever used for feature films. In this inferior series, all the other's motives and gimmicks are used, but with much less success. <br /> <br /> Were it the so-called "Amazonian Aborigines" who looked like the Bollywood Committee (this movie was shot on location)? in Sri Lanka) or the inappropriate scenes of "decapitation" and "castration" that seriously diminished the authenticity that became apparent in the "cannibal holocaust"? You can decide. Without destroying the conclusion, it seemed as if Lenzi put more emphasis on his shock and awe-inspiring climax than the basic requirement for a coherent ending where all loose ends are resolved. Most unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> As with the others, where the scale of the graphic portrayal of violence against humans is (fortunately) limited, filmmakers have spared no extremes to inflict the worst cruelty on unfortunate animals in their country most sadistic shocks. Unfortunately, the only thing that's shocking about this film is the fact that it's mentioned by, among others, those who deal with the topic more convincingly. <br /> <br /> If there are any redeemable features, Kerman is a likeable, if somewhat dimensional, guide, and his crush of scant-clad co-stars (Agren, Lai and Senatore) provide a visual relief from the relentless killings.
