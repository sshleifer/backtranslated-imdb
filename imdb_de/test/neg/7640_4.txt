The summary of this film made me believe that this is a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society she lives with. I like strong female characters and expected a movie similar to "Chocolat" with less fairy tales and more bite. What I got was a cast of despicable characters. <br /> <br /> For a character-driven movie to be effective, I need to feel a connection or compassion for the people. There was nobody I could relate to in the film. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in "Rain Man") portrays a mentally ill, probably bipolar, woman who is often rude, aggressive and violent. Her husband squeals and cries when he does not hit or punch someone. The kids are rude brats. They are screaming at each other and the women in the movie. They attack other children without provocation. Violence generates violence. This seems to be an island full of emotions, aggressive, violent and rude people. <br /> <br /> The direction is not mandatory. There are mixed scenes that try to be art, but instead bore the viewer. The situation is exceptionally great, but even that is not captured to the extent that it could be on film. <br /> <br /> I would recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie.
