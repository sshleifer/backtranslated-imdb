Lina McLaidlaw is a beaming, lonely young woman who unexpectedly falls in love with Johnnie Aysgarth, a highly qualified bachelor with a propensity to lose money. They marry, but almost instantly Lina is exposed to Johnny's addiction to lies, gambling and debt. Despite his shortcomings, she can not resist his charming nature until she suspects he might have murderous thoughts about her ... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, well done, attractive cast, a good script and maybe the worst end of movie history. Okay, that may go too far, but not much. Many films change the ending of a book (Great Expectations, The Shining, etc.), but the last two scenes of this film are not only lame, but make the entire previous plot completely meaningless. The story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and his moral deficiency - and what she knows about him - to kill her. It was meant to end (as in Francis Ile's / Anthony Berkeley's book Before The Fact) when he tried to assassinate her. The reason is not that the studio forced Hitch to re-shoot the end, one of the first examples of the blasphemous process of the Preview Audience test. Hitch was crazy and did as he was told (this was only his third movie in Hollywood), knowing that sooner or later he would get creative control of his films, as his fifties masterpieces prove. But that still leaves us with a turkey ending. This is a pity, because it is really a very good movie with a fascinating theme - does anyone really know his husband or wife so well? The script is excellent, with many unconventional moments (like when Lina's dad dies and Johnnie thinks she's crying about it), a critically acclaimed performance by Grant (who never played a villain again), and all the photography of famous glass milk shot. Fontaine won an Oscar for the performance, though I personally prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier role as victim to women in Rebecca. I would like to rate this movie higher, but I really can not forgive this end. This is what happens when films are made for money and not for love. I think that's the actual theme of the movie. Quickly search for Hitchcock's cameo as a man writing a letter.
