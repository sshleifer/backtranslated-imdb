I feel that many people liked this movie (not all, but many) because they do not want to admit that they do not understand it. People with medium intelligence, if you like, pretending to be so avant-garde and trendy that Lynch is a genius. Lynch is like Tarantino to me. They are both great, but no one is the Messiah, as many fanboys believe. No director can change the world, so relax. And both sometimes make absorbing films, that just happens. Everyone has a bad day. And since this movie was initially designed as a pilot and then wrapped in a movie, it was not made with all the passion, and you could not imagine being stuck in a movie. Imagine, a large part of the film is indescribable and incomprehensible. We can make all the difference, Lynch may have his own opinion, but it does not matter. It was incoherently scattered across the screen. Granted, the first part had the appearance of a deliberately intricate, passively interesting story, but then it faltered. The cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phone calls, the lawyers ... come. I can almost imagine David breaking Lynch, forcing the crew to gather around him and telling them, "Look how crazy and funny I am! Is not that great? It's so weird and crazy! " Funny and crazy, if it is a byproduct of your style. However, it is presumptuous and tired if you do everything to do nothing other than that. It's like all the half-pulp fiction throwing that came out after Pulp Fiction. It's just not cool.
