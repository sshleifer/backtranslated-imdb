I found an old VHS version of this movie in my parents' house, so I thought I would try. I did not expect much from the beginning and I'm glad because the movie was not good overall. <br /> <br /> The acting was very bad overall, even for a Nicolas Cage movie. A scene with a radio controller is so pitiful that I found it strange that this scene was not cut. The first 30 minutes of the movie had almost no developed plot and I did not know what was going on. <br /> <br /> The story itself had the potential to be decent, but either the director was bad or tried too hard to give the style of the film its own, unique touch. I've been able to see it all, but I'll probably never see that movie again.
