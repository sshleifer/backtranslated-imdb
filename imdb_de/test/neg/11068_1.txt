I'm an avid movie watcher and enjoy a variety of films. However, I found NO pleasure in this movie. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I do not feel there was much of an action, the characters were not sympathetic and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best, and the end only made me dislike the movie anymore. It's definitely not in the same category as "The Cave," which in my opinion was the best cave movie ever made. Even "The Descent" was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a waste of the $ 3.79 rental fee and my time to see this. Do yourself a favor and avoid it.
