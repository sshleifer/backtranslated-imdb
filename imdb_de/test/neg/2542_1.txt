I have just watched this movie and for me .... it takes forever to finish, because he is so boring ..... and the plot is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> now ... where i should start .... o .... the movie is called "sinking of japan" ... yeah yeah ... it shows that japan actually sinks, but the action part is very bad. Compare the movie "the day after tomorrow", I would have rated it at least 8/10. <br /> <br /> The "sinking of Japan" does not reveal much about the disaster that actually happens right in front of our house. There is not much excitement ... boring ... all I can say ... <br /> <br /> one more point ... I would recommend this movie to have a better title ... maybe something like "the romance of the sinking in Japan", because this movie has a lot of conversation (waste of time ... talking nonsense) & the love story is extremely boring and dragged on too long ... honestly ... I almost get it frustrated. <br /> <br /> Overall ... this movie does not show enough details about the catastrophes, z Many people run like hell to avoid death. The story part was extremely untouchable for me. <br /> <br /> But hey ... there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie ... & it has good songs!
