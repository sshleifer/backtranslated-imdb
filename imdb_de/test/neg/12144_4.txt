This is a serious movie about black revolutionaries and not a real action movie. Billy Dee plays a young man who is fed up with racism and decides to take matters into his own hands. It's pretty pithy and realistic without taking advantage of the characters, but it's not that interesting either and Billy Dee's character, though maltreated by white authority figures, does not look very likable. It's also hurt by the extremely low budget. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see, since it is a good representation of social problems of the 70s.
