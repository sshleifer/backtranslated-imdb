I think Downey may have been inspired by the French New Wave. <br /> <br /> Who was not? <br /> <br /> wave. <br /> <br /> A synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose, and Downey seems to have lost a lot. <br /> <br /> Just say no. In more ways than one. Including the consideration of this movie. <br /> <br /> After a while, I could not stand it anymore and started to spin it through. It would have been wiser to just leave it out altogether.
