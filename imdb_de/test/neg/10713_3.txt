For three quarters of an hour, the story gradually becomes an important issue. Although it's overloaded with scenes that just want to tarnish the viewer and distract him from the action, something happens. It is not much and it is certainly not obvious. The combination of palace impressions and story-driving scenes give the entire character group neither depth nor insight. In fact, they keep them sterile because there is no character development at all. Everyone just stays around turning around their own clich√© and role - the cute, somehow wayward girl; the fighting superman, the snobby aristocrat. The male lead seems to have no difference whatsoever, he is a flat presence that actually does not matter because he's only there because the storyboard forces him to do so - it seemed like he was on vacation and got caught upstairs. When it comes to changing the corner in terms of what happens, the movie first snaps empty for a few minutes and then gets ridiculous. It dissolves - or better, dissolves - with a book-worn Deus Ex Machina, more stereotypes, and some of the grossest of action and decisions I've ever seen. It's history, all right. At first the movie is a drama, even though it is meant to be comedy, and then it turns into a farce. The protagonists do what is expected of them, and there are no surprises. The first set of somewhat serious antagonists, however, is replaced by a pair that was literally bored. Maybe that was a kind of nod to the audience. <br /> <br /> This film does not receive any bonus for the underlying philosophical meaning (as there is none) or for technical implementation. The animation and the editing are fair and also the sound mixing; However, it is by no means outstanding or even above the average Japanese productions of the late eighties. In fact, visual treats are static, uninspired, and not original. <br /> <br /> The worst thing of all is that it's totally entertaining, even when you're not dealing with characters and all of that. There is not enough going on here and the rest are crazy. Get a real Ghibli instead, make a feast with it and keep your hands off it.
