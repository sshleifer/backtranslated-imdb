I hated this movie. Simply put, this movie is so bad that I almost want to ignore it, that I always look at it and never mention it again. On the other hand, I can not resist good bashing. And if there's something Evan Almighty does for the audience, that's the best criticism. <br /> <br /> The film (a sequel to the hilarious Bruce Almighty) begins with the reintroduction of the public in Evan Baxter, just a supportive character in the original film. Right. This movie does not feature Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten. Not even a small appearance. You know your movie is bad if the guy who agreed to do Ace Venture: When Nature Calls does not even have a short walk-on role. But somehow they manage to keep Morgan Freeman as God. As I sat in the nearly empty theater, bored with the missing comedy, I wondered how much money it took to get Freeman for the film. Then it hit me an hour ago. It's just a throwaway role that takes in the 100-minute movie every 20 minutes. God just shows up between the scenes to tell Evan to build the ark. Sure, I know that Morgan Freeman will not see this movie in a year's time and think he's as good as his roles in The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby, but it's easy money. <br /> <br /> Where was I? Oh yes, the plot. Sometimes it's so hard to focus on what you're doing when you find that you've been thinking more about the plot than the author of the script. However, Evan (Steve Carell) has apparently given up his job as a news anchor for a job as a Congressman. Yes ... without transition in between. He never turns to his wife and says, "I think I want to be a Congressman." It just happens within the first five minutes and you have to deal with the big transition. As a Congressman, he is partner in a bill proposed by John Goodman's figure when God suddenly tells God to tell Evan to build an ark. No "Hey, how are you? How is the weather?" little. Only "I want you to build an ark." Evidence of Bad Writing: Evan notes that God is giving him clues to build an ark after noticing that a fan is holding off a Genesis 6:14 sign as he passes by his son playing a baseball game on television observed. <br /> <br /> That's basically the act of Evan Almighty. There are some random supportive performers who do their best to create comedy, but they are not very good because they have little time to screen. It's just your basic run of the mill family building an ark movie. In addition, there is the obligatory scene in which a father has to cancel his walking plans with his children and his wife because he is busy with the work. They are disappointed, but they understand, as is the case in the film. Only once would I love to see the youngest boy turning to his father and kicking his chin and telling him, "You're a real bastard who canceled your plans with us, I'm going to make emo now." There is also this drama that you would expect from the father with his family when they realize (the woman, actually ... the three children have no problem helping the father in building an ark) that he has gone crazy and claims God wants him to build a big boat But do not worry. His family decides to stay with him. Oops, I spoiled the drama. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that there is hardly a good comedy. I know that the decision has been made to decide if it's a PG movie to get a bigger audience reaction, but I do not think I'm in the minority when I think family humor is more than Craps only guys who are kicked in the nuts and animals Maybe I am wrong and that's what the family humor has reduced to. And if so, please bring me more adult comedies so I do not have to rummage through this crap (pun intended). <br /> <br /> The end is extra cheesy. Suddenly, the movie takes on a dramatic CGI curve that makes me shudder when I think it's a terrible CGI waste. I bet it was expensive too. After all this waiting, we are finally told why God wanted Evan to build an ark. And boy, boy, I hated the reason for that. I'll spare the details, but it was as if I had seen or read a crime thriller and the killer turned out to be the person who went behind the main character for a second and had no lines. Oh, and then there's a nice touch in the end. The song "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" plays the credits and we are then subjected to the "dancing" of the cast. I do not understand it You are unsuccessful for 100 minutes making a comedy, and then they are thrilling you. I swear I was not as scared as I danced Steve Carell since ... well, never. There you have people. Evan Almighty is the scariest movie of all time. All in all, I thought it was a wasted experience. I am amazed at all the talented actors (Carell, Freeman and Goodman) who appear with Lauren Graham, the wife of Gilmore Girls, at this festival, who has yet to prove to me that she can figure out a paper bag. But most of all, I am surprised at my willpower to actually sit through the whole movie without going out. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of ****
