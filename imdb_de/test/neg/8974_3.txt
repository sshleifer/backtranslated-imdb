After some time off work, I watched my DVD collection "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" and chose the most obscure title of the package: Zis Boom Bah with a forgotten Grace Hayes. "Classics" is obviously the deciding word here, as most titles I have never heard of are known and I suspect they are all public. The film also stars her son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy (who's just from New Orleans, Louisiana state), with Benny Rubin as malt shopkeeper and Huntz Hall taking a break from the East Side Kids as Peters buddy. The plot about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible man, without knowing who she is, is for the birds and does not have many funny scenes, though I have Peter's celebrity imitations and his dance with Hall likes to pull. And the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves. Ruby, however, is omnipresent with his confusion about the American vernacular of the time, and almost everything about him makes no sense at all (though I like his funny dance). Since this was only 61 minutes, which I've certainly played in the lower half of the double play bill, I'll be charitable and give this a 3 for the few entertaining things I've mentioned.
