I bought the DVD of this movie because I'm a fan of William Devane and I was really disappointed with "A Christmas Visitor". The story of the movie is so boring and slow to develop that you want to turn off your TV or DVD player by about halfway. The dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera, but not to a TV movie. William Devane was fine in his role and he played quite well, but in other films and projects he was much better. Meredith Baxter was terrible and could not really bring the warm-hearted mother to the spectators. Instead, she played very cool and was no better than a middle-class actress. I absolutely can not recommend this movie. Save your time and money on these.
