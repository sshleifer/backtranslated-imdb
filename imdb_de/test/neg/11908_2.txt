The Canterville Ghost (1996). The director made this production too sappy. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. There is time and place for "emotions", and this production can not translate very well. Patrick Stewart reciting Shakespeare was very good, but still inappropriate. Would not recommend or watch. The close-ups and the padded text and subplots were lost to me. Adding strange material and scenes does a really great job. The scriptwriter should find another job in which to relocate his talent, perhaps afternoon soap operas would be a better place. Take a look at the really good version and pass it on.
