I would not deny that I enjoyed watching Japanese horror movies, but everyone must be fed up after seeing it over and over again. The film follows the story of resentment. Audrey, as requested by her mother, will retrieve her sister. But when she arrives, something strange happens to her sister and then her sister is killed. She wants to know the truth about the curse and later comes a photographer (Eason). On the other hand, a family and three girls do something, but they seem to recognize it too late ... Actually, I do not see the points for the three girls being International School to appear in the movies since they are not (totally) related to the story. The reason why the woman holding the grudge is still killing people is still not clear (it seems to me that they are only telling the same things that I have seen in rancor). And the sudden appearance of Audrey in front of the boy is undoubtedly strange, which in my opinion is an attempt to relate the story about the family. The killing scenes are absolutely the mix of those in the ring and Shibuya Kaidan. Acting would be another bad point. As Hong Kong, I really want to support Edison Chen's first efforts in Hollywood, but as a movie lover, I really can not find a reason to support bad acting. Other actors like the father, although he only appears in a few scenes, should have done better. What is kept well is the atmosphere of the film, especially when I saw it alone in the middle of the night. <br /> <br /> If you have time, you can really enjoy all the horror movies and have seen all sorts of horror movies apart from that, like me, you can kill some time. If you really like Japanese horror movies of this kind, you should look at the Japanese version of the ring.
