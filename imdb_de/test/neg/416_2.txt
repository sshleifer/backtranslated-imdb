Ron Howard and his "editors" had only one job to do ... Follow the guidelines of the book, which is "rich," "mysterious," "moving," and very cinematic in its approach! <br /> <br /> What did you do? They changed EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING! What's left is something that has no right to be called "Angels & Daemons"! <br /> <br /> I really love the book and find it very hard to see it treated this way! <br /> <br /> I wonder what Dan Brown's opinion was about "this" movie. <br /> <br /> I really have no patience to sit down and correct the 1,000,000 changes that have made it, it's pointless .......
