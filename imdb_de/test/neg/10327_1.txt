This movie is so bad that I spent too much time talking about it. Soo bad ... really ... ... BAD ... and I'm not even so critical ... I'm almost ashamed to admit that I've seen it ... Sandra's few minutes show you how far you are really done ... I mean, anything but that is really Oscar-worthy for her ... I think the only way for her to look at this is that there is no other way than after this ... I think she had started it somewhere ... but really ... that bad ... ... really terrible ... bad is too good a word for this shit ... but I do not want to get nasty now .. but how can you not do that after I've wasted 90 minutes ... 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back ... 90 minutes I could have done better ... like sitting on my butt and staring into space ... that would have been a better time ... (shaking his head)
