This is by far the most repulsive and cruel version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever created. As a Pimpernel fan, I was genuinely offended by what they did to the characters - but this cruelty is not worth it, even if you are unfamiliar with the story. Percy Blakeney, for example, would never stab people in the back just to go down a hallway. Chauvelin would never have a bunch of women in his bed. Marguerite never had an affair with Chauvelin and Armand with Minette, whoever she is. Chauvelin would not accidentally shoot Tony in the head. Chauvelin is not called Paul, nor has it ever been. They have completely eradicated any reference to the Pimpernel disguises and instead replaced them with James Bond-style gadgets and gizmos. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself ... The make-up is scary. The women look like clowns. Elizabeth McGovern's beauty mark happens to wander around her face. The poor, pathetic actors have no script to work with, and it's not really their fault their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper. The dialogue ... oh, the dialogue. The dialogue is unbearable. And who is responsible for the small subtitles at the bottom of the screen, should consider this movie as penance. (I counted 13 local signatures in the first half hour before I gave in. As if we could not figure out that the body of water between England and France is the English Channel.) <br /> <br /> The film - if I did Getting me to call it that because it's really just a videotape with a filter - absolutely worthless. Do not waste your time and your brain cells on this rancid hoax - look instead at the 1982 Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour version or the Leslie Howard movie from 1934 or anything but this one.
