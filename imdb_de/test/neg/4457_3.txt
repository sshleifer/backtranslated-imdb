Proof, if any evidence was required, would have forced Hammer to leave her vampires in the Victorian era. After all, vampirism is about suppressed sexuality, which is why the concept in London in 1972 is meaningless, with its thirties pretending to be horny teens. The audience was fed up with the horror of the fifties and sixties salon, so the studio tried everything to bring it back, including extensive LUST FOR A VAMPIRE among others, and updating their characters was pretty quiet in his grave two years later. Too bad ... <br /> <br /> But I still have a great fondness for the classic hammer time of 1957-1965.
