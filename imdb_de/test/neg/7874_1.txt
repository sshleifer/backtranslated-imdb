Pooh. Stephen Baldwin. I never noticed it until I brought the DVD home and saw its name in the credits. Double ugh. What's worse, he's the name in this low budget, mindless, wandering, would-be shooting. I mean, where did you find the guy who writes this garbage? Driving a caterpillar in LA City Dump hoping to break into the movie? The whole story is a ridiculous situation, stacked on a ridiculous premise. Baldwin is as convincing as a figurehead for American Gothic, without pitchfork. His entire acting repertoire looks like he needs the potty and then looks like he found it. <br /> <br /> So there are people: bad script, bad behavior with nameless actors, low budget settings and a hero who is as convincing as a boy scout looking for a cookie client as an action hero. It's too late for me to get my money back on the DVD, but you can save yourself - unless you're one of those who want to make the dogs laugh ... honestly, this one is too boring, to be funny.
