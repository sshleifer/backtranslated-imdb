The first official release of the World Wrestling Entertainment Film Department is a fairly basic horror / slasher movie called "See No Evil" starring Kane, one of her great wrestlers known for his intimidating presence, hard knocks and one of the most obsessed kinky background stories in wrestling. And let's not hit us here; Although this film is being promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time (mostly by WWE), it goes without saying that once I've seen it, I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> "See No Evil" sees a series of juvenile delinquents being sent to a hotel for tidying up. Of course, this hotel also has a monstrous killer (played by Kane) and we all know where that leads. Without giving away too much of the action, this film has the appearance and structure of a Slasher strip of the early 1980s, with most clich√©s intact, but without the fear that accompanies these films. And that's the main problem with "See No Evil". It tries so many of the tricks suggested by its predecessors in the genre that it seems predictable. Veteran horror fans will quickly spot some of the gimmicks, and even those who have only seen a few times should know what's going to happen next. It's too general to be scary. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie is undoubted, but it's just for the effect. The dark atmosphere that has flowed into the film initially gives the feeling of horror, but when you come towards the end, it somehow feels out of place and quickly becomes tiring. The death scenes are not as bloody and horrible as laughable, though some of them are quite resourceful. <br /> <br /> And the acting in this film is also pretty bad, as the main characters are not developed enough to interest us when they are finally beaten. Some can not even present the fear properly. They scream and cry in a futile effort to fight back. So, dying just adds to the comedy because you do not care enough about it, that you simply consider it the equivalent of Starfleet Redshirts for the monster Kane. <br /> <br /> As for Kane, he simply portrayed His character is just as much a character as his wrestling character, only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone. I have no doubt that Kane can play a big role in the horror genre. He has the look and the presence for it; All he needs is better stuff (especially a script not written by someone writing wrestling shows) to work with. <br /> <br /> Well, although that sounds like a harsh review, I really liked the movie. It's one of those ridiculously bad movies that you can not help but sit down and enjoy. Again, my main criticism of the film is that it is simply an exercise in shooting bloody killings and has no frightening or shocking moments. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed it because it was easy for me to laugh at some of the movie's scary moments. If that happens because it should, the movie would have been rated higher. But it did not. It was laughed because it is a B-movie and it does not help that the previous experience of the director from porn movies and music videos exist. not exactly complicated things that have to be managed anyway. Nevertheless, I liked it very much. <br /> <br /> If you do not like a funny B-movie or a funny horror movie, I would highly recommend "See No Evil". If you are a true lover of the genre, I would wait for the DVD to come out before you try it out. Everyone else should probably see something different.
