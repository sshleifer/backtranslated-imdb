I thought "Puppets phoning on the phone" was pretty low, but I do not think Carlos Mencia's show is a comedy at all. His main goal is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word "beaner" as often as possible. I have never felt compelled to write a review explaining the awfulness of something on IMDb, but I really hope that this show never gets renewed or repeated. Mencia tries to be the next Dave Chapelle, and maybe he was hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes. It's obvious, except for Chapelle's intro (blues guys vs mariachi band). However, Mencia has absolutely no attitude and does not go far enough into the popular views of Hispanic culture to have a creative impact each time. Instead, he adheres to a small number of barely shocking nicknames for his Latinos and makes "jokes" about immigration. Now and then he uses the light darkness of his skin to make fun of someone like the cultures of the Middle East. These jokes are mainly about repeating any joke or clich√© made against culture, and possibly some unbelievably old themes (like 9/11) in a watered-down stand-up style, while laughing at himself To cover up the style of the audience. I think he's too scared to really offend anyone, so the viewer just feels awkward. He also beats jokes to death. If you have ever seen, "Why is this message?" You will know what I am talking about. It's funny in the beginning, but he just keeps going and eventually becomes Captain Obvious. <br /> <br /> It is a train wreck that is purely painful to look at.
