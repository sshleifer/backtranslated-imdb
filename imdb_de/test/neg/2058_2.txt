This movie is just crap, I can not say otherwise. From the beginning you know that it will be crap. <br /> <br /> The story, the dialogue, the drama, the special effects, the make-up, pretty much all shit. I like vampire movies and I know that they will never be Oscar-winning films, but this is not even worth seeing, I can not believe how anyone made this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is ... Does not exist, everything looks like a big joke. Maybe they tried, but I seriously doubt it. I wish I knew what they were trying to do, but it just backfired, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen a lot of bad movies, but nothing compared to that) Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT observe this. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is also full of clich√©s! P.S. 2 Bad Script, Bad Direction, Bad Cinematography. P.S. 3 I took the trouble to comment on this as a favor for all.
