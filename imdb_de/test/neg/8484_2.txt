SPOILER <br /> <br /> I love movies. I have seen many movies. I did not think that I would ever see a movie that I actually hated. Son of the mask has ruined it. Son of the Mask is so bad that I do not even make a verbose comment, as I usually do. In fact, I will not write much. I think you all should know that this movie is terribly awful. And poor Jamie Kennedy. He was fantastic in Scream, but now this movie! This movie also shoots a SMO-CAN movie and makes it the stupid kids movie that even kids will not like. This movie also consists of very rude humor. Like the nose woman. She has a nose for a head and when she spits sneezing white stuff out of her nose. There is also an exorcist parody. Yes, a children's movie has a parody for adults. Maybe they thought the adults would like it. To be honest, the movie became even cheesier and rougher. <br /> <br /> Here's the basic, stupid plot. Tim Avery's dog gets the amazing Loki mask and turns into a comic dog thing. When Tim pays more attention to the baby, a cartoon dog becomes a Wiley Coyote rip-off. Then Loki takes the baby with amazing powers and Tim and Loki have a really cheesy animated fight. Tim wears the mask. Everything ends happily. Too bad that this movie is awful. All in all, the original of the mask was a fantastic Jim Carrey movie. That's basically not. Please borrow, do not buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake when I rented it. I do not want you to make exactly the same mistake. I feel terrible that I could not write a detailed comment, but really, what is there to comment here? <br /> <br /> Recommended Movies: The Mask.
