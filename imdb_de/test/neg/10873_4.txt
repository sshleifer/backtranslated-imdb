Director / conductor Larry Bishop tried hard with Hell Ride. The film wants to be edgy, funny, provocative, strange and biting, apparently in the Quentin Tarantino / Rob zombie style. But it is not nervous. The references seem to be forced. The dialogue tries to be smart and fails. The humor is never funny. Nice try to set a dark tone, but we would have to take care of the characters or the story so that they can remotely succeed, old and inappropriate "bad guys" in an attempt to make a modernized Sergio Leone Western. If this film can inspire newer generations for movies of the 60s and 70s, kudos for it. But for itself it is rather boring and irrelevant. I think there is a place for style over substance. But this movie is not.
