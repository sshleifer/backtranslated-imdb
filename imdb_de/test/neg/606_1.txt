There is not a single character with redeeming qualities in this sitcom. They are all selfish, disgusting or two-dimensional. My husband looks at it and claims that there is nothing else, but I would rather not see anything. <br /> <br /> The only sitcom I can think of was worse: yes, dear. At least you did not get nine seasons. <br /> <br /> Overweight does not make a weird genius, and Kevin James does not have the talent of John Goodman, Jackie Gleason or John Belushi. Leah Remini may have talent, but if it does, she is wasted on the wife. Jerry Stiller convinces as annoying old man. Maybe there is a reason for that. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of why sitcoms are ridiculed.
