I saw The Greek Tycoon when it first came out in 1978. I found it extremely boring. I thought it was no better than a travelogue with one exception: For the first time in my life, I realized why it was good to be rich. Seeing the landscape in front of the yacht of Aristotle Onassis and casting my first glimpse into the lifestyle of the rich and famous opened my eyes. To tell Martha Stewart: It was a good thing. Funny, I do not remember the sex scene. I had not seen the movie since he was on the big screen, and I found the lovemaking session with the mistress unforgettable. Maybe because I was younger and alone, that was no big deal.
