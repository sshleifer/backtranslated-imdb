... but had to see how bad it could be. The plot was thin at first, but it got worse and worse. A female genetic engineering student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a man because a biological weapon used in World War I killed 97% of the world's male population. The surviving men are either gigolos with high prices in back alley clubs or crazy lunatics in rundown football stadiums who want to overthrow the "Lesbian conspiracy". The entire process resembled the microwaves of a large bowl of Jello. Press a few buttons and you'll get a baby. Not only that, he ages in a month to mid-20 and then begins to age normally (how comfortable). Eventually, poor Adam gets bored in the remote cabin in the forest where his creator reared it, and steals her car to see "the city" several plots of land we never see loosened. As Adam quickly learns, what men have survived is treated as outcasts / criminals because they are dangerous animals that can not help their genetic predisposition to violence. The propaganda machines were in full swing, making women believe that all men are rapists and murderers. This has led to lesbianism being the norm, the overthrow of Christianity, the reproduction of women by mere cloning, and oh yes, world peace among other implied results. All this seems unlikely, as only 30 years have passed since the war. Adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next, genetically programmed to be non-violent and incapable of doing much for himself. With the FBI on the trail, the Madams looking for fresh meat, and his creator trying to retake it (for himself), he learns that violence is not limited to the male species. Overall, I would not recommend this film , <br /> <br /> However, I really enjoyed Veronica Cartwrights being the FBI's "love to hate her" director, and Julie Bowen did not do it badly as Hope the '. Cabinet Hetero geneticists either.
