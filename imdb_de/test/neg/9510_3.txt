Franco Zeffirellis ("The Taming of the Shrew", "Romeo and Juliet", "Jesus of Nazareth", "Othello"), the third engraving when he put Shakespeare on the screen, works very well with the cast of Mel Gibson (" Mad Max, "Lethal Weapon", and "The Passion Of The Christ" (formerly "The Passion Of The Christ") in the role Sir Laurence Olivier once owned (and rightly so, see also "Hamlet") , probably the best interpretation of one of the Bard's timeless (and the most-cited) tragedies) and redone five years later by Kenneth Branagh as a full-blooded treatment, combining 3 hours and 22 minutes with a dream cast (and many minor additions that are good The Contemporary Master of William Shakespeare, Kenneth Branagh, the directors of "Henry V" and "Dead Again", was co-directed by Glenn Close ("The Big Chill"), Paul Scofield ("A Man For All Seasons"), Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Michael Maloney (who as Kenn eth Roderigo would be cast alongside Kenneth Branag) and Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's "Othello" (see my review of Olivier's "Stage Version" of the tragedy, though he starred only) and who cast Branagh in his three-hour "Hamlet" version as a "hamster" (a proper tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of the play; See also my review 5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who was cast 4 years later as Cassio in the version of his brother "Othello") and Helena Bonham-Carter, who was cast in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" 4 years later. <br /> <br /> Zeffirelli had intended this film as a tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier (who had died 2 years before this movie) and works pretty well for the most part.What was a bit uncomfortable for me was that Zeffirelli was laying many lines In one scene, he gives one of Hamlet's lines to the ghost, and Helena Bonham-Carter did NOT convince me as Ophelia, too boring and unreal, while Jean Simmons (who immortalized the role in Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who did an acceptable job in Kenneth Branagh's uncircumcised, epic revisionist revision of "Hamlet"), who stood well with Jean Since Simmons is the BEST Ophelia at all, she became known in 1948 for di Best actress nominated (she did not win - what a shame). Ian Holm said his lines too fast, not slowly, as I expected, in a scene with him Laertes and Ophelia. On the other hand, I am more used to Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers' interpretations of the role, and I think they have done better jobs than Holm in their respective versions of "Hamlet" (both of great directors, actors, and text editors), producers and stars of all their versions of the bard's work) as Polonius. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, however, was excellent. The scene in which Hamlet confronts his mother was very well done, but Olivier and Branagh reinforced the scene to create even more of the emotional intensity and excitement needed for the scene. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version just to pass the time, but it's ideal as a teaching tool for 12th grade English teachers (I recommend showing Olivier's version first, then Branagh's, and finally this version) , Despite the "PG" rating of the film, there was really nothing to complain about in the film. Only what the piece demanded. <br /> <br /> The best versions of "Hamlet" are: # 1 Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I can not decide which one was the best. For more information, see my reviews of these versions. <br /> <br /> # 2 Franco Zeffirelli. This one was fine. It started with a scene that was not in the game, but it should then have progressed to the actual beginning of the game, where a guard "Who is there?" "No, answer me, get up and unfold !!" This scene scares you, because you are sitting quietly and then-bam !!, you almost jump out of your skin. In short, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the game. HUGE mistake with Zeffirelli to skip this scene. It also laid many lines (and cut off others that I think should have been inserted), such as the line in which Hamlet says to Ophelia, "Bring yourself to a monastery, why are you a breeder of sinners ? "; This line should appear in THIS scene, NOT where it was placed in the movie (after the soliloquy "To Be Or Not To Be"). This version has difficulty cutting out too much or too little between an outstanding piece of literature. Kenneth Branagh would rectify this with his unabridged version of the tragedy 5 years later, which made his HIS version a more fitting homage to Sir Laurence Olivier, as many of the actors (besides him) "Hamlet" played many on stage or on the film had times on different occasions. However, Zeffirelli's attitude to "Hamlet" is true to the piece and that's what I was looking for was more violent than the resolution of the previous two faithful versions (more in keeping with the game, Olivier softened it ... and it worked just as well) ) and stayed closer to the game, with Branagh making some harmless touches of his own ... too good an effect. <br /> <br /> This version is not rated.
