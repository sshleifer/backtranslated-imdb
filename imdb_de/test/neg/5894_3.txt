We will never know the truth about 9/11. And this modest movie proves it. <br /> <br /> I recently saw a YouTube report claiming that no planes were involved in the destruction of the Twin Towers. that all news programs were allegedly provided from a mysterious source (probably the Gubmint?) with the same angles of the towers, and in the footage provided, CGI planes were replaced by real MISSILES that actually hit the towers .... <br /> <br /> It's a captivating video, and although I'm not a Wacko conspiracy theoretician per se, I'm still not sure if the actual planes hit anything that day (the towers, the Shanksville Field, the Pentagon ) - because there are no aircraft debris. (And what about these notorious "black boxes"? None recovered.) There are a million other theories abound, all courting a drop of truth in a sea of ​​speculation. But you'll drown in Malarkey before speculating in the 9/11 COMMISSION REPORT, a no-budget movie that attempts to shut the barn door after you've escaped all the horses and jihadists, speculating something true or worth considering. <br /> <br /> Writer-director Leigh Scott is obviously a concerned American citizen who wanted to enlighten the audience, which the 560-page report may uncover. It would help if his movie had an actor instead of a man who looks like David Duchovny, a girl who looks like Gina Gershon, a man who thinks he's Russell Crowe and another guy who's pretty sure he's To be Sean Bean. It would help if his cameraman did not have Parkinson's disease; if the optical fiber has not tried to save power; It would help if its editor did not have Attention Deficit Disorder or the soundtrack was not an atmospheric new esoteric of world order. and the looping should probably have been inserted when people actually moved their mouths. <br /> <br /> We can not even call this propaganda. It is too funny. And with humor I mean unsurpassable. <br /> <br /> You can not jam a theme of this complex into a two-hour movie, but Leigh Scott tries it anyway, including all the sexy slogans we've awakened: bin Laden's intent to attack, weapons from Somalia acquire, non-aggression agreement with Iraq, visit Mussawi flight school, weapons of mass destruction ... <br /> <br /> The problem is: we know that everything is retrospect, Any discussion that the concerned intelligence workers have together, stinks after wrong thinking, which are all crammed together for a proper conversation. As with reverse engineering, all the essentials are briefly and succinctly mentioned, so we may wonder how incompetently all these branches of government collapsed. <br /> <br /> There is a ridiculous interrogation scene crammed with a sliding bimbo a guy with tomato sauce on his face. Well - that would be torture if most men did not think it was a turn on. <br /> <br /> The slogan is, "What if the attack could have been stopped?" According to this report - and we assume that the CIA and other subway agencies, according to the Commission's report, were all ready to arrest bin Laden - and not. Anyone who has anything to do with the "terrorism" reports (you mean, you've actually read those reports?) Are so worried that we just want to beat them for their bad acting. <br /> <br /> But the whole story goes much deeper than the banal soundbytes The sloppy Ku Bush clan pushed the American people forward after 9/11. We now know that even holding on to Bin Laden before the September 11 attack would not have changed or achieved anything - the wheels moved with or without the Taliban figurehead, whose involvement was the possible notion of a man's feverish notion to unite a common enemy. Contrary to popular belief "they did not attack us". When Ron Paul tried to explain, it was a setback from the Middle East - "they were so sick of it that America" ​​over there "planted their infidel feet, that they had" brought "the war here. Even though George W. Death likes to announce the nonsensical thing, "We fight over there, so we do not have to fight over here" in reality "Because we're over there, the fight was brought here." <br /> <br /> Bei The Sept. 11 attack was not so much about the complicated planning of terrorists, but about the gross negligence of the Bush administration, which we know that (without the investigation of commissions) all the information had been forwarded to the Clinton administration ; Information about terrorist cells that reach critical mass and their intent to cause chaos. But the Oil Idiot of Texas, who refused to read his daily briefings and prefer to vacation at his ranch in Crawford, rather than spending an extra day at work, sworn the oath he'd taken an oath to afford - to protect the American public. <br /> <And then the scum who called himself President used the attacks that were made by his negligence as a political hammer against his own country to get a second term, to destroy the American Constitution and America on the Basis of a fake war with a lie (WMD), with a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. Strangely enough, the film never appears near the Ku Bush clan and offers neither opinion nor judgment. Leigh Scott wants to stay neutral. Tell that to the raped and plundered hundreds of thousands in the fake war on terror in Iraq. By sheer coincidence, I realized that I saw this DVD while I was wearing my "Bush song Thousands Died". T-shirt.
