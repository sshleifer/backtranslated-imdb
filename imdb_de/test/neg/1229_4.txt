This is a bad caricature of "Lonesome Dove" - ​​and Larry McMurtry. <br /> <br /> I love your books, with "Lonesome Dove" among the top three. I've admired the way you look at your characters with such unflinching honesty that is balanced by never taking it too seriously. I am so spoiled. <br /> <br /> Why did you come to this? <br /> <br /> "Comanche Moon" does not meet your standards. I see that you are credited with script writing, but that's so different from you, I'd rather say it was written by someone else. <br /> <br /> The dialogue makes me claustrophobic and I wish someone would erupt a naturally set sentence. The part about 'genius' was agonizing. McCrae was unrecognizable, mostly because of the crazy words that came out of his mouth. Well, I miss Call too. <br /> <br /> The main missing factors are Gus and Call and the men they are: their objective courage; the underlying vein is ethics and honesty; her lack of self-deception. Tough men who lead a hard life with a certain, undeniable grace. <br /> <br /> Some guilt must be attributed to the arduous direction here and throughout the world. All performers needed dialect AND dialogue coaching. <br /> <br /> Although I try to imagine Robert Duvall as McCrae speaking the same dialogue, things are getting better - but not much. It's trying to shy a cowboy-of-a-few words, sound smart, grinning, but it does not work half as well. <br /> <br /> How can it be different from "Lonesome Dove"? Can the writer have forgotten his characters? They've deceived some of the people, Mr. McMurtry - but not this one.
