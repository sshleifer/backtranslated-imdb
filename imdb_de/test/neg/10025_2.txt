Oh yes, this is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award for "worst slasher of the 80s". "The Prey" has everything you would normally want to avoid with a horror movie: a routine, derivative action that you've seen a thousand times (and better), unbearable characters and terrible performances, a complete lack of blood and tension. blurred photography and unoriginal locations and? most irritating of all? the most amount of unnecessary padding material you've ever experienced in your life (and that's not an exaggeration, it's a guarantee!). Aside from the seemingly endless amount of National Geographic footage that I will discuss later, this movie is shameless enough to contain a complete banjo interlude (!) And two occasions when characters tell ambiguous jokes that are not once are funny. The setup is as rudimentary as it gets: The intro shows images of a devastating forest fire with OTT voice-over screams of people. Nearly forty years later, when an elderly couple camping in the same area is shaken by something that breathes heavily from the canvas. This should be enough information to deduce that someone survived the fire all those years ago and has been playing around ever since. Enter three unbearable twenty couples who go into the danger zone and only have sex in their heads. Of course, they do not know that they are sitting ducks to look at the stalking and panting killer. "The Prey" is an irrevocably boring movie. Apparently it was shot in 1978, but nobody wanted to distribute it until 1984, and it's not difficult to understand why. If you were to filter out all relevant content, this would only be a short 30 minute movie. maybe even less. There is an unimaginable amount of wildlife and wildlife, sometimes of animals that I do not even think live in this kind of area, and they seem to go on forever. The only thing missing is the typical narrative of National Geographic, which reveals the habits of animals. Animals in their own natural biotope are undoubtedly beautiful to look at, but not in a supposedly hideous and kitschy 80s Slasher movie to scream out loud. The last fifteen minutes are finally worth something, with some mighty kill sequences and fine make-up effects for the monster (which turns out to be Lurch from The Addams Family movies), but still stupidly accused? the scene with the vulture is too stupid ?? and the last shot is just laughed and loud. As mentioned before, "The Prey" easily makes my personal list of the worst 80s slashers, besides "Dismay with Fear", "Berserker", "Deadly Games", "Do not Go into the Forest", "Hollow Gate", "The Stay Awake" and "Curfew".
