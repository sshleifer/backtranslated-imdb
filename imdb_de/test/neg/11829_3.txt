... and in this series I was reduced to a nasty jock with a gay hairstyle. Do you remember my friend Marco, who had all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series, his one-liners have shamed Mr. Freeze. Do you remember our over-evil Nemesis Visser Three? He's a bald guy with inhuman buzzwords. Do you remember Rachel, "Xena, the warrior princess," and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love? They were turned into mindless Bimbos by the 10 (!) Writers who decided that the original characters were not cool enough for television. Do you remember the fantastic alien ax that was cool and intelligent and really liked cinnamon rolls? In this series he is the token alien with an extremely annoying voice. Do you remember the funny banter that our team had in the books? In this series, our dialogue is so bleak and stupid that it is obvious that the authors are down to the lowest common denominator. So forget about everything you thought you knew about Animorphs! It was Cassie who became allergic to Morphing, not Rachel, thinking should resonate, and Visser Three and Ax rarely appeared as Andalites (no, it has nothing to do with the budget!). <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy. And I do not lie. The idiots are all around us. And if you're unlucky, one of them can turn one of your favorite books, series, or graphic novels into a terrible television program. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... watching TV is worth it." ~ (the very bald) Visser Three <br /> <br /> (r # 91)
