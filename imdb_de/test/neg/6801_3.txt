As an early portrayal of the 1960s turmoil that ensued, Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) can be excused as an early flower child. The film itself deserves no such scope. The lack of character development, motivation and justification for the character's behavior makes the movie very disappointing. I sat and watched and waited for an explanation of the bizarre actions, only to find that Shainberg let me look into a story someone must have been joking about. The fact that the few facts presented were not very consistent with Diane Arbus' life did not help clear things up. <br /> <br /> The washed-out Art Direction in Diane's "normal" life stood in a nice contrast to the brilliant colors in her "Awakening Life with Lionel". And the stairs to the trapdoor was a nice demonstration of Diane's attempt to bring her existing family into a new life (though I do not see how that trap door on the ceiling of her dining room could connect directly to Lionel's apartment, which was two flights from up the stairs). <br /> <br /> Perhaps my analysis is too literal to look for character development and relationship understanding beyond a sentence or a comment. I would also like to have seen at least one of Diane's photos. I will not wait for the sequel.
