THE GOOD: Acting was great, especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Matt Dillon's Best Supporting Actor. <br /> <br /> THE BATH: I am a visible minority (not white) and have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the theme of the movie, I definitely would NOT say that this movie is the best of the year, it is far from it. I have problems with this film, both from the perspective of a player and from the perspective of a visible minority. Some of my problems with this movie are: <br /> <br /> (1) Bad character development (or none at all). Just because we saw extremes in a character, for example, that Matt Dillon is a racist cop and a good caregiver for his ailing father, does not mean that the character is well developed. Yeah, I admit that in a big cast ensemble like this one, it's difficult that every character is well developed, BUT that does not mean none of the characters should be like that. <br /> <br /> (2) The dialogue really seems to be so much that I'm really surprised that this film was won for Best Original Screenplay. You should NOT show this movie in scriptwriting because it is good, but to show students and future scriptwriters what they should NOT do. I just had the feeling that I was constantly struck by how bad racism is. I understand. <br /> <br /> (3) The plot seems so random, it is ridiculous. What are the chances of a black car robber stumbling over an Asiatic who happens to be a human trafficker as he enters his van, and the same black car robber finally carjacking this Asian man several hours later after he took him to the hospital Just to find out that the various Asians being traded in the van just show that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or how about this scene in which a prejudiced white upper-class woman who has fallen down the stairs and all her prejudices and hatred have disappeared into the air? If it was that easy, why do not we throw every racist down the stairs in America so they'll have a heart change? <br /> <br /> (4) I think my biggest concerns about this movie are unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is more hidden than in your face. I refused to enter a supermarket because I'm not white. Did the shopkeeper say because I was not white? No, he said the shop was closed, although many people were shopping inside. Did he call racial insults? Racism in America is more hidden. Some taxi drivers will probably not stop picking you up because you're not white, but that does not mean they'll try to run you over or come out and say racial slurs. If there was a Chinese girl I would not say "Blake! Blake! Learn an English bitch!". On the other hand, if I was a Chinese and accidentally left a Mexican behind me, I do not say "Mexicans are bad drivers" in front of her face. That's not how things work. Instead, I gave out my insurance information, apologized, and went home to tell my Chinese colleagues and family members that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That's the true racism. It is hidden and not in your face. <br /> <br /> In any case, crash is not original, unlike what some people say. The interlocking and interwoven storylines, plots and characters have been made before. "Magnolia" is a movie that does a lot better than Crash, yet it has never been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It had a stellar cast - Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who recently won the best actor), Tom Cruise, etc. It's really a mystery how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture.
