This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. And that's compared to Alexander, Fortress 2 and The new world. <br /> <br /> I should return to the blockbuster and demand my money along with a compensation, as it was a truly traumatic experience. For the first ten minutes, I changed the zoom on my widescreen TV because the actors were apparently out of the screen. I did not think it's possible to make such a bad movie at this time, I was wrong. I've thought of a good reason to buy this movie while writing this message. A joke at Christmas. I blame the woman for choosing her, thank you, baby. <br /> <br /> Be warned ....... A true shocker of all time !!!!!!
