This movie just seems to be meant to annoy me. Everything I hate about films is present: false sentimentality, extreme dizziness, bad children actors and much more. This ignores the fact that it represents the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, and many of the performers admit that a football has the shape of a lemon. What?! This is a rugby ball. The story follows a group of no-hoppers who get a new teacher who pleases them (who happens to teach the class in a short skirt) and they are interested in football. Of course they are all rubbish (do not forget, they are not hopes) except a kid who moved away from El Paso. Blah Blah, etc, etc., and the kids are still not making good football, but a good heart follows, and the no-hop players become a group of well-rounded kids. Damn, even the adults start coming; Drunkards become caring parents, illegal immigrants are left off the hook ... groaning. <br /> <br /> This movie star Steve Guttenberg. Well, before you make your way to a copy in your local video store, wait a minute. Guttenberg is garbage. No no. Come on, how did this guy ever get into a movie? I have absolutely no idea, and in this movie there is nothing that could give me an idea. Olivia d'Abo plays alongside Steve and does not impress. She just seems to go through the motions and look good. Although I have no problems with the last part; Their performance does not honor the film. The kid actors that make up the rest of the cast are as bad as you would expect from a movie like this one. Most of them are abominable and / or annoying and that does not make any pleasant consideration at all. There is a goat in the movie who plays mascots and he does a good job. But you would not see a movie for a goat, so do not disturb that movie.
