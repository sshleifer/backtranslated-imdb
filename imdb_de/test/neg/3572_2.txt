I find it difficult to understand why the viewer feels like this is a powerful movie. I would suppose that the main purpose of this film would be a character study and the impact of racism in a British community. All the more disappointing is that all the characters are two-dimensional and the acting is on the level of a college performing arts course. I'm always skeptical of "improvisation," another word for being too lazy to write a decent script. I was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience that laughed as they were sure to be moved by the story. Racism is a serious topic, but I think a subtle approach to cinema works much better than using a trowel.
