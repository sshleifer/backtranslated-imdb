I find the documentary work of Herzog very uneven. Fata Morgana, a kind of companion of Lessons of Darkness, not only misses the shattering spectacle, but mostly the cognitive eye of an author. By comparison, amateurs wandering aimlessly left and right across the desert are the kind you would expect from a German tourist with Handycam. The camera runs out of the window of a car and picks up all kinds of pointless pictures, cable fences, run-down buildings, and stains that come through the lens in random order, interrupted by shots of sand dunes. At one point Herzog encounters a group of starved cattle rotting in the sand, but the picture is portrayed as you and I, perhaps worse, the camera looking from one cattle to the next. For a documentary trying to be a visual feast, a hypnotic, surreal excursion into unknown landscapes, he lacks the visual staging and conviction of a disciplined author. It is everywhere, half-hearted and boring, the myths of Mayan creation are recited in one voice, then another text that Duke held for literature. Only at the end Fata Morgana jumps through a series of bizarre encounters. First with a man and a woman playing music in a room, the man singing distorted through a microphone, both are apathetic in their task. A man holding a turtle. A group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the earth. Apart from that, it seems to offer a very low substance or to offer visual splendor.
