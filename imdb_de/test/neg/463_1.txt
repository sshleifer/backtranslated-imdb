How can anyone start liking this movie, I really do not care. <br /> <br /> The idea? It has no. "A man fell apart". That's the idea. Impressive. Slowly an environment killed him ... now THAT is original and worth it to see it. <br /> <br /> This is the first Fasbinder movie I have seen ... I have heard that he is a genius of staging. Scene, but I have seen student films with more attention, inspiration, idea and artistry than these ... these ... these nothing. It has nothing! <br /> <br /> Every shot is too long. There is so much emptiness in them ... Acting is terrible. You can see that the actors had no preparation at all, no understanding of their roles, not even an attempt to show emotions ... it's so ... superficial ... The lines are so explicative that you get 90% of them could still have the same shitty movie. Tempo? Who cares? Atmosphere, dynamics, that's for pussies! One scene per scene, 80% of people stared unrealistic and had no idea how to portray emotions and the importance of the moment, apart from a hollow look in the camera or in another area ... Edit? All editing rules were ignored without any payment being made ... Photography? Half of the images are reflected in themselves and unpleasant light without any stylization. Shadow, shadow play ... who needs that? We need a guy who pisses, drinks and his wife beats as if he were ... as if he were acting. We need a few close-ups of a not so beautiful woman ... we need an amateurish climax of his capture by an unconvincing Arab torturer ... This movie has so much wrong that he was not worth the no-budget. Honestly, I have not seen such a bad movie since American pie 5. So bad. <br /> <br /> I've just started to watch his "Veronica Foss" movie, which looks a lot better on the first 15 minutes (as he's got a bit of direction and artistic idea, by the way). Crap ), so I will not say that Fasbinder is unaware ... but that .... this movie SUCKS!
