An Asian blowgun assassin kills victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before being hit by a car. Sheila Morris (former Swedish Miss Janet Agren, who shows a hilarious "Southern Belle" dub to show she's from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets herself up on the search. This brings her to New Guinea, where she promises $ 80,000 to a dirty leader (Robert Kerman, ie The American pornstar R. Bolla) to find her sister. After barely passing through a jungle of bloodthirsty cannibals, they find Diana, under the control of Jim Jones cult leader Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical guru-style crazy things, like expelling LSD, initiating suicide in the group, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him, and raping Agren with a huge cobra blood. From time to time, a figure looks to the right or left to see a bloody scene lifted directly by JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN FROM DEEP RIVER (both also led by Lenzi). I'm pretty sure you also use at least two scenes from CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Here we get the expected animal murder scenes (except Gator, natives eat live snakes), plus nudity and castration. Me Me Lai shows up to give her breast implants another workout in which she plays a widow who is beaten by three of her sister-in-law on the ashes of her freshly cremated husband. Mel Ferrer briefly appears as a professor and has not much to do. <br /> <br /> So with MANGIATI VIVI! You get pretty much a promise that will be fulfilled with all the nakedness, the blood, the dead animals and the bad taste one expects from one of these titles. So if you are a hunting dog, you should definitely see it. Personally, I was bored halfway and just wanted it to end. The original (heavily edited) 1985 US release was titled THE EMERALD JUNGLE to make people believe they were hiring John Boorman's EMERALD FOREST. It has also been called DOOMED TO THE AND EATEN ALIVE BY CANNIBALS!
