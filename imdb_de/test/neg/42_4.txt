Art House horror attempts to cover with unconventional aesthetics that this is just another serial killer who ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teenage sexuality and violent anger. The suburbs are as similar to any Australian writing (book or film) since 1960 - surprisingly, the suburbs have a dark underbody - and the plot is as invented as you've ever seen. "The neighbors would never know anything about this man," says one of the filmmakers about Joel Edgerton's character. "But he was absolutely plausible what he was, serial killers do not all have spots over their eyes and scars on their cheeks, they look like the guy next door." Another dealer for pornographic violence, who sees a serial killer on every street. But the real insignificance of this film lies in the fact that it is a genre film that nobody has seen. Supported by substantial funds (including some from Film Finance - this is the government), this was a big hit at the Underground Film Festival in Melbourne, and had to rely on ACMI friendliness for a * very * short release season. Question 1: What does the FFC finance if it is "arty" and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why are these nasty movies (ACOLYTES, BEAUTIFUL, PUNISHMENT, NO Through Road) even produced? Richard Wolstencroft & Co. encourage their creators to believe that they give the masses what they really want, as opposed to what the cultural elite believes they want in government finance. The truth is that these brutal and forgetful unloved people receive much more critical recognition - and receive far more obscure accolades than they actually are.
