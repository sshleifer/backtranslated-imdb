A huge alien beast lands on the earth and soon devastates the population. First, he used his laser gun to release almost every person he sees and his nude claws with which he likes to rip and eat the human spleen! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's pretty stupid stuff. I have to give some points to have some fun sometimes. Actually, at first I liked the mindless fighting and some of the later over-top effects. However, it does not help if the monster only offers the most entertaining moments in the movie and it's not on screen for much of the movie's runtime. Acting is just awful and amateurish, and our main hero, Sheriff Cinder, is far too unattractive to grab the movie's hottest chick. I also have to lose points if I copied THE THING from another world (1951) several times. If the monster does not rage, NIGHTBEAST is far too boring and eventually its attacks become so repetitive and predictable that they are even less fun. Take a look at this with the 1951 THING and see the difference in terms of characterization, attention to the plot and details.
