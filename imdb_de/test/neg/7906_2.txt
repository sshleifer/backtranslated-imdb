"Soul Plane" is a terrifying attempt at a comedy that should appeal only to people with thick skulls, bloodshot eyes and furry peasants. <br /> <br /> The plot is not only incoherent, but non-existent, the acting is mostly below average, with a gang of extremely feeble-minded and terrible characters that are badly thrown in the face, never a bit amusing. This film has no structure and is full of racist stereotypes that must have been old even in the fifties. The only thing that really applies to him are pretty ladies, but really, if you want to be able to rent something from the "adult" section. OK? <br /> <br /> I can hardly recommend anything here, since you probably have a much better and more productive time chasing rats with a sledgehammer or inventing waterproof teabags or whatever. <br /> <br /> 2/10
