WARNING: I recommend anyone who has not watched the movie not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> When I first started to watch this movie, my expectation was that it was a vampire movie, given that this is a fantastic movie as Rodriguez and Tarantino helped the movie. I started about 15 minutes and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain, which shocked me. First of all, the story with which it ran was not at all sexy, and it was just boring and uncomplicated to the point where I just wanted to switch it off. I became more frustrated with this movie as it lasted longer, but I hoped it would get better ... then, when it finally showed vampires, it was very bad. I thought, "Okay, this movie started with a terrible story about those two criminals, and then VERY slowly turned into a vampire movie that I thought would be in the last 30 minutes from the beginning?" To top it off, they try to make the main characters cool and reverent, and to put an end to them when they just are not. A hare would be more intimidating than these characters! This movie is a terrible crap !!! From dawn to dawn I exposed myself and left a terrible taste in my mouth, confusing thoughts in my head and let my body unable to free themselves from the terrible shock I wasted just 108 minutes of my life for a terrific film. I do not understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, all of whom are the good and honorable actors they are, can take part in this useless filth. In my view, From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Do not look, you are doing a GREAT favor ...
