I saw this movie with my friend, an avid hip hop fan, and he was really looking forward to hearing the film's "soul" vibration. Boy, we were totally wrong. When I finished the film, I felt two things: regret and relief. Regret it because I regretted wasting my time to see that awful piece of crap and relief because I looked at it for free via cable. <br /> <br /> This movie really gives black people a bad name by dropping so many awful cliches that I believe that all smart blacks have been trying to spell everywhere. I am Asian and I am very sorry and ill for those who made this movie. What more can I say? Bad writing, even worse acting and terrible plot. <br /> <br /> Even if you are bored to death and have no choice, do not watch this movie. Serious. The movie really has nothing to offer unless you want to see things like illegal alcohol consumption, killing of animals, humiliation of women and overall: A REALLY REALLY BATH OBNOXIOUS SICKENING AWFUL FILM. Yuck
