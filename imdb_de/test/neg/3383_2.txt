What an absolute joke of a movie. The case for this film makes you believe that duel meets Jeepers Creepers meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Three good movies of your own, and you might think MM could not go wrong with their blueprint. Well, I thought so, and I was very, very wrong! <br /> <br /> We follow two college students traveling miles and miles across the desert to get married. They pick up a girl (no, she is not undressing), then they are chased by a Leatherface puller in a monster truck, which they aptly call F ** kface (AKA Monster Man). <br /> <br /> The Monster Truck I admit is a very cool vehicle, but the less than exciting chase scenes are ruining its potential. <br /> <br /> So MM decides to have a bit of grudge against these guys and chases. After a while they lose him for a while and stop at a bar with amputees. Then they go to a motel where the main character Adam is sleeping with Hitchhiker Sarah (though both are wearing underwear!). Then they get caught by MM, taken to his house, where they escape death and try to kill MM, but fail, therefore building up the sequel. Apart from a little "twist" it is. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the first 2 minutes? where Adam's friend Harley appears and hides behind Adam to scare him, without explaining how Harley was there, how long ago, or how could Adam not realize it? Without thinking that you already hate it, maybe you can enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Monster Man has very bad cinematography and a direction that is instantly daunting. This is the kind of movie you can record as one of those movies in a box of 20 horror movies you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> What's so irritating is that blockbusters feature so many of these bad quality films being filmed by some amateur movie students in digital form, and that's exactly MM (though IMDb says that this particular director Was born in 1961) movie is cruel. The script, which the author obviously found funny, is irritating and childish. You get the impression that only one draft was written before they started taking pictures. In fact, the script is stupid, a lot of the movie seems to be improvised, full of those boring, entertaining conversations that are just funny or important to the characters themselves. Imagine you had filmed yourself and your friends conversing, sure, points are funny? FOR YOU, but mostly it's garbage. So the script is for MM. <br /> <br /> Do not you care about the horror ?? It's pretty minimal and there are much better Gory movies out there (Bad Taste, Evil Dead and others?) Movie. Compare the intro of Jeepers Creepers to Monster Man's intro and you'll see what I mean.
