If you think it's good to be obsessed with who you fall in love with, then I imagine you give it a good rating ... but I can not imagine that topic of obsession and little respect for others is (such as the way Paulie treats the teachers trying to help her) is all you want to teach your children. Yeah, it's bad how Victoria treated Paulie, but you know what. So life is. Is not it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the most of your life? Or is falling from the roof a better lesson to teach our children? Secondly, when Mary's dad did not show up for dinner and Paulie helped Mary release her anger, Mary even said she wished he was dead ... Somehow I do not think that's any good news you're dealing with Disappointments through anger.
