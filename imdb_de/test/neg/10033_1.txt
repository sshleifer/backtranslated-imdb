Thank god I did not buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity, and of course, after seeing it, I feel they should be reimbursed! This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I realize they did not have a big budget, but I swear I could make a better movie than this one staring at my pets! The acting was terrible, as well as the editing, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad that it made me seriously angry when I saw it! I'm looking forward to the REAL movie about this story that will come out soon so the people who are interested in it will not have to bend down to see that joke!
