I know that my summary sounds very harsh, but this movie has a very limited appeal. The average Joe out there would have a hard time staying with this movie. The entire movie consists of animated loggers doing their work and dancing on pending logs. All of this is done with very sparkling and artistic colors, and the film could be great to show in an art museum. However, if you really love this kind of art or are a Canadian who loves movies about your homeland, this is unlikely to end. I have a pretty high tolerance for such a thing and even I had to force myself to watch after a few minutes. I can respect the work that was behind it, but it's just not compulsory.
