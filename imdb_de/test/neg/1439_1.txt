Oh, where the hell am I supposed to start? Give a short summary of the story? No, either you already heard it or you do not want it. Either way, it's shit. Similar to the movie. I happen to be a half-size horror movie fanatic, and I have to say that this is one of the dumbest and awkward films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is terribly stupid. The story begins too fast, in the least, without any tension or accumulation. All these torture scenes would have been MUCH more effective if we had given the characters even a tiny crap. Since the first scene in the film, the teen girls meet Capt. Howdy, how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them? First, they seem stupid because they go to a party with a guy they do not even know, and second, we do not know their damn names! Why the hell should I care if they live or die? Not to mention the fact that they really have the guts to try to get us to capt. Howdy to make sympathetic after being "reformed"? YOU'RE WELCOME! I cheered when he only got his deserts! He deserves it! Damn it, he deserves worse! Also, we're forced to sit in a pointless, wrong directional sequence that's straight out of "The Silence of the Lambs" (and here's terrible done). Of course he will give you a wrong address! Even if he gave them the right one, do not you think he would wait and not punch Johnson up? KEEP!) <br /> <br /> Then there is the dialogue. Anything Captain Howdy says is either ridiculous or just stupid. "The dead are so terribly dead when they are dead"? What's that crap ?! Dee Snider once said, "Knowledge is power." Well, if that's true, this movie has absolutely no power. <br /> <br /> Then there are the plotting holes. Yes, I know, this is a horror movie (well, wannabeible horror movie), but damn! You could drive a semitrailer into these holes! First of all, these must be the DUMBEST policemen I've ever seen! JE !! I mean, dear God, these guys are idiots! Request for support, idiots! Second, how the hell did this humorous septum ring fall from Captain Howdy's nose ?! This piercing expert clearly says "this is the biggest I've ever seen", but if it's so damn big, how could it have been so easy? Does Capt. Howdy left it at the scene because he wanted to get trapped? They certainly did not do it as if he did. Besides, they would NEVER Capt. Howdy's publishing, and I know that from a damned fact. He would be in jail for the rest of his life and there is no way around it. Much less did he return to his old house where he killed / tortured everyone. IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPLAUSIBLE. <br /> <br /> And now the acting. Dear God, these people suck. Linda Cardellini is the only good thing in this movie. She is ready and incredible. Too bad she barely has a chance to play in this bitch. Amy Smart appears for about 10 minutes and then fails. Even the most entertaining Robert Englund is little used here and ineffective. Dee Snider plays the crazy guy with no talent. I never felt threatened, scared or intimidated. I would rather have seen Dee Snider in Alexis Arquette's role in "Bride of Chucky". It would have been so much more fun to see this talentless hack of this loveable psycho doll. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider is just shit. He can not play (one of the scariest villains I've ever seen), he can not write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?), And he's obviously stupider than Jessica Simpson! This movie is just one way for Dee Snider to show off all the weird crap he knows about self-mutilation and modern primitives and Blah-Blah-Blah. Either it was done before or it simply did not have to be done. I was bored with the whole damn thing. <br /> <br /> The acting is shit, the music is shit, the script sucks, the tempo sucks, the special FX suck, the director sucks ... basically this movie is shit. This movie tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller / horror movie and it fails miserably. It does not manage to scare, shock or disturb in any way, way. This is probably one of the least effective and totally unoriginal films I've ever seen in my entire life. A piece of cinematic garbage on celluloid. <br /> <br /> "Strangeland" receives a 0 out of 10. Avoid at all costs. In the least not pleasing.
