A truly wonderful cast and a very talented technical crew wereted their valuable career time and equally valuable free time by taking the trouble to support this highly predictable and downright formal piece of commercial garbage. The film is based on a really good and up-to-date idea, but both the producers and the director have simply used the standard formula of the Hollywood disaster movie, ruining the potential value of the production. <br /> <br /> An unusually high tide Tides and very strong storm conditions create a record high tide that overwhelms London and floods most of the Thames Valley. At the heart of the plot is a heroic scientist (Tom Courtenay) who alerts the authorities to the danger and saves the day, a glamorous police chief who runs the entire show, and a contested Deputy Prime Minister (David Suchet) who tries to be important look. <br /> <br /> But it's all so unreal that you feel like an extended tea break after just 30 minutes. The young glamorous police officer demands full authority over the army in a state of emergency and receives it (as if!). The experienced general is simply pushed aside like an idiot who has to lick her boots because of her obviously superior skills. The problem is that our Mother Superior, now responsible for millions of lives, spent most of her time worrying about the fate of her two daughters, who were traveling to southwest London and did not call to say that they were okay. That's why our powerful wife sets out to find her and decides that the sole priority for the entire army and the emergency services must be in southwest London and not in another district. Of course, the minister, the army and the entire entourage accept their prioritization without question. One can only assume that they had all possessions there. When her children are finally found after endless reports and efforts by her staff, she tells our male hero, "Thank God, they're safe, that's the main thing." Do not mind the millions of others or all the other responsibilities she should control; As long as her own children were safe, everything was fine. <br /> <br /> This movie is just another excuse to push the same old female chauvinist sexist gossip trap that women are the wise, mindful, caring and clearly capable leaders, while men are for nothing but physical bravery, mindless strength and mental skills are good very special knowledge. And yet the only simple instruction she could have given to the population; To go to the next tall building and quietly go to the fourth floor or above to get instructions when the water goes down, it was never given by this female superheroine - or even by anyone else. The whole problem was so easy to solve, yet millions of people did not seem to mind going up! Poor garbage.
