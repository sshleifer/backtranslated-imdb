New Orleans is not as it is portrayed in this <br /> <br /> debacle of a movie. Quaid's attempt to use a Cajun accent (by the way, hardly anyone speaks in New Orleans Orleans) is terrible. Action = elemental and mindless. This <br /> <br /> image refers to itself as a puzzle, but a puzzle involves a <br /> <br /> gradual process in which a viewer gets hints and phrases throughout the movie. There is nothing here. "Big <br /> <br /> Easy" tries to get along with the trivial stereotypes of New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled - the real Big Easy is nothing like the city where Quaid & Barkin find their way around.
