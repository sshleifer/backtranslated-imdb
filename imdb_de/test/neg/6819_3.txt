I'm sure this movie had its funny moments with the Sat Question People and I know the movie should not be completely credible. The film made it too disgusting, for example, a girl like this would never go out with a man in a million years That the people in the film had lackluster performances, the acting was so bad. The conspiracy would have been bad as well, they could at least have had a better job for the script, and focused more on the comedy. The comedy was also a bit dry and was really boring after the first jokes, it was as if 10 minutes had been a laugh, as if it is old. This end began to begin. The bottom line, if you want to mix a little lackluster drama with a dumb plot and a romance, go ahead and watch this movie.
