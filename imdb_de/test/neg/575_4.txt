First and foremost, Blythe Danner does not look old enough to play Capshaw's daughter (and in fact she is not - just ten years apart). I understand that this should be one of those magical moon-thrust romances but that's beyond the pale. Very, very weak in terms of acting, screenplay and directing. <br /> <br /> The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this movie worth seeing - though not really believable as she looks like a heterosexual sex dog. But still adorable. In fact, DeGeneres and the skin photos of the young man Capshaw makes with them make that impression. But no one really can say whether Capshaw really loves the young man or not; Neither the script nor her acting pulls it together for us and we wonder how she really feels.
