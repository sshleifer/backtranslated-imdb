I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview that made me hell. But when I saw the actual movie, I was disappointed. Acting is stilted, and the comedy's attempts are miserably out of place and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy who's being chased by a feces in a bedpan is neither funny nor scary, just stupid. I grew up with the Bell Witch legend, so I know a lot about it. Many facts in the movie are just right, but this movie should have been a lot better. For example, the entire birthday party scene lasts about fifteen minutes, does not add anything to the storyline or story, and should have been on the tailor's floor. A hard-core editor would have been able to make a decent movie out of this mess. and I'm not trying to "attack" this IMDb list. I just say it as it is.
