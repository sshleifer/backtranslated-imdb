What begins as a passable film degenerates into one of the most incoherent, most careless, incompetent, stupid attempted horror films of recent years. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible. It's such a confused mess that pulls off any decent fright movie you can think of without a single fear. Be it copying the latest trend with creepy children or ghosts passing the camera or the old horror of Fulci's Gates of Hell. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that not even a cat jumps out of a closet you leap. Be avoided.
