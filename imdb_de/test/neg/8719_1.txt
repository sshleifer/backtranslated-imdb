If you have never read the classic science-fiction novel on which this mini-series is based, this may actually be good. Unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you probably can not see more than the first one to two hours. All political intrigues were taken out of the film, the most important scenes from the book were taken out, the motivations of the characters were completely changed and words from the wrong characters were put into the mouth. Where in the novel Paul Atredies was a teenage boy with incredible political skills and a great understanding of how the world works, in this film he is hot and frustrated. Avoid this movie at all costs.
