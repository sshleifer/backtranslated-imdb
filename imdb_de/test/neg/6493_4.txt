This is a very mediocre Jackie Chan movie, and one of his absolute worst James Glickenhaus ruined him! I think all the characters are decent, but the story is that way, but Jackie Chan is still amazing, even if he looks bored. Jackie and Danny Aiello did not have any chemistry together and it was often boring, but the final was above average and it was entertaining and had some good stunts! I have not seen the Hongkong version yet, but I'm sure she's better than this guy, and the turn is very predictable! It's really lifeless and boring, and I do not blame Jackie for not looking happy. The opening is meant to be memorable, but I have never seen it and done it better, and I thought the whole movie was pretty lazy and could have been a great movie if Jackie had been in control! And I really does not root for any of the characters. This is a very mediocre Jackie Chan movie, and one of his absolutely worst James Glickenhaus has ruined it !, even for the Hard Jackie Chan fans not recommended. The direction is terrible! James Glickenhaus is doing a terrible job here, with extremely camera-like camerawork, bad angles and a mostly boring movie. The spectacle is like this. Jackie Chan is as usual AMAZING, but he is not his usual energetic self, and he looks bored through the whole movie and has no chemistry with Danny Aiello. (Jackie rules !!!!!). Danny Aiello is okay, as Jackie's partner, but his character is a bit stupid and he did not have chemistry with Jackie, he did OK, I guess. Roy Chiao is decent as the main villain, but just made the moves and was not too threatening, but he is still damn cool. The rest of the cast is average at best. Overall your time or your money is not worth it. * 1/2 of 5
