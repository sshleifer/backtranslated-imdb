Why can not there be better TV movies? I was in a loose end today and watched this movie in the UK on a satellite channel. What a terrible waste of time. Bad sets, bad acting and oh my god, what a terrible flood. Blimey, this woman can even overtake a torrent of water! <br /> <br /> I really wish that people would make TV movies with better effects, better or at least more credible plots and far better acting. Killer Flood is good at bad acting. A few pieces of ham could not seem worse. <br /> <br /> Finally, I really agree with the comment about the dog, but I think it would be a little bit risky in real life!
