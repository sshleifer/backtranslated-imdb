This documentary was not created professionally or objectively. The whole thing played out like a conspiracy theory from IBM to win the game in question, only to earn some money. Garry Kasparov has an ego problem. He was bloated before the match and when he lost, he did not like it. I remember playing chess against computers in the 80's, and it was not that difficult to win. Over time I started losing and did not like it. Today I just do not play computer anymore because they are just too good. Not only that, the games are uninteresting and they lack the allure of human games where both sides are more wrong and open up the game with exciting possibilities. This documentary shows us again and again images of The Turk, an ancient automatic chess machine, which was really controlled by a human. From the beginning to the end, we believe that IBM literally hid a human GM behind its cupboard computer. I'm a computer scientist and annoyed that IBM must have cheated just because Garry lost. I know how computers play chess. It is not magic and not a mystery. They can be trained, have a great knowledge of chess, and see positions and opportunities compared to people with unprecedented levels of detail. It's really no surprise that Deep Blue won. Maybe it was then. If this were the case today, given the ever-increasing computing power of machines; People would hardly blink. If a machine could not at least draw with a GM today, people would think the program was weak.
