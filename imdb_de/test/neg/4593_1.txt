"Bacon" was apparently a biography related to the serial killer Richard Bacon. However, there is not much murder in this movie and none of it is explicitly shown. Perhaps the most troubling scene in the entire film is when bacon kills one of the eight unlucky nurses in their own bathtub, but even this is merely implied and is not shown, except for some unconvincing imprints of Mr. Speck's leg. The most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the dubbing, which should prove the boring nature of this movie. Every aspect of this movie is terrible. If you are not bored, do not bother. This movie only starts at 72 minutes, but it feels like an eternity.
