Without John Rhys-Davies, I have to admit that this would never register on my film counter. But despite that fact, this is not a bad thriller considering the low budget, low quality effects, stark drama and aspects of the sci-fi channel. The effects on the blood are very convincing, and the chupacabra actually looks realistic ... Regardless of what you think, a chupacabra looks like a good-looking chupacabra. <br /> <br /> Apart from the positive effects, this somehow runs away Like Kolchak: The Night Stalker (Darren McGavin, remember?) hits the love boat, but despite the ultimate cheese of this work, it still contains something that Actually resembles and actually tries to gain your respect while making you laugh and roll your eyes. <br /> <br /> As conflicting as this work is, I still enjoyed it. You may too. <br /> <br /> It rates a 5.2 / 10 rate on the Made 4 TV scale. <br /> <br /> It rates a 4.1 / 10-rate on the movie scale of ... <br /> the Fiends :.
