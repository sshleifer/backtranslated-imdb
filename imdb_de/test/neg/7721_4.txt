"House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" (2005) is the sequel, though you really do not have to see the first "House of the Dead" to get this movie. However, the production value is definitely here, with great zombie effects and beautifully crafted, with very effective sound design. However, that's all that's good here. <br /> <br /> The story and the script are terrible. , , There are blatant plotter holes everywhere. It's also funny that the soldiers do not mind if they have blood on their faces (as opposed to 28 days later, when blood in any part of the body infects you). Realistically, too, how little here is the order of the soldiers, in contrast to the usual discipline of the US military. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10 points.
