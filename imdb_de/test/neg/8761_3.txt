"Revenge of the Zombies" is a pretty weak and barely walkable zombie effort. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Traveling the Bayou, Larry Adams (Robert Lowery) and Scott Warrington (Mauritz Hugo) find out about a friend's death. At a meeting with dr. From Altermann (John Carradine) he repeats the idea that they died mysteriously. While they are there, they discover that the help is made up of zombies, reviving dead people who are doing their Lord's bidding. As the bodies pile up, he reveals that he has made the creatures for various experiments and everyone is trying to stop him before it's too late. <br /> <br /> The good news: Little is right here. The opening is simply the best as she has some good grades. From where the creepy silhouettes go through the darkness to the revelations, these wonders work for both the mystery and the grand imagery. The big scene is a scene where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long, slow and scary shot. These are all made before the opening balance and are a fun sight. The scenes in the middle where the creature awakens in the casket are pretty cool and look really great. The last big plus is the really funny ending. With this kind of ending reminiscent of so many universal experiments, it fits into this style. From the scary revival to real action near the wetlands, this game is fun and really works with the others to achieve only positive results. <br /> <br /> The bad news: This one has only a few bugs but they are the most important ones. The first is the boredom of the movie due to inactivity. Almost nothing happens here, mainly because of the tendency to do everything with talking and not with anything else. There are only intermittent scenes that are banished to the zombies, but here there is nothing that gives the film any action. This just has no action, and that hurts the movie. It rarely produces scenes of interest, and sometimes it feels a lot longer than it really is. The last flaw in the movie is the pathetic apologies for zombies. Those who are used to more modern fare will have a hard time getting scared of these creatures, and they really only serve several scenes. Here, the zombies are not treated as a threat, which makes them even less scary. Few screen times, non-threatening nature and unfashionable behavior of these zombies really destroy this. This has really hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: With bad zombies and little to see, this one is a weird effort. Those who are used to modern zombies will find little interest in this and come out just like this, while only classic horror fans have the chance to try it out. <br /> <br /> Today's rating PG: Mild violence
