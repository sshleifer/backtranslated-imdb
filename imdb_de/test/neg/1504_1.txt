A lesson on how to make a bad movie disguised as horror. Without going too close, I would imagine that these are the results of a series of film students who put everything into the story and then actually act in it! It's like a kind of film workshop and a movie that desperately needs an editor. In this case, it would have taken 10 minutes! The director of this garbage probably had more money than sense. Consider the number of screenplays or even unpublished films that would have benefited. The so-called Granny, who killed humans in a rather silly way, looked like Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future - or maybe the musicians Johnny Winter / Edgar Winter. It starts with 20 minutes of boring, boring nonsense being injected by the students - something about paranoia. Giving this trash is 1 because he can not get less. There is not just one salvation feature - and if one of the girls keeps the body on the blood-soaked ground for the cheater, then she has to worry about actually TASTEING the red stuff before she knows it's not tomato ketchup ! It's an insult to the intelligence of an idiot
