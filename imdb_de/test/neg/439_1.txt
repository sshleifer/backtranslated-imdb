Well, what can one say about a "horror comedy" that contains neither horror nor comedy? There are no characters in the film, but far too many lines of action - all underdeveloped and mostly superfluous. <br /> <br /> The computer-generated creatures look bad, a bit like Disney versions of oversized, tailless rats. The walking dead are, apart from the title, the biggest rip-off that should look like the dead in Landis' film, but are a long way off. They just look like bad actors with a touch of plastic and bull's blood. <br /> <br /> Two lines of action showed really promising behavior (love story and "company history"), but failed as well as the director. the writers, the SFX department, the production and the actors.
