I think the problem with some of the reactions to this movie is that, with a few exceptions, they are not focusing on the main break, hence the main audience split. <br /> <br /> On the one hand Those who take the visual design, the pretty costumes and the various elements of the film. Some children's movie fans love the colors and animations as well as all the weird "magical" effects, shape-changing animals and so on. Some culture lovers like the complicated references, the overlapping of various folklore elements and the fact that they can sing Zhang Ziyi and see quasi-miming in two different languages, which should be a kiddie comedy. <br /> On the other hand, there are people who say that a children's film should still have a point, that a mix of fairy tales is not a story at all, and that it is easier to believe in magic when there is enough thought and care gone into the technical aspects to make it real , <br /> <br /> In other words, the ideas could be irritating; But if you put them on stage, they have to deliver. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> A good fairy tale - from any country - has a clear story, a point and characters that interact strongly with each other. That is missing for all of them. A few exaggerated gestures for the opera, Western and Japanese, are no substitute for a solid theme. As a fantasy fan, I have to say that I've eaten some turkeys and loved some. but this one is really trying too hard - cheap. If you use Zhang Ziyi, he tries to add a little glittering smell of exotic flower syndrome. The other problem is not that there is no conspiracy. There is half an action, which means that you are constantly drawn in and then dropped again, as another, not too sharp dance number begins. <br /> <br /> The characters all seem to know that they are starring in a movie. Unless you really like other people's amateur video, but that's not good. I want to test that on real kids. I think they would drop it in heaven after about 20 minutes for uproar.
