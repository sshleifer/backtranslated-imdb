This movie contains all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. Only a few films can really worry me. He did it. Few horror films give me a sense of fear. He did it. It let me guess. I was interested in the story. I took care of the characters. The acting was decent. About halfway through the film, unfortunately, the story does not have many good directions. It becomes obvious that everything cool about the plot destroys itself. It does. What develops in the first half as a big horror concept, shifts away from the horror in the direction of the absurd. A plausible fear becomes a series of implausible reactions of the characters. The story ends with disappointment. While this movie seems complete, there is a loose ending that could be set up for a sequel. The movie is not good enough for a sequel. This movie is worth seeing in the theater. Do not expect that you are stunned. This is best suited as a movie to borrow. It's probably not a movie you want to own.
