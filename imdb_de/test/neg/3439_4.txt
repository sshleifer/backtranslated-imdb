You get Braindead for an hour and a half, I have to completely save the world trade, a liner and a woman somewhere in the equation. This time he plays a man who helps people with the witness protection program. To quote the cover of the film. He erases their past to save their future. Woppi, that must be cool :) I bet younger people will like it, but it's a bit over the top for my taste. And the one-liners are really different, and I do not mean that well. After killing a crocodile, he manages to say it. "They are luggage" If you are in the right mood, you can enjoy the movie. And as for the braindead action, this is not very bad. But before the movie starts, you'll know exactly what's going to happen. But if you like these kinds of movies, you will probably enjoy them. I rate this movie as 4
