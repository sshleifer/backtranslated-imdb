"Stealing Time" actually dates back to 2001, when it was mysteriously called "Rennie's Landing". This explains how director Marc Fusco could afford this cast of established television and movie actors in an obviously extremely low budget production. After about ten minutes in the movie, you realize why this thing never got a theatrical release after shooting the film festival a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Franchise Pictures' recently released distribution is likely to reflect the perception that the rising popularity of certain performers may be milked to cover some of the modest production costs. Although it's not a great addition to anyone's CV, young actors have done worse things than they've desperately sought for acting. Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley and Charlotte Ayanna are playing college friends who are doing an early "big chill" reunion and comparing war stories about the failure of reality to fulfill their dreams. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. Yes, Alec (Facinelli) dreams of an alcohol business and a bank robbery, which is then "cheap and lame" staged to completely inappropriate music. It is the least exciting banking job since W.C. Fields was the guard in "The Bank Dick." <br /> <br /> If anyone in "Stealing Time" can show any moment in which something "actually" happens, I would like to know, because as far as I can tell, nothing happens throughout the movie. Fusco may be trying to say something more profoundly through incessant visual reflections, taking control of his life before it's too late. Like "St. Elmo's Fire," the film is littered with every profound thought expressed by a young adult who has left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time. <br /> <br /> I felt like Fusco was there for some kind of Howard Hawks Young Professionals in action "Only Angels Have Wings". On the other hand, I'm sure I read too much into the movie. After all, things actually happen to Howard Hawks movies. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
