This script was a bit original in 1935, but the poor performance and the uneven level of quality make it impossible to recommend it. Some of the vignettes are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is never natural. Some of the plot changes were creative, but I was very surprised that it was so highly rated here in the IMDB. A few scenes pay off, it's a movie that entertains completely. If you like this kind of montage, do not run and let Tales of Manhattan (1942) tell a wonderful movie that describes the life and times of a cover.
