Solange is not a big Italian thriller. Get ready for the spoiler - the main suspect, the professor, did not do it. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know that he could not have been the killer from the beginning. he and a student were witnesses of the first murder. So there is absolutely no reason if the professor is the killer or not. The final explanation of the mystery is long and tedious. The solution is interesting, but comes from nowhere. The rest of the movie (and it's not a short film) just is not exciting enough to spark your interest. Even in the tradition of the "false man" is denied because the police never seriously accused the professor and the murderer is never after him. Dull, dull, dull.
