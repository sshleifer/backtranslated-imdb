As with most viewers of this film, I am an avid reader of the books. The first two films feature Buck, Ray and Chloe as protagonists, but in this second installment they play the second role after the efforts of Louis Gossett JR. World at War is based on the meeting with Buck in the book series. <br /> <br /> The problem is - this movie is as horrible as the first two. Amanda appears out of nowhere and suddenly has a significant role to play (I will not reveal it if someone does not read the series). Other illogical parts are available. I really want Cloud 10 to make a good Left Behind movie, but unfortunately this resembles the bad guys the first two.
