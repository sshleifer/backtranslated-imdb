I saw this movie once in 1959 on a kiddie matinee at the North Park Theater in San Diego when it was released and I was eleven years old. It was one of three features shown that day. <br /> <br /> I have not seen it since then, but I wanted it because I'm a movie fan and appreciate the horrible along with the great, good and average movies. Consisting of children between 8 and 15 years, the tree monster laughed with laughter. <br /> <br /> A triple calculation in a theater with 3 adventure films is something an 11 year old does not forget, but I can not remember the names of the other 2 films. (One of the stars was George Montgomery and David Farrar.) <br /> <br /> UPDATE: The other two films in this treble were much better. They were "Watusi", 1959, starring George Montgomery and David Farrar and "The Angry Red Planet", 1959, starring Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden. Ms. Hayden has also written a couple of health and fitness books.
