Another movie that punishes us for the crime of "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> If you like seeing people killed for one and a half hours by machine gun fire, this is probably the bill. Fans of the debut episode of "Aeon Flux", in which the title character literally beats thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers alone, will really do it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's not exactly a smart movie. In fact, everything is an excuse for a group of young people to act rude and shoot people. Sometimes an entire scene passes and the only thing that happens is you guessed it! someone is shot Or, to freshen things up, twenty people are shot dead. At first they just sit there, the next minute they sit dead. Rough act: A young American goes to Paris (an American in Paris, do you understand?), Hires a prostitute (the ethereal Julie Delpy) and gets in touch with some old French friends who have AIDS, they plan and try a bank robbery. Of course, the film convention says that no bank robberies happen without problems in the film, and this accumulation takes about three-quarters of the time (it's like "Dog Day Afternoon" without the joke, patience or humanity of Sidney Lumet). In the bank, things go awry (surprise!) And the Parisian with AIDS messes with his Uzi several hundred times. No spoilers here, but suffice to say that you are so emotionally distanced from these characters that you probably will not care who lives and who dies at the end of the movie. Some have called it stylish. Maybe that's it, but it's the style of another, it's a movie that's already been done, and "Killing Zoe" is trapped by convention. Nowhere in the film does the director (Roger Avary, co-winner of the screenplay Oscar "Pulp Fiction") do anything truly original, stylish, funky or outrageous. If you do not take into account the fact that no movie that took place in a bank had such a high body count, there is nothing else that makes this movie stand out from the crowd.
