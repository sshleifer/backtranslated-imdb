Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so horrible that I could not help giggling disbelieving in the whole movie that I actually saw something so crappy. Ha ha. The audio editing is terrible. They try too hard to develop creative camera angles. Because they are just funny and stupid. The script was shit. The spectacle was terrible, the plot was not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it's a 20 year old movie ... so I'll give it a bonus point for it. And yes, the music was terrible. But we all have to start somewhere. And submitting these things is so tedious. At least 10 lines ... trouble. Well, I know now why I could not find this movie in the movie shop. I had to buy it offline to see it. Good that it was only $ 0.48, although the shipping was $ 2.59. Well ... I do not recommend anyone to waste time and money watching this movie ...
