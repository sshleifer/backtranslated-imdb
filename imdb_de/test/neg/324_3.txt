In Halloween, three friends are looking for fun in an old cemetery in the suburbs and remove a cross from a grave where Jack-O was buried many years ago by farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is unleashed, killing the trio and seeking the revenge of the descendants of the Kelly family. <br /> <br /> The cheesy "Jack-O" is a combination of a terrible story with terrible actors. I was curious about the name John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive material in such a bad movie that the respect for the name of this great actor is completely inadequate. It's amazing how bad acting is, rather than turning the proposed horror genre into a comedy. This is the kind of movie that goes well with a group of friends drinking beer, making comments and laughing a lot. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jack-O ?? Dem√¥nio do Halloween" ("Jack-O? Demon of Halloween")
