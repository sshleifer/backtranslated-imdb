Stay away from this movie! It's terrible in every way. Bad spectacle, a thin recycling plot and the worst end of film history. Rarely do I watch a movie that makes my adrenalin out of irritation. In fact, the only other movie that immediately springs to my mind is another movie "People in a plane in trouble" (Airspeed). Please, please do not look at them, as they are absolutely and completely pathetic from beginning to end. Helge Iversen
