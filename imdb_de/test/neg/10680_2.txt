As the main character "Lillith Silver" she wants to point out - "You know everything about vampires". It is obvious that this statement was addressed to the performers and the crew, who create a very poor picture of all the blood-sucking favorite underpants of all. According to the misdirected director, vampires are all baked in white and penned in latex, similar to a piece of meat in shrink wrap. With fangs resembling bannanas and a bad case of asthma, our main character Lillith creates a slapstick caricature of the "modern day" vampire. The plot consists of a 9-year-old Playstation collection for boys, who is on a branch a piece of paper, then mingled with this terrible story. Lillith, our pale protagonist, is a vampire bounty hunter who lives on digging out members of everyone's favorite cult, the Illuminati! Instead of integrating the classic assassination method of stealth and precision, Lillith rolls in through an open window and then begins to chew on her targets before being shot at with a handgun). PC Plod is then assigned to solve the murders, coming to the grizzly but strikingly obvious conclusion that Lillith is actually a vampire and armed with the usual vampire-posting tools, including a cross, garlic and a sharpened piece of wood. Meanwhile, Lillith, who has made a habit of exploiting her boss, is upset when an old Nemesis crushes him and demands that a ransom be delivered in person. As you can imagine, this is not going according to plan. However, I will not submit to the pain of the following scenes, so I'm going over to the end. Lillith and her "Nemesis" have a showdown, and after Lillith has won the victory, he is revealed, with all the extravagance someone is told to have cancer, that the two are centuries old lovers and the whole story a twisted one Game was. Yes, this kick in the balls was the real end of the movie. In my opinion, this joke of conclusion is the icing on the cake covered with latex and seals this movie in the vault "Never look". <br /> <br /> When it comes to film techniques, the movie is just a movie and does not bother creating a style. The director tries to save his disaster from the abyss by taking some close-ups and a few multi-angle shots. However, this is not the salvation the movie needs. <br /> <br /> You could scream, "but this is a B-movie that's supposed to be crap!" But I have no sympathy. I've seen some popping B movies, like Evil Dead 2 and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, so this shame can not hide behind apologies. The budget was low. This is evident by the lack of location and good actors. However, if the director were more creative and spent less on makeup and bad blood, he could have done something decent with this disgusting attempt. The dodgy sex scenes are in no way beneficial and just served to entertain me with the obscene acting arts. Half of the budget must have been paid to the female cast just because she got her tips for lesbian drums. If I wanted to see a vampire porn, I would have bought Muffy The Vampire Layer. <br /> <br /> The cast is bad, the story is worse and the effects are paralyzed. There was some potential in this film, but its uncomfortable undertones and the embarrassing depiction of a classic horror character merely served as sinking. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a laugh with some friends, I recommend you to watch this mockery. If you're looking for a more serious vampire action movie, try Blade or Underworld to soothe your raging blood rush.
