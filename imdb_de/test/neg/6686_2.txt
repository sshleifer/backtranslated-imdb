There was a lot of hype around the movie and the ad made it look like it was great. Sad as Bring It On 2, Bring It On 3 shames fame of the original Bring It On. There are shameless clich√©s throughout the movie. The lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film. The appearance of Hayden Panattiere was of minor importance in both acting and cheerleading. There were several scenes in which I literally wobbled because I was embarrassed for the cast because the scene (lines, storyline, etc.) was just so stupid. My recommendation to the creators of future Bring It On movies is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them acting because the "cast" of the cast was disgusting and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the movie. Only great character: Kirresha.
