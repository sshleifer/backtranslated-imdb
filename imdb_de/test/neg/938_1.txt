I saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they got better movies than this, because this movie did not fulfill any of the hopes the audience could entertain, from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, to simpler desires like decent acting, coherent directing character development or actual production values. The film has been plagued by film school effects such as stills showing moments of emotional distress and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2. This film failed on almost every level to thrill the audience. After the first twenty minutes of bravely trying to take it seriously, the audience collectively threw their hands together and just started enjoying the film's inherent crappiness. I might be upset that I paid $ 9 for it, and it was two hours I'll never get back, but on the other hand it was a fun two hours I'll never get back. This would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.
