The movie is a bit entertaining, but the biggest feature is Shalom Harlow's ridiculous performance. It's been 4 years since this movie was released, and hopefully Harlow has gone through more training. Maybe she should stay with the more worldly, somewhat corrupt characters she has spawned in other performances.
