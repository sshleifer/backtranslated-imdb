I think I win the "bargain" contest for this film, as I received it for $ 20 as part of a "Martial Arts Movie Classics" DVD collection of 50 films, which means I get about 50 cents for the chance paid to watch the movie "Black Fist" version of a movie released as "Bogard". <br /> <br /> For a simple "revenge punch", "Black Fist" is not too bad, even though it's obviously hampered by a low budget. One of my informal "rules of thumb" for watching a movie is that the movie automatically gets at least three stars if the lead actor is better than his production and screenplay. That's certainly the case here. Lawson has some presence and some charisma and probably deserves a better movie career than he does. <br /> <br /> The street fighting choreography (the apparent reason for the movie) will not impress anyone who has ever trained in a martial arts school or just been beaten in a school fight. I've only spent about two years learning basic kung fu, but even I would never be tempted by the front "punch" throws, arm drops, and roundhouse punches shown here. But the atmosphere is good - dust, blood, and screaming crowds, and the actors give the fight scenes a feel. Less credible is the conspiracy. Dawson's character "Leroy Fisk" is portrayed as a street-smart, keen young man looking for work as a pick-me-up in illegal, unrestrained street fighting. Nevertheless, he is surprised and outraged when he has to pay the cops. Excuse me, but I grew up in the small town of Iowa and even knew that I had to pay the cops for this kind of action, and that the guys who fight need Fixer to get their matches, and the fixers do Worth the money. So you have to look at this movie with some kind of intentional suspension of your critical abilities to accept it as a "black brother being oppressed". (Most other non-black fighters in the stable are also hit in the face for the same deal, yes?). <br /> <br /> The film suffers from a short attention span. The director obviously did not have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed, so he had to fill in the gaps with pretty ridiculous exhibition scenes just does not work) along with voice-overs and montages that are awkward and unconvincing. This is especially true for the entire angle of the romance, which was filmed apparently retrospectively. This is a bit shabby, considering that the death of "Fisks" wife should yield his revenge. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the movie rises from "Young Fighter Through the Turnaround" To the revenge theme it counts some steam and plays with a little more conviction. I'm not sure the final payoff is worth it - Roger Ebert calls it "a long drive for a short day on the beach" ... but it does things in a reasonably satisfying way. <br /> <br /> If Sylvester Stallone had filmed this movie with a real budget and cast, slicker sets and costumes, as well as herself as a hero, people would have hailed him as the next "Rocky" show how Circumstances and chance can spoil the dreams of aspiring filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look at various decent punches and lines and see how Dabney Coleman embarrasses himself in a role that lies beneath him.
