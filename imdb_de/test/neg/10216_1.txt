I really should give this stinker more credit than 1 star, because the movie has so many stunning lines that it's almost worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Acting, if you want to call it that, is so stilted and invented that it makes Ed Wood's actor come alive. "Sammy," the only black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in her other films, but he has no acting skills. His lines are priceless because of his absurd delivery, though I suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character. His old man in her other turkey ("Pushed To The Limit") is no-budget, junior high school quality, with eyebrows made of cotton ball and white, spray-sprayed hair Buy this video, unless people want theirs own Mystery Science Theater parties host and need a copy of something similar to hand. It's really Beyond Fear - it's actually Beyond Funny.
