A 'Wes Craven presents' film from 1995 directed by Joe Clayton with Lance Henriksen. A group of scientists are rescuing a dying man they find from their desert outpost of the government by injecting him with their experimental virus. Of course, one of her colleagues goes overboard and the virus turns the man into an almost unstoppable monster in which they are locked up. Lance Henriksen plays the morally offended researcher who leaves the project before all this, but after receiving a call for help to save the man (in front of an unstoppable mutation machine), he returns. Deciding to Combine Two Travels He brings his family (they go on vacation afterward) and gives them entry into the top secret government facility, which puts them in the midst of chaos. If you can not know, the viewer relies on working a bit with the viewer and putting aside a few insignificant (see: big and blatant) details. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, with milder views bits of enjoyment. Note: The outpost is commonly known as the Mind Ripper.
