I have seen the Mogul Video VHS of it. This is another of those old distributors from the 1980s whose catalog I wish I had! Although the title "Do not look at the attic" is the main reminder that is repeated in it: "Do not go to the villa." It is not a good idea to stay in the grounds of the villa. A character goes to the attic only an hour after the movie and should have done it sooner, what is learned there. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Turin, Italy, in the 1950s. Two men fight and a woman tells them the villa is forcing them to do so. One man kills the other and then regrets it, and the woman pulls the knife out and stabbed him with it. She flees the villa and after leaving a chair she moves on her own (what does that mean?), But when in the garden a hand comes through the floor and pulls it into the ground. <br /> <br /> From there it is today, thirty years later. There is a s√©ance that appears suddenly and apparently has nothing to do with the film. The children of the woman from the prologue inherit the house. The main daughter is played by the same actress who also played her mother. At least one of the two men from the prologue also seems to find himself as another character. She is being dogged by warnings not to go to the villa, but they all do, because if they do not use it, they lose it. People die. A lawyer who has won all his cases, tries to enlighten a little. The end is pretty bad. Why was the family cursed? An unfortunately boring movie. <br /> <br /> At the back of the video box is an amusing, small-print disclaimer that says "The scenes pictured on this box may look like an artist's impression and may not necessarily correspond to the actual scenes of the film movie." In this case, the lid of the box is an illustration that more or less accurately represents the above-mentioned woman being pulled into the ground, though there are two hands and the woman is different. True, sometimes the cover has nothing to do with the movie. I also remember a reviewer with a bad film predictor scale, where movies with illustrations on the cover instead of photos got at least one point.
