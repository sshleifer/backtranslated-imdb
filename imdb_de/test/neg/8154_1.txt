The only thing I expected from this movie was a smart, talking motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This movie is just awful. I gave him a star, which of course means I enjoyed it tremendously. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad fight choreography. The only real actor in this film is Martin Landau, who of course plays the villain, though the character is your usual evil CEO / villain. Even the so-called "Plot Twist" at the end was not a shock. <br /> <br /> There was so much to laugh about in this movie, I really enjoyed it. And there were a few impressive car accidents. <br /> <br /> Like bad movies? Look at that, ouch. Do you want a good movie? Not here.
