A couple moves into their dream home, unaware that it and its neighbors were built over land that was formerly used as a cemetery. The film is said to have referred to a true story, although it is not known how much of it should be true. The plot is hardly unique - see "Poltergeist" by Spielberg (1982). Within a short time, they experience various supernatural phenomena ranging from the disturbing - mysterious shadows, the daughter's grave illness - to the ridiculous toilets, which are constantly flushing and the doors get out of control. There is little depth in the story: as soon as it turns out that the land was used as a cemetery, we learn nothing more. The plot does not seem to develop. The characters are not very well drawn or memorable in any way and the atmosphere is not special either. The film could be disturbing for some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message.
