End of Days is one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. Confused direction, intricate script with lame dialogues and gaping pluto holes, fast editing in MTV style and bad behavior. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that End of Days is not visible. The movie interested me because I found Ah-nuld's latest action movie ridiculously silly because he was so incompetent and stupid when it came to logic. Without the sense of logic, the movie dies faster, which is why End of Days earned a huge nightfall in the second week after opening in the US. I will not go into detail Explaining why End of Days violates the Law of Film Logic, but there are some issues with this movie: <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) <br /> <br /> After the devil gone, the restaurant explodes without any trace, as he did. No snapping finger, no manipulated energy gas to ignite the fire, nothing. How could that happen? <br /> <br /> Arnold and his annoying buddy Kevin Pollack magically connect with the name "Christine York" after exploring the phrase "Christ in New York" engraved on the body of a victim on the computer and Viola, Christine York, the only person with the exact name in New York City! Beyond my suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> How did the characters who came into contact with Arnold's character turn against him later in the film? I laughed out loud when I realized that the good stepmother, who has become the evil stepmother, is the same actress who played a nanny in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Your ironic transition from this movie to this movie was absolutely funny, if you can imagine. <br /> <br /> All the thoughtless huge explosions and shots. What did you expect from Arnold Schwarzenegger? <br /> <br /> The devil took the body of a man made of flesh and blood, yet he is invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through this body. Logically, this is impossible. <br /> <br /> While the Devil demonstrates the illusion in the apartment, Arnold's character meets the massive Christmas tree, which is supposed to be an illusion, and falls * physically on him. <br /> <The devil is able to knock out the person's brains and turn the head of a victim 180 degrees, but he could not kill Arnold's character as he always intended. <br /> <br /> As the parents of the devil's object of yearning died and why wicked New Yorkers ruled behind Arnold, and the object of desire was not explained at all. <br /> <br /> In the episode, which is a rip-off of speed, Arnold and the devil manage to escape the craving of the subway train wreck through the short stretch inside. This is beyond my comprehension, since the power would be sufficient to forcibly toss around Arnold and the object of desire, and die seconds after the impact of deadly wounds. Arnold suffers the brutal beatings of police-approved mob Devil and sets him on the cross to hang on the wall, but the devil forgot to use the time and opportunity to kill him for comfort. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, after the Devil took over the body of a man, suddenly Arnold is his bodyguard ??? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing? <br /> <br /> Arnold's recital with crackling dialogues in particularly laughable scenes like "YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO YOURS!" are the perfect lining for MST3K, just like Eraser with the classic line "You're the luggage!". <br /> <br /> The whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ridiculous. At about midnight, the pseudo-religious chatter about Christian theology is the end of the world and the fanatical murderers who know where the devil's object of desire is. <br /> <br /> (END SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> It is highly ironic that End of Days uses the scattered curse words to abuse the deity as they roam Christian theories. The extent of the violence in the film is exaggerated and cruel and therefore not necessary to serve the conspiracy. Here, the estate of the director plays a role. He certainly does not know how to make a coherent action film from the script writer of Air Force One, who had to write the script only for a large sum. <br /> <br /> End of Days is a worthless movie with no salvation value except for Campiness - Arnold's worst since Hercules in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
