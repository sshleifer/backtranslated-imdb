Normally, if I do not see a show on an original run, I'll find it later on the cable and find it a gem. The "Gimore Girls" are one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I missed it. <br /> <br /> I really despise shows that fill every minute of the actor with wild, stupid, boring skirmishers. This is only an hour. The mother, Lorelei, made me wonder if she was bipolar and lost her lithium. She never stopped talking; every minute, every second, talking to every person she interacted with. Worse, her speech is childish and asooo as Valley Girl. She talked about boys, their hair, their mother, their clothes. What is the sitch? (for the situation). I have seen this show three times and still do not understand the point of this series. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it makes no sense to look like the "girls" of Planet Mars, except three generations of women in a family. In comparison, the males are smart and make the show a bit observable. If Lorelei had ever existed and tried to hold me in conversation, I would have to defeat her to get rid of her. She obviously does not know how to stop listening to someone else with a subtle hint. She also does not know how to really perceive the existence of others. <br /> <br /> In a show, Lorelei comes home around 10pm. She got the date after following a man she had met at auction. She goes to her daughter's room where the daughter asks how it went. She tells how boring the guy was. Her date had a few words. Lorelei complained that the man had not stopped talking (choke). Hopefully the date learned how happy he was. <br /> <br /> Another person commented on how the mother behaves like a teenager, and the daughter is the adult's personality. Lorelei even dresses like her child. This obviously 40-year-old mother dresses and looks like she's reaching the mall with her high school buddies in tow. <br /> <br /> I thought that this show should be followed by "Just Shoot Me" because that's how I felt.
