I rented this movie because I noticed the cover in the video rental. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, the 40s time setting, and thought, "Hmm, can not be that bad." Unfortunately my impression after viewing was "not too good". <br /> <br /> It's kind of a Chinatown rip-off, but the worst thing is that the other members of the team except Nolte have not come in enough screen time. But it's a decent movie I can see. And Melanie's role was so small that she had no chance of being a nuisance.
