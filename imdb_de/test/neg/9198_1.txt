If you pack all the clich√©s about the city's firefighters in 105 minutes; They have the Ladder 49. <br /> <br /> It has a history, but it is heavily clouded by all stereotypes. It turns it into a movie with every event; becomes so predictable, it's not worth looking at. There is no depth in the story and even the acting seems to be superficial. <br /> <br /> It looked like it was going to be a tribute to the firefighters, but it got boring and overbearing. The parallel between Jack Morrison, who was fatally trapped under an inaccessible part of the building, and firefighters trapped under the rubble of the Twin Towers was too obvious. <br /> <br /> It's not comparable to movies like Backdraft and certainly there is no example of future movies about the fire crew.
