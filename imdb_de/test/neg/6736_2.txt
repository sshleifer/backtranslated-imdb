I've seen "The Foreigner" listed here on IMDb in the "Bottom 100" movie classifications. So I did not expect much when I tuned in to the US Channel a week ago, but I had hope. "Belly Of The Beast" (aired a month ago) was a mess, but it had great scenery and photography and some pretty cool moments scattered all around, so I thought this movie might be the same. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie misses the standards of basic watchability in almost every way. The script comes from a bastard offspring of a John LeCarre novel and a Richard Ludlum movie. However, it is made by people who have no talent for action and characterization by these worthy writers. Instead, we have a depressed, mean, nihilistic, cryptic mares test of confused motives, involved alliances and setbacks. And breast shots. And bombings. And evasions. This translates to the directorial style, which relies on worn-out 'grainy shot / slow motion' shots every 10 seconds, along with wire work and hyperactive jump cuts. Those cinematic devices that were outdated ten years ago when MTV directors used them for Whitesnake videos, and the director edited them like a punch press, hoping to incorporate some weird art-house techno-thriller coolness into the process to let. <br /> <br /> Segal itself is just awful. He spends the entire movie in a hoarse, throaty whisper, switching between two expressions: he looks like he's sucking on a lemon while someone waves a small feces under his nose or looks clogged. And he's so chunky (and in vain) that he never really pulls his knee-length feather duster in front of the camera. I understand that it is difficult to control the scope as a male actor is getting older (although Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never seemed to have this problem). But you deal with it by being honest and growing as an actor, not with carefully chosen camera angles and floor-length robes. <br /> <br /> So I can not really say what's going on, and the movie does not give me any reason to worry about what's going on, and the protagonist is absolutely one-dimensional and visually unsightly. No recipe for a good movie experience. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, most of the sets and scenery are atmospheric and eye-catching. If you were to freeze the film in almost every scene that would not be seen near Seagal, you would be impressed by the care and professionalism of the lighting, the colors and the composition, as well as the beauty of Eastern Europe's settings. But dressing a rotten egg as a Faberge egg can not make it edible. And the procedures are rotting in the heart. <br /> <br /> There are "cool" movies (like "Versus"), visually eye catching, but emotionally cold movies (like "Underworld") and there are paranoia conspirator thrillers (like "The Bourne Identity" and his remake with Matt Damon). And then there's this thing that can not decide what it wants to be, pretends to be all those things, and fails because it has no guts and no soul. <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by professionals with an actual budget. So you can not place him in the same class as "Manos", "Killer Shrews" or "Hobgoblins". But I would rather watch all three films several times in a row, as "The Foreigner" again.
