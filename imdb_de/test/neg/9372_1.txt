Eliza Dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. She manages to be the stable center of "Tru Calling", but that's not enough to save her TV series from mediocrity. It's a pity that a woman as attractive and talented as Dushku should switch from a meaty supporting role in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" to this blunder. <br /> <br /> Unoriginal and desperately trying to be "hip", at no level can "Tru Calling" be irritating beyond the hormonal level. The heroine of the same name spends a lot of time here and there to walk through a very small town to avoid the death of handsome corpses that she has met in the morgue where she works. Despite running, she always looks like she has just stepped out of a portable, air-conditioned dressing room. <br /> <br /> In each episode, Eliza Dushku and the rest of the cast are struggling to breathe life into the bland, characterless scripts, but it's a pointless exercise. "Tru Calling" simply lies on the record and looks lifeless at the ceiling.
