The medical student Paula Henning wins a place at an exclusive Heidelberg medical school. When the body of a young man whom she met on the train appears on her dissecting table, she begins to investigate the mysterious circumstances of his death and discovers a cruel conspiracy committed by an anti-Hippocratic secret society within the school. Disturbing and crude, many scary parts. It even has a good script and a good ending. But it has a bad side. What else could you see from this movie? It's a good puzzle and horror movie. But of course, if you like it, buy it. If you do not, there is still no reason to waste your money on it. <br /> <br /> Rated with R for extreme violence in graphics, sexual situations and obscenities.
