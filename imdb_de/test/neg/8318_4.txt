I am very disappointed because I expected a real trip as promised in the many reviews. The script is very bad with many holes and the direction. The director could not develop any violent scene with tension and tension. It's very hard to follow a wannabe thriller. That's why I had to watch every bullet go out without meaning. I've always wondered what kind of movie I'm watching. Then I did not like her aggressively smoking one cigarette after another, but maybe the film was partly backed by the tobacco industry. The end is also very disappointing. I can not understand how Jodie Foster could have been nominated for the Golden Globe in this worst role of her life. Jodie, that's why I liked PANIC ROOM or FLIGHT PLAN very well. This is definitely one of the worst I have ever seen. 10.4.
