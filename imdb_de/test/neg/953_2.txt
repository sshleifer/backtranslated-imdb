As a flagship show, Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic for the larger case of G4 TV; It's a show (and station) that has fallen so far that it beats sex to mask its gross mistakes. Its predecessor, The Screen Savers, was a place where technology problems were investigated and the latest and best technologies discovered. It was a nice show with a friendly staff and it was fun to see some modding and other experiments that the crew could put together. <br /> <br /> The acquisition of TechTV by G4 has disturbed some longtime fans of the station, but early returns were actually promising. The emphasis on playing was a nice addition, and I've really enjoyed a lot of coverage of E3 and other major entertainment events. Unfortunately, AOTS is now just a shell of his former self. Those who oversee the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and games and toward anything that could lead to drooling in young adults. The result is that AOTS spends so much time performing Olivia Munn or promoting the adult film industry as when it comes to games. It is so bad that it is practically unsurpassable. <br /> <br /> While some puerile get pleasure from these kinds of things, those who really enjoy playing, maybe wonder where the good coverage went. Equally troubling are young players who engage in G4 because they think they would get games - this active playgroup between 10 and 15 - instead get things for a riper audience. Such things are expected on a channel like HBO or Cinemax. It's tragic on G4. <br /> <br /> At least SpikeTV, another channel for men only, has good programs like CSI. AOTS and G4 have little to offer. <br /> <br /> It's a pity.
