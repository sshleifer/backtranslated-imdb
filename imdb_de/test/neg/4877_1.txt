Where should I start. Let's first list the good things about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Mikael Persbrandt is great as a gangster Thomas. This is the only character you really care about, and he is a villain! (Allthogh never does anything bad and is generally a pretty likable guy.) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always great. It's a bit toned down here, but it's still pretty funny 3. The film looked pretty good for Swedish standards, good use of depth of field and light. <br /> <br /> Now that's bad. This is by far the worst screenplay ever to get on the big screen. Acting with everyone else was pretty bad and over the top. The direction was terrible. A completely pointless story, totally unrealistic characters and events and 1.5 hours too long. In emotional scenes, pretty much everyone in the theater laughed. People were just starting to go in the course of the screening. <br /> <br /> There's no way to put the story into something coherent, so I'm not trying. Every clich√© ever conceived is in there and in all wrong places. I'm sorry to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Make sure you have a good laugh but do not try to pay for it;) <br /> <br /> .R
