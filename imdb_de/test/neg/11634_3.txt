Two years after Brad Brown left the small town of Grover's Bend for bumping into the Krites, Brad Brown returns to his grandmother in time for Easter. Meanwhile, the Krite eggs start to hatch. As they cause trouble in the city, Brown and its inhabitants, as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to kill the creatures, must fight the bloodthirsty suburbs before they wipe out the city. <br /> <br /> The original Critters was a small attempt to demolish the family horror movie "Gremlins". It became a cult favorite in the video shelves and was successful enough to justify a sequel. This sequel reduces the horror and instead makes its entire focus comedy. Unfortunately, the comedy is extremely awkward and also childish. Acting is comparable to the rest of the movie. It's just that the film suffers from a weak script. The visual effects are pretty well done. <br /> <br /> Note: D + Review by M.K. Geist.
