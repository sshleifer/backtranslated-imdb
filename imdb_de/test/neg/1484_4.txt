Perhaps it is time to declare 2007 the "International Year of the Movie Crocodile"! The ridiculous "Primeval" came first through a crocodile named Gustave (!), Who ruled the swamps in Burundi. Then there was "Lake Placid 2", an unprofessional and televised sequel of an unforgettable original. Third, there is this incredibly derivative and sleepless piece of Aussie horror, and finally I have not seen the promising "rogue" yet. The latter is probably the best, considering that up-and-coming Aussie horror talent Greg McLean ("Wolf Creek") is there. "Black Water" is certainly not a complete waste of time and film, but it is another pointless survival movie that confuses the agony of everyday life with horror. Pardon my insolence, especially as I sincerely pity the people who have gone through this ordeal, but to portray three characters sitting in a tree and moaning for more than an hour is not my idea of ​​sheer excitement! Three young people travel through northern Australia and decide to go fishing in the remote wetlands for a day. It does not take long for a gigantic and wild crocodile to capsize its small boat and devour the guide. Grace, Lee, and Adam barely manage to escape the reptile's hungry teeth by climbing onto a tree. Although he is out of sight most of the time, Croc lurks patiently waiting, making it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive. Yes, it sounds very much like the plot of "Open Water". Replace the numerous invisible sharks with a huge, invisible crocodile and the open sea through an equally unavoidable Aussie swamp, and there you have it. Well, "Black Water" offers at least some exciting moments and an impressively designed water monster. It must be said that the crocodile looks fabulously groovy and you count down anxiously every time he comes out of the water wildly. The three-person lineup does everything to keep their characters interesting, but how do you accomplish that by sitting in a tree all the time? The true-event concept obviously causes a number of limitations, such as limited images of the fantastic locations, dialogues and endearing character drawings.
