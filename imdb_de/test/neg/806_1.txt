Who is responsible for these things behind the scenes? Who are these actors? Did they crawl out from under the rocks? "yuks, many yuks!" No. no yuks just detest for me and shame that I am human. I have to turn my eyes away from the set, it's so embarrassing. I changed the channel. <br /> <br /> I've always had a problem with Robin Williams 'non-stop'. I forgot my lithium today, but at least he's funny in a blue moon. If you watch someone who's not funny, as if he pretends to be Robert Williams, it's like pulling every tooth in your head slowly and sadistically, without novocaine, for all eternity. You're welcome.
