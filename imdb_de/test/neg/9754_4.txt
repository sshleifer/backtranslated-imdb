I was not really interested in seeing Step Up, but my girlfriend always annoyed me because she's so in love with Channing Tatum. I'm constantly annoyed that this is the only reason she loves the movie. But somehow she convinced me that it was a worth watching movie. If I loved movies like Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead and Save the Last Dance then I would love Step Up, what the hell? I think every movie has the right view, in a sense. <br /> <br /> Well, do you know the movies I mentioned above? Dirty Dancing, take the lead and save the last dance? Well, put them in a blender with some gangsta love and you have. Not to mention when you've seen these movies, frankly, you've seen Step Up. Because Channing is a subordinate class with street smarts who feel the music naturally, while the girl in the sphere has to follow step by step, how will they ever fall in love when they are so different? After all, this is their chance to approach the passion, the mystery and the desire of the dance! <br /> <br /> OK, that was a stupid plot explanation, but as I said, as long as you saw the movies I mentioned, or if you just saw the plot, you get the movie. I do not understand how it actually has a rating of 5.5, I bet they are those Channing lovers! LOL! I'm joking with you, but it's all good, I guess I just did not understand what others did with passion, the mystery that dance is! Oh, Antonio Bandares, where are you when we need you ?! <br /> <br /> 4/10
