The seller Lenny Brown (Woods) quickly loses his knack for selling the proverbial ice to Eskimos. Brown and his wife Linda (Young) have a chance to shine in California by a philanthropic entrepreneur. a fortune they lose if the federal government changes the tax laws. Seven hundred thousand dollars in the red, and the yuppies without a portfolio need huge amounts of Colombian marches powdering their screams until they find themselves with fairly hungry monkeys on their backs.
