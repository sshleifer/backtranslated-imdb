The absurd premise of this strip has to do with Argentina recapturing the Falkland Islands, which came into force in 1982, impregnating European women with Argentine semen, watering down ethnic purity until it favored Argentina. Yes exactly. The reconnaissance is conducted by our hero / Villan and Cad, Fabian, who pulls his fisheye camcorder off the pillar to secretly film his encounters with the Falklands, including his publicity and eventual conquest of a woman, Camilla. This movie is an unfortunate indie and a fraudulent documentary that favors us with boring hip-hop tourism. Yada, Yada, Yada. The film has no potential for action and only becomes interesting as Fabian and Camilla move through the usual moments of awkwardness and uncertainty when they get to bed from a handshake. "F * ckland" is only for cinema-goers who appreciate the gloomy, unfussy, sharp webcam of the Dogme Indies.
