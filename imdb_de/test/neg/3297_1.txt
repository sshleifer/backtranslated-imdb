I'm one of those strays for penalties when it comes to sitcoms these days - I'll still check them every now and then. My observation is that most of them are not very funny, even in big networks that are just getting high ratings, I just do not understand who they find funny. While a few made me crack a smile, none of them made me laugh. I usually change channels after a few minutes. Now in the FOX network they are producing new shows like changing underwear. For some reason, they believe that they can make a good sitcom, wrongly wrong. They've defeated this dead horse so much that it's ready to hire anyone who can write a crazed pilot with bad dialogue to knock him out. Let's take a quick look at the latest garbage Fox issued "The War At Home". <br /> <br /> I've seen about 5 minutes of it and that was generous. In this episode, the daughter mumbles to her parents and does that. I am now an adult. The father is fed up and says, "Okay, keep going and do whatever you want, if you mess it up, it's your problem." whereupon she answers, "well, I think you're crazy, but hey, at least I did not get AIDS" (turn to the laughter, no way to be a live audience unless they were paid for, to applaud such garbage.) - I found the crack about the lack of AIDS in such bad taste. Well, at least I do not have to look at this crap anymore. Take a hint FOX, stop wasting your time with sitcoms. Well, you have the Simpsons, but it is getting very old and tired now.
