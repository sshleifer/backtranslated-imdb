Altioklar: master of thieves. <br /> <br /> Watch a movie, steal some of it, write a script ... It must be very easy to become a director in Turkey. I think Altioklar saw "Identity (2003)", "Saw (2004)", a few series about crime, murder, etc., and then said "Eureka, Eureka" (after I've found it!) After writing the script of the film. <br /> <br /> You can guess the killer at the beginning of the film. It only took me 10 minutes. He shouted, "I am the murderer, I am the murderer." There is no secret. <br /> <br /> Tamer Karadagli is the same (Sux). Exaggerated copycat, funny macho man. <br /> <br /> There is only one good thing in the movie. The performance of Demet Evgar is very good. You can only watch the movie for that.
