I remembered that horrible movie I bought in the summer of 1989 at the Camelot music store when I visited my grandparents. It was a time when I had just discovered movies like Re-Animator, From Beyond, The Return of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready for all that Horror / Gore genre had to offer ... or so I thought! I was only about 12 years old at the time, so I really can not remember it well. I remember a psycho who was killed with a corkscrew killing people, and a few policemen (I think) who had driven in a car that was not actually moving. I also remember that it was the worst movie I've seen so far and I promptly threw it in the bin. <br /> <br /> Something today made me think about this movie (I can not believe I really remembered the name), so I jumped on Imdb to see if it's listed. To my surprise ... IT WAS! And other 5 people have seen it ... amazing. Although I remember that I hated the movie when I somehow wished I had kept it somewhere, because I would like to check it again to laugh (he would probably make a good movie). In any case, I am glad that I am one of the few elite who have seen this little "treasure". I'd like to pick it up somewhere for a few bucks ... but beware, that's not a recommendation ... it's awful ... it's just for nostalgia.
