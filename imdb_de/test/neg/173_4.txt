Was it really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in a documentary? And why all the silly dog ​​scenes and then the repetition of all the same silly dog ​​scenes? This movie begins with a big promise - to showcase international politics and the wine business. It had a great start and included all the right characters. But the production is a mess. The points started and continued to develop, then never finished or with dangling ends. Very bad and confusing camera work and editing. They should have used subtitles for the British mumbler of Christie's. Too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentary In my opinion, there was too little of it. <br /> <br /> We left at 2:00 - I have no idea how long it has been going on.
