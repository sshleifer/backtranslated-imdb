This is the worst movie I have seen so far. 85 minutes of bad acting (half of the cast seems to suffer from Asperger's Syndrome), terrible wigs, unusual make-up (including tide lines around wigs), and holier than you characters with more sacred than the dialogue that makes you sick. A funny aspect of this film, if you have the patience to look at it, is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes in which the unfortunate cast appears from scene to scene. Was this film supported by a catalog manufacturer with desperately shady pastel everyday clothes? Were the actors paid for their efforts with clothes? You certainly do not deserve to pay anything else! This horrendous effort of a film in the first half provides a wide-ranging action that turns into an equally confused archival Christian scripture test in the latter. The entire casting and production team was to be burnt at the stake, or at least crucified!
