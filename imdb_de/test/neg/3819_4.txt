It is important to check your expectations when you see HATCHET. The * buzz generated on this website far exceeds the real impact of the movie. What can help someone see the movie is that it can not be described as sinister. It's pure camp and an attempt to have fun. It's not - funny - just campy. Do not expect anything like SHAUN OF THE DEAD; something like Friday the 13th (Part II to infinity). <br /> <br /> HATCHET has passable actors. The cinematography is just Ed Wood. Creature effects and make-up are stupid - probably on purpose. Blood and blood is something between Romero and Dead Live. HATCHET is a movie of togetherness. It is between SHAUN OF THE DEAD and LESLIE VERNON. It's between Campy and Comedy (there is a difference). It's between ultra-violent and violent comics. <br /> <br /> Instead of "capturing the essence of American horror," or whatever other stupid jargon the film described, he tries to capture something between the sperm - -American-- horror like Friday's 13th and newer horror like SHAUN. Thankfully he stays away from Torture Horror. <br /> <br /> In the end, HATCHET is between a bad movie and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> * I think more and more people are involved In movies, websites like IMDb are streaming around to rate and comment on the films they're in contact with. At a minimum, there are campaigns for employees who are in touch with employees to provide positive feedback and ratings. There is no other reason that this film was stared with 600 votes in the high 7s and falls back quickly after a wide release. This movie is just better than the horrorfest releases and should not be so bloated.
