The whole hype! All adds! I was upset that I missed that on the big screen. Where this movie worked was in the little details. Everything else failed. Arnold has shown so many better performances in recent years. I thought the days of Commando and Last Action Hero had vanished from our lives. Unfortunately, this film is downsized and reduces Arnold to a roaring, grunting and discarding muscle that simply knows how to shoot weapons and blow things up. In a final moment of clich√© (and at some other time) that was predictable from the beginning, we see a glimmer of the actor proving that he is more than what he paid early in his career. I was not impressed by the movie as it never broke new ground or went anywhere you had expected.
