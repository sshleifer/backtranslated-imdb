I looked at the first 15 minutes and can say that there was no consultation with military personnel. The character of Judith Light (an officer) has her hair past her shoulders! One of the first police officers to greet her as she walks into the medical facility where she works is so overweight that his pockets are opening! No, there was no military that she advised in this film. Even a former military could have helped here.
