With respect to Will's "genius," a tremendous suspension of unbelief is required. Not only in mathematics - it is also read very well in economic history, can shrivel several shrinkage, etc., etc. No, no, no. I do not buy it While they're at it, they might just as well let it carry a big "S" on their chest, fly faster than a jet plane and make bullets. <br /> <br /> The problem of what it really is and whether it deserves such mindless tribute does not seem easy at first / ex nihilo /. It is not so diverse. And it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries. <br /> <br /> It's better to have Will turned into a basketball kid. Only that Damon is too short.
