This was a film based on the novel written by the modern literary god Koontz. I refuse to believe that Studio has acquired the rights to this film for anything that uses the name Koontz of Genius. Since my vision became bad enough to require Large Print, I could not read this book since I've had it at least twice a year since my first reading. I missed the book very much and could not find it in the large print. <br /> <br /> I had hoped that I would have rented this movie, at least I would get the relief of my acting watcher, but this movie was a farce. Due to subtle action points, I believe that none of Mr. Koontz or most decent authors can be stuffed for 1-2 books in 1-2 hours of film. <br /> <br /> It will be the clever network, cable or otherwise, who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multi-part television movie, ie miniseries, out of this book in the RIGHT way! <br /> <br /> One in five stars - would that be possible to go deeper ...
