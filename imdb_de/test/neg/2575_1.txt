Forget the fact that most people expect an action movie from Seagal. This movie simply had no substance. Very long and boring. The scenes were much longer than they had to be - the camera often focused on something for a long time, when absolutely nothing happened. Cure for insomnia. By far the worst Seagal movie (I like some of his other films). 1.10
