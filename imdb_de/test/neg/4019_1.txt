20th Century Fox 'ROAD HOUSE (1948) is not just a stupid noir, but also an implausible, incorrigible hole in a movie. It is full of unconvincing cardboard figures and soberly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced. He is surprisingly led by Jean Negulesco, who would be expected to do so much more. Miscast is Ida Lupino in the lead role! Lupino, a woman capable of producing as much sex appeal as a blood orange, believes she is Rita Hayworth, who plays the role of a sexy bar-room torch singer. The handsome Cornel Wilde as a lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm, whose role plays little more than a role. Then we have Richard Widmark, who wrote the most ridiculous part of the picture! When we first see him, he is a nice O.K. Guy who runs a thriving road house. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not clear enough - he becomes madly jealous of his manager (Wilde) when he tells him he wants to marry Lupino. You see, Widmark wanted to marry her, but - 1) He never suggested it to her - 2) They never had a relationship (they do not even have anything that resembles a love scene) and - 3) without anyone ( including Lupino)) he has received a marriage certificate. Impressive! How Widmark could achieve something like marital happiness with Lupino after such an "advertisement" is everyone's business. Huh Well, if Widmark shatters during the whole thing, I also feel sorry for the movie to say that. From here, the Widmark character is unintentionally funny! That he lost his marbles so early in the process is utterly implausible and unconvincing. He finally goes over the edge, gets totally confused and laughs with some Tommy Udo-Sniggers at the poor Cornel Wilde before he bites himself in the dust. <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough mess of a movie for you - the image is also hampered by the constant use of studio sets and interiors. There is not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! In addition, 95% of the movie is played at night. <br /> <br /> In addition to an interactive press book and a photo gallery, the extras also include a "Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox" feature. Whatever has led to such a documentation, I am not! As far as I know, they've never been to a movie with Fox or anywhere else! However, this feature is hosted by hitter all-rounders like Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer, and a few others who are heaped with amazing praise for this tiring and frightening affair. Everything I can say, I have to be well. But "Road House" was previously a forgotten and buried Noir and for me it should have stayed that way. <br /> <br /> Fox would do better if they released DVDs of superior and elusive Widmark films like "Down To The Sea In Ships" (1949) and the colorful "Red Skies Of Montana" (1952) ).
