This movie could have been an impressive epic, but the makers seem to have done anything to make the film look stupid. Even God himself is not spared in this film, his words are permeated with childish jokes. The result is blasphemous and annoying. Only people who do not want to see a cheap parody in biblical history may see this movie without embarrassment. The creators of this tasteless production should see "Il Vangelo secondo Matteo," a film by Pier Paolo Pasolini, which shows that it is not necessary to perverse the words of the Bible to make a good story ; The most impressive result is achieved by a sincere rendition of the plaintext itself.
