This movie was relatively good in the first parts. <br /> <br /> We have a story from three angles. So, let's find some clues and complete the story. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait ... that stuff does not matter because the FBI guys are the bad guys! That was a great turn ... it was almost a terrible turn. I immediately downgraded the movie from a 7 maybe 8 to 3, based on the last 10-15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Can not someone else see why the twist is so bad? Yes, that's a good shock. But it's bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the previous hour and twenty minutes. There is no connection to the killers. <br /> <br /> The killers are in about 5 minutes of this movie (as a killer), and the two FBI agents are only in 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty minutes /> <br /> We get it ... monitoring ... Oh, the killers are voyeurs. WHAT DOES NOT MEAN, because they have been described as psychopaths only to a limited extent. And the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we observe from the 3 stories come out the window as they are all dead within 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> All this makes the end even more ridiculous. Oh, they killed a bunch of FBI agents at the beginning ... Which FBI agents sleep together? Everything in the same room. Found by amateurs and murdered and then embodied by people who know nothing about FBI agents? A police officer 3 yards away can not seem to hit with a standard pistol that can fire several shots. I hate films that try to feel that this could be real if they make absurd leaps that we think we will believe the killers are with a girl standing in the field ...
