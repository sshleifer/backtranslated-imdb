What can one say about such a pathetic movie? <br /> <br /> - Very bad action! The main actress seems to know only one facial expression: fear mixed with weakness. Like a poor beaten dog ... The other actress (the one who plays the evil) looks like the female double of Ozzy Osbourne, with a horrible red wig. The other actors are so pitiful that they are not worthy of being described. <br /> <br /> - There is absolutely no conspiracy. The story begins with possibilities, but goes nowhere: we know nothing about the meaning of "11:11" and also not who Rayden really is, with the exception of the simple "she is evil" or "she is a child of the Apocalypse". .. which is not an explanation. We do not know why the parents were killed, what is the danger and why Sara was chosen. In the further course of the film we only look at pseudo-spooky scenes with bad music. Moreover, the ending does not bother: we see only two possibilities, as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director's cut ... There is no plot, so no possible interpretation. <br /> <br /> - "11:11" is just full of clich√©s! It's so obvious that I could not help but laugh. For example: the abandoned library or bathroom scenes, ghost silhouettes walking with a gust of wind ... there is even the fashionable "little weird girl" like in "Dark Water" or "The Ring". Of course, the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotypical gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, thin black clothes). Is it an obligation to make them credible? I do not believe Sara's psychology is so poorly developed and so typical that it does not make her credible or endearing. <br /> <br /> - Awful direction: As I said, nothing original, everything has been seen a thousand times and is used here for no real purpose. <br /> <br /> - There are some funny incoherencies. For example, I do not know if "Ghost Science", "Paranormal Course" or whatever is being taught at American universities ... In Europe that's really not the case: teachers talk about negative energies or use "unmaterial" creature sensors. .. ridiculous. Plus, how do you watch a 1960s movie with a Super 8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours digitizing (in the movie, the movie is immediately displayed on the computer screen), and how do you do it? ? In this old film, you isolate a tiny detail, zoom in and see a perfectly recognizable face? I wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analogue movie ... <br /> <br /> At some point it is worth "11:11" to be seen if you want to laugh at silly movies or maybe if you want to fall asleep on the couch ... but it's an expensive way to fall asleep!
