There are films that are so bad that they are good. Then there are movies like Rest Stop, which should never be done because they are just terrible. Bad drama, unusual characters, predictable actions, and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all important failures. Some half decent special effects are about the only important thing. <br /> <br /> I can not even bring myself to write a plot, because all I really want to do here is to warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favor and do not even bother with this movie. It is 1.5 hours of your life that you will never come back. <br /> <br /> 1/10
