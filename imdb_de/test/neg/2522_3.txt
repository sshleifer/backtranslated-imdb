This movie was really stupid and I thought it was not so bad and I could endure a movie about a bed where people eat. Then the part at the end where the man has skeleton hands was the cherry on a bad movie. I could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands, for God's sake. The brother was still alive and moving when his hands had bare bones. The funny thing was that he could still move his hands, which was just not right. Without muscles, you really can not move your hands, but he did. The brother should have bleed before he moved his hands. The movie was not that great, but it was okay until the hand scene. I laughed so hard that I could not remember how it ended. It had something to do with foam or something.
