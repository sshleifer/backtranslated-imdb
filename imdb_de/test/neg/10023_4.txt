Everything that everyone has said sounds pretty good when it comes to "The Prey". Endless nature shots, bad drama - Apart from these elements, this is a movie for Slasher fans, which in some cases is considered a cult classic. Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan are playing well. There's also a three-minute banjo solo that demonstrates Bostwick's skills behind the instrument. Not bad, if I say it myself. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of the "film" are his saving grace. The end haunts me to this day. This can also be a short-lived plus as a former John Carl Bucheler takes on the special effects. Some may know him from films like "Troll" and "Friday the 13th part 7 - He's both staged films.) All in all, this is not a movie where everyone will find something redeeming - on the Hollywood level, this is all I can Take a seat with one of the company's most amateurish efforts, but for the handful (but very loyal) of Slasher movie fans in the world, even the bad acting and the cruel nature shootings can be forgiven.
