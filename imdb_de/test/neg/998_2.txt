Starting with a tearful poem and pictures of American rockets, starving children and mutilated Palestinians, I quickly realized that this would not be an objective documentary. 5 teenagers convicted after the riots in Gothenburg are interviewed and very puzzled explain why they had to throw the city center in the bin and then (oh my god) actually paid for what they did. I kept watching and many questions were raised. Was the process done properly and did the cops have the right to do what they did? Many questions were asked ... and then dropped. No interviews with judges or documents through the process. Nothing. <br /> <br /> In short: nothing new from what every Swede has seen on television a hundred times - just bad propaganda.
