I would be one of the few who owns a copy of this classic. But I do not just own 1, I actually own 2. It's THAT good. <br /> <br /> If I say well, I mean bad. But I will try to do a thorough review. I even saw 'born a ninja', which one of the other reviewers mentioned here, to compare it to. And born ninja is actually worse, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> And that's always funny. EVERYTHING about this movie is bad. EVERYTHING. The plot is absolutely full (note the "you have to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife"). EVERY action sequence is also stuffed. Our hero Danton is more than a hero. He can sting people with twigs, taking bullets into the heart at 50-centimeter intervals without bleeding, and tie a rope to a tree that, when an enemy steps on it, ties a knot around the opponent's leg, pulling it up, and throw him 50 yards into a row of spikes. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that you can not comment on it, but you should let it roll, especially Dantons jump out of the ground and growl at the evil '. Oh yes, and the bad guys: Somehow it seems like they are reviving in the movie 5 times each. Maybe it was just that there were not enough actors, but in a movie of this caliber? I doubt that. <br /> <br /> The 'conspiracy' is about how Danton was a soldier in the Vietnam War, and now his colonel hunts real people to train for his mercenaries. The Colonel wants to pick up Danton by accident, then Danton fights back. This is just the excuse for a Rambo clone, with most of the film being Danton battlegroups. And I really can not explain the plot anymore, because there is nothing else in the movie. It is still rocking. <br /> <br /> What else could be wrong? Do not let me start. Hand grenades that actually kick the actors at the feet because the explosion is as big as a match Grenade launcher he is against the same background, although he is in completely different places. And the worst thing is when Danton pushes the plastic blocks at the enemies and an enemy is completely untouched by the blocks. So he does not know what to do, and he dies half-heartedly without being touched. It is ridiculous !!! <br /> <br /> But funny. Very funny. This is one of the few films that I can fully recommend to anyone, because if you do not find it funny, you are 1 in a million. And for the rest of us, it's magic.
