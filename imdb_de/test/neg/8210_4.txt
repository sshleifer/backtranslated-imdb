"Dungeon of Harrow" had many things that could have made this pretty good horror movie. Creepy mansion, a torture chamber, a paranoid army, a stooge, a ghoul in the dungeon, etc. But unfortunately this was not done very well. <br /> <br /> A writer and a skipper are shipwrecked an island belonging to a count in a castle, his slave and a dumb maid. The count is becoming increasingly suspicious that the two castaways are (of course) pirates, and more and more inclined to turn against them and have them and the mute girl who befriends them tortured and imprisoned. Does not sound bad, right? <br /> <br /> Well, not quite. I called this one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but now I hesitate. Because it had so much potential, it can not really be called "one of the worst". However, it is a great success if all this potential is wasted. All in all, it's not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> There is a very exciting scene in which our hero is chained in the dungeon and faces the crazy and crazy, rotting bride, who is adorned in a tattered wedding dress. This was both scary and disturbing when I saw for the first time how the horror developed in this scene. Man, I wish it was a better movie! <br /> <br /> This movie was right for a whimsical late-night chiller, but eventually took all the wrong turns. I suggest someone do this remake.
