And now to another point of view: I did not like it. I did not actually finish it. I know that "Unforgiven" is considered by some to be one of the biggest westerns ever made. I know he is a star and was led by Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American cinema. I know that it has won a lot of Oscars. Nevertheless, I did not like it. I do not like Western, and that's a matter of taste, but I do not admire the Eastwood spectacle either. He is and never was a leader. He is not a Burt Lancaster, not a Paul Newman, not a John Wayne. In this film alone, he is eclipsed by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; They are both actors. No, Eastwood is a big guy with a shrill voice that normally plays tough guys. Here he plays a retired, tough guy. When I see him on the screen, I see a man working on his acting. Then there is the anti-Western Western conspiracy. It is too obviously intended to promote contemporary values ​​- respect for the role of women, blacks, Native Americans, and single parents; a disregard for violence and alcohol consumption; the wholeness that comes with marriage, including between different races and small adorable children - in a century when these values ​​were not necessarily accepted, at least in this way. By promoting these values, the film looks very thoughtful, if not even preaching. Then there are the stereotypes of cinematography - prostitutes with gold hearts, the kid who can not shoot straight, the new city in the Wild West, the sage brush shimmers on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords. Finally, there is the direction of Eastwood. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood still rode north and talked to Morgan Freeman and the boy, who could not shoot straight, sixty minutes after the conspiracy of a prostitute began to move. It was too slow. Someone had to find these elements undecided. I'm scared, it was me.
