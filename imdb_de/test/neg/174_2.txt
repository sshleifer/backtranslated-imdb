I've heard people compare this movie to sideways. I never suspected how this comparison was made, because this movie was in no way comparable to Sideways. <br /> <br /> These two movies were as different as Star Wars and the Thornbirds. The only thing they had in common was that they both had wine as their theme. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews in this documentary were of interest, they were ruined by the very worst camera work ever ... tried it. I've never seen any worse camera work in my life, and I compare it to home videos accidentally shot by 5-year-olds. <br /> <br /> I give these two stars, ONLY for the interesting interviews with French wine types and to show how intrusive and corrupt the American wine companies are (are not all companies intrusive and corrupt?), I would say 10 Give Stars (Yes, that's NEGATIVE 10) for the Regret, Terrible, Terrible, Terrible, INDUCING, 5 year old could make better mess.
