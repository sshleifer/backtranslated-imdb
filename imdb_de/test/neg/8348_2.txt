This movie is a catastrophe within a catastrophe movie. It's full of great action scenes that only make sense if you throw away all the reality. Let's see, wise to the wise, lava burns you; Steam burns you. You can not stand next to lava. Redirecting a small lava flow is difficult, let alone a significant one. It scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even worse is the huge amount of talent that made this movie. I mean, the drama is actually very good. The effects are above average. Hard to believe that someone read the scripts and wasted that talent. I think my suggestion would be if this movie started on TV right away ... look away! It's like a train accident: it's so terrible that once you know what's coming, you just have to be careful. Take a look and spend your time with meaningful content.
