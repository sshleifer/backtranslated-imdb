It's going to be hard to fill that line with 10 lines ... But I'll try to prevent others from making the same mistakes as me - to watch this (dreadful and boring) movie. <br /> <br /> I like Patrick Swayze - he has shown excellence in movies like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South (TV Series), but in this movie ..... ARGH. ... This movie is so booooooring, the drama is terrible - the script is shit - well ... I can not even find a good thing, nothing, absolutely NOTHING, I looked at it with two other friends and we were We all agreed that this was one of the most boring movies we've ever seen, and the fact that it takes more than 3 hours (which we did not know) - when Part 1 was over and it said "Continued" we almost cried "nooooooooooooo", we have to take 90 minutes longer to watch this movie !!!! "<br /> <br /> it's painful to watch this movie: .. at no time does one get the impression that the actor are Russians, extremely bad the action scenes are the only good scene is when the truck explodes at the beginning of the Movie! The rest is MIST! Clean your toilet instead of watching this movie (and do not run when you watch this movie - you were forewarned!). Personally, I would recommend Patrick Swayze to call his agent and make him remember this movie so badly.
