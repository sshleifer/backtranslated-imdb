It was funny because the whole thing was so unrealistic, I mean, come on, like a pop star just pops up in a public high school and falls in love with the girl who happens to be obsessed with him? Come on, people! <br /> <br /> Everyone except the main girl was totally terrible when they were acting. The dialogue was cheesy, the premise stupid and the camera work was done badly. I felt like watching a bad home video. <br /> <br /> I feel like I've wasted nearly 2 hours of my life, that I'll never come back. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else to say, except that I would hit myself in the face several times than watch this movie again.
