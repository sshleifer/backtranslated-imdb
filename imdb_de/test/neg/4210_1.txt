Apart from some very early Norris, "Breaker, Breaker" has nothing to offer that can not be found ten times better on any broadcast channel. A pathetic attempt at filmmaking. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Still, I watched it and pressed the fast-forward button because the drama was so horrible it was weird. Of course, the film should be an action / drama, but turned out to be a treatise on how NOT to make a movie. In this "dog" is everything to see what the film could be wrong. If you happen, take a look. It's so bad, it's funny.
