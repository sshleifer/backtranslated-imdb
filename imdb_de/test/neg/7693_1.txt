This movie, being the first KSA movie, was meant to be active and showcase the goodness of its people. Otherwise, we see that Rotana's performers want to show the people of religion in Saudi Arabia as terrorists and stupid that they are not peaceful and smart. The director is not even less well. The grandfather in the film is very younger than the father, everyone realizes that. And the girls, who are not Saudi-Arab, show our girls as pitches that seek people to satisfy their needs. Hasham was just another piece of furniture he imagined when he said to his lover that I love you and shout to his friend that he does not talk to strange girls /> <br /> The father did not move like that just, but put on his film and did not see this movie as a cast and the only word he said: "A5zo Al Shai6an". The weird thing about this movie is that the girls were housed in a family part of a restaurant. The voice behind the young man talks to his girlfriends "kiss me" many times and Muslims do not grow up bitches and adulterers. Every Saudi has a patriot in their hearts and will not allow this stupid movie
