No, I'm not a radical feminist who beats up the hentai and yaoi genres. I just think it's boring and pointless story, not to mention that this crap of HENTAI lends anime a bad name worldwide (watch Sailor Moon!). Unfortunately, people do not know that not every anime (or any other Asian style) is a dirty porn. Death to the stereotype !!! <br /> <br /> * starts the casting of Ultima *
