Dedicated stars (Heather Graham) along with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). It is the story of Joline who is determined to find her ex-husband, who is in a mid-life crisis. <br /> <br /> Committed was not at all what I expected, it lacked comedy, which was ultimately the genre. It was more than stupid and unrealistic. Casey Affleck delivered a reasonable performance. Graham's recent roles were uncomfortable and this is not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Graham's most recent role was Blessed, which I found misleading and did not appeal to me at all. <br /> <br /> Benefits Affleck <br /> <br /> Disadvantages Predictable, unrealistic, bad acting and no comedy movie!
