Jack Frost 2 is beyond question, I'm actually surprised that people are allowed to make such films. <br /> <br /> When Sam and his wife spend a relaxing Christmas at the Tropicana, Jack returns to kill. Have fun and take revenge with inbreeding ... <br /> <br /> Take Not at all, most people say it's a laugh with your friends, but honestly, it's a waste of time. If the people who made this movie can get a job by doing what they do, they can at least take the time and effort to write a better story, especially the cheesy character names.
