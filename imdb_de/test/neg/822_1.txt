Do not tell me that this movie was funny or a bit funny. It was a complete disaster and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ali G is just funny in Channel 4's Ali G Show. After seeing his performance, all I can say is that he's not made for movies. With a Daft script or more like no storyline, there's nothing that would entertain you. This movie is full of annoying, unrealistic characters. At the end of the film Ali G gives a speech. He mentions that if you hated this movie, tell people it's good. Not even the speech could save the movie. He probably knew it would be a stinker. I would give a 0/10 here, but the minimum start is 1. Overall, you should not waste your time with this garbage.
