I have not read the book on which the film is based, nor the letters between Vita and Violet. If I came to this film with any expectations, it could be that the Bloomsbury group (including Virginia Woolf, which included the Nicolsons) would be represented. It was not like that, but that was not a problem for me. What I'm wondering is how the people behind this film managed to be so uninteresting and repetitive in my opinion, and most of the characters are flat despite the great material and some very good actors. The script is just not good enough. I agree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbor - too many senseless sex scenes (but only between women, although there is nothing explicit about Harold's many love stories), too many senseless scenes in general, too little information about the background of the characters. Given the quality of the production, it seems strange - superficially it seems to be a very ambitious job, but of course the script has the biggest weight and that's where this movie fails. <br /> <br /> Vita's relationship with Harold did not seem convincing to me, though both seem to work very well, especially her. The way they expressed their unconditional love in a rather juicy way, I thought, well, just not convincing. It makes much more sense that it should have been through letters, as Tmmvds points out, that I would have liked to know where the nicknames came from - the Russian * as well as Mar - why anyone who is nicknamed Mar with Vita? It may be a small stuff, but it is important to contribute to the overall picture. <br /> <br /> * I watched the movie with English subtitles and where it was supposed to say "Mitya" it was called "Medea". That could explain my nickname frustration to a degree - I could not understand why Vitas should be Greek, while violets were Russian!
