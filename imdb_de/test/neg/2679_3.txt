Man, the 90s really was a terrible decade for movies. The films lack a good style, and storytelling is often missing. <br /> <br /> This 6th entry into the long running Halloween series is certainly a bad one. You never really get into the story because it's not a very well constructed and built movie. <br /> <br /> It's just a badly finished movie that also suffers from the supposedly less writing and non-writing. compelling signs that are in it. Dr. Loomis only seems to be there, just to be in it. It is a pity that this was the last movie role of Donald Pleasence. It's nice and somehow fitting that his final role is in a Halloween movie, but he definitely deserves to be in a better one. <br /> <br /> There is never a sense of real danger in the film and in the character of Michael Myers just never seems threatening or threatening. Maybe it's because he appeared in the movie too early. He does his usual stuff again, but without too much class and originality. Even trying to uncover Myer's past does not really work for the main reason that it's just not explained very well. It's obvious that the script was reworked several times before and possibly during the shoot. Some scenes were even re-recorded or added, after it turned out that the first cut was anything but pleasant. <br /> <br /> The movie looks and feels more like it was made for television. This is also due to the lack of really good Gore. As a horror movie, there's really a lack of everything to make this a good or even original movie. <br /> <br /> So far the worst of the series! <br /> <br /> 3/10
