I think cheaders have to be out of thin air and finish the reality show once and for all. I do not care what anyone says you can attack me or agree with me, but it's the time when the show just spews propaganda and the host The scammer Joey Greco is a little bastard who wants to get the impression people to show in front of the camera is effective and not daunting. It is only shown disgustingly that he is also the wiretapping and persecution of people by "fraud-spies" illegal and is a federal offense In a police state like the Soviet Union and the Nazi Germany, I am happy that there are bad reviews about this garbage that must end soon, or we will lose our liberties as a nation. No wonder our country is going to hell Because of these and other dirty shows, I liked the older shows better from the 1950s / 1980s. I hope you all agree, that I thank you for being Infowarrior
