This movie is definitely 5. I caught him on HBO yesterday. I remember when it first appeared in the cinemas when I told a friend that it would never be a hit because Americans did not want films about the story, especially movies that had more to do with ideas than action. I do not know if that was why FMLB was not doing well, but now that I've finally seen it, I can add a few observations of my own. <br /> <br /> First of all, while Dwight Schultz has done well in Star Trek and The A-Team, he is disgusting as the lead actor in this movie. I've always expected him to scream Jon Lovitz, "I'm ACT-ING!" He formulated and sounded as if he was trying everything to be an ACT-OR on a stage where he had to strangely emphasize different words and phrases. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I enjoyed the clever positioning of Paul Newman's character as a manipulator, trying to connect these cats (the scientists) at each step in order to reach his goal. Third, there was some discussion about the moral implications of the A-bomb and whether the US should use it. Probably not enough or as deep as it is allowed. <br /> <br /> Finally, there seemed to be a whole lot of twists and turns for dramatic effects. I do not know how much of the events in this movie are lifelike, but there were things where the test bomb slipped in chains or a laboratory accident was killed by a spilled coffee cup (and as a result a scientist killed) pushing the limits of credibility , Maybe this stuff or similar events really happened, but it felt like different scenes were being added just for dramatic effects, undermining the overall tone and purpose of the movie. <br /> <br /> FMLB was fine. I need to read more about the actual events to know if it was exaggerated, or only the most accurate.
