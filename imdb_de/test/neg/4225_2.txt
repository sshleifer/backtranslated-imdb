I think the cards were stacked against webmasters, because from the beginning there was the itchy feeling as if something was wrong, but I could not say for sure. Then it hit me. Baptized For a while, they managed to do most of the lines either as a voice over or off screen, with a few little hints here and there until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of synchronization that gets on your nerves with nothing that is even close to being funny. I hate syncing, but after all, poorly labeled martial arts movies tend to have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> What I wanted was a movie about a hacker who is actually hacking and doing something like that. Maybe like a back of the hacker's table (it's about the person trying to keep them out instead of the people trying to get in). What I got was a poorly written, nonsensical murder mystery with a plethora of bad chases, an allegedly incompetent hacker spayed without his little ego, and a director who obviously did not know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to come in, take the guy's camera and shoot the thing myself. The editing was not much better. The acting? Well, I think if the leader did not have such a bad script to work with, he would at least be seen. The main villain was fine too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. Dubbing did not help, but acting was pretty bad, even considering that. Before I let myself go, let's do some goodies. Well, one or two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I preferred the Cyberworld stuff to how little of it was, and would have rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around it than the lukewarm environment out there in the "real world." The falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kinda cool, but pretty useless in the scheme of things. The Heart Gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, though a plotter torn directly from the pages of Escape, New York, was terribly conceived in the long run. There is a point where the villain is unconscious and our hero is right there. Why did not he try the bad guy thumbprint (because the heart device was activated with his thumb)? Anyway, some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff, if only they could be better used. <br /> <br /> Well, who dares to compare this movie with Blade Runner? Both films will take place sometime in the future and in both films is a kind of wild romanticism. There is a murder investigation, but I have seen many movies with a murder in the middle that have nothing to do with Blade Runner or Webmaster. Identity for example. There ends the similarities. Period. There is no comparison, as it would not be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a keen sense of artistic direction and knows some basics of filmmaking, such as the camera. Webmasters are cheap and not just for the budget. It is cheap because it is written poorly, and because it usually takes the easy way (as in writing a figure that just appeared to rescue the girl at the end and bring her to point B without a hero) with it he could do his thing. Very convenient. Or the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care about. Or crazy things like the car she set up so someone could get away with her.) <br/> <br /> It's trying to be hip, it's trying to be exploitative, it even tries a twist end, that's not a little It is surprising and it tries to be exciting. But a bunch of nearly identical chases, bad writing, editing, terribly filmed, bad acting, etc. does not make an exciting movie.
