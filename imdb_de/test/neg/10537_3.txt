This is a very bad action movie for a variety of reasons. First of all, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat, pretending to have a chore, and his fight scenes require creative editing or easy replacement. Second, his opponent is a very weak villain. This is about an intelligent and evil masterbrain, and Chestnut does not deliver. So what about the action? Well, the two parties are constantly shooting at different places in Alcatraz Prison. They shoot wild and bad, because compared to the amount of required ammunition, the body number is rather low. There is nothing to save this movie. There is not a single good line and not a single good joke. The little psychological interlude with 49er One and Judge McPherson is ridiculous. So what does it have? Well, the usual Bell helicopters, silhouettes moving in blue light and slow motion, doors full of bullets and 1000-watt lights shining through the holes, figures jumping through the air as they shoot, firing weapons from nowhere , a long black coat with a brave black guy and a thin wooden box with 25 tons of gold. The pain continues until the last moment, a hopeless approach to relieve the credits. Californian beach boy Don Michael Paul wrote and directed. At least this mountain of boredom comes from a simple mind.
