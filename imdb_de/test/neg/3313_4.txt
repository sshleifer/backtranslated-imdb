Patches of white and different shapes, beautiful nude, random pictures. This is this little experimental short film. <br /> <br /> It's kind of interesting to think how such images could be transferred to the film in the early days of the film, but despite my love for many surreal images and films and a fascination for the bizarre, this movie just did not do it for me. <br /> <br /> I'm not sorry that I've seen it, but if there's any meaning behind it, I do not understand it Optically, in my opinion, that's not so outstanding. As an example of Dadaism, I would suppose that it would fit well, as it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason, though I would prefer to do it in a more visually interesting way. > But something for everyone.
