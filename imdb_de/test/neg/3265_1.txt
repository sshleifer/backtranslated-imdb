This movie is so horrible that it was really a chore. I wanted to eject it from my VCR and throw it across the room, but (stupidly) thought that it would eventually become fun and then everything would be fine. "You lose, we win, yay!" This movie should be seen for anyone who entertained the idea that Jackie Mason is funny. Then beat her over the head with this movie until the tape breaks. And if you even think about renting that shit (or, worse, have you!)? I mean, with such a crap you can see at a glance how bad it is! "Oy vey!" This movie is shit.
