Pam Grier is the super soul sister of the 70s. It is featured in many blaxploitation films recently discovered and appreciated by a new generation. I can say with certainty that BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA is the worst Pam Grier movie I've ever seen. Grier is Lee and Margaret Markov is Karen; They are two female prisoners who fled the prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked the touring car. Chained together, the film becomes DEFIANT ONES for women, but has three distinct actions: A fat criminal (Filipino star Vic Diaz) wants to see Lee dead, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent Sid Haig) is looking for the two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends are looking for her. The film eventually becomes so tangled and uninvolved with the two women that the title MEN CHASING WOMEN should have been. Grier, an action star, has no chance to participate in one of the many (overlong) action scenes. Markov is excellent, as Karen and Grier are okay as Lee, but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots. An interesting scene has forced the bounty hunter to make a police officer and his boss drop his pants so that he can shoot down the one with the smallest penis (judged by his whore) but easily forgotten in all the chaos. </ Br> /> BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA starts off as a great movie for women imprisoned with lesbian guards and a shower scene, then switches completely to a chase movie. If director Eddie Romero (famous for directing the Filipino horror films) had just stuck to the WIP theme, he would have been fine. Instead, BMWM is getting old very quickly and the surprising ending just makes the audience wonder why there was a 90-minute movie to end like this! Another problem: where should the film be filmed? While some accents are Spanish and cities have Spanish names (Los Robles etc), all the natives are obviously Asians! Hmmm ... Recommended only for die-hard Grier fans who will be disappointed even then.
