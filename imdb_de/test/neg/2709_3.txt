I was planning to see this movie when I saw it in my TV Guide, but after about five minutes, time is definitely more valuable than "Who's That Girl." It's impossible to describe how bad Madonna's acting is, and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever recorded in the movie. This crap is an insult to movies and intellect. I almost never! rate a movie I do not watch from beginning to end, but in that case the former is impossible. 2.10
