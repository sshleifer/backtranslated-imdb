When this film was staged by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino, I was sure that this would become a gem. I was wrong. I do not hate this movie, but I do not like it. <br /> <br /> I love Roger Avery because of his amazing direction in the rules of attraction and his scripts for Pulp Fiction and Silent Hill, but he made a mistake doing so. I really need a comment on Tarantino. We all know that he is a genius. <br /> <br /> This movie is just about a gang robbing a bank, but fails because of stupid people participating in the robbery I'm disappointed with Tarantino and Avery because I made this movie, but I change I do not think how great both are.
