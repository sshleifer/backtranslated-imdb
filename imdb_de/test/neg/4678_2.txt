The name of Bad Company's biggest hits album is "10 From 6". You could have just turned up this album and cut the tone in this movie. Most of the songs played in the movie are from this album. I think Oldsters in the 1970s was probably tired of all the pieces of the 1930s and 1940s. That's how I feel with films from the 70s. The characters in the movie looked like they were auditioning for Danny Terrio. Why do films have to exaggerate the 70s? The only good piece I liked was Freaks and Geeks. They cut this TV show. It was just like high school when I was there around 1980. I was old enough to remember the '70s, and no small town was like that. It was totally teen dominated. There were no reactionaries talking about the hippies and downtown Philly. Those were more the 70s that I remember as a kid. This movie was very boring and cheesy. Sometimes I fell asleep. I do not know why an actor who played in the 70s appeared in this movie. He probably tried to give him credibility. Walken did not show up until the second half. I think the only true thing about the movie was that the "baby boomers" were a lot. All the kids in the movie were spoiled brats. I do not know what they had against their father.
