The new Celebrity Deathmatch is terrible. They kill the masses and bring the low-budget celebrities to victory. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Little flip? Lil Flip and Lil Wayne should both die. Lil 'flip is shit. the fight between Lil 'Jon and Lil' Bow and Lil Flip was insane and short. They should just kill everyone. Why did Tobey lose to Jake and Christian to Adam? They are better actors and superheroes. They also spend too much time talking, rather than arguing, which can upset the audience. Everything seems to be rushed for some reason, they can not just fight a long fight? The old Deathmatch is much better.
