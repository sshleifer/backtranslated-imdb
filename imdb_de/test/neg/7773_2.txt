If you're a moron for crazy movies and are looking for something you do not need to pay close attention to, it might be worth it. The story itself is very unrealistic. The dialogue is also not very credible. It is doubtful that you are referring to any of these characters, as none of them are very likable. The drama could have been a lot worse. victoria pratt is clearly inappropriate with the rest of the cast, as she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress. Although it does not say much, this is one of the best achievements I've seen in Tori spelling. she seems to get better with age. Overall, this extremely melodramatic film is mediocre at best.
