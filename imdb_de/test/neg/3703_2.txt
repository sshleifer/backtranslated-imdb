Were it not for cursing and blurring when one character gives the other one a finger, it's easy to confuse this low-budget snoozer with a sci-fi channel pilot. The conspiracy over the government's attempts to destroy a group of telekinetics originally trained as a military weapon ends ambiguously with the self-taught hero who seeks a vengeful telekinetic survivor. Unfortunately, the film is talkative, boring, predictable and even without interesting special effects. Louis Gossett jr. Play a subordinate role as a nasty government bureaucrat who founded the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. He walks through the part and it's hard to understand why he's disturbed. Other members of the cast do a good job with a script that demands little.
