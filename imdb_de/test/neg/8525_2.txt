I almost laughed loudly when the director said the film was original with a strong plot. There is not one ... repeat an original plotting line or a special effect in this movie. <br /> <br /> The Crows ... Hitchcock has done well before CGI and even with CGI this movie lacks a well made attack scene. The scary crawling boy ... The grudge did it and did better. The Psycho ... at Cold Creek Manor lately, but it's been done to death. No pun intended. Unconnected / rebellious teenager whom no one listens to ... about a dozen films have used this except for Beetlejuice. The cloudy stuff from the basement ... can you say Amnityville Horror? Doors open uninvited ... What Lies Beneath did with a lot more flair. Scary farmhouse ... too numerous to mention. <br /> <br /> The background of metaphysics - which should really be the focus of attention - is lost once you find out what happens, which by the way is pretty early. <br /> <br /> What is actually not even trying to explain in the film is how they explain to the police that their assailant has sucked the mud down the basement so they really do not have a body. <br /> <br /> All in all ... NOT OTHER
