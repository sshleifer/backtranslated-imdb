I think there are two ways to target a movie with kids. You can either say a): "Let's make a movie that kids will love today!" or b) "Let's make a movie that I would have loved as a kid!" The second approach explains why Steven Spielberg often makes films that appeal to a younger audience. Prime examples are E.T., The Goonies or Indiana Jones. That Darn Cat is an example of the first approach. You see these flat, incredible characters saying things that are supposed to be funny, but are not. The plot itself lasts for ten minutes, but it goes on and on. And although I'm not a kid, I do not quite understand what's supposed to be fun for kids in this movie? The clumsy police chased by a dog, the old lady with a dwarf bird, or Christina Ricci's sarcastic oneliner? An actor showed a spark of talent with his acrobatic humor: Doug E. Doug as an FBI agent.
