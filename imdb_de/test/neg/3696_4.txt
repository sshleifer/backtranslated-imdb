I've always been interested in watching the movie since it was featured in a British magazine in the early 1980s titled "The Movie" (incidentally also the Leonard Maltin Film Guide) as the worst movie of all time was awarded the uncomfortable BOMB rating). When it appeared on DVD last year, I was interested in buying the boxing set "Cult Camp Classics" in which it was included (along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [1958] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]). Since buying QUEEN recently on DVD-R, I had paid for the idea. <br /> <br /> Luckily I just stumbled across the movie on DivX - but the print was not taken out of the movie Warner's DVD (which supposedly has a surprisingly pleasant-looking transfer), but rather a muddy TV imprint ... although not so much the detail is lost (in other words, it was like watching the movie as opposed to black and black - white!). To get to the point, I have to admit that I was disappointed that the movie was not the laugh party I had been expecting all this time (Maltin calls it "weird awful"). ; Actually, I found it very appealing - and grateful for just over an hour. However, there are some undeniably amusing parts - such as when the old sister begins to shout her head off at the sight of the 50-foot woman and the sheriff's deputy almost overruns his boss and the head lady's butler in his enthusiasm to help him in one unusual case. The special effects also did not strike me as "among the funniest" (again Maltin) in the movie - though they are certainly embarrassing! <br /> <br /> Okay, so the idea that an alien (in huge human form, dressed in caveman rags and radioactive for takeoff!) comes to earth in a large, spherical (!) spaceship and seems to be it's total nonsense according to the heroine's award-winning necklace - and its quasi-transparent appearance is not at all beneficial ... but it's really human history that attracts our attention (in relative terms). The figure of the man is not very interesting, but his two wives are: the wealthy, nagging alcoholic Allison Hayes and the ambitious, vixen girlfriend Yvette Vickers. Also involved in the story are Haye's faithful servants (mentioned earlier), a few policemen (one of them, as mentioned elsewhere, he is lovably stupid) and just as many doctors (one of them is called Dr. Cushing [!] And another .) A specialist called when Hayes begins to grow in size after irradiation. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film can be considered as the reverse female version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957) - though it is. It would not be fair to compare the two further, as the classic by Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson is much more psychological / intellectual. Actually, Hayes does not seem to struggle so much with her "condition" and actually uses her to teach her husband a lesson. Her tantrum - exaggerated in movie posters of the era - is rather strange (especially considering that this is only the case in the last ten minutes). If you do not show the damage caused by her enormous but highly unconvincing hand (especially when lifting the puppet, which is supposed to be her husband!), You can usually see her in wide angle and almost backwards (with her size it is even inconsistent in relation to the buildings) it goes by) !! Nevertheless, Hayes's death is electrocuted (when he bumps into an electrical cable). <br /> <br /> Finally, I followed with his television remake from 1993 with Daryl Hannah as the title creature - which I specifically hired for this purpose.
