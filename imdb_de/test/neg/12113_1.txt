I'll say to my review with the preface that I'm not a fan of the independent genre "Direct to Video," which owes a lot of debt to the Grindhouse movies of the 1960s. I do not own one, I've never hired one, so maybe I'm missing the appreciation for those winking, cheap stinkers that many other people have. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie Saturday night with a girlfriend on Cinemax. Please do not ask me why I saw Cinemax on Saturday night with a friend. We got bored at World Championship Poker. A horribly bad acting courtesy of Misty Mundae (and I wish she was not from Illinois, since we're really very bright Thespians here) caught our attention. Usually, the goal of good softcore porn is to get you and your partner in the mood. Some good sex, humorous humor and who knows what could happen? After about 15 minutes and a scene in which the title character seduces an ambush victim, my girlfriend said, 'If you want to see the rest of that money, I'm going to bed, so I do not have to. Please turn off the volume. Here's what I can tell from the story: Misty's character is a sexless nerd who is bitten by a spider and turns into a super-sexual kitten with super web-slinging powers that are not coming from her wrists , There is a kind of bad villainy that does not look very angry or sexy. Spiderbabe saves the day, has sex, MJ (who is male in this movie) is constantly being proposed by stereotypically bad gay bikers, and somehow the evil ripoff is being driven to death by a building. <br /> <br /> What was good about this movie? It ended. <br /> <br /> What was bad about that? A third-grade script looked like an Oscar winner, a screenplay of people I wanted to get drunk on, college-age sex offenders who would not know what sex is, if they had a dr. Ruth taught class attended effects that were about as special as someone jumping from a trampoline, humor about as funny as ?? Well, I have not found anything that is Lamer yet. The sex scenes? If we saw a video, those scenes would have only activated the fast-forward button. And the action scenes? Some of my old Atari VCS games had a better choreography. Now I know that this kind of movie should be enjoyed because of its inherent inadequacy. Companies like EI do not want to make good films: they have a niche and aim for it. My experience as a marketer tells me that they are the right money for the audience. But after my brief encounter with 'Spiderbabe' I can say that I will not dive into this world again soon. The problem with the filmmakers in this genre is perhaps the following: they go to great lengths to make the films bad, and if they make an effort to focus on what they are doing very well, they would 'le bad' Cinema, a la Troma movies in the 80s, proved to be very pleasing. Sorry people; The mind is there, but the effort is not. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that "Alice in Acidland" fascinates me?
