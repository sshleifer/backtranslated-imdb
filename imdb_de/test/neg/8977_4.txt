Deep Sea 3D offers a breathtaking view of an underwater world that few have seen first-hand. <br /> <br /> From the opening sequence, as a wave approaches the audience, which sinks us briefly into the sea The filmmakers make full use of the IMAX format. A jellyfish field seems to fill the whole theater, a shark acts on us, predators jump up behind the rocks and eat their prey. It's a beautifully caught eye candy. <br /> <br /> Our ears are not treated the same way. The movie is told by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sound so ridiculous that they positively affect the enjoyment of the visuals. Dork sounds a little bored as Winslet sounds as if reading a bedtime story to the village idiot. I was shocked that an actress of her status could have rendered her performance so wrong. The script is pretty stupid and contains very little depth. The soundtrack is filled with strange, unrealistic sound effects that I think are funny, but they divert attention from the material that could have spoken for itself. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman has delivered an outstanding result that greatly influences the ups and downs of life under the sea when it is allowed to play with pepper without stupid bladder tones or crabs. <br /> <br /> The film is a technical marvel, but it can not be taken seriously with its childlike script, annoying stories, and inappropriate sound effects.
