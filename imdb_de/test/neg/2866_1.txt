and one of them is a 14-year-old girl in a bathing suit. For fans of this film, I would like to ask: Would you allow your daughter to walk around dressed in a resort dressed like this? And would your 14-year-old be able to handle the reaction of men? If so, I would like to know why, on both counts. A suit like this is a clear invitation to the men; It is hypocritical to say that this is not the case. <br /> <br /> And to another point, which teen would ever claim that her father was her lover, without the excuse for serious mental health problems? This is almost as disgusting as the bathing suit. <br /> <br /> Simply put, some things just are not funny or suitable and never will be.
