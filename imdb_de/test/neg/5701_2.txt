This movie has EVERY clich√© of any terrorism or airplane crisis movie. <br /> <br /> However, thanks to the good performances of Rowland, Loken, and Smallwood (and possibly Enberg as well), it's not entirely unsurpassable. What's really amazing are the computer animations they show as live-action scenes to attempt. Boy, oh boy, the CGI scenes in "The Last Starfighter" shot in 1984 are better than these (17 years later). The feeling of Cheepnis really shakes his back. <br /> <br /> Too bad, that could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste.
