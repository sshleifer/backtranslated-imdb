I always found the diligent Man Ray and his artistic endeavors extremely presumptuous, and I never understood why his work attracted so much attention. Apart from his rayographers (whom he invented by accident and who are only direct-contact photo prints), he seems to be the only real contributor to the culture that he was the first photographer to portray female nudity in a way that more as art was accepted as a porn. But surely this had to happen sometime, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story of the Emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> "L'Ã‰toile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... offers a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish that is never explained. Starfishes have the amazing ability to regenerate lost limbs and even regenerate whole body duplicates. However, if this has anything to do with the theme of this film, Ray neglects to say so. I was more impressed by the title cards of this film, which contain rhymes (in French), a pun ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux. <br /> <br /> As so often in Ray's work There is indeed a beautiful young woman in this film. Unfortunately, the photography is (largely) so fuzzy that we have little opportunity to appreciate it. I rate this jumble a point of 10 points.
