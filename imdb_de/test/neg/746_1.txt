Shaky handheld cameras (this piece was intended for television, not for the movie) not only make you fully aware of how awful the cinematography is in this movie, but make you absolutely unable to immerse yourself in the story. Poor Miss Austen has to roll in her grave. All I can say is, if you've enjoyed the novel, stop there until the BBC creates one of their most intelligent and sensitive masterpieces (like Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth) that, I think, would have worshiped Austen ). The BBC would never dare to sell cheesy saxophone solos and indigo-girl-hollers over a historic castle and a loving hug. Giles Foster often seemed confused that they were editing the music for The Specialist. If you want to love Austen the way you love her, look for the BBC logo ...
