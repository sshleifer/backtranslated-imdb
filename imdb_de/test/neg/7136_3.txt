Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) travels to Tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and falls into the same mysterious curse that killed so many people. With a group of others, she tries to finally solve the curse and finish. <br /> <br /> The Grudge 2 washes everything from the beginning and only causes a little fear. The first grudge was at best an average movie. The premise was decent, but the acting was wooden and some scenes were really ridiculous. The Grudge 2 is still stupid and less scary than the original. Scary Movie 4 has made it almost impossible to take these movies seriously, and I struggled to keep a clear face during the "frightening scenes", which should make people laugh more than just scared. How Takashi Shimizu screwed up his own franchise is inexplicable, but he managed to create a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, he kept the movie at a slow pace with a bunch of boring characters and paralyzing fear tactics. Obviously he made this movie for money and I'm glad he failed. <br /> <br /> The script was pretty bad, mainly because it made no sense and they did not develop the characters at all. There were three different stories in the film, and each one of them had something to do with "the grudge." The connections were weak and a number of people were killed for no reason. They do not explain the rules of the curse very well and it got a bit of a bloodbath because everyone died, though the PG-13 rating kept things from getting interesting so even some of the death scenes were pretty lame. The dialogue was weak and none of the characters was sympathetic or well enough developed to really care. <br /> <br /> The acting was comparable to everything else and in comparison to the first one she was much worse. Amber Tamblyn was annoyingly wooden. She moved very slowly on the screen and all her feelings seemed to be fake. Sarah Michelle Gellar was okay, even though she had a cameo. Jennifer Beals showed the best performance, she had some good scenes and was somehow effective. Arielle Kebbel was okay, a bit bland. The rest was either terrible or easy to forget. Overall, The Grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel. There were many things missing and it's not worth looking at. Rating 4/10
