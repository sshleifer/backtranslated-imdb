This movie is awful. If you think about watching this movie ... two words, DO NOT do it. It's tasteless, the plot is really lame and the jokes are even worse. The spectacle is really pathetic. I can not believe this movie was made. If you fancy a teen comedy, watch American Pie, Going Greek or Road Trip. It's about two girls driving to Malibu in their Spring Break. As usual, they did not plan much and called their uncle (I think she calls Michelle) in Malibus Villa together. Uncle Bennie strictly forbids them to organize any kind of party, and as you can imagine, they continue to do so. Please, I ask you not to see this movie.
