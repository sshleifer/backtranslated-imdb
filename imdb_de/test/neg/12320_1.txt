Inappropriate The PG rating received by this film is another big misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13, but this movie gets a PG? You're welcome. Parents can not be fooled, it is a big mistake to bring a primary school child to this film. There have been many times that I felt uncomfortable, not only because the humor was inappropriate for children, but also because he was totally out of the blue and unnecessary is still a horrible movie. The casting and the overall picture of the film are the only achievements. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always sympathetic (or in this case hateful) Alec Baldwin are both good at their roles, though Preston is almost too beautiful for such a role. The children are conditioned actors and this is particularly evident in Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that made me throw things on the screen and not throw at them. Mike Myers is absolutely regrettable. I did not like him as the voice of Shrek, and I truly believe that Myers should never come anywhere near children's films again. His portrayal of The Cat is a bit weakened version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, if only for one day he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal trouble and discord. <br /> <br /> The cat in the hat is perhaps the worst children's movie of all time.
