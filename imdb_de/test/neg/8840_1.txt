With great expectations I have seen this film, the Spanish contribution to the Oscar race this year. Partly completely pointless, banal, pathetic, poorly written, edited, acted and staged, the film is too long. It does not succeed in transmitting the "message" that it tries to give, in storytelling, the awkward historical settings and above all in the rhythm. There are such extreme dropouts that I have not seen in a movie in a long time (the story of Lucas, whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all the lizard nonsense). The Spanish-speaking audience around me yawned and quickly lost patience. Some of the comments I heard were whether the members of the Spanish Academy had taken drugs before they chose the film for the Oscars.
