I must admit, as ashamed as I am, this indescribable teenager was one of my favorite movies. Nine years after seeing Stephen King's frightening story for the first time, I've come to my senses and can more reasonably evaluate Fritz Kiersch's work. A young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic buddy are really disturbing on paper, but this leads to one cheap, average horror show on celluloid. Much of this result can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch makes the beginning of the movie almost a hacker slasher show and then turns the finale into a nightmare of hocus-pocus special effects. <br /> <br /> The cast is reasonable, but they can only provide as much credibility as this incredible movie allows, and the soundtrack of Jonathan Elias is scarier than the images. <br /> <br /> That's a shame George Goldsmith's script made Stephen King's haunting short story a shocking horror. Isaac, Malachai and all the other "kids of corn" are not really scary. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 7, 1994 - Video
