I renounce the obvious verification of factual inaccuracies. They are too numerous to name. A much shorter list would be what they understood correctly. 1st type called Noah 2nd Ark with animals on it. <br /> <br /> If you wish a much more detailed account of Noah's Ark and the destruction of Sodom, you can rent The Bible (1966). It shows the story of creation by Abraham trying to sacrifice his son Isaac. It's a much better movie and it could be that the horror "Noah's Ark" (1999) made you look for such a movie. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I really did not like the movie. When I read other comments, I can see that even the atheists found it grossly wrong. As a Christian, that was unbearable for me. Maybe the worst movie ever made. Not a real point for this movie, except, perhaps, to show off her computer animation. <br /> <br /> Was it a complete waste? Maybe not. God can use evil to work well. <br /> <br /> Romans 8:28 says, [28] And we know that all things serve the good for those who love God, those who are called to His purpose. <br /> <br Genesis 50 says: [20] But as for you, you thought of me badly; But God meant well to do what it is today to save many people alive. In the second example, Joseph's brothers wanted to kill him, but God made their evil a very good one. He may have done the same thing with this movie. <br /> <br /> People were so astonished at the lack of biblical foundations that they could probably break the dusty old Bible and read the story for themselves. To learn from Lot and Sodom, they would have to go all the way to Genesis 19 before God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah. By then, they have read nearly half of Genesis, so maybe they want to quit. The next book is Exodus, which is based on the film "The Ten Commandments" (and much more accurate). If you've seen this movie, Exodus is easy to read. So now they've read at least two whole books of the Bible just because they saw a pathetic movie about Noah's Ark. I am sure that this actually happened to someone in the world. God works in a mysterious way.
