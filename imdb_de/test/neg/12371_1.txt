This is one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen. I can not believe that the person who wrote the review was serious. Maybe he was bound to do it. It has nothing to offer. There is no tension, the spectacle is bleak, the direction hopeless. The music score (?) Consists of three banal sounds that are played until dawn. The plot (?) Has taken to writing every five minutes. The dialogue is what a 10-year-old would achieve with a homework project. The only (redeeming) feature is the actor who plays the psycho himself, making great faces, trembling and gurns, and is therefore sometimes amusing. The only reason you would be on the edge of the seat would be if you suffer from a weak bladder. Do not waste your time.
