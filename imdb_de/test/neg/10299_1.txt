Without a doubt the biggest movie waste of the year. This film is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and full of unusual characters. In addition, and perhaps the worst crime, it is uninteresting and unpredictable. As soon as Bill Pullman's character scribbled on the photo, the word "evidence" was changed to "violence," and I had found out the entire conspiracy. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to look at this garbage. The only salvation feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and wasted no money. I would be really angry if I had paid to see it in a theater. <br /> <br /> If you call this thing a thriller, you really have to get more out of it. A horrible, horrible movie in all important areas.
