I have been trying to write a summary of the plot for a few minutes now, and can not seem to. But with a movie as bad as Night of the Blood Beast, the plot barely matters. An astronaut crash lands and is considered dead. His body is later revived, but he carries the embryos of a foreign life form. But how did they get there? And where is the alien who implanted the strange creatures in Maj. John Corcoran's body? <br /> <br /> IMDb lists the duration of the night of blood beast at 62 minutes. Is that correct? 62 minutes It had to take longer. It felt infinite to me. Even with the MST3K comment (which was very funny by the way), the actual movie felt much longer. And it's pretty much a Snoozer from start to finish. I like a lot of those alien invasion movies of the 50s, but not these. It has aroused my interest at any level. The baby aliens looked too stupid to be taken seriously, the title blood beast was pathetic and none of the characters did anything for me. Add the usual low-budget Roger Corman traps and you have a real loser of a movie.
