I will not lie and say I'm not watching the show - I'm doing it. BUT it has a lot and many shortcomings. 1) The boarding school is perfect. The drama is minimal. Everyone is so nice to each other, you know? Let this be a reality test. It is impossible that every school is like PCA. Free laptops for everyone. Large dorms. Mini Refrigerators If there were such a school in real life, almost nobody would have a maiden for it. Secondly, everyone is so rich and it's weird that nobody stole anything yet. 2) Characters really unrealistic. The first things first, whoever speaks in his right mind as he does. They talk like a perfect teenager. Second, Logan Reese (Matthew Underwood) is an extremely rich boy "hot" teenager. My question is, why is there almost no girl in this school anywhere in it? He's rich and "hot" now, and all those girls would be after him, even if he was an idiot. Besides, Chase is the stupidest person ever. He is this timid teenager who claims not to be in love with Zoey and overreacts to anything Zoey is concerned about. She must be BLIND so as not to see him in love with her. <br/> <br /> Come on, Nick. I know you can do it better than that. Please ..
