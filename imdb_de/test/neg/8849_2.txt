I can appreciate films with subtitles from foreign countries, especially those in which the subtitles are weak and do not really follow the story or make sense, but this movie had too many parts that did not make much sense. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can admit to some creepy and crazy parts, but they repeat themselves, I felt like I was seeing a loop trailer; It seems like it's a short film shot with different actors. <br /> <br /> In the veins of RINGU and GRUDGE, the hype is not over yet ... the excessive length has destroyed the thrill /> If you're not a die-hard fan of this type of movie (which I thought I would), you should not waste your time with it.
