I attended a screening of "The Cooler" at the Toronto Film Festival this year. While the other reviews I have read are generally (and mysteriously) positive, I have to tell you that this film is unimaginable, unbelievably bad. The very courageous and sincere performances of William H. Macy and Maria Bello were most horribly missed in the least polished, clich√©d script that has been given the green light for years. I do not know how bad The Brown Bunny was, but I'm sure he could not reach the depths of the Dante style this one made here. As brave as their performances were, the bravest thing these otherwise brilliant actors did was to be entrusted to such a dreadful director and such a gruesome screenplay within a hundred meters of a camera. The dialogue is so shameful and awkward that I actually blushed during the performance. I'm ashamed that Macy's talent was wasted in the hands of someone whose management is as incompetent as his writing. Watching gifted actors like Alec Baldwin through Kramer's appalling scripting and ham-fisting It was almost like watching a seal being beaten to death - I felt angry, helpless and sick at the same time. Although I am always glad that there are investors and industrialists who want to make risky writings with interesting premises, this picture was a total fiasco. Kramer could not have been more cruel to these actors if he himself had forced a steel pipe to his knees. I hope for them that they can all avoid similar humiliations in the future. Macy wisely pulled herself through the side door and did not even stop for the show. Unfortunately, it seems that the main character's bad luck is possible at the worst. Anyone who is used to quality independent people will probably find it completely unbearable.
