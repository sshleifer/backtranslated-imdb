Creating a comedy is like a pretty thin rope. It works either or not. Grandma Boy is one of those movies that does not work. It may have some very funny parts, but for the majority it's just a horribly lighthearted comedy from the usual minor characters in Adam Sandler's films (Sand's himself, he's just a producer). <br /> <br /> Alex (Allen Covert) is a game tester. He is 35 and is the best tester and game player in his otherwise large workspace. In the end, he gets his flat and his things he took because he did not pay the bills (as it turns out, his roommate had just paid the rent for Philipino hookers and not for the landlord). Desperate, he moves to his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond) and her two roommates. <br /> <br /> This is the basic plot of the movie, which is subplots about a hot new girl named Samantha (Linda Cardelli, from her time as Velma in Scooby Doo unrecognizable) trying to bring the testers to complete a new game as soon as possible, a robot-like game that spawns JP (Joel Moore), who works with Alex and much wears the same clothes as Neo in The Matrix and, of course, all sorts of sexual and drug-related jokes. That's it. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie, aside from the fact that the real conflict is in the movie and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the movie, is that it's just not funny. It is totally amazing boring and just funny fun. Nothing happens at all. No emotions, no sense of direction and a lot of heavy cursing. You may be laughing at some witty jokes the actors say, but otherwise you'll be in utter boredom and wish you had not even studied the movie. How this movie was lit green and how Fox thought he could make money remains a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> There is simply no entertainment value that could result. None of the actors actually performs well, they behave like idiots for the camera and hope for the best. Stoner's comedy has been played several times and occasionally indeed (Harold and Kumar go to White Castle and Dazed and Confused). Here it only makes the movie even less funny than it already is. The chance shot of a monkey and a pair of naked breasts does not make the movie any better. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few funny lines, this film should be completely ignored. It's not very funny, the whole plot is stupid, boring and just makes a horrible movie. Avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
