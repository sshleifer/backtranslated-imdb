This is a total crap. It is an insult to the great book by Frank Herbert. They have distorted the story and the characters. Acting is average to bad. The only well-made and well-played character is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies quite early in the story and then goes downhill (not that it is a very big hill to start with). The film from 1984 was staged by the legendary David Lynch. I was not very impressed with the movie, but given the technological limitations of the time, they did their best. Amazingly, the shitty Miniserie looks much better in comparison. It was at least in line with the book that I really love. <br /> <br /> You had the chance to get it right this time, unfortunately it was not used.
