Let me first say that I rarely discuss movies. I only comment when I'm excited or disappointed with something that I thought would be good. Killshot was a big disappointment on many levels. The script was awful, the drama was below average (especially by heavy weights like Rourke and Lane) and the editing and effects were weird ((cars blow up, etc.)) Rosario Dawson had a terrible role, I can not I believe I would even accept it, it was an abuse of her talent that I can not put into words. I should have known after seeing the trailer for this movie 3 years ago, and it was repeatedly put on the shelf that it was a serious problem with this movie. ...... do not bother, unless you are really bored ........
