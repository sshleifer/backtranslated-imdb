I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was horrible; it was pointless and just stupid. The alleged conspiracy involved a future groom who was too involved in the problems of the world to refer to his bride and other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (no less in a tuxedo) and joins in with a selection of crazy people. <br /> <br /> We saw it with a busload of people on the way to Atlantic City and everyone agreed that it was a horrible movie. It tried to be profound, but it was not. it was stupid and offensive. If I was not on a bus, I would have gone out of the movie. Everyone who wants to watch the movie or wants to rent or buy the video has been forewarned.
