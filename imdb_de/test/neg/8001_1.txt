This movie simply has no redemptive features. The story is incomprehensible and the script is gross, sadistic and stupid. The sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable chase. The music is terrible. Acting is largely limited to the growl and grin. A half star pal. Too bad for DirecTV, that it was set to pay-per-view. In a theater, people might have thrown soda on the screen.
