This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best. I know, I know ... but how good is that? Well, let's not be stupid. It's still pretty bad, but it's a good movie compared to the first two. Again digitally shot, with decent lighting and good camera work. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> When a college baseball team harasses new members, one remains in a diabetic coma. Of course, they leave him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow. According to legend, the soul of the boy is transferred to the body of the scarecrow, which is brought to life and brings terrible revenge. The co-eds drive to the beach, which is very close to the corn field. On the sunny beach they are gradually killed by the whistling scarecrow. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Brian Katkin does a credible job bringing the much needed drama to the movie. Unfortunately, the drama jumps over well and ends up in ordinary cheese. Much of the acting was fair, but there were some really horrible tunes, including a horrible piece of bad lip-synching. Some of the issues were largely unresolved, and most were used to find someone alone so they could be slaughtered. Again better than the previous installments, but still missing.
