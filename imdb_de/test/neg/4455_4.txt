It is a shame that such a lame plan should be hung up in such picturesque locations, with some features added to the documentary for additional length. A shorter movie might have kept the tension a little more, and a more charismatic track may not have distorts its lines so much. The female lead role was not allowed to do enough, which led to a pretty, but boring affair. It builds towards the end, but the main character's own salvation is not too late and should have been revealed earlier in the movie. Not terrible, only a pity. Insignificant, but nice enough to decorate the television programs of the early hours.
