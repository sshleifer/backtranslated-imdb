Note to myself. Never again see a serious movie with Charlie Sheen in it. Great comedian, terrible seal. This film makes Navy SEALS look like a ruthless group of Rangers, even though they are indeed the most elite form of military in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy the reputation of the Navy SEAL. Thank you for making such an unbelievably selected group of people look bad in one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is a great story that could be turned into an amazing action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are opportunities for a very passionate story, but Sheen decides to ruin her with "funny" comments.
