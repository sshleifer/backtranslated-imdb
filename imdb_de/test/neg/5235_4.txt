After the lush, inspiring aerial shot in time lapse at the beginning of the film, the movie got into boredom and a one-note note to the end. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? the characters. I really enjoyed them in the book, here it was all the guys and one-dimensional idiots who had either "victim" or "asshole" on their foreheads right from the start. It's a mystery to me how shopkeeper Leland Gaunt (in a haunting and inappropriate performance by Sydrow) did not see through anyone. <br /> <br /> This film lacks thrills, excitement and, to a certain extent, entertaining values. It stretches far too long and does not have much profit. Why should you introduce too many annoying characters and then forget about half of them halfway? In the book, virtually everyone who went to the store met a cruel fate. Apart from one of the only decent scenes that was well translated from the novel (the fight between Wilma and Nettie), this was a flop and there were not many balls. I'm sorry, but after the screen's demise, a boring kill and some quarrels and then a few explosions, it just did not do it for me. Unfortunately, the brutality and vulgarity of the book was missing. The explosion of the church scene was so exaggerated and badly executed, suddenly the whole city was in a brawl? It made no sense, and characters that were not consistently introduced are suddenly: who are these people and why should I care? <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere and none of the scenes had any momentum. I thought Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good actors, but the movie does not give them enough substance to give me a damn. Amanda Plummer was credible, but too pathetic to be really sympathetic (she was a sad and depressing character in the novel). J.T. Walsh was entertaining, but the role was anything but interesting or complex. Too predictable <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was too noble for the supported material. It stuck out like a big thumb. Just there buddy, easy. A little less theatrically, I would guess it worked. <br /> <br /> I admit that something of the Gore it did was good enough, I think, the director often seemed to hold back though. If you want to make a movie that hits the 2-hour mark, make sure that there is more going on than this disaster of adapting one of King's better novels. <br /> <br /> I have often laughed at scenes of laughter One assumed they should be taken seriously (Ed Harri's speech in the end, or the character Hugh Priest in general), and for most of the time she was bored and uninterested. Personally, the director should have done so much more with this story, his approach is too tame and hides behind too much sharp cinematography to ever appear as a decent movie. The movie looks good, but not the look I think I deserve. I mean, this guy was leading ALASKA, not a good sign. <br /> <br /> I'd rather read the book because it's also much more entertaining, multi-layered character development, cruel violence and chaos, an unpleasant sense of humor and much more fun. This is a slaughtered version that does not have much to offer. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
