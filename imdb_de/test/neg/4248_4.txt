Although I do not usually like romantic dramas, I saw this movie a bit short. <br /> <br /> There was a promise that the characters and relationships could be explored much deeper than before, but the story did not seem to be in order to understand the direction in which it was going. <br /> <br /> The comparisons and parallels in the story, especially the three generations of women in the family, have had much potential, but they have not fully expanded. It could have made the movie a lot easier to connect to, and connect to, the goal of any movie about lost love and the recovered life. I think the film was suffering from a lack of direction Although Harry Connick Jr. and Sandra Bullock have desperately tried to breathe life into the otherwise flat character outlines, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> It's not that this is a bad movie plot developments, it's just that this movie is undermined, and overall a bit flat.
