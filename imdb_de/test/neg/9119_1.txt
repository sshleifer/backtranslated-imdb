Would not it be for the fact that it is a 2 DVD set combined with the original American graffiti; If it was not that I have been here in Iraq for a few months and will see pretty much everything at this point, I would have thrown this movie in the trash after the first ten minutes. This movie was terribly bad on so many levels that I do not know where to start. Badly played, shot, judged, written, rated, edited. The first attempts of my 9-year-old daughter in filmmaking are superior - and she filmed the sleeping dog. (Come to think about giving this piece of cinematography 9 stars, but I'm biased.) If you have even the least appreciation for the quality of filmmaking, avoid this piece of rubbish at all costs. No character in this film has a single quality of salvation except for the Icelander, who does not even have a single line in English. I will not waste any more time describing what a bad movie that is.
