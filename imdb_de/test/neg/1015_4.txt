Since Paul Kersey did not have any real relatives for revenge, the third installment in the "Death Wish" saga is that he returns to New York to visit an old war comrade. He only comes to find out that Brooklyn has completely turned into an impoverished Gangland and that adolescent thugs have killed his friend and are constantly terrorizing all the other tenants of a rickety apartment building. Kersey makes a deal with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blond lawyer, blows away countless villains with an impressive Wildey Magnum weapon, and trains and inspires gradually the petrified New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Okay, there's no point defending the "Death Wish" series after seeing Part Three. The original from 1974 was a masterpiece that was as much about social drama as it was about retaliation. Although it was pure exploitation, the second part still had some redeeming qualities, and at least the events were logically linked to the events in the first. Number three often feels like a completely different franchise. Apparently, Kersey is no longer an architect, he is ten times more social and talkative than before, and suddenly no one, not even the police, is more against vigilante action? All these changes and some other aspects make it more than obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson have reduced their "death wish" success to a mindless and exploitative action series that has a huge death toll with each episode and more explosives and criminals, they become more evil, sloppy, meaner and much harder to kill. However, the gentlemen did not seem to realize that the uninterrupted spitfire of violence actually produces an opposite effect, namely this extremely monotonous and much boring one than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that described "Death Wish 3" as a mere definition of cinematic masturbation. This description could not be more punctual as the script moves tiredly from one disgusting execution sequence to the next. In particular, the last twenty minutes are a complete "orgy" of shots, explosions and executions, which were realized through improvised home-made measures. Yi-Haaa! This entry in the series has a pretty interesting side effect, including Martin Balsam ("Psycho", "12 Angry Men") as the tired neighbor who holds machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter ("Family Plot") "as something unorthodox Copper and even Alex Winter (from "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!") In his debut as one of the thugs.
