Conclusion: Since the warrior queen Gedren has raised and slaughtered most of Sonja's family, she has trained in sword martial arts. Now, Gedren has taken a very powerful talisman that threatens to destroy the world if it is not destroyed, killing Sonja's sister. Now Sonja is vengeful and saves the world. Along the way, she meets the very Conan-like (but not Conan, no!) Kalidor, the children's prince Tarn and his bodyguard Falcon. First, Sonja rejects any help, but later has to accept it and save the world together. <br /> <br /> Comment: If you watch a movie like this, you think it's the story. That's the best element in this movie, the movie is in big trouble. Because 1) a movie like this one should base its strength on good sword fights and effects and 2) the story is really very bad. It's simple and straightforward and really does not do anything for character development or even tension. It's predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, Sonja and Kalidor, have no chemistry at all. And the child is just annoying. And most of the scenes are so long that they get boring. Although the film is not very long, it does not have enough material to fill its time. And so back to point 1). The battles are slow, uneventful and really bad. It clearly shows that most fighters clearly block the opponent's blows, which are far ahead of the opponent who even started beating. In my honest opinion, I believe that most children who fight with sticks produce more exciting fights than knights, than in this movie. All in all, this is a really bad spin-off that should be avoided by anyone who likes Conan movies. <br /> <br /> 2/10
