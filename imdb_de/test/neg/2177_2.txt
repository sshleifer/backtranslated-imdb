Chaplin was a great mute comedian, but many silent stars of time fell as the audience heard their voices in the first few conversations. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice simply did not suit his dumb characters, which made him rich and famous. His career never recovered when the sound came to the film. Unlike most of the reviews I've read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not add to his popularity with the average viewer, who expected to be entertained by Chaplin the Comedian, and did not spend his amusing dollars on Chaplin's political commentary to observe. </ Br> Despite Chaplin's awards and knighthood, I would make an exception to his "contributions" to humanity. The Great Dictator was founded at the same time as Stalin's brutal dictatorship was conducting its show trials, and both dictators signed the agreement that led to invasion of Poland by both dictators. World War II began with the attempt to save Poland. The Nazis were defeated in 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. This happened at the time this movie was filmed and Hollywood's investigations by the federal government. If Chaplin had included Joe Stalin in this satire, in addition to the Italian dictator, he might have had less criticism of his policy by the politicians. The mistreatment of Jews and dissidents by the Soviet Union surpassed the time and number of Nazis. <br /> <br /> Many films felt that many of the gags were too timely to be understood by younger audiences who did not know who Goebbels knew was Goering or Mussolini. A classic work of art must prove itself. The classical Greek tragedy, the Mona Lisa and Beethoven's Ninth, are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless. Films that rely on current political commentary or currently popular social views generally do not survive the generation in which they are made. But those who deal with problems that are common to all generations will probably live forever and get a high rating from me. Chaplin, because the author, director and lead actor has to blame for what I think is a dated and tiring film. Chaplin's apologists apologized for his decision to leave the country, which made him rich and famous. If Chaplin found the US so offensive, why did not he return to his homeland? The Briton fought blood and money against the Nazis. What has Switzerland contributed to the fight against European dictators? Switzerland is like a country club, choosing and choosing its members by race and class, and does not care much about people who can not be admitted to the club.
