I appeared as an extra and was a journalist for The Dain Curse. I was involved in filming this film in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania (Jim Thorpe was also one of the filming locations of The Molly Maguires, 1969). I reported on the "action" in the newspaper Emmaus Free Press, where I was editor from 1978 to 1980 (the newspaper was no longer published in the 1990s). I remember the excellent attention to detail of costumes, automobiles etc. of the past. The modern asphalt roads of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a rural town in the south of the 1920s. At that time, I interviewed the producer and briefly talked to the director in a change of sentence. I did not get an interview with James Coburn, which has always been a big disappointment to me. Incidentally, I briefly appear in one of the street scenes, with a snap cap and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to step in and it was a thrill. I still have a collection of black and white stills that I've taken from production for the newspaper. One day they might be of interest to film and television historians. - Lou Varricchio
