You have to see this movie! It is so bad that it is really great. <br /> <br /> You have your crazy but brave captain, who of course has an affair with his worn-out husband, who used to be a great copilot. And of course there is also a collision in the air when the captain's enemy and rival is too yET for the ride. Then you have your old crazy buddy of Army Air, who flies the fighter and tries to do well. I can not tell you what he's trying to do. The plane keeps going up and he's fine, and then you have your greedy and immoral corporate engineer and then your ice station zebra is cold and then Lucky rescues the evil from the roar so he can land the plane! and it does not end --- it just keeps going on and on! You have to see that. It is great! YOU WANT TO PUT UP ME! Did you ACTUALLY DISPLAY IT IN COMMERCIAL TELEVISION AND HOW IT WAS REJECTED ON THE CABLE?
