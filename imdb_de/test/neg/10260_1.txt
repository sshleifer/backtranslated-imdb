Before I really shoot this movie, I just want to say that I absolutely loved it. <br /> <br /> How many times have the characters in the movie used the phrase "You're Right"? I'm sure I counted in the hundreds before giving up and watching the movie again. Second, what the hell is with these blue monkey things? OK, so the Dansen family had a very private life and had a brown eye, a blue eye, but since when does humans turn into underground, carnivorous blue zombie creatures? <br /> <br /> and finally: 'Old believers here protect me' hahaha :)
