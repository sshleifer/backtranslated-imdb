The filmmakers have done everything to ONLY find the following demographics: Palestinians who seem to have a peace-loving, solution-seeking goodwill, Palestinians (especially older women and families with children) who are particularly uncomfortable with security fence and Israelis who are not Believing in the security fence, they strongly sympathize with their alleged effect on Palestinians and consider it unnecessarily divisive and / or a waste of money. Oh yes, they use a member of the Israeli government who supports the fence, but they do what they can to make him look inhumane and unfeeling, and ask him very key questions that are really statements (eg, "The wall is bad"). ) for the environment ... it destroys everything "). <br /> <br /> I have no problem with it (well, most of them) are presented in the film, as much as I do not to the people who interview them However, the question of the Israeli security fence has at least two sides, and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of Israelis (and many others) support the construction of the fence and believe that he overall has a positive impact, this "documentation" "does not even present such a person. They even go so far as to interview an Israeli Jew who claims that "all Israelis support the fence" and are thus crazy, and then stubbornly refuse to even interview such a "crazy" Israeli. Oh, and to top it off, set the tone for the film by interviewing a couple of young Israeli kids (really exceptions to the rule - I was there) who laugh about their Arab neighbors from all over the area. <br /> <br /> A "documentary" is a film that deals with a topic and presents a wealth of facts, opinions and perspectives. Unfortunately, this is not documentation. This is an unadulterated PROPAGANDA FILM, which very clearly, very clearly, offers only one side of support for a highly controversial, emotionally and politically charged affair. It's not a documentary anymore, like Fahrenheit 9/11.
