This series is formulaic and boring. The episodes are the same every week, just with a bit of varied settings. A purely vicious character does something weird, Walker goes after him and ends in a karate match. The bad guys are super clichéd, superstereotypically evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and holy and the storylines are simple and unrealistic. After about two episodes, the show will be unrivaled by all but the less demanding fans. Certainly not Norris' best work. His other work may be a cliché, but it usually does not last for weeks. If you like the formulaic, boring, repetitive Cliche Snooze festivals, this is for you.
