I saw this movie on TV yesterday. I had just read the book in which the film was supposed to have been. The preface read: "This is a free adaptation of the novel by Eça de Queirós". I should have turned off my TV at that moment. Vera Sacramento's idea of ​​"free adaptation" revolves around a story about the church's influence on people and the hypocrisy of people who demand morality in the late 19th century in a story about sex. In fact, the only thing she inherited from the novel was the genital area, which was only mildly mentioned in Eça de Queirós's novel. And of course the name of some figures. <br /> <br /> In the novel, Amélia and João Eduardo were victims of church influence. Amélia was seduced by Father Amaro and controlled by him all the time. João Eduardo, her fiancé, was thrilled by the priests for daring to criticize her. In this film Amélia seduces everyone she meets, and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons. Vera Sacramento has made a novel that criticized the moral costumes of one epoch and turned it into another movie with much (bad) sex. Even worse, their story was completely devoid of ideas. Two wasted hours! Eça de Queirós certainly did not deserve that.
