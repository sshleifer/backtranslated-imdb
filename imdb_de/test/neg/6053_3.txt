I did not hear anything about this project until I saw it going, so I looked at it completely openly. The cast is full of strong players. Unfortunately. , , it is terrible. I do not mean that it is not good. I mean, it's exceptionally bad - sometimes ridiculous, but mostly it's just boring. Its strongest appeal comes from attractive people as naked as US TV television permits, but it's all curious and devoid of substance, and nymphs as substitute characters can not justify bad television for several hours. <br /> <br /> There are two basic issues that the cast can not overcome. First, the script * is awful *. Yes, making changes to the myth of Hercules (which is certainly not a monolithic story) is traditional, but this version is relentlessly boring and far too often stupid (and sometimes downright head-shaking) at a terrible pace. Borrowed pieces here and there (and some parts that seem to be in different films), and really dreadful dialogues. The dialogue is often so unbearable that you feel embarrassed about the actors. Sean Astin, apparently now typed as a second banana, seems to be particularly burdened by one horrible line after another. There is no consistency of tone and atmosphere and little cohesion in the plot. <br /> <br /> Secondly, most special effects are really bad. Really bad. Occasionally there is a decent amount of CGI, but most of the time you feel really embarrassed about the cast. I have no idea what the budget was for this project, but it definitely looks like a crap compared to "Clash of the Titans" or even "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" and is not like the old Lou Ferrigno and the Italian very cheap to compare "spaghetti" Hercules films. Only painfully miserable. <br /> <br /> There are many other issues - the story is unnecessarily complex and can not keep up with itself, and Hercules itself is not presented as a very interesting character. Almost anyone who does not have a European accent tries to fake a kind of fake that is not only amateur and outdated, but actually makes no sense at all: drama does not get better just because the actors use British accents all. But the horrible script and the equally awesome effects let it all go again. <br /> <br /> In fairness, "Hercules" was apparently intended as a four-hour mini-series, but was cut off (for this broadcast anyway) a three-hour television movie. I do not know what they're cutting, but it's possible that the changes made things worse. I do not think you can do "Hercules" well by adding anything, but that does not mean that continuity, such as B., has not suffered from the network changes. In no case I will look at the USA version.
