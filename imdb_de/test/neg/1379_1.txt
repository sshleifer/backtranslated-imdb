Carlos Mencia is not funny. Carlos Mencia is not funny from his stand-up specials to this train wreck on a television series. I've been trying for two years to convince people that he steals the jokes of other comedians, and as for his comedy material, he's a regular "Johnny-come-weeks" with far below-average scores. Psycho Astronaut Jokes Britney Spears Collapse Jokes? I hope that's just a planning mistake, but at Carlos and Comedy Central, these topics and many others have touched upon the range of late-night television show presenters, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV, and many others. Unusual ethnic and racial stereotypes? Comedy has no chance to develop with Carlos Mencia. Perhaps the people, especially the onlookers and Comedy Central executives, will understand the point since the New York magazine's magazine named it this week: "Carlos Mencia, unrepentant joke filcher."
