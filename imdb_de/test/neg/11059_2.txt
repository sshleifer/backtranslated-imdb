Audio: <br /> <br /> Seriously I've never seen a movie with a worse sound. There are scenes in which people walk through the grass and you can hardly hear them over their steps. They have to fight with their feet. <br /> <br /> You know how to forget a line in some movies, so you have to drown it on the back of a person's head. Here the editors were not so smart. There is indeed a scene where the character of Shannon Tweed says her line without moving her lips! I'm pretty sure that they played live loops during the shoot during the shoot, because in many scenes the sound effects are either different or missing when the camera changes the angle. <br /> <br /> I could write much more about how bad the audio is in this movie. <br /> <br /> Other Nuggets: <br /> <br /> In this movie, they probably regard the opening balance as special effects because they were so difficult to produce. The main title and the first names in the opening credits are in white text over a white sky and they wobble as if they had been carefully painted by hand on each frame. <br /> <br /> The reuse of extras in this movie is incredible. There are about 15 rebels in the occupation, yet thirty or more of them are killed in each battle. If only the film had been of high quality to distinguish who died over and over again. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that the rebels are usually killed by explosions that are always between 30 and 200 feet away. There is a scene, a scene where some rebels run out of their huts in the base of the rebels, and a hut trembles as the rebel leaves the door. One wonders if the hut will last long enough to experience the inevitable explosion. There's a blue helicopter that looks as threatening as a pair of running shorts, but somehow it's equipped with an infinite supply of rockets. If they show how the rockets are shot from the missile shafts of the helicopter, the very often in unpredictable direction very large bottle rockets resemble. They still manage to hit their targets with ease, which, as mentioned above, is always a very safe distance from the rebels who kill them. Note the pilot's recycled material by pressing the LIVE button to fire the rockets (since they were printed vertically, we first read them as the "Evil" button). <br /> <br /> Note how the grenade launcher you use generates identical explosions as the helicopter missiles. In many scenes, it's also fun to see the actor shoot in the foreground in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers he kills. Frequently, characters shoot a disproportionate number of bullets at the soldiers being killed (for example, when a short burst of fire kills a large group of enemies). <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is very, very, very bad. The plot was almost as well thought out as a 5-year-old football game, and the editing is the worst I've ever seen. But to be honest, sometimes it's fun to laugh for 90 minutes at a group of adults who sincerely participated in such a terrible movie.
