It's exactly what the title says ... an island inhabited by fishermen. The shipwrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and the crew land on the island. Either they are picked up by fishermen or worked for the treasure hunter Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he has found the lost city of Atlantis, has been holding the vile scholar Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage for 15 years so that the fishermen can discover a treasure trove under the sea. Cotten is of course a complete madman. Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry. This madness was led by Sergio Martino and is surprisingly not without merit. It's fast, fairly well played and the fishmen look pretty convincing (though it's unlikely anyone could prove that these things DO NOT look like real fishmen). There is an excellent music score by Luciano Michelini.
