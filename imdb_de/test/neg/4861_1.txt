I would like to set 0.5, but unfortunately I can not. Who can write such bad scripts (I saw the movie for five seconds and knew that the "bad boy" would be Sutherland - he had to pay his taxes to see how good he was in Redford's film, "Ordinary People" and others! -) <br /> <br /> Although I do not like it, but I had no choice, I saw the movie in French, but I know that listening to the real voices of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton does not change anything would. Apart from the fact that it may be pathetic. <br /> <br /> What makes me sick is that people make their living doing that bad stuff (forgetting to talk about Mr. Waterson, far away from Woody Allen's films, the he once played in). <br /> <br /> We had another film in another French channel: a stupid James Bond with Brosnan (I'm not talking about the real bonds with Connery (please, the end of the holiday, wake up!).
