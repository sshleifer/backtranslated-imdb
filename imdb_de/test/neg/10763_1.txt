I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time. The special effects do not deserve primary school production. A toy boat that represents a freighter travels at the speed of a speedboat in shallow waters, while the wind-driven mist blows in the opposite direction. The red and blue floodlights make for a particularly dramatic touch. Whatever cache Vincent Price should deliver is overshadowed by terrible production. Calling this a documentary is like calling Britney Spears a musician. After about 20 minutes something was very funny to me. Perhaps it was Price too dramatic intonation of the often-used line "She disappeared in the Devil's Triangle! [Black]; Next Story] When I started to laugh, my friends joined back shouting," Good! "After that, it was almost as much laughed like in a Marx Brothers movie, nobody stayed for the terribly serious second film "Chariots of the Gods".
