Unfortunately, I think this is one of those movies that, when you or I put it in the studio, said, "Can I make this great movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?" The studio would have kicked you to death immediately. However, when a bunch of massive Hollywood names say, "Look, I'd like to take a trip to Italy with my buddies, how about that?" The studio writes a check. <br /> <br /> We start with the casino boss of Ocean's 11, who tracks down the robbers who ran away with his cash, and then Brad Pitt slows down Catherine Zeta Jones, and then there are monkeys over in Amsterdam and Italy and so and so and then everything ends somehow. <br /> <br /> The film, however, includes the most shameful moment of both the career of Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis, which is a movie gem. I nearly vomited in my lap and pulled my eyes out when Julia Roberts, who plays in the movie Tess pretends to be Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis wonders clearly when he can go and how much the check will be. <br /> <br /> Well, to be fair, I would have done it for the money, so I think I can 'I really criticize the poor ones, but I'm a bum without a Hollywood legend. I think what really annoys me about this movie is not that it's boring and pointless and has a terrible story, but I think the actors probably all had a lot of fun doing it. I think the whole job of the actor is to project emotions outward ... I feel like I paid for the party but had to stand outside in the rain. Booo! <br /> <br /> Watch if you like Como or CZJ or something else, but go for a walk.
