Great piece of fiction played as if in fact. Tonight I looked at the birdman from Alcatraz. Robert Stoud was not a model, meek prisoner, and he was in jail for pimping and not paying a client. When he was imprisoned, he was so uncontrollable that he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in the prison hospital. Also killed a few people in jail. This movie reminds me of the Alcatraz Birdman, but worse. Robert Stroud wrote books and somehow contributed to society. And the BOA had some hints of Stroud's madness. BUT this guy, Henry Young, who's the first to kill himself, was probably a well-known bank robber who took hostages and beat them up in more than one robbery. He was not a poor guy who stumbled into a grocery store that happened to be a post office and took some money. This man was a tough core criminal. Three years before he went to Alcatraz, he killed a person. He killed another person in prison, not because of the solitary confinement that ended one year before the murder. The true story of his life would have been more interesting. They did not even get the guardian's certificate right. You can not be a guard at the same time in three different prisons. And it looks like the warden in the movie was a pretty upright man while the guards go. If my mathematics are correct, it is assumed that the guard played by Karl Malden in the BOA is the same guard in this film. Oh boy. Not only that, in this movie we should think that poor Henry committed suicide. And he wrote the word victory. Right, he could be alive right now. He was sent to Springfield, where Robert Stroud was also a prison for medical facilities, then Walla Walla for another murder he had committed. He was released in 1972 and released in 1972 to never be found. Maybe he's hanging out with the guy CB Cooper, who jumped out of the plane in Washington state after he made a bank robbery. Now the play was very good. Kevin Bacon belongs to this class of actors, including Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, the highly undervalued actor's club. Gary Oldman, they could only make the overseer so he could play him because he was great. Christian Slater still somehow sounds like Jack Nicholson, I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. Bacon's wife Kyra Sedgwick was in the movie, I think, just because she's his wife. I like her, but not in this strip. For some reason, I felt that when this film came out, it was a special project for Kevin Bacon. I feel he could take a person who is really a victim of the penal system, there are enough of them and spread some light on their plight. Others then selected a psychopath to be shown as a victim.
