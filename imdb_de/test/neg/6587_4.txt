I recently borrowed from a friend on DVD. I did not really know what to expect. I have not seen many Russian films and I do not think I've ever seen a Russian war movie. Maybe that would have expected something different, something more in the direction of an imaginary Russian mentality. Whatever those expectations were, they became ashamed, as this is a standard war movie. <br /> <br /> The whole formula, some young people from recruiting to training to deployment and some pursuing battles, is well known. We have seen this happen both many years ago and more recently (as with Jarhead). Of course, there is a difference here, because this movie is more about Russian soldiers than Americans, as is almost always the case. But in general this could just as well have been a Vietnam movie. I think that just underscores my feeling that Afghanistan was the Soviet Union Vietnam. A country that was supposed to be a push for a superpower, the war for years continued with terrible losses for both soldiers and civilians. <br /> <br /> The good points in this film were good photography (there are some nice ambient shots) and decent effects for what I think is a rather low budget movie. What has disappointed me is mostly the story. It just does not manage to arouse emotions in me. Mostly because the character development is bad. And to really feel something when people are shot down, you have to make them human, not just faceless cardboard cutouts. They do not do that in this movie. It's also too long and that seems to be a kind of trend lately. In my opinion, a movie that lasts more than two hours has a lot to offer, and this movie does not cut it off. There is also a disturbing music that is laid over each scene like a wet blanket. This is very disturbing especially in the action scenes, not that you need action music, but a little more than just slow keyboard music would be nice. Otherwise, the production values ​​were good enough, there was not the problem. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to watch this movie. As a reminder that the war no matter where you are shit? That Russian filmmakers have already seen too many American war films to create something original? Regardless, this film is rather clichéd, lacking in spirit, and while having acceptable technical qualities, it lacks the development of scripts and characters. In the end, it will be just one of those war movies that will not make you think and add anything to the genre. I have seen much worse, but also much better. I rate that with 4/10.
