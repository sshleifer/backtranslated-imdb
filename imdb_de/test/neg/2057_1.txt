This movie is probably one of the three worst movies in history. I hired it by accident without reading the reviews, and wow, I regret it. Really has no action, does not really follow the vampire genre. Just terrible god. Watching this movie will affect your enthusiasm for vampire movies. I felt that the writer / director / producer was taking this drug addiction, hallucinating and trying to replicate it in the movie. All the time I wanted the movie to end ... but the end was even more crazy. <br /> <br /> If this review can save only one person from seeing this crap, I feel that my time to register and write this review has paid off.
