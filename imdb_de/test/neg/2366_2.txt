A good old boy movie is almost necessary to have moonshine, chases, an action vaguely resembling "Plot" and at least a very pretty country, barefoot with short shorts and a low top. The pretty girl is here (dressed in designer jeans) - but the redneck requirements stop there. Jimmy Dean is a natural spokesman for the sausage, but as the tough guy of the former sheriff, he gets too short. Big John is big, but he can not convince with the "bad" part of his moniker. Bug Eled Jack Elam is screaming as always and Bo Hopkins has been playing the same role for decades. Ned Beatty also plays a small role ... but there is no STORY. It smells like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night rather than a feature film. Cornball Cornpone with easy predictable feel. Perhaps the most obvious problem with this movie is that Charlie Daniels sings the theme. You know the one; it was made famous by ... Jimmy Dean.
