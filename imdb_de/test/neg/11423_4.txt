First, I have to say that I liked the first Underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious about vampires and lycans and so on. In this last part (hopefully) of the series I'm just sorry how pathetic the vampires are. At least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes ... now vampires seem to be besieged victims of a bad pest control problem. They look and act like proud white pasty people. <br /> <br /> Some ideas were neat ... the whole thing with human noblemen was interesting. Too bad, the spectacle was miserable. The slave thing was also feasible. <br /> <br /> Other things just strike me as pathetic. Spoiler now. Castle walls that can be skipped in a few steps? Enemies that do not attack during the day? Big bad old vampires who take a long time to join the fight and run away from a young Lycan leader after a minute or so? Werewolves approaching their enemies? Lycans, the armor invaded ... for what? They do not use axes and swords or armor! A vampire leader who is so inappropriate that he has almost everyone against him? The romance is so unconvincing that she is sad. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only if you check it online or buy a very cheap cinema ticket. Some of the measures are OK too. Certainly the armor and weapons of the vampires are interesting. Otherwise, a very weak script that was poorly composed and uses all sorts of nonsensical plot twists.
