The original body and soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann Revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee ... and filmed by one of the greatest filmmakers ever seen on screen ... James Wong Howe. This remake is abominable. Despite the presence of Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Beals, there is nothing valuable here and it is a pity that this product has the same title as the brilliant original. Only the name of the main character, Charlie Davis, is the same in both films. I do not think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake. I am amazed that Rod Steiger has participated. This could be the only bad movie he ever shot. Maybe he needed the paycheck.
