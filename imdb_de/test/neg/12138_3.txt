UP IN THE VILLA (2000) ** 1/2 <br /> WARNING: YOU MAY ALSO FIND MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It's hard to know what matters to UP AT THE VILLA a beautiful but flat piece of time, one with the sole purpose of receiving Oscar nominations for Best Costume Design and Artistic Directorate (one for Cinematography and the other for the score are welcome). It has the same basic idea of ​​thousands of historical pieces produced each year: a good-looking, intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place. She has many difficulties, but in the end she finds happiness in the arms of a man with whom she has achieved nothing. In this case, our lady is in Florence some time before the Second World War. She is an English widow in love with a rich but old man (whom she obviously does not love). One day she meets another man who does not have a good reputation she falls in love with. Of course there is her friend who will help her for better or for worse, and a third man who commits suicide in the lady's room and sets up a risky situation for her. Guess how the story ends up ... <br /> <br /> UP AT THE VILLA is not a bad movie. I've always been interested in the story, but never got excited. The problem is not the slow pace, but the script. Adapted to a novel, it needs something spicier, exciting, twists and tension. Every time you think the story is getting warm, it's getting cooler again. If you think there is a plot that concerns the common chief of police in Florence, it is so, but it changes almost nothing in the story. Until the foreseeable end it just goes on. <br /> <br /> As I said, UP AT THE VILLA is not bad. When it's a bit bland, it never gets juicy and sentimental. The acting is half and half, but certainly convinced. Kristin Scott Thomas made some really bad choices after THE ENGLISH PATIENT (the romantic drama THE HORSE WHISPERER and the boring / irritating RANDOM HEARTS). UP AT THE VILLA is undoubtedly better than these pieces and Kristin is better as well, but she can do more. Sean Penn is good as always, even if his character is a big guy. Anne Bancroft is a great actress (THE GRADUATE, my God!), And here she does not let her character get ridiculous. Now the supporting actors are pretty bad (Jeremy Davies is sooooooooo annoying!). <br /> <br /> The director is good, but not daring. It was interesting to know that the director is the same as ANGELS AND INSECTS (also with Kristin Scott Thomas), another drama from the time, but more daring than this. What counts here are the visuals. Florence is wonderful, the costumes are great, the scenery, the music ... <br /> <br /> In the end, UP AT THE VILLA is an average romantic drama, but of course it could have been a lot better. It's worth seeing and interesting, but do not expect an exciting movie - that's not it! This film fails because he wants to have a puzzle, something to watch ... However, there is not much to say, mainly because of the flat screenplay. Well, as far as the Oscar nominations go, do not worry - it's probably going to get them.
