"Three" is a seriously stupid shipwreck. Masked as a psychological thriller, his closest relative is the monumentally superior "Dead Calm" (also Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" provided well-drawn characters to mourn the parents of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman, who wanted to redefine their relationship on a cruise. In the end, they are terrorized by Zane's crowded psycho killer. It created a sharp, increasingly locked tension, a frightening sense of claustrophobia on the open sea as the cat and mouse game unfolded from life to death. <br /> <br /> "Three" suffers from poorly drawn characterization (the audience does not care what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plotter, a complete lack of suspense or excitement and a few dull ones , hammere performances of the main actors. In particular, Zane is irritating to the top. In "Dead Calm" he was threatening, wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence. Here he is bombastic, light-headed slimy and riddled. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? And how is it that his lighter is filled with juice for over a year? Mrs. Brook is very picturesque, stunningly pretty, but both the chest and back have been bloated wildly by a sort of rescue pump. However, they manage to act with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. Dramatic actress, in the truest sense of the word, she is not. The guy who plays the voodoo-hijacked Manuel, the third part of this sad triangle, could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood - nobody would notice. In fact, due to its utter lack of ability to deliver dialogues in any meaningful or dynamic manner, Driftwood represents a potential improvement in the use of cents (excuse play). <br /> <br /> Plus Pages: The scenery is beautiful and The cinematography (above and below the water) is credible. <br /> <br /> I guess this had a very limited (if any) theatrical version or went directly to the rental and sales DVD. The reason is that it is not very good. If you want something decent in this direction, you will get "Dead Calm". It was made by people who knew a bit about the cinema.
