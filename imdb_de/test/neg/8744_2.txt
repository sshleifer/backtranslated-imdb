This follows the endless series of crazy, predictable 1950s science fiction things. As usual, it's pretty bad. There is not much plot that I could see, and the excessive exaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laugh. The title is also misleading. If you intercept this on MST3K, it's probably the only way to see it, and it's better to leave it that way.
