I'm a big fan of British films in general, but especially of gangster movies. Unfortunately, this film was terribly bad. I find it quite depressing that this movie gets good customer reviews. The idea that this movie is tough and realistic is ridiculous. I have read and heard Faust's hand about the real events in this film, and almost all of them have been glorified from above. The only real event in the entire movie was the Range Rover killers. Some pompous bouncers were exterminated because they had played around with people they could not handle. This movie is a shame for British cinema! It has no action and no decent acting and is only dependent on violence (crude and realistic, as some people like to phrase it). The kind of people who made this movie should not be near a budget or movie camera, just like the people in this movie are not getting the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent little story without consequence.
