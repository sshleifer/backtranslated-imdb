This is a really bad movie. However, it is good to laugh at the terrible ideas and "special" effects. At the heart of the plot is an EU space organization that discovers a tenth planet that is directly opposite Earth. They send a manned mission (they were on Mars and have not yet discovered this planet, is anyone stupid enough to fall in love with it?) And believe it, it's the mirror image of the planet they came from. From that point on, almost everything is predictable. Honestly, you can guess almost anything from the title of the movie. The only surprising thing here is a Maned Space program run by Europeans. :) For the plot concept or the execution there can be no excuse. So it's good for a laugh, or maybe when you're in an altered state of consciousness.
