I rummaged through the movies on demand and saw Underdog for free and it only took 82 minutes, so I decided to check it out. I did not expect much, but it exceeded my expectations of being awful. Everything about the movie was damn worthy. The dialogue was cruel, including many terrible puns. The jokes were terrible too. I found myself shouting and flipping out my TV while suffering from this garbage. It hit the target audience very well, but I do not see how others enjoy this movie. It made me very angry and almost cried because everything terrible was going on in this movie. <br /> <br /> The only pleasing thing about this movie was that I was able to give it a 1/10 after seeing it. I ask you to avoid it at all costs. I understand the fact that it is made for children, but it is not sympathetic at all.
