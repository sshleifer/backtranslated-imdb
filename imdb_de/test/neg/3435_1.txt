Ten years ago I really wanted to see this movie in the cinema. But I missed it and then forgot it. Oh boy, I am glad that this film did not ruin my youthful eyes at the time. <br /> <br /> I saw it yesterday, and seriously, this must be one of the 10 worst movies ever made. And I'm talking about movies that have attracted too much attention, like those wonderful trailers on TV, and too much money being spent on actors and the film's production is even worse, do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> Please, Hollywood, NO ARNOLD!
