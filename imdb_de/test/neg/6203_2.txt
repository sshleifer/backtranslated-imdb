David Dhawan copied HITCH and such an unofficial copy. The movie is not even 1/2 as funny or amusing as the original. It's boring with forced stories like the Lara track that he has a child and no husband David also tries to stifle the drama, but the film looks disconnected, boring. <br /> <br /> Songs just come in, romance and everything without a few funny Govinda scenes, the dance before the break is nothing else to mention. The last few scenes are pretty funny, but they tend to get too long. <br /> <br /> David's direction is as bad as MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA. He has to change his style or try something good. Music saves grace, some songs are good, but the situations seem to be forced <br /> <br /> Govinda is overweight and too loud and screams his lines on the first rolls, but he gets into the groove and does his best in the office and the scene with Salman in his cabin and towards the end <br /> <br /> Salman only plays himself and his nasal tone In addition, his fake acting style is a headache. <br /> <br /> Lara is avoidable, Katrina is as usual fake. <br /> <br /> The child is exaggerating
