What was the goal here ... I started to look at it, but then I realized that it had no purpose ... bad drama ... no action and no story ... I listened to it while I was surfed the Web reading about David Beckham's US Galaxy deal over $ 250 million. Do not rent this Do not let this borrow ... I have seen so many films that I felt that this would be crap right from the start. <br /> <br /> War movies should be accurate and, if possible, have an artistic merit and not feel like a Christian melodrama ... This film fades in comparison to the ones I've seen before. I have to say that I am really disappointed with this movie.
