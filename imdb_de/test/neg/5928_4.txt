Sometimes I think that somewhere in the office complex of the "Lifetime" channel is a room in which the writer is staying, with a big wheel on the wall - like the Big Six in casinos. The latter have many spots where you can even win money and less for larger amounts, until there is perhaps a couple paying bigger sums. <br /> <br /> But I imagine the wheel of the channel, which has about six different genres His wheel, of which two appear most frequently, referred to as "The psychotic neighbor" or "The spouse with a hidden past or a secret or both ". There are some repetitive storylines in "Lifetime" movies, and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous. <br /> <br /> The spouse ... category may be a long-time spouse, but a person appears or when an event occurs that reveals that the good woman was once a hooker, one the couples were involved in a nefarious act long ago or something else in a different environment than suspected - etc., etc., or, as in this film, one of them entered the marriage with the most disgraceful goals. A constant in all their genres is that the husband or other men are usually ignorant, empty. and slowly knowing what the hell is going on, to the climax, or at best very late in the process (unless the man is the rogue). Not the case here. <br /> <br /> Whether the referrer is the "neighbor" or the "wife," it's always fascinating how easy, successful, and effortless they are with their deceitful minds others, beat them as needed, take different poses, and juggle more deceptions than you can count - with infallible success until just before the end. <br /> <br /> The main actor here, like many others The films of this channel are an old hand. I noticed that another movie in which he starred bore the title "The Perfect Neighbor". <br /> <br /> The vindictive "perfect woman" in this film transmits those on their way with more skill and ease than the most experienced and competent "man" in Don Corleone's family could muster. And I could not help but imagine that Jack Nocholson's Melvin Udall's "As Good As It Get" with his massive OCD woes could give advice to the anti-heroine to help deal with the obsession that the The basis for this was Opus.
