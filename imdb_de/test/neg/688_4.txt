After his role in the Fine Caper SEVEN THIEVES (1960) - which I saw a few years ago - Edward G. Robinson appeared to be playing older criminal mastermind types (apart from the somewhat juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID [1965]) , I've seen the pretty good "Euro-Cult" effort GRAND SLAM (1967) before, and apart from that, I've got two other similar tracks from Italy to check out - one of which was headed by future Goro champion Lucio Fulci! In any case, this is the kind of international production - with American and Italian actors and a British director - that was prevalent in the 1960s; it is in itself harmless and uncomplicated, but hardly memorable and definitely overlong - especially for the financing of the heavy equipment needed for the raid (eg an army tank and a plane!), the gang involved must be a variety pull of minor thefts first. <br /> <br /> The gang is of course an incompetent post led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his buff-friendly friend (Raquel Welch) - the others are a "pacifist" black, a constantly hungry Italian and a little Englishman. They try to convince an ex-gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to hand over his fortune unless he is destitute ... but under the patronage of "Professor" Robinson, he beats instead an encapsulation of $ 5 million Platinum in front! It is needless to say that the gang members do not dare (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica to get the name of their fence in Morocco, where they should retreat after the raid), or to destroy the order (commissioned ) To uphold a restaurant, the Italian can not resist sitting around the table and ordering a multi-course meal! Amusingly, in the face of similar failures, De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it - although she allegedly holds up a gas station, it turns out that the owner is a nephew of his and only asks to borrow some money! <br /> <br /> The central raiding sequence is usually complicated: while the gang, including Welch, takes the train that transports the platinum, Wagner abducts the pilot Victor Spinetti and his plane. When the job is done, he intends to cross De Sica twice - but neither his partners nor Welch himself are willing to obey, so he has to give in. From the time when the crime was not paid, the gang tries to lose their entire supply in the air when the bomb bay doors of the plane are accidentally opened.
