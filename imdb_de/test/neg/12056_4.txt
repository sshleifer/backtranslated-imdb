Yeah sure, this is a Friday the 13th rip off, but I have no problem with that. It's a good effort, the murders are not so bloody, but the acting of a girl carries the movie, what a cry queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low-budget movie, the effects are well done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it's done. Some people have problems with the camera, I can not see what's wrong with that. It's so strange that so many people do not like this movie, I really enjoyed it. Of course the script is not original, but I admit that so many slashers are made in the forest. Maybe everything is predictable, but it's worth it, I've seen much worse, I can tell you that
