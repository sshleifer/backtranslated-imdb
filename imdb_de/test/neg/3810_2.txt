I do not understand what the big hype about this movie was. All the horror sites said that this movie had all the essentials of an "old American Slasher" stick that would satisfy your needs. - Although this resembled an old American Slasher movie, my needs were still not met. <br /> <br /> My big problem with this movie is that we are now in the 2000s, not in the 80s. The horror of the 1980s is past and should remain in the past. Horror films have changed so much that older films are now cheesy and unrealistic. Although it's fun to look at, they do not offer the same realistic bloodthirsty blood that the latest movies offer. <br /> <br /> Hatchet is cheesy, unrealistic and terrible. If we wanted to see an old American Slasher movie, I can just go back to Friday's series, the Nightmare on Elm Street series or the Halloween series. I have to admit, the movie is better than some of the horror movies that are released, but it's one of the worst. The jokes are not funny and the actors are terrible. <br /> <br /> I would personally stay away from this movie and never look back.
