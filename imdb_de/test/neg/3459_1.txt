I also made the mistake of thinking that I would see the 2003 Upstream with Geoffrey Rush. That was worse than many student films I've seen. The script was forced, the acting was inferior and the editing annoying. It was so slow that I just managed to stay. But I always give a movie a chance, so I suffered to the end. There seemed to be a memo about this movie because my friend and I were the only ones in the theater. Why did not someone send me this memo?!?! That's why I'm posting a warning to others who think they're throwing out good money to see this. I just hope that you actually came to this site and not like me when I saw the wrong "swimming". P.S. Excuse the actors and crew for reading this. I know you worked hard on it. I know what makes a movie ... keep trying!
