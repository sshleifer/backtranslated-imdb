Despite an absolutely gruesome script (more on that later), the film is still highly visible just because he plays with the two outstanding actors Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. With the exception of one or two REAL stinkers, I would probably see almost everything in the movie as I am a big fan of Hollywood's golden age of the 1930's and 40's. No matter how much I love her movies, I just can not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation in a ski resort. The two have not met yet, but the movie begins loud and disgusting with a scene in which Fonda yodels terribly while skiing. It was made so inconspicuous and my teeth crunched, but I stretched it out - especially when Fonda fell into a snow bank and the yodeling stopped !! In retrospect, I should have just shut it off! Fonda falls out in the fall and Barbara goes for help. Back at the ski lodge, he seems to be okay, but fortunately she is also a doctor and has him x-rayed and nurses him well. He in turn is in love with her and suggests her. Although they hardly know each other, they marry and the film seems to be a sweet but very light romantic comedy. Once she gets home, not everything is rosy when she jumps back into her job a family doctor and he shows signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man because of his jealousy. The movie makes everyone laugh, but frankly, Fonda's behavior was really scary - spying on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening every man she treated, tripping a female patient who already has a back injury, and attending a surprise party that all (men and women) are out to steal his wife. He comes as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenics, but it should be all laugh. Considering that he seems like a dangerous nut, you would think that Stanwyck would apply for a repeal along with a restraining order! But strangely, she gets angry, but just can not get angry with Fonda, because he is like that ........? I can not imagine the right word - "scary" is everything that comes to my mind !!! Later, Fonda gets out of the blue a multimillionaire at a counter in a department store. Then he and Babs, through magical thinking, seem to assume that his hostility and violent jealousy are a thing of the past - a job obviously heals anger and mistrust. When this job fails, the movie ends with Fonda buying his own hospital, giving Barbara a job and living happily ever after. They do not go on with the story, but I assume that he spent most of his time as a hospital administrator, according to Fonda's character, to beat all male patients. <br /> <br /> The first portion at the ski lodge and the next did NOT go well together, and the last section "Horatio Alger", in which the rich boy did well in the business world, was not good. They were like three different actions, but the most serious problem of the movie was that it seemed to excuse domestic violence and insane jealousy! What a scary little movie! Fortunately, neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this Yechy movie, but for all the other beautiful movies.
