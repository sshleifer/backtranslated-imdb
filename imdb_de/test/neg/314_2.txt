Jack-O (1995) was a really bad movie, we are talking about Snoozefest x 100, no entertainment value, no budget, no Gore, Z-grade actor etc. This movie was a terrible asset to the horror movie industry and should not be made !!! The only reason I bought this movie was because I knew Linnea Quigley was in it, and she's really doing her obligatory nude shower scene, which is nice. <br /> <br /> But as far as the movie itself is concerned ... ...... I fell asleep in the 40-minute phase and did not feel like quitting at all, it's just dodgy lame OK. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, I'm an avid fan, I'm a big fan of MASSIVE, I love low-horror horror, I love everything, but I hated this trash. I think that will tell you everything you need to know about "Jack-O". I give In this movie 2/10 is the "2" intended for the 2-minute Linnea shower scene, the film itself is a total of ZERO !!!!
