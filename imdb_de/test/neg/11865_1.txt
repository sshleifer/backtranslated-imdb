It seems that all companies that enjoy the taxes that Romania has taken for the picture are enjoying the image that has disappeared since 1994. They barely try to get the oldest car they founded, but they never take pictures of the Lamorghini, Ferrari and Aston Martin and all the new Mercedes that are more likely to be found in some key countries. <br /> <br /> A second problem is that they filmed in some parts of Bucharest where they had the opportunity to clear the streets and put rubbish in the street to put on people I do not know, maybe '90s clothes that make them look stupid enough to make you realize that the script may have been a second hand copy you bought on ebay, or worth a while to make movies in the US and make good money there to give something and to shame our country. I have no reason to believe that anyone will understand the message (beyond my English ---: sorry)
