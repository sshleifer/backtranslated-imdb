*** This comment may contain spoilers. *** Warning: This includes spoilers. I've seen some pretty lame movies in my time. And that's understandable, since I see about 80 films a year. I have to say that out of the 80 movies that I see in the theater, maybe 5 are really good, 15 or 20 are not that great, 40 or 50 are fine and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible. Here On Earth falls into a category of its own. This is one of the most predictable, vehement and despicable films I've ever seen. It is full of unusual characters, maudlin situations about post-school topics and enough fluff to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like an American beauty. And I'm not unfair. This is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a rich man, a poor girl, a poor man and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all city dwellers. Are you already warm and out of focus? Let me continue. One day, the rich snot comes to town with his new graduation gift, which his father bought for him, and he insults the pretty girl in the diner, almost gets into a fight with her longtime friend, rages him and rages him and destroys that Small diner she works on. So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and his friend have to fix dinner together. What this means gives us ample opportunity to see Chris Klein shirtless so we can understand why the girl in the diner falls in love with him. He has abs !!! Oh and he is rich !!! And .... he's the biggest idiot with no respect for anyone. He is James Dean, he is a rebel who does not condemn !! He is rude to anyone in the city, he does not want to connect with someone who wants to be nice to him, and he looks like a spoiled, rich guy. But Leelee Sobieski still falls in love with him. There is no reason why she does that, she just does it. Oh, excuse me, I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet as she does. If that does not make you wet, I do not know what it's going to be. <br /> <br /> Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever come across in the movie. There was a point when I left the theater to get popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom, and I told my fianc√© exactly what would happen in the next ten minutes. On my return, she just laughed and said I was right, even though I said that there would be a dance scene. The illness she suddenly suffers from is cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen. Have you ever seen a cancer patient die slowly? They lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums start to rot. It is not a nice picture. Sobieski lights up after getting cancer as if she were pregnant. What an insult to people who have seen lovers die slowly from this disease. And how do you get knee cancer when I fall in the field? <br /> <br /> Now I realize that I have seen too many movies, and this causes my cynicism to get out of hand sometimes, but that's ridiculous. There was nothing to like about this film and the character of Chris Klein. He is an idiot, he is abominable and he never tries to make peace with anyone around him. Here on earth is not only a bad movie, but also an irresponsible movie. This was rated at 4.2 in the IMDb voting, which is far too high. This is an embarrassment to writing on-screen, and whoever gave the green light to this happening should not only lose his job, but should also promise never to be near a script again. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, and that's generous. This film should be shown at film schools how not to write and direct a movie. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and really need something to do and your choices clean a cow dung farm or watch this movie, choose the cow dung cleaning. It will smell better and you feel that you have done something good with your two hours.
