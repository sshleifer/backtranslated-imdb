Early Jackie Chan movie with no signs of the known Chan person. This is Chan in a traditional revenge story cloned and reclaimed by countless producers and studios across Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. It's a very serious story that does not show the humor and warmth that would make Jackie Chan a superstar. It is also clear from watching that he would not have reinvented himself if we had never known him because his career was painfully short. As a film for yourself, this is a good-looking, but pretty unremarkable movie. I saw it in the middle of a full-day marathon of martial arts films, and it would have come together with every other movie I saw that day, if I had not noticed Jackie in the movie. Honestly, I do not think the movie is really worth dealing with (there are too many other better variations), unless you're interested in where Jackie Chan started.
