A killer (John Karlen) with a fondness for really bad disguises (Afro wig on a white guy?) Crosses his van looking for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the case and finds the killer pretty easy by just hanging around the local pool and looking for anyone who looks funny (again the Afro wig comes into play). DeCarlo follows the murderer home and decides to introduce a risky sting with a policewoman. <br /> <br /> Inspired by the crimes of Ted Bundy before he was caught, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a fairly predictable and cheap series. Killer film director Jeremy Hoenack has no idea how to make a movie work or even make it exciting. He knows, however, how he shows many close-ups of the murderer who wrestles his hands! The only thing that really promises is the captured '70s atmosphere (watch out for the wallpaper in the bathroom). Well, that and a downbeat ending. The Media Blasters / Shriek Show DVD features a lot of nice stuff, including an audio commentary by Hoenack and Karlen, as well as video interviews, trailers and an alternate opening.
