Each student could make a movie 1,000 times better than rubbish. As someone who had read the book, I had expected that even a direct retelling would make the book a fair film. There was a chance a talented director could go beyond Woodward's story and make a great movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the director went beyond Woodward's story. He added a hip Hispanic angel named Velasquez, who was not in the book. He had got Bob Woodward to swap the dead Belushi in the morgue. The film had all the insight that someone was stoned on PCP and was staring at his navel. If this is a spoiler for you, you will thank me for it is absolutely the worst movie ever made.
