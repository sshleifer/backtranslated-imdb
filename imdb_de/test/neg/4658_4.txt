I have to say that I had low expectations of the movie before I saw it. Everyone in the area said it was great, but I knew exactly what they liked. They like Aerosmith's song, which is indeed great, they like the amazing special effects that have gone a lot, they like the comedy side of the movie and of course a lot of girls who love Affleck, which in my opinion is a really bad actor, who did not try to be one, failed and now he is nothing. And all these things, as well as the reviews and reviews I read on the internet, gave me an idea that the movie would be a big disappointment as I'm a big fan of disaster movies. Well, I was right, but at least I was prepared. <br /> <br /> The movie is really commercial. It was said, but I will say it again. We have a budget of over $ 100 million, we have a romance between the Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors that are popular because they rarely agree to become part of a commercial film cast, if it does their names are not written in large letters on the screen. Like Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi, who are highly respected actors that I also like very much. You could play many characters in many different films. They could improvise, they could make funny jokes out of tasteless lines. By and large, they could turn little films into really interesting, funny or dramatic films that people love and will always love. Like Fargo in Buscemi's case or a simple plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I'm really disappointed they took part in Armageddon. Thornton plays a smart and clever man involved in politics, if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the Deep Core Drilling Team that is to save the world by destroying the asteroid that is about to destroy the world. What I did not like - well, I guess I've already been understood. I pointed to bad factors. The story is boring, without purpose and stupid. It's so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that makes it ridiculous. At least films like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that could be considered as art. At least it's not so obvious that the movie is for financial reasons. Apart from that bad performances of all the big stars. The jokes are not funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes they make no sense at all. In fact, I recently read that Ben Affleck Bay asked on stage if it would be easier for them to teach astronauts to drill than drill to become astronauts, and Bay's response was simply "Shut up!" This is a really funny story that shows the desperation of the creators perfectly. <br /> <br /> And in the appendix I will explain why I give the movie 4. Well, I like "Do not Want To Miss" and I was impressed by the special effects that are obviously the only good thing in the movie. The first scene is memorable. These are the only good things I liked about the movie. Michael Bay is an average director, but The Rock and both Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon, which was, is and always will be a big bad movie.
