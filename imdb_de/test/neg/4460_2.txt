British television director Alan Gibson, veteran "Dracula AD, 1972," is considered one of the least appetizing contributions to the Hammer Studios series on Bram Stoker's immortal bloodsucker. In fact, this was the first time since Terence Fischer's memorable "Horror of Dracula" (1958) that Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were fighting each other as deadly enemies. They would repeat the same roles a few years later in the last Hammer Dracula: "The Satanic Rites of Dracula." It was also the penultimate Dracula for Hammer, in which Lee appeared as a notorious Fangster. For the record, "Dracula n. Chr. 1972" was the seventh Hammer Dracula. The exciting prologue of 1872 prepares you for something other than what the rest of this disappointing horror movie brings. The eternal rival Count Dracula and his nemesis professor Lawrence Van Helsing literally face each other on a runaway carriage in Hyde Park in London in a vivacious opening scene that makes everything seem comparatively anticlimactic. The carriage crashes and Dracula appears and hugs half of a wooden wheel with its broken spokes in his chest. Of course, Christopher Lee has to hold this broken wheel to his body, but the imagery beats her way enough to pass the test. The count goes out and his opponent Van Helsing expires. However, one of Dracula's students grabs the earl's ring and scoops some of the vampire's ashes into a vial for safekeeping. The screenplay by Don Houghton rages the action one hundred years to swing London 1972 Meet a smarmy young man, Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame of "No Blade of Grass"), who loves having a group of hippies crashing the parties bring and drive the British police with their antics, to raise hell. Alucard happens to be the descendant of a servant of Dracula. Now Alucard has the count's ring and a vial of his dehydrated blood. Alucard chooses the sight of a desecrated church to hold a black mass. He invites his trendy friends, including Laura (super sexy Carolina Munro of "The Spy Who Loved Me"), Gayner (Marsha Hunt) and Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham) to attend this black mass because she offers something different. Not surprisingly, they revive the count and the evil bloodsucker focuses his eyes on Jessica. In the meantime, after discovering that Laura's body has lost blood, Scotland Yard asks Inspector Murray (Michael Coles of "Doctor Who and the Dalkes") for help with Van Helsing's current offspring Lorrimar (Peter Cushing). Dracula wants to take revenge on Van Helsing by taking his granddaughter as his bride. Lorrimar tracks down Alucard; They fight in his apartment in Chelsea, and the young vampire drowns in a tub of water. Keep in mind that running water is as deadly to vampires as sunlight and crucifix. Van Helsing finds Dracula in the abandoned church. His daughter is expecting the count. Van Helsing and Dracula get involved. Van Helsing throws holy water into Dracula's face. The vampire falls into an open tomb with a stake waiting for him, and he decomposes again. <br /> <br /> The main problem with "Dracula AD 1972" is that we do not get enough of Lee as a count, though we get a lot more from Cushing than Van Helsing. Furthermore, the scenarioist Don Houghton captures Dracula in the ramshackle church and never lets the vampire enter the city. Despite his small budget, "Dracula around 1972" could have been much better. The scene in which the contemporary Van Helsing has to write down Alucard and spell backwards to get Dracula seems almost ridiculous. You'd think he knew about this backward spell trick. If you are not afraid of horror movies, it will make you yawn. Occasionally Gibson presents us with his disfigured fangs and bloody eyes a great close-up of Dracula, but that's about as scary as this cooler, and that does not say much.
