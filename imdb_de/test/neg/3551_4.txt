Not even original in the plot. Ho hum. There were a few angles that could be quite interesting, but the movie follows the path of 90% of Hollywood movies. I do not understand Samuel Jackson most of the time in his other films, but he was pretty good at this movie. He rarely shouted and went much further in his character than to turn into an "angry anger in your face". I liked Eva Mendes - as always - and although she is a feast for the eyes, she proves to be much more of an actress. Actually, Luis Guzman was also really good, except that I did not like changing his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the movie. How can a character revolve around an aversion to a former police officer and then turn himself into a land of the lollipop within fractions of a second? Is not there any original thought in Hollywood?
