Am I the only one who thinks this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> I admit that horror films often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects. But how these shortcomings come together in this movie is surprisingly pathetic. <br /> <br /> Miserable story: The idea of ​​a raped vagina taking revenge by turning into a human eater sounds pretty weird, but what the writer made of it is stupid. <br /> <br /> Bad spectacle: The actors move like puppets. They play and look like people who really try, but completely fail. <br /> <br /> Bad effects: Especially the explosion of the van is incredibly cheap. <br /> <br /> It's surprising A director who has made some beautiful films during his career is changing to such a mess.
