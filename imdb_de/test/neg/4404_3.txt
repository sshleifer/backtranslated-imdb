I was very worried about this film, he was supposed to play at a Jewish film festival and was reportedly very hostile to Israel, using clever humor and irony. <br /> <br /> I was relieved that the film was disappointed, no shame, but as a movie she was deeply disappointing. The movie was full of random events, some of which were eventually connected and most were not. Some of the events were very smart and funny, but others were just random and pointless. <br /> <br /> There are repeated scenes between two lovers sitting silently in a car playing a hand-holding game. In some cultures this may be erotic, but it looks like you're watching the thumb wrestling. It got really tiring after the third time. <br /> <br /> I've always considered David Lynch bizarre by using strange stories and images to make the audience think he's so demanding that they do not understand his work; In fact, there is nothing to understand. The same is true here, the stories do not add up, and there is not much talk about a political issue (in one scene, a frolicsome Israeli soldier humiliates Palestinian drivers at a checkpoint.) That's new?) <br /> <I understand not why this film has been controversial and why it has attracted attention. It's an inferior job and it's a waste of time.
