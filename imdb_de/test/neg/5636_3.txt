I did not know anything about this DVD when I did it. Had a quick look at the comments, but decided to stay open. Obviously an independent movie and a low budget, but that did not bother me. I'll see everything with Derick Jacobi and as usual he played his part well. What a pity, nobody else. I saw "Atonement" with Vanessa Redgrave a few weeks ago, and she was great. In it she seemed only to appear to read the lines. In my opinion, the main mistake in the casting of Vinnie Jones. To be honest, I saw his picture on the DVD cover, but did not notice that he got a top-notch. A sticker was strategically placed over his name! It was good to see and I really liked the Dickens story next to today. Maybe this would have worked better with a more capable actor playing the lead role. It was still weak.
