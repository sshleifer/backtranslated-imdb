This movie is not as good as I thought. There is no story, no characters and dialogues would have been nice. The gore effects are good and sometimes it gets pretty bloody, but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when that's over, the scene starts with the girl. The music is a classical score and goes very well with the movie. You should have created a 90-minute version in which they could have had some time for character development, so we can regret the person on the autopsy table. And a few more information about the dying would have made this movie far more frightening than it is. Do not expect a scary movie, but a beautiful, bloody special effects roll.
