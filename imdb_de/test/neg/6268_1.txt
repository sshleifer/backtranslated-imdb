Do you hear that sound? This is the sound of H. G. Wells moving back and forth in his tomb, between this version and Spielberg's cinematic abortion it was a hard year for the classic novel. But at least Steven had a few things right compared to this Crapperella. Hello, the ships were not big insects, they had names. They were tripods and the aliens worked in threes. The ships and the aliens were all wrong, you can not really see the aliens until the end. The effects and the cast work well. But these actors are much better than this "movie" deserves. The main part, if not the whole movie, is the Howell character, who is astonished by the devastation, meets a person, she joins him and he loses it for one reason or another. There are at no time more than two people in front of the camera, though most of the film. It's like they're filming three at the same time, the movie is going to go over budget or something. So bold is the single and mean only observable adaptation of the history of WAR OF THE WORLDS the GEORGE PAL version from the 1950s. THE BLACK HOLE.
