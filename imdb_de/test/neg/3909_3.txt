If you're one of those people who does not really like sci-fi because of their sometimes far-fetched ideas and surreal worldviews, you should stay away from Stuart Gordon's Space Truckers as much as possible! It really is an absurd space adventure, replete with eccentric characters, colorful kitsch and ridiculous conspiracies. To be honest? I probably would never have been interested in this movie unless Gordon's name had been in the credits. This guy is almost a genius in the horror genre, with undeniable milestones like "From Beyond" and "Re-Animator" in his resume. Obviously, Stuart Gordon likes his humor as twisted as possible! He had once gone (with re-animator) once completely beyond the comedy-top, but with the little difference that the bizarre humor was effective there. Something that is not really the case at Space Truckers - most gags do not go anywhere and the exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses. In the end, there is only an occasional amusing but completely unnecessary mess. Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance (or at least a half Charles dance) are always a pleasure to see and the still impressive Barbara Crampton has a small role at the end of the film. Crampton was Stuart Gordon's regular heroine in earlier horror films. The story of the Space Truckers is as stupid as they come. Dennis Hopper plays the self-made loner, who is tired of his job. Who would not be if you transport pigs across the galaxy for a company called Interpork? He sees his change to flee while he brings his muse to earth. They float in space pirates and find out that their cargo is supposed to wipe out half of the universe! After this little escapade, Stuart Gordon wisely returned. Since Space Truckers he has already made the sublime "King of the Ants" and the absolutely brilliant "Dagon".
