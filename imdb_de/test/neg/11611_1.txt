I'm not mad at all when I say that this movie was worse than any other movie ever made. Worse than "Batman & Robin". Worse than "Manos, Hands of Destiny". Seriously, it's so bad. When people tell me that a movie is horrible, I use the "two girls" scale to find out. If the movie is like "Two Girls," I will not look at it. If it's twice as good, I might just look at it, just to laugh at the retarders who paid someone for it, because a movie twice as good as this one would still be garbage.
