Trite and unoriginal. It's as if somebody saw Immortal Beloved and Amadeus and decided to mix them up and steal some other formulaic plot parts from other films to create another. As with most historical films today, there are some inaccuracies, as the story is manipulated to better fit the story, which is, for the most part, understandable. For example, in the remaining days of Beethoven's life, other people had to write down what they needed to say in order to understand them. That would of course be a nuisance on the screen. Although the script is filled with some quotable lines, it does not quite catch the feeling of that time and, with some bad acting, seems more timely. Diane Kruger is nice enough to look at, but she still has a lot to improve. Ed Harris does not work for me as Beethoven, and I'm mainly responsible for Gary Oldman. Overall, not a very good interpretation of the musical Maestro life. Just find a copy of Immortal Beloved. <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
