This movie is perfect for any aspiring screenwriter, actor or director. If you watch this movie you will see all the things that are wrong with the movie industry as it is today. There are so many clichés that it hurt to sit through this movie. None of this is original and every single spoken line was torn off the cliché movies we all saw in the 90s. Although there are a few cheap laughs, it is wrong wrong wrong. I was so bored and the movie was so predictable and pathetic that I actually noticed how much makeup was applied to Tara Reid's face to hide those huge pockets and wrinkles from her endless party. Seriously, she had so much foundation that you could literally scrape it off and refill a whole bottle of it. <br /> <br /> What shocked me was that so many talented and popular performers would sign up for garbage. And I do not know how I sat through that terrible screaming of Ashton Kutcher. Do you know when he is angry or something and he screams in that annoying way? Ashton's terrible "talking", Tara's face was ten shades darker than her neck, a drugged owl, a script that looked like the work of a three-year-old ... Seriously, in my Whole Life There was no movie I saw that I did not enjoy, no matter how bad it was. This deserves an award first. BATH BATH BATH ... I do not think there's a single word in the English dictionary that could possibly describe this seedy movie. Tonight I tried to look at it again, but I had to shut it down in ten minutes because I wanted to scream at the overwhelming amount of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Do not bother renting this place your blockbuster is not worth a penny. In fact, I'm willing to pay anyone out there who wants to watch the movie so he can do something decent with his life.
