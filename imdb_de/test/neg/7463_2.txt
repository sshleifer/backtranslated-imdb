THE ATTIC starts well. The somewhat dreary story is much supported by the two main characters and there is a kind of character study going on here, but the movie is rapidly going downhill when Carrie Snodgress buys a monkey. Not one of those cute little monkeys. She buys a really big chimpanzee !!! <br /> <br /> This sudden plotter basically kills the movie. It's just not imaginable for a woman like Snodgress, who's having trouble doing anything because of her domineering father, so she can buy a chimpanzee out of the blue. I mean, come on! Forget it!
