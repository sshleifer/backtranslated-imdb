Challenging horror movie that looks like a soap opera about a drug that sends you into a fantasy world where alien creatures lurk. The movie has some good pictures, but its weird mix of what's real and what's not. Worse are the vague expressions of one of the characters. It seems that there is a more serious, meaningful film, but I do not think they ever got into the serious or meaningful realm, trying to exaggerate the meaning, stupidity comes away. There is not much to say, people talk, drugs take vision ... they talk more. It is not as bad as pointless and boring. The boring thing is the sin here and the reason why you want to avoid it.
