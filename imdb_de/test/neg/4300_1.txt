Impressive. They told me it was bad, but I had no idea. <br /> <br /> We started a tradition. We found a copy of this movie and we just pass it on from person to person. Anyone who has seen the film looks at it and then passes it on to someone else who is worth watching for this unique, creative, terrifying film. Hopefully it will travel around the world a few times. <br /> <br /> It's painful. Really painful. It's even so bad that it's funny. Okay, sometimes it's so bad that it's funny. But most of the time it just gives you the feeling that something inside is sucking on your brain. <br /> <br /> Wow. Look at it, then it will happen.
