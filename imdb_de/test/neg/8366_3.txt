I suppose to say that this is a totally horrible movie would be unfair, but it's pretty bad. The Disney plot includes dogs that play football and fall in love (aw, how cute!). Acting is not bad, but it could definitely be better, especially that of young Canadian actor Kevin Zegers, who looks the whole movie as embarrassed as if he did not want to be there. Anyway, kids will love it, but parents pay attention!
