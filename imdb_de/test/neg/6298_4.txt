Terence Stamp can get carried away, but this is still a flat one-dimensional movie. It's nice to watch - so are the actors - and when it comes to drag queens, you may like it, but the plot and the characters are as thin as cardboard. It's one of those politically correct films that distort everything else to make a "minority lifestyle" warm and cuddly. It brings a lot of mileage from the Zickendialog, which is amusing in this sanitary form, I guess. <br /> <br /> Ninety percent of the actions move in inconspicuous situations in gaudy costumes. The dramatic content is a symbolic appendage - they barely try to make you take it seriously.
