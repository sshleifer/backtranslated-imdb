A few weeks ago I saw a movie poster of El Padrino (2004) in a movie theater with the tag "The Latin Godfather". How lame are we, Latin thought, just because he's a Mexican? Let me remind you that ALL Latin comes from or is related to Lazio, Italy. The original man in the godfather movie is thus more Latin than the Mexican godfather. For this reason we are called Latin American people because we speak Spanish. Language is based on the Latin language that originated in Rome now Italy. So placing a day in a movie poster like "The Latin Godfather" is not only ignorant when we try to link this movie to the original godfather, but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some recognition by copying the title film classic. Well, as far as the movie is concerned, I just hate to do too much, so from 1 to 10 I guess that 3 is the most.
