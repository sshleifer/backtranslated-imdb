One of the worst things a movie studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others by commercializing a "shock" or "gore factor" to sell tickets to buy a new diamond necklace from its birch. The worst thing is to misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by fabricating events, dialogues, and images to your liking. After all, one of the worst things a movie studio can do is to use actors on the ground and shoot everything on a stage that's been rented for fifty cents a day. All three of these offenses, which the creators of this film are guilty of, are to blame. This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen thousands. A score of "1" is too good for this celluloid waste. The filmmakers should not only be ashamed of creating them, they should also be ashamed to negatively exploit the heroes of this story. These are the people who have experienced this tragedy up close, both the living and the dead.
