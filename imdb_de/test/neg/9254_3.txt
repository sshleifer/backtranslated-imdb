I just saw this movie because of the fact that it was on the DPP Video Nasty list, and although I'm glad I saw it because it's another Nasty Down video now - Andy Milligans is by his own merit Film really not the case, it's worth it to deal with it. Of course, there are far worse films on the notorious list; But that does not make the pain easier. The movie was obviously filmed on an extremely low budget, and that's reflected in the script; Blood Rites is working on an idea that is often seen in horror movies and does not do anything new. Basically, the plot revolves around three couples who are in a house awaiting the results of a will. It will not be long before they are picked up ... bla bla bla bla. For the most part of the film, nothing happens; And if we finally turn to the scenes that view the film as forbidden, they are so amateurish and stupid that they can not be taken seriously at any level. It's a very good thing that this movie does not have a very long running time, otherwise it could be used as a particularly bad torture method. It all boils down to a boring end that succeeds in being an epic-scale event. Apparently, this film is still banned here in the UK. but somehow I doubt it's because of his shock value. Basically, Blood Rites is not worth seeing and I personally see no reason to recommend it. Unless you're committed to seeing everything on the Video Nasty list ...
