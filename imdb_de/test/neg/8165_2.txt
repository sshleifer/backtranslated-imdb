Maybe it will be better. I would not know I did it in the first twenty minutes before I cut him off and entered a mourning period. It was obvious that the plot itself was known. One man, Paul LeMatt, Professor of Entymology at Columbia University, drives his dog to a small town in Ohio looking for his former wife Diana Scarwid. There he meets people who either ignore him or are hostile. Oh, they like to smile, but there's something going on underneath. <br /> <br /> This type of arrangement is equally at home for filmmakers and audiences alike and there are many options. You can achieve a neatly drawn commercial success like "Bad Day at Black Rock". Or it would have made a beautiful "Twilight Zone" episode and probably did not. <br /> <br /> The cast also includes some experienced performers as well as some previously known names. Kenneth Toby, a veteran of science fiction, is the superficially endearing motel manager. Diana Scarwid can do an impressive job, as she did with "Silkwood" for example. For some others their range is limited. <br /> <br /> But it's bad-tempered and shabby. <br /> <br /> Example of a shabby direction. The dog of LeMatt is not liked by Kenneth Toby. When LeMatt takes to the street, Toby sneaks to the window of his room, looks at the dog and wriggles something. Cut on LeMatt on the street. He hears his dog howling. Then a POV shot of probably the dog walking towards LeMatt, then past him while the wind blows and LeMatt stares at the camera. Cut to an identical setting - from the other direction! Whatever the camera is, whatever LeMatt stares at is never shown. Maybe it was nothing, because suddenly the wind stops and LeMatt is alone in the street and looks a bit confused. "You should never have brought this dog," says a smiling Toby from the porch. Question: What is this scene about? <br /> <br /> Example of shabby writing. Well, two examples. (1) If you would sit down and write a stereotypical waitress in a diner in a small town without having to do any craft, you would imagine a dull child whose hair is piled on top of her head chewing bubble gum, strolling among the tables , Law. (2) Everything that is credible is thrown out the window in favor of special effects. LeMatt's car stops and explodes as it waits to be repaired in the garage. Silence: credible. Explode: supernatural. Not even Edgar Allan Poe would support such an event. <br /> <br /> And the intruders themselves? Imagine a humble masterpiece like "Body Snatchers Invasion." In the small town of dr. Kevin McCarthy goes a bit crooked, and it takes half the movie to solve the puzzle, and all the while the tension grows and the doubt grows. Here, twenty minutes after the movie, a stranger enters a motel room, ripping off his plastic face, revealing a pulsating, light-emitting, naked brain. The pregnancy is stopped. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you the end because I do not know what it is and I do not care. I suppose it had something to do with insects, why would Paul LeMatt be an entymologist? (By the way, who cares about his lessons?) But I'm not even sure if there were any bugs. It is quite possible that the error transaction was coincidental. The authors may have made him an insect specialist and then forgotten everything. It would not surprise me.
