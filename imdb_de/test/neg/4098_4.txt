Although I like Steve Carrell's work, Evan the Almighty proved to be so many other exaggerated films as far worse than I had hoped. <br /> <br /> This turned out to be a cheesy family movie, the kind that does a famous comedian to improve its image, but ultimately can not deliver. <br /> <br /> The usual Carell-Dorky humor is almost nonexistent in the movie, and although he chuckled me a few times, there was nothing weird about him in Evan the Almighty. <br /> <br /> His 3 children, though probably of some importance to a biblical character, were really useless in the movie and horrible actors. Even his wife was a third stage for such a simple act. <br /> <br /> It was a big mistake to put so much money into a comedy. Although Carell's career could benefit from this film, there is no real reason to look at him. <br /> <br /> If only a little less of his family, a little more of Carell, Molly Shannon and maybe even a cast of SNL, it could have been much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> 4/10 for a few giggles here and there.
