The best thing I can say about "Quintet" is that it's not as bad as I saw it the first time. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean it's good. <br /> <br This weird, sci-fi thriller is not quite like any other movie I've ever seen, which at least gives the impression of being new. But it's a movie's a borderline disaster and one of the worst Robert Altman ever did. On the DVD special about the creation of "Quintet" it is clear that even Altman did not know what the hell the movie should be. <br /> <br /> It's in the distant future, when the world is there, under the grip of another ice age. The film was filmed on the deserted side of the Montreal Expo '67, and I have to admit that this gives the film some interesting elements for production design, even though much of it looks like it was filmed in an icy mall. Paul Newman looked zonked and absolutely uninterested in everything that was going on around him, and Brigitte Fossey playing Drifters who are walking in this futuristic city looking for Newman's brother. Soon, Newman is caught in a deadly "quintet" game that bored residents play for lack of something better and whose rules the audience never realizes. We only know that the goal of the game is to kill all the others you play with and to remain the only person alive. This gives their nihilistic residents their only thrill, because as one of them says in a psycho-nonsense conversation, one can only appreciate at death that one is alive. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow, ugly and uncomfortable to see because of its unyielding gloom. It's almost as if Altman intentionally wanted to make a movie that nobody wants to go through. There are no characters - of course, actors walk around talking lines, but none of the lines really mean a lot and the impressive list of international actors that Altman put together for this tab is not a problem. Only Bibi Andersson gives a memorable performance that may be found in a movie like this one. Still, he manages to create an atmosphere, even if this atmosphere is a terrible atmosphere, and it is strangely fascinating that it would be fascinating to starve a man slowly if he starves to death a decade of great movies really a dry spell. "Quintet" followed close to the cruel "A Wedding" and was soon followed by the not bad, but mostly forgotten "A Perfect Couple", the thoroughly terrible "health" (which I have never seen before), because there is nowhere to be seen) and the catastrophic "Popeye". Thank God, he recovered. <br /> <br /> grade: D-
