Bhagam Bhag was a waste of time and money! I wonder if Govinda made this movie? Govinda ... Dude ... m Your big fan, do you have to make the right decisions now if you choose a movie? I wonder if he had a role in this movie. Johnny Lever could be transferred to Johnson's role. Akshay Kumar steals the show here! Akshay ... Dud u Rock! You've created a space in the heart of everyone around the world! Lara Dutta, Tansuhree ... you guys deserve better. Paresh Rawal is good in his mind! Overall, there were only a few scenes in which I laughed. Otherwise, I just wondered, "the hell did Priyadarshan make such a stupid movie?" Anyway, let's wait for the upcoming movie.
