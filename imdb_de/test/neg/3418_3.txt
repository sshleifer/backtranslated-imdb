Geoffrey Wright, director of "Romper Stomper," transplanted Shakespeare's "Macbeth" into the contemporary, criminal underworld of Melbourne, Australia. The result is a half-awful piece of cinema. Sam Worthington is Macbeth and walks very self-confidently and bored. Victoria Hill, who wrote the script with Wright, is Lady Macbeth, and she is neither terrible nor good. Lachy Hulme, who plays McDuff, is the only actor in the cast who radiates any kind of authority. The rest, including Gary Sweet, is wasted and misdirected. The late Will Gibson was shot on HD and the pictures of the movie are missing the character. Everything is too clean and deliberately lit. Wright's direction is extremely uninspired and the storylines are confusing and inappropriate. Mistakenly marketed as "the most violent Australian movie of all time", the film is sometimes violent and quite bloody, but does not provide a single moment of impact. Slow and terribly presumptuous, this xth version of the classic game is the personification of fake ones.
