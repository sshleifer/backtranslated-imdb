Choose a cliché or cliché (whether ethnic, sexual, cultural, etc.), and I bet you'll find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think all Hispanic teenage boys are stupid, hairy, inarticulate and dirty troublemakers? Are Hispanic girls sex-crazy, slender, ass-proof sluts? Do black people want to start fighting and carry weapons? Are all gay people throwing pink drink theme parties and asking the boys to model for them? Are all white teenage girls rich, stuck princesses, bored with white teenage boys and looking for something more dangerous? If you answered "yes" to any of the previous questions, you, my friend, are a fanatic, and you become Wassup Rockers LOVE. <br /> <br /> Director Larry Clark shocked his audience (I was 15 years old) when I saw kids for the first time and I think that's why I'm still a virgin), but Wassup Rockers is not shocking? it's just bad He's trying to be nervous and realistic with his minimal dialogues and body-hair close-ups, but those characters and this story are completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Wassup Rockers is the fantasy of a teenager. Which 14-year-old boy does not want to be a skater who gets into trouble, crashes parties, drinks 40s and is told by the hot, rich, white girl that his uncircumcised penis looks "dangerous?" Apart from this population, I really do not know who will enjoy this movie.
