Unfortunately, the golden age of stylish Italian cinema seems to have been forgotten. And the recent idea of ​​the famous filmmaker Lamberto Bava is another obvious proof of this assumption. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to watch a lot of films by this prolific director (like Body Puzzle, Delerium, Macabre and both Demons). Although not completely satisfying, they have never been so boring. <br /> <br /> A suspicion that this new entry of my DVD collection money was thrown into the wind came shortly after the car accident scene and was impractical and unlikely to position the body under the dump truck. <br /> <br /> And the sense of superficiality grew in the course of the heavy chain of events that followed. Dumb dialogues, intrepid scripts and a total waste of talent from the international cast. The only character who made more or less passable performance was Mark's mischievous son, who refreshed all boredom. Unfortunately, you could hardly celebrate Mario's son job in all areas. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing his Murder House hoping for improvement.
