This movie is an insult to the game he's based on. The character of Claude was distorted beyond recognition, leaving a painful performance that is not vaguely similar to the original plot. Pity, shame, shame. They have also shortened a whole series of the original score of changing the context in which the songs are sung. This distorts the air of the movie and causes the onlooker, who is aware of what it is supposed to be, to flinch, as the author of this video game gives Hud a wife, transforming Sheila into a spoiled rich girl, calling Claude a cowboy and burger kill him by sending him to Vietnam instead. If you are unfamiliar with the original plot, I can assure you that this is not a bad movie for you, but if you ever want to see the original or, as I am, a diehard fan of the classic game, you would be best to avoid the movie altogether. You really have to stick to one or the other.
