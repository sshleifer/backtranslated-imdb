I see this movie as a bad tribute to the old Slasher movies. Since the 70s and 80s of the horror does not really lend a candle, of course, the personal taste comes into play here. <br /> <br /> This movie falls only in the category "New Generation of" Slashers "in my book, the cast is the typical 18-24 years and possible models.I am tired of this image in horror movies, the old movies had at least some variation on the people, one or more fat people and generally dorks, just looking people, of course it's good to have some good viewers, they've always been there, but if the entire cast is just a few I'm OK, yes, I like watching HOT chicks, but not in a horror that's supposed to reflect some normal people who are being hunted by a knifemaker ... They expect people, hunted, they look like they happen to be on the street, in my view, of course, there are some good-looking movies that are perfectly fine, but there are not many. "Wrong Turn" is an example of the bes seren. <br /> <br /> The next point is the killer scenes that all Slashers should be. In this bad movie you only see 2-3 frames with sudden high pitch / scream and music in the crescendo. And that's it. The little you see is not very graphic, not for people who have seen some horror over the years. The old-school slashers, by comparison, had much more and better death, blood and blood. Not to mention the killers in these films who have outperformed those whom you will see here. <br /> <br /> As for real horror fans, it's more fun and exciting to see horror with new approaches due to originality. The killer in this movie adds nothing new and fresh in my opinion. I have to agree with what someone said before, the CGI is something I would not like to see. Personally, I prefer the makeups in this sense to being conservative (unless the CGI is really well done). Most importantly, you set a good mood that allows you to 'get into the movie'. A good backstory is a very good thing. If you also show and explain too much of everything in a movie to the audience, it all comes down to mysticism, which greatly increases your mood and does not give you much to think about. Just one example: In many cases it is a good step to keep the background of the killers. I mean, if everything about the story or the people in it needs to be explained or detailed, then the viewer does not have much content left to think about it ... It's like watching a porn movie and hoping for a great movie Story in the meantime. <br /> <br /> Why the old-school slashers still work, at least for some people. Because they are established cult films from the time when they were something new, it is admittedly difficult to make such new films nowadays. The exception could be for people who, of course, do not yet know this kind of horror. I've noticed that many people like this kind of horror movie, so of course horror movies do not have "a real taste". <br /> <br /> But for people out there who could share my opinion; Here's a frame of reference for what you can expect from this film.
