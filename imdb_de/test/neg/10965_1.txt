This movie produced by Nott Entertainment is not good at all. I sat through the first 15 minutes of the movie before judging that acting is bad, casting is bad and the camera work is bad. When I hear that there is a download of this movie on the internet, "nott" is even worth the bandwidth. <br /> <br /> By the time I wrote this review, the average vote for this movie was an 8.5, which made me look at it, and there was an average high majority of ten, obviously chosen by liars and Schillern. This movie is "nott" for everyone. Or parents, if you want to punish your kids with this horrible movie, let them go through this for Halloween.
