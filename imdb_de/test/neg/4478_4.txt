I had high hopes when I went to the theater - after watching the trailer, I was hyped as much as the next one, who saw great talent that had a nice premise for creating a story. <br /> <br /> However, it's disappointing to see that talent was devastated by the poor composition of songs - the words are chunky and cheesy, probably because they were composed with a more Western theme. It would not be hard to imagine the same melodies with French or English lyrics. In Mandarin they just sound weird. <br /> <br /> The musical elements were also badly cut together - way too fast to have fun, and the settings of the actors, who look desperate, have taken far too long <br /> The special effects are the next disappointment , Suffice to say, it's very obvious where the special effects start and stop. <br /> <br /> It's not Moulin Rouge, nor In the Mood, despite the occasional (and very similar) slow waltz theme. All in all and an hour too long to tell a simple story.
