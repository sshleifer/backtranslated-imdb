Granted, this movie is well-filmed, but it just does not make any sense or purpose to make it look like a 3-year love story for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> This might have been an episode of the brave and the beautiful or the oc, in short, please do not watch this movie because every 5 minutes is a song to wake you up. I gave this movie 1/10 because that was the lowest and no. This is not completely based on a true story, more than half of it is made up. I repeat that the direction of photography is 7 or 8 out of 10, but the movie is just a little bit too much, the actor's nasal voice just makes me want to shit your nose. If you're a real mesh fan, this movie is a huge no-no.
