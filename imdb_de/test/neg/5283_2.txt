Oh, bad, bad, bad, but I've seen worse, so I gave him a 2 instead of a 1. I was just finished with the movie and thought it was about as lazy as the meat on dr. Choppers face. The worst line of the movie had to be: "I would like to introduce you to someone ... meet my inner b * tch", which was the only survivor of the fantastic group that holds a garbage can at Dr. Ing. the stage. Second worst line: "I'm the park ranger that gets you killed" What, this freak is not even a cop ????? Did anyone else notice that everyone is dying immediately from the magical tummy-punch (no one dies so fast from a tummy tore, I know I often see them in the operating room), except the Super Park Ranger. Dude was like a bucket of blood from this wound, bends a little on the ground and then comes to the final, to a farewell shot on Dr. Dude. Chopper while the inner bed huddles on the floor. And if that does not kill everything, he does not even have the decency to die like everyone else. Inner b * tch helps him to limp out and tells him not to die while running for help because he is like her only friend who is still alive. Since when did these two become friends? I do not think that a hectic meeting in the woods, telling you to go to town, is qualified to meet you, but anyway. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only when there is nothing else and you have nothing to do with your time.
