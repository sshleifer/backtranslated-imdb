"Love and Human Remains" is one of those obviously scripted, obviously traded and obviously staged flicks that are so obvious that the escape from their inventions and their making is beyond. This amateur movie does not need to be explained and tries to stuff every skillful line, every misanthropic overtone, every special sexual inclination into a movie, without having to worry about the fit. In short, sensational crap without the sensation ... which leaves a lot of crap.
