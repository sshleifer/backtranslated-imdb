C'était complètement minable: an absolute absolute! <br /> <br /> This was an idiotic attempt to destroy classical source material, and it was quite successful! <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances, do you watch this movie unless you want your ten euros torn, pushing your nose up from a bunch of vapider, hideously uncomplicated characters. <br /> <br /> This type of film clearly illustrates the gap that is still separating directors and viewers. If the individual (who could have imagined a crime as a ban on heaven) behind it were considerate enough to see the version currently playing in French cinemas, he or she would have had to endure what I had to endure and rewrite it graciously or simply scrapped it altogether. I think the vein of adult humor being mined here goes back to Fritz the Cat, but he lacks the avant-garde status of the movie or even his base attempt to publish social commentary. With the spread of remakes and with increasing reliance on pre-existing source material to fund storytelling these days, one would hope that the election of Snow White and the need to stop worrying about the notion of characters or a radically new story would be more Time, oh, I do not know, interesting animation, wiser jokes, maybe a coherent film that has something to say and does not wire its emptiness out of the initial picture? <br /> <br /> An obviously vile production.
