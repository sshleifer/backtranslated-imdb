This extremely cheap monster movie is about a group of mine riddlers exploring an abandoned gold mine to see if it's worth reopening. They are trapped in a cave and find themselves at the mercy of a strange, slimy creature that tends to cut them off one by one. The word that came to my mind the most when I saw this movie was 'desperate'. The script and acting are terrible, the stop-motion monster effects were unintentionally funny, and with much of the film illuminated underground, the sets looked convincingly like a logistical nightmare. Nevertheless, for some reason, I said that this film failed not for lack of effort, but for lack of budget, experience, and / or lack of creative inspiration. The whole thing felt like it was either a college project or a first movie of amateurs. I have a certain affection for such films, even if they have completely missed the goal. I guess I say, I give him a B for effort and a D - for actual results, not offensive bad like some low budget monster movies I've seen, but still not worth watching if you do not have a lot of free time your hands. I choose a 4.
