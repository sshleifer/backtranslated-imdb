I really do not believe that producer George Lucas did not really make such a horrible sequel as "More American Graffiti" turned out. In retrospect, however, it was the first crack in his then seemingly impenetrable armor. The great success of "American Graffiti", which was produced almost simultaneously with "Star Wars", was the first film that Lucas successfully took with Coppola, without having to worry about directing himself. The result is typical of Lucas - far more interesting in terms of structure and type of treatment than the actual material. Author / director Bill Norton was allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to create odd associations in the images. While it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the four storylines, the style ultimately embodies only the breakage characteristic of the film itself. <br /> <br /> Lucas's brilliant original film revolved around a group of friends about the archetypal. "Last Big Night" before school ends and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are expected to go to college. One thing that made this film so work, despite the fact that it is very episodic, is that you had the main characters together in the beginning and come back together at the end. There is a temporal disposition, as in Nick Ray's "Rebel Without Cause," in which a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than would actually be a particular time in real life, but all takes place in a static space. "More American Graffiti" is basically the opposite - the room is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) in Vietnam, his former girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) at student protests involved in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) races on the semi-professional racetrack. In a constructed meeting at the beginning of the film, all the principles are brought together to see John's race, but then the threads do not come together again and spin like the original. Instead, they split off and we follow the characters over three years. You see different events on New Year's Eve in the years 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the audience to get confused, and I think it's fair to say that we do. While the original film seemed to compress important events and rites of passages to an unreal theatrical time that evoked nostalgia even for those who have never experienced these events, this sequel draws the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and the Try to make it into a coherent movie. <br /> <br /> For me, the best parts of the movie are Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some of the jokes fall flat, but the style of these sections is interesting and they make a nice contrast to each other. A good movie might have been made if those parts were just a little better and if the other parts were not that strong. Speaking of drag racing: The whole conspiracy with which Milner spoke to a foreign exchange student was really lame, not funny, and throwing Mackenzie Phillips for a cameo did not help at all. It was just another fictitious moment, as if they were briefly explaining why Curt is not in the movie because he's already in Canada. Instead, Laurie has only one other brother, essentially identical to Curt, but with a different name and now played by a very boring actor. There is a black kind of satire for some of the Vietnam stuff that is very similar to Lucas and John Milius' original idea for "Apocalypse Now". And in the scenes in San Francisco, there's some of that manic fun that made the first movie funny. But along with the fun dishes, you pulled the rest of the movie down with you, as if someone was trying to argue with Steve and Laurie in their terrible suburban battle, as if they were auditioning for a Spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment. I think that even if these parts of the movie were not so painful, they still would not really compare to the first movie because there is no closure and no sense of coming back together or anyone who has learned anything. It somehow ends at the point where the money runs out or something, a cheap imitation of "Two-Lane Blacktop" and so many better movies. <br /> <br /> Like the original, but this movie has a great soundtrack of historical hits, which is probably worth it for itself and makes the movie almost tasty. The performances of Country Joe and the fish are great, and Scott Glenn, who falls in love with Candy Clark as a hippie, is a sight - I wonder if he had to use a wig back then? I can not possibly recommend this film, and yet it has a little affection in my heart because I love the original so much. I think every few decades I have to try this movie, just to make sure it's really as worthless as I remember it. It's a party killer, but it's something every fan of "American Graffiti" or George Lucas generally wants to see at least once or twice. It shows how much effort can be put into something, and it can still turn out to be half baked. It makes you wonder how wonderful it is that Lucas made such a good movie as "American Graffiti", as if all the elements were there and all the appropriate gods had been appeased. Unfortunately, this was not the case for this movie or for Bill Norton.
