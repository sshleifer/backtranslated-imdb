This is just one of a hundred million films in which directors try to put too much drama into a movie that is not dramatic at all. As in the beginning, the part in which the monk pressed the arrow into his own hand then pushed the same arrow into the gargoyle five minutes later - no sense at all plot line is the CGI, which would be greatly surpassed by a homemade flash movie. The actors look like they're doing their best to portray a series of 70s robots. The dialogue makes so little sense that it is not funny. <br /> <br /> Many things happen without an explanation of how and why, for example, a lady who suddenly runs around in a zoo that closed hours ago. And when she sees this thing approaching, her first reaction is to take a picture instead of doing what she does ten minutes later - power walking (not even running) as her life depended on it - obviously not , <br /> <br /> Overall, not recommended. I wish they were still making new MST3K episodes.
