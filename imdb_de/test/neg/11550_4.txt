"Escanaba in da Moonlight" is the first presentation of Jeff Daniel's writing and directing talents. <br /> <br /> I have seen worse debuts, but this is not great. <br /> <br /> "Escanaba in da Moonlight" begins as a decent spoof of this part of American culture. When we follow Rebuen Soady on the eve of the 1989 deer hunt season, he approaches the record of the eldest Soady, never to make a buck. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in the upper regions of Michigan and has all the usual clich√© signs. But there is a warmth that says that this is not mean. <br /> <br /> Well, Reuben makes his way to The Soady Deer Camp and before his wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives him a Native American necklace, his lucky hat and two forms of liquid that you're probably about do not want to know anything. Anyway, she's really the only one who believes in him. He eventually arrives at the camp where his father, Albery Soady (Harve Presnell) is waiting, and his brother Remnar (Joey Albright) will show it soon. <br /> <br /> Okay, let's fast forward. There are some laughs here, a few moments when I giggled loudly. But most jokes here are used a few times. <br /> <br /> But the biggest drawback is the spiritual / Native American happening. Just when you come to terms with the characters, these strange things occur. However, the special effects are so cheap that they only produce a big flash of light and then quickly push the head forward again. <br /> <br /> And the end, well, it's worthless. <br /> <br /> The move itself was not bad, the quirky character and the funny parody were good. But it should have stayed. Rather than having stupid spiritual awakenings that look like rejected scenes from a demon possession movie. <br /> <br /> I give "Escanaba in da Moonlight" a 4.5 out of 10.
