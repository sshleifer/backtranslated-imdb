My friends and I have just seen a preview of this new Australian movie. Everyone who was in the cinema agreed, what was the purpose of this film? There was no good story, the characters were not developed, and the plot did not seem to be motivated. I find it bizarre that this film, which probably cost millions, was financed and produced. It serves the drama community for no purpose and adds nothing to the Australian film palette. It was a waste of time to do this droll jobless work, and more time should really be spent on buying scripts for the job and creating good stories instead of creating a mess like this. Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne were alright, but were hampered by a bad script. Pia Miranda's character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot, and her lines were average at best. A true talent waste. The salvation was the camera of Geoffrey Simpson ACS, which was like most Australian films outstanding. <br /> <br /> Come on guys, think about it next time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
