This is another of those movies that I knew I would hate, but it was not as bad as you would expect. <br /> <br /> It has a lot of T & A and even the DVD menu is cluttered full of women's breasts. The first scenes of the movie contain a lot of sex and nudity, and I began to believe that there is no story that uses nudity to make money with a popular 8MM prequel. <br /> <br /> As I kept watching, there was just more sex and nudity and main characters that might interest me less, but then the story started to unfold and I started to see the meaning of everything, and it was a little bit better. > <br /> It's about a man whose fiancé is the daughter of an ambasador, and they all have a bright future, until nude photos of a menage showing a trois sex act, and blackmail on the sender cards. The man and his fiancé now need to know who sent the pictures and how to silence them. <br /> <br /> The film has nothing to do with Part 1, it does not even have It has something to do with 8MM, but it's a sex video, so I can see the similarities, so small they may be. <br /> <br /> Acting is neither good nor bad, it's just nobodies playing parts that anyone could do. The production value of the film lies in the middle of the street and its pure drama-yawning. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching the trip to get to the bottom of the blackmailers' motives. I expected answers, which is much more than I could say for the first one, which I think is garbage. This movie also has some nice twists that are always welcome. <br /> <br /> It's not great and it started very slowly, but in the end it talks. I was not on the edge of my seat and I can not swarm my friends that this is a must, but watching a lot of movies and always looking for something new could keep you entertained for 90 minutes.
