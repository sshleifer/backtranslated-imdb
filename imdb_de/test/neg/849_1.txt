The Italian rip-off of Mandingo and The Drum is a poorly named Italian life on the plantation yarn. Many people who do not look like they belong in the American South, wear poorly tailored costumes and wander through places that do not look like the American South. The plot has something to do with the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman, the jealousy that ensues, and the tragedy that follows. The movie promises hot, steamy sex and a lot of twisted acts of violence, but none of that is really all. It is probably anything but racially insensitive, I have not noticed since his artistic bankruptcy. The last phrase is ridiculous at best. A big turkey.
