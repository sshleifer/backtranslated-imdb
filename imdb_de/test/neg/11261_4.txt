I've read all the Dave Robicheaux novels and consider James Lee Burke my favorite novelist. I also visited New Iberia and Acadiana to better represent the environment in most of these books. Needless to say, I was eagerly awaiting "In the Electric Mist", especially as I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be awesome like Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. The story was very choppy; The interaction with the "spirits of the Confederate dead" was shallow and lost the effect and nobility that it added to the book. and Tommy Lee Jones was sad as a DR, expressionless and difficult to understand. The best way to describe this memorable movie is to add my "ditto" to a previous user comment that this movie was like one of those old television movies. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show up at any time. <br /> <br /> The location settings were accurate and the photograph sometimes captured the essence of the steamy, evil, smoky juke joints and weird images. Ground cemeteries of southern Louisiana. Unfortunately, the incoherent presentation of the story was bad, and Tommy Lee's underperformance detracted from the region's unique atmosphere and keen excitement. <br /> <br /> Finally, a comment: In the novels Dave Robicheaux is the nickname "Streak". because of the distinct strand of silver-gray hair on one side of his head. (Much like Paulie Walnuts would look like the sopranos, if only in profile). Tommy Lee did not have a series in this movie, probably because the publishers are James Lee Burke fans and they leave the airbrush series behind After seeing Mr. Jones have seen bad imitation of Dave Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: While I generally find Alec Baldwin pompous and disgusting in most roles, in Heaven's Prisoners he was by far a better Robicheaux than Tommy Lee. In the electric fog. "Heaven's Prisoners is also much more interesting and exciting, with consistently credible performances and a more atmospheric atmosphere than this new movie. <br /> <br />" In the Electric Mist "is fine if you're" veging out. " "and there is nothing better on TV, but then there are also infomercials.
