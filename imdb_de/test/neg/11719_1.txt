No blood, no blood, no satisfying death scenes ... stupid stupid stupid dumb. Dear God, as I sat through this movie, I became ill. Ill be sick very boring ... extremely boring ... <br /> <br /> There's not even a humorous aspect to this movie! I can not say anything good about it, except the lead actor had a nice body ... I think. Definitely not worth the fifty cents I paid for the rent.
