** Attention - this report may contain spoilers. ** <br /> <br /> The idea behind the character of Danny (Jet Li) is good - a boy is taken and trained by Hoodlum to behave like a vicious pit bull. is mainly controlled by whether his collar is on the neck or not. <br /> <br /> However, the author did not know how to deliver this idea within the limits of credibility. <br /> <br /> He has Danny meet a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who must be the most trustworthy fool ever to be a man - along with his nit-witty, endlessly babbling, rather unattractive stepdaughter Victoria ( Kerry Condon). Incidentally, I was stunned when I learned that Victoria should actually be 18 - she looked 25 or 30 out. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, there is no romance between Danny and Victoria. <br /> <br When Danny reappears, hurt, what does Sam do, but brings him straight home. Danny is out for two days, but will he take these jokes to a hospital? No. I do not know if they even went to see a doctor. <br /> <br /> Now, Danny is obviously not a spiritually stable person, you can see that from the beginning, but Sam takes him to his house where both he and his stepdaughter could seriously hurt or even get hurt by this rather strange young man been killed. Why Morgan Freeman took on this bland role in this insane movie, I can not guess. Certainly Mr. Freeman is not so desperate for a paycheck. <br /> <br /> Then we have Bob Hoskins as Bart, the gangster who "owns" Danny - now you're talking about a gunman who's hard to kill. The car Bart is in is riddled with bullets that would compete with Bonnie and Clyde's death. We think he is dead, but no. Then we have another car accident - and again the old beard escapes unharmed. <br /> <br /> In addition, we also battled Danny against half a dozen tough guys at the same time, plus a scene where Danny decided he did not want to fight anymore. I do not care how much a person does not want to fight, if it's up to you or you die, I think everyone would fight. As I've said in the topic Headline - This movie is about 40 miles out of the bounds of reality as we've come to know it. It's not just a case of belief - it's completely beyond that. <br /> <br /> Also, I never understood why Danny's mother, who turns out to be a nice lady, and not the prostitute Bart claimed was mixed with Bart and his gang, and was shot. Maybe that was my mistake, I was distracted right when this scene occurred - but it was highly unlikely that she and Bart would ever have crossed paths. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars - and that's generous.
