I wanted to say that since I saw the movie for the first time. I still will not allow any of my children or grandchildren to watch this movie. At least not until I tell them and they understand that it's a fiction. The only thing I saw right was that animals went to the ark, everything else was wrong. Lot and Noah fight on the ocean like a pirate movie. Make sure that you tell your children the real story before you allow them to look at it, but really, until they are old enough to understand that it is not really that they have a screwed-up vision of the Bible. This was the worst bible movie I have ever seen. Bruce and Evan Almighty were much better and had more to teach. Let your kids watch them
