I saw the biography of Ed Wood many years ago. Tim Burton lovingly paid homage to this extremely talented yet enthusiastic filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Plan 9 and it actually tickled me endlessly. A stupid story, kind of bad production values, but still entertaining and even funny. <br /> <br /> Then that. What can you do with it? Now that Wood has been reported as a cross-dresser, it's amazing to see a movie that deals with it like a cartoon. Yes, there are some attempts to teach the audience about the subject, but most of the time this is a really twisted self-parody. On the one hand, it is a plea for tolerance. Another portrays transvestism as a disease. And finally, it says to the audience, "Okay, if you're shocked now, wait until you see that!" The problem must have been that Wood had to compromise to make the film. You can almost feel it when you see the opening title of the manufacturer: personally looked after by ... So, where are we? This is neither a serious theme film nor a total shocker. <br /> <br /> The entertainment value is practically zero. The wooden voice is slightly amusing, but only because it sounds so misguided. However, this was done in the 1950s, so it can be argued that it was brave to make a film that even mentioned the word transvestite. It all depends on what the film itself is trying to enter. Shock The rape scene is, while mild, just there. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. This is a dropout, but the discrediting is not just Woods.
