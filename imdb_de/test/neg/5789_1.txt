Oh man, I hated this movie. Granted, the locations were great, but that's the ONLY positive thing I can say. Well, I'll say right from the start that I'm very critical of how weapons, especially firearms, are portrayed and handled in movies. Since it is a war movie, the depiction was fine, but the slim weapon handling in the film would NEVER have been tolerated by a real SEAL team. Acting was more wood than my first sailboat, the equipment (or lack thereof) was ridiculous, and the dialogue, we should say, was a drawback to anything that was interesting. Well, except for the journalist, who was actually looking ahead. Watching this movie was like watching "Palmetto" with Woody Harrelson, where every scene was so bad that you just could not turn it off because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. Like Palmetto, so did they. The scene in the water, in which they had inflated the damned boat after drowning the first of the enemy and possibly drowned, made me laugh so much that for a millisecond I thought it was worthwhile, through the water wait for movie. Then Charlie Sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy into the depths of the ocean (the way he was filmed, with the many camera clippings it looked like he had gone down about 80 feet.) Nice continuity there ... before he cut him The throat was so damn stupid, I was stunned. And again, the whole damn movie was. I like action movies, but not this one. NOTE: The version I watched was a TV version, Pan & Scan. I can not imagine that that made a difference, unless the whole thing gets blessed shorter!
