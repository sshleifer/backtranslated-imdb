At the place where the last AVP left off, an alien "Burstburster" emerged from a dead Predator on a Predator spaceship and dropped the Predator spacecraft into the modern day Gunnison Colorado, where it is breeding more aliens, the devastation cause. The Predator race sends down a lonely, highly skilled and armed Predator to eliminate the chaos. Our human figures are trapped in the middle of the intergalactic battle. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is the tempo. This movie moves way too fast. The opening credits have just rolled and the Predator ship crashes into the ground after the alien reaches its full height. A Hunter and Son character is introduced, but before we even know their names, they are both killed, then we see the Predator home-world, and the leading Predator flies away to fight the alien infestation, and all this happens within the first five minutes. This unnatural tempo does not diminish the entire movie; The National Guard is coming to the city, but within two minutes they are all killed without looking closely at a single face. The manager of a pizza shop gets a scene where he can evolve, and the next time we see him again. Without learning his name again, random hobos, a coffee shop waitress, and a cook are killed again without their names know. In a moment, our main characters are at home, the next one walks around the city, the next in a gun shop, the next in an APC, and that random phrase that keeps jumping does not allow the audience to settle down by letting them reach for straws. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the settings and the time frame. The movie is set in the modern Gunnison Colorado. Every other alien and predator movie was shot in exciting settings, such as: In industrial space ships, guerrilla warfare, rainforests, alien planets, and underground labyrinths. Now AVP-R is entering a small modern American city, with "highlights", including a sports shop, parking lots, pizza shops and bedroom for little girls. I mean, did you really try to make the movie as boring, dark and uninteresting as possible ?! It's hard to see these monsters as fearsome creatures when they stand by a shelf full of Reeboks or hide in the bushes in front of little girls' bedrooms. Continuity is a big problem with this movie. The alien series was set in the future, no one had ever heard of an alien before the first movie, and not only had the aliens never been on Earth, but if they ever reached Earth, humanity would be destroyed. This film is ruining the whole concept by being in the present day, with Average Joe's seeing the aliens everywhere, and at the end of the movie, humanity will not be destroyed, not even what may be called minor casualties. It pisses on the whole concept of other films. Attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive Deus Ex Machina. The Predator simply carries a bottle of unlimited magically blue fluid that melts away just a single drop of body. The army at the end of the movie happens to be drastic and lets a nuclear warhead simply drop conveniently erase all evidence of the existence of aliens, although there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses, and many more bad attempts are being made to plot holes impossible to fill. <br /> <br /> Also for a "verse" movie, he has relentless preference for the Predators. For most of the film, a single Predator manages to kill dozens, if not dozens, of aliens in the Mêlée area, barely getting a single scratch, while the aliens are slaughtered just like clay pigeons left and right, and only on their pigeons are waiting turn to be killed by the predator without making any effort to defend themselves. This movie should not be called "Alien vs. Predator", as well as "Predator Massacres Aliens". I mean, how can you fight two species with tension and tension when one is shown to be very clearly superior? <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are among the biggest flaws. Not only are they pale compared to the characters from the previous Alien and Predator films, but as standalone films they are bland, bleak and sometimes even scary. The characters in this movie are I do not make kids, horny couples who want to be embarrassed, pizza delivery boys, blonde bimbos, high school thugs, kids, and a disgusting copy and paste job that demolishes Ripley and Newt; the worst and most stereotypical ideas for characters. Not only that, but all the aforementioned characters are played by teenagers. Teenage casting is an obvious attempt to attract a younger audience, but the only effect is that the movie looks and feels like a typical teenybopper Slasher porn movie, with acting actors that are too young to be a compelling show Mostly they have completely empty facial expressions, which provide a monotonous dialogue. Not only that, but these characters do some of the most cinematic things ever, including the use of Predator cannons, power statements when it's been hours, and stupid plans to get out of the city rather than just Leaving the city quickly and simply so many other idiots that the movie actually sighed the audience in my theater of frustration. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is just a terrible B-movie, something that's due to the direct DVD category. The fact that this film was a theatrical release amazes me as every part of the movie is just amateur work.
