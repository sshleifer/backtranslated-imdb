Terrible drama with the worst special f / x I have ever seen. It's bad enough that I wasted $ 3 to see that lousy pile of crap, but it was the hour and a half that I lost, that I could not have done anything but get a root canal or to work voluntarily for the jury. Being drunk could not even help this video. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly: I sincerely believe that I've lost some IQ points in the course of looking at this idiotic piece of work! Maybe this time I should have followed my own advice. Never expect a decent movie when written, directed, and produced by the same person, and NEVER expect anything valuable from Jeff Fahey.
