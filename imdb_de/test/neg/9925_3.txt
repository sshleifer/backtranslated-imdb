As much as I love Ellen Barkin (who is really underestimated), I have to cancel this movie. If you can not say who did it AND why you obviously never saw a psycho-sexual thriller or saw 20/20 in the first half hour. It's as if the filmmakers and actors do not care that they've turned that way and that they're playing the characters perverts mixing violence and sex. It's not a funny movie you can sit down to, even if you like Ellen Barkin, it's nice to see that she's a tough lady.
