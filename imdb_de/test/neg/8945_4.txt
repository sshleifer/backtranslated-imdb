Several years ago this film was aired on TCM UK as part of a Tod Browning retrospective. What they actually showed, however, was the 1937 remake! My brother had seen it (and in hindsight it followed the original pretty scene-by-scene, even to the set design)? Although it's not a classic, he said it was a much more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly creaky earlier version? <br /> <br /> As this is the first collaboration between Browning and Bela Lugosi, did I have high hopes in this direction? However, these were lifted when, after the first role of boring conversation, it turned out that the main purpose of the film was to appease the still novel sound technique, and the result is therefore step-shaped and extremely static. The thriller plot is not exciting either. Even less appetizing is the seemingly British-Indian backdrop (with the affected accents of the characters and the appearance of the upper class? Not to mention the exaggerated use of idiotic idioms like "I say", "more" and "now") "the whole thing more other than that, there are some unintentional howlers: Margaret Wycherly (as the wrong medium) asks the police inspector Lugosi (if anything, his undeniable screen presence is obvious) to give her some time "find out" who the perpetrator of the double murder really is (the evidence points to her own daughter being played by Leila Hyams!)? She hears a knock and is deceived that the spirit world has really made contact with her then Lugosi enters the room and says in his unmistakable accent, "I knocked twice." They did not hear me! ", where my brother and I almost laugh at the floor n fell !! The editing is really sloppy: During a high-angle recording of the main unit is a microphone quickly pulled out of the camera area? and even worse are some cases where one person outside the screen, apparently in the next shot, goes to another part of the set, but each shot is recorded for the other actors for an absurdly long time, so it seems Take Eternal time for this person to go just a few steps !! <br /> <br /> THE THIRD CHAIR CHAIR marks the third non-horror browning talkie I've seen? Even if both this and MIRACLES FOR SALE (1939) deal with murder and occultism and therefore could still be connected to the genre. Much has already been said about the director's apparent decline with the coming of sound: the flawed 4 horror movies he made in the '30s are infinitely better than the others. what I have always found so stylish and bizarre that Browning was not as much at sea at this time as was suggested?
