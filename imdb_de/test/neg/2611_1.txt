This movie may have been the first Puppet Master, but that certainly bored me to death when I saw this stupid movie. I wanted a refund. This was a bad show for the Puppet Master and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that was terrible. For some it was great, but for others it was a ticket to snore, and if they are right, they are right. The dolls did not even do anything or kill people. It should not be seen by the people, so I warn you not to see it. They will be disappointed even for the fans who love Puppet Master, it was a waste of their time and it did not make that much money 1/10
