Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines summarize this crappy little movie that can only attract idiots and their parents to the movies. and his ... # 1 movie in America! What does the country think? Mike Myers looks more like Michael Jackson. A Chinese lady falling asleep within 3 minutes. A lame act with dirty jokes. It's grotesque and terrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I'm so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan are likely to play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green Eggs and Ham. They'll try to hunt Sam-I-Am and the nasty guy who runs away with it. (I hope you do not ruin the classic book.) Do not waste time and money if you see that.
