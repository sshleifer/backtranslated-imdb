This is said to be based on Wilkie Collins '_The_Woman_In_White_', but the only similarity with this story was the names of the characters, the time period, and the settings. If they changed the story so thoroughly, I do not understand why they had to claim that it came from Wilkie Collins. Read the book. It's much better.
