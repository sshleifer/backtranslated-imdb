Although Casper van Dien and Michael Rooker are generally banished to B movies, they are even above this movie. It does not even convey the slightest feeling of excitement, fear or anxiety - unless you count the fear of sitting through the rest of this garbage. The direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movements that hide the fact that the killer is not near the victims when he attacks. And what a murderer is he: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. I liked him better when he was fighting He-Man. This is one of the laziest tasks of character design I've ever seen. I mean, it's Skeletor! And he is on a horse! This is supposed to be an eerie, supernatural creature? How should we take this seriously? All we get are scenes of this guy riding his horse through the woods - on which he can barely stand - with scenes of soldiers accidentally firing into the woods, thinking they could shoot a ghost. Occasionally, Skeletor shoots someone with an arrow or rides past and stabbing someone to show just how dumb the effects really are. I usually like the sci-fi channel on a base kaose plane, but this movie is too inappropriate for any enjoyment. Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need him ???
