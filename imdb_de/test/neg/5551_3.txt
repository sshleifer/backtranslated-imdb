I've pretty much debated what rating to give to this film, as it's my most unpopular film by Herschell Gordon Lewis yet, except The Gruesome Twosome, but it has the best drama I've seen in a Lewis movie , But we all know that does not mean much. After the movie was finished, I was happy because I felt like I had a 4-hour movie, even though it was only 82 minutes long. I try to watch all of HGL's films, and that's probably the only reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The gusset is, as always, good, the only thing Herschell did right. The drama is just as bad as usual with one exception. This exception is Frank Kress. Would I say now that he is a good actor? No way, but it's good compared to everyone else. The story is boring and shallow and does not go where and in the end I did not care what happened as long as it ended. I know that this is a cult classic, but I did not enjoy it at all. I hope you will.
