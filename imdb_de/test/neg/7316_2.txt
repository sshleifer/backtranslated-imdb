A boring mix of puerile humor efforts with a romantic relationship melodrama fails to add a touch of reality to this faint-hearted film. As the action kicks in, Reno (AJ Buckley) enters his apartment and discovers his girlfriend in flagrante delicto with his roommate, who happily tells Reno, "Well, at least it's with someone you know," and Reno's decision, never one This decision was communicated to the viewers by means of a soon-to-be-canceled voice-over. The story goes on for ten months, and we find that Reno stays true to his word about avoiding roommates. However, this seems to be the question that he collects a living lover, Holly (Holly Fields), with whom he has generated marriage plans. The plot briefly switches to a bleak Hollywood club where Reno's uncle Charley, in love with a "dancer" he felt was highly desirable, kisses on the club's bar after seeing the unadorned charms that make up the object shows his affection. It is obvious that Charley was aware of the flawed state of his heart because he had made a videotape in which his comment left Reno his large (and mortgaged) residence in Hollywood, and we see that the latter decides against promises Interviewing candidates for two roommates as tenants, where he and Holly share the selection process in an organized manner. After an inconceivable sequence of bizarre tenant candidates, all of whom find Reno and Holly not surprisingly unfit to live with them in their home, they choose each other's tenant of the opposite sex, with the lovers obviously choosing theirs Partner. The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) seem to have little apparent clue to their existence, except for a high-profile fornication with a wide range of partners, and it does not take long for jealousy to represent the harmonious relationship between Reno and Holly. Reno strives to patent and market a kind of sports bag. Since he gave Holly an engagement ring, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial importance if he wants to advance his marriage plan. Unfortunately, the predatory team of Chad and Nicole, whose every action is said to be in pleasure, are likely to disrupt all Reno's future wedding intentions. The direction is relaxed, the basic needs of the players are far from it, though an unpredictably composed script hardly provides material that the actors can work with and the ad libbing remains embarrassingly flat. Consequently, the performances are indistinguishable, unsupported by spotty editing, while the manner of camera work changes abruptly and often like the backlight of a firefly. Filmed on a low budget and on-site, the design process requires only a certain amount of skill, but the tasteless D.J. Background soundtrack, generally blurring and almost always invasive. Many discussions have been inspired by the final sequences of the film, which are obviously not expected by a viewer due to the foregoing, but in reality these are probably the only thoughtful parts of a poorly paved screenplay and provide fair results. The work is despite the shabby quality of the production altogether almost horological.
