Let me first say that I loved the original Grudge. It was not one of the scariest, most hair-raising experiences I've ever experienced in a crowded movie theater. I'm not joking. As a self-proclaimed Japanophile, the film looked better in my eyes as well (if the shot had been changed to an American suburb, I probably would have hated the movie). <br /> <br /> That said .. This movie is a total mess! I'm not saying it's shit because a) the movie has some good points. So what does the movie have for that? Well, to start with, it looks pretty cool: Takashi Shimizu, through filters and the use of somber, faded colors, almost creates the dejected, fearful atmosphere of the original. Some scenes are really shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just bad. Period. <br /> <br /> The story is superfluous everywhere in the Tarantino style, d. H. The scenes are not in chronological order. This technique is pointless in the case of this movie and just makes things more confusing. Honestly, a simple plan would have worked better. The original lacked action, too, but it made sense, and the film more than made up for its thin plot with a lot of fear and a really tense atmosphere. Grudge 2 has none of these elements and is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the acting skills on TV that make the cast of the original Grudge look like Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn. Simply put, the movie does not work. It's too slow, too boring and just not scary enough to make up for the confusing storyline (which by the way adds nothing new to the story so even grudge fans will not be satisfied). <br /> <br /> Oh, and what about the old man playing Japanese pek-a-boo on the bus? Is that supposed to be funny relief? Artistic statement? Or what?
