This is so bad that I do not know where to start. <br /> <br /> The main role is a good starting point. It is an outstanding character of Mary Sue, who has little in common with the original from the book, which was (slightly) more credible. No, this one is invincible, infallible, indomitable and bland, even beyond the exalted standards that make up this era of "chicks with swords" that have been upsetting our media lately. She is a twenty-year-old top model, thin as a game, but rich, already a leader in her academic field, a kung fu master, a natural sniper, and seems to have enough authority to surpass officials in a natural way how evil FBI agents. She is God. <br /> <br /> To make up for it, she's supposed to be socially awkward (due to her usually harsh upbringing that turns her into a "spock"), which gives us some enjoyable moments she's wondering "Star Wars "or" American Idol ", but if it really matters, she can easily show herself as a top negotiator and diplomat because she's so superior, you know. As a coronation, she is played by a wood actress. <br /> <br /> The more talented Boreanaz serves as the Faire-Valoir mark for this construct and acts as a bumble-bee comic relief and house "Watson". In fact, everything is a pop-parody of better works like Sherlock Holmes, CSI and X-Files, which tries to mimic the sexual tension between the main protagonists. It's cheaper, though, with all the sophistication of an elbow pick, but one million million poor mill girls will undoubtedly take part in it, hence the crazy rating this turkey gets. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the lowest common denominator in this sad puppy goes way back, leading to exciting sex details from the Legion of Sidekicks, which aim to make it bold and trendy while the overall tone of the show An obvious neoconservative has a view of things. <br /> <br /> Story-wise, there is not much to enjoy as crimes (which always start with some cruel remnants) are solved with nonexistent technology, while the "squint" are adorable But so wrong (the women are less than the boys) is based on different theories, all are useless, because the main character has everything from the beginning, and once she has established, she goes out and beats the guy, who is usually a tough hombre with a spin kick here and a slapper there. The end.
