I'm just filling in this comment because I could not stand the fact that a positive comment appeared on the "full information" page. I really think that this is the worst movie ever made in my country. This is not just because of the terrible conspiracy, the crappy English and a voltage curve as flat as our country. No, because this was a serious attempt to create a good action movie that conforms to the Hollywood standard. It had to be "The European Action Movie of the Year". To this end, they even hired Fejda van Huet, actress of the Oscar-winning picture "Karakter", to complete the task. I do not mind enjoying bad movies, I can even enjoy them when it comes to unassuming B-movies. but i can not stand any movies that are awful but should be a-type movies.
