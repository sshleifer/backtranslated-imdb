This is considered the worst movie ever. There was no research in this movie. At irregular intervals action scenes were recorded, which made no sense in connection with the film. Items appeared and disappeared by accident, etc. It is obvious that this was led by a "stunt coordinator" who was to return to his old job. The skeleton man rode a horse throughout the movie, which, amazingly enough, could change color at will. Either that or somebody thought the audience would all be color blind and would not notice. In one scene, the blood would be on the actors and the next one would miraculously disappear and then reappear. It seems that everyone associated with this movie forgot to look for inconsistencies.
