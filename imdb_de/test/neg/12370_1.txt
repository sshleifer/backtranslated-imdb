Without a doubt this is probably the worst movie I have ever had, and I will see my whole life. Take 5 wooden actors thrown out of drama school because they were so wooden that someone was sitting on them, thinking they were a bank. Then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old VHS types that cost Â£ 20 on Ebay. Add a terrible story with no effects and yes, you have this movie. What a shock it was. They could not even save it by having a fussy girl with them. She was fat and ugly and was the worst of them all. I actually looked at everything because I could not believe that crap was ever funded. <br /> <br /> MISS AT ALLCOSTS
