Stinger begins "3 months Ago" on the SS Newark submarine, where genetic experiments have gone awry and the crew member is brutally slaughtered by big killer corpses ... A few months later "Camp Pendleton" where General Ashford (James Cagnard) Lieutenant Williams (John Miranda) on his mission to go aboard the Newark and the genetic scientist Dr. Assist Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows) before anyone knows that a group of corporate scientists and Marines aboard the Newark is shocked to be discovered. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark), who does not make much sense, mutilates the corpses of the crew. It is not long before the scorpion attack, first Lt. falls. Williams. Sergeant Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) is promoted and takes on the responsibility of bringing everyone to safety and ending the threat of the giant scorpions forever ... <br /> <br /> This Swedish coproduction was co-authored by Martin Munthe directed. He also took over the cinematography. I thought this was a purely non-inspiring creative feature. It's early in the new year and Stinger is the first huge, genetically altered movie of Monster / Creature / Insect I've seen in 2007, hopefully things can only get better ... The script by Mat Nastos is incredibly clich√©d and all of this gets ideas from other films, especially Aliens (1986), we see that the isolated place in this case is a submarine, the hurriedly assembled team of marines, including one who chews on a cigar throughout the movie There are the scientists, including a fair-haired Swede Everything you need to try and explain, and the evil money that draws the evil money makers of companies that puts the mighty dollar above human life and the last ingredient is the monster / alien / Insect or whatever. There are a lot of big scorpions around in this case, but they are not used in any kind of unique or imaginative way, so they would just as well have been killer locusts. Yes, it's all here, unfortunately Stinger is not an alien, if you understand what I mean. It's over 100 minutes long and highly predictable, though it moves at a reasonable pace & as a stupid creature feature you could make it worse despite the many statements made by the IMDb ... <br /> <br /> Director Munthe is different not, it's not scary, it lacks atmosphere and the action scenes are boring and uninspiring. There are not many scorpion attacks and it takes almost an hour before any significant action takes place. The special effects are at the bottom of the scale, but I've seen that worse. I mean, that does not mean the effects in Stinger are good, but I've seen worse. There is not much blood or blood, there are some mutilated bodies, some decapitated heads and someone is torn in half. The only smart and amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked Swedish scientist asks her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money she will make with the scorpions. However, there was a moment when I had to moan. to rip out my hair in its stupidity, as a guy tries to fix the submarine's circuit and lights up the lights by hitting the power supply / computer boards with a hammer and it works too ... Technically Stinger at best average and there is the usual endless number of dark corridors that become monotonous. Stinger was filmed in Stockholm in Sweden, if you are interested. Acting was bad and there is nothing else to say. <br /> <br /> Stinger is not a great movie nor a great horror movie, I can not recommend it at all, but I have seen it worse. If you liked Stinger (unlikely), you might like the similar "thematic" giant scorpions on the loose films Tail Sting (2001) or Scorpius Gigantus (2006) (equally unlikely).
