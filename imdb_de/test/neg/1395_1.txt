... where is my damn trophy? I seriously expected a banner and confetti to fall off my blanket to see 30 minutes of this crap. Comedy Central has been dropping the ball lately, trying to fill the gap left by Chappelle with several squadrons of a retarded man who personifies the retarded men. You're close !! If you watch the show, you'll find Mencia, if he does not stutter about punch lines and laugh about his own skits, only makes exaggerated observations that seem to have no sense of humor. Did you ever notice how the people in Buick's drive are really slow? It's close like Dah duh! Not even the dwarfs and the half-naked hot girls can distract Mencia's pronounced lack of talent. In addition, Mencia is not even a "wetback" because he constantly and stubbornly declares that he is what makes him a scam. <br /> <br /> If something good can be said about Mencia, then it's his own case effort. The man obviously has no talent, but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, God knows he's trying.
