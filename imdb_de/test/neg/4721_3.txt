Cult buyers are no doubt familiar with the term "video nasties". This was a notorious British list of all films that could harm society if viewed by an irresponsible audience (dramatization). For gore buffs, this is an excellent checklist as it contains inhumane cruel and disturbingly realistic movies (Faces of Death, Cannibal Holocaust, Driller Killer) as well as outrageous and extremely sick horror movies (The Burning, Nightmare City, The Toolbox Murders). Against this background, it is quite unusual to see the "Night of the Bloody Monkeys" listed among the other "Nasties". It sure is bloody, but the blood and violence are so poorly portrayed that I can not imagine anyone would be offended by it. And the stupid plot (about a desperate doctor planting the heart of a gorilla in the chest of his dying son) is not exactly what you would call disturbing. All that's left is a pretty amusing pulp horror strip with terrible acting and pointless sleaze. The monkey make-up effects are ridiculous and there is no tension or atmosphere that you can spot anywhere. Pleasing only if you are in the right mood. The few sequences with detailed matches by Lady Wrestling (who makes one of the leading actresses for a living) are very cool.
