I kind of like Bam Margera, so I was curious. <br /> <br /> But seeing home production with someone, friends, and family, with a decent camera, and a solid guy is just not good filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Writing, directing, acting and editing are catastrophic at best. But I ate half. And why? <br /> <br /> This film gives perfect examples of what not to do. It is the dream of a film student, what should be avoided at every stage of the process. Cram it in film school curiculums all over the joint! <br /> <br /> So, thanks Bam! Now I know that Jackass is real - because you do not want to win an Oscar, dude :)
