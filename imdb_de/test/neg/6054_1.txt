"Embarrassing" is the only word that describes this laughing terrible production. From the blatant disregard of the source material (which is sure to anger anyone familiar with mythology from the distance, to the likely inadequate production value), this entire mini-series is a trainload of actors with whom I have pity) communicates the illogical dialogue the same "European" accent that is so common for bad epics. Worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects, from costume and stage design (blurring styles across time and space) to the score (which seems to simulate many recognizable classical pieces as well as "The Lord of the Rings"). , Most obvious are the visual effects that single-handedly prove that if you can not afford to do them well, WRITE IT OUT. <br /> <br /> It hurt to see another legendary story, from a cheap "customization". Maybe someday somebody will do it right.
