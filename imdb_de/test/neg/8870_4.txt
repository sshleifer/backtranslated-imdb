Policeman Michael (Tomas Arana, "The Church") has his hands full as he examines a serial killer who has left parts of the bodies of people he murdered in the home of a recently widowed Tracy (Joanna Pacula). Mike needs to find a way to prevent the bodies from stacking and possibly find love. <br /> <br /> A feeling of "giallo" movies of yore penetrates this movie, even though we know who that killer is from the beginning, and the movie contains some good standards (a scene later in the movie, which is particularly memorable in a school for the blind), but it does not make much sense if everything is fine said and done either. All in all, not nearly as good as Bava's earlier "Macabre" or his first two "Demons" movies, but pleasing enough if you can forgive the pretty vile conspiracies towards the end of the movie. Too bad, the Image Entertainment DVD lacked extras of any kind, as I would have been interested in some. <br /> <br /> My grade: C-
