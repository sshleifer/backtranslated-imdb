Boring one-note characters with almost no development, inconspicuous performances by people who feel like they are just reading lines, and ridiculous special effects make this a real stinker. The story begins with the extremely mild commando Russo and his comrades attacking an Al Qaeda training base. The scene tells us that al Qaeda has recently been looking for the ultimate weapon, and also serves to illustrate Russo's only character trait, a tendency to forego teamwork. Using a collection of empty slates and stereotypes, including a Russian spy, Russo travels to Chechnya to catch a mad scientist working for the terrorists. Along the way, they encounter huge hordes of carnivorous bats flying for some reason in broad daylight. From there, the movie turns into nothing more than a sluggish morass of ridiculous actions, including a scene in which a bat swarm cuts off a soldier's arm!
