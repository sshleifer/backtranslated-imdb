There is no doubt that one's originality is innate, but what we have here is art in its most pathological, grotesque form. That's why Begotten has my respect, but realistically it makes no difference what that abomination is about, but for the record ... <br /> <br /> In the ultimate incoherent horror we start in an unknown time in an unknown place. We are immediately immersed in the psychotic nightmare native. A god is seemingly depressed, he mutilates himself with a razor, I mean, he really tries to finish everything, it takes a while (why not it?) After this ultra-morbid introduction something happens, something rises from the corpse, says Mother Earth. What is she doing? Well, she gives birth to something. The thing would probably have stayed in the womb, but that's life. The psychotic nightmare of Begotten welcomes the matter the only way she knows how. Together with Mother Earth, the thing is mutilated by unknown, covert invaders, with evil intentions being the only available clarity. From that point on things are moving since they have never been pulled. Interesting, gritty images with a completely decent soundtrack are the highlights of the rest. So as not to give the impression that I do not recommend this evil because I recommend it only once and only to people with an appreciation for the dark side. <br /> <br /> From my description it may look like this I am not conceived. Trust me, I understand it, and yes, there is art aboriginal if I've ever seen it. Everything in this film, no matter how noncommittal it may seem, matters. This is perhaps the only thing that makes up the art of the born. Still, most of us need some kind of entertainment value, and that comes from someone who has enjoyed The Chooper. Probably the most intriguing first five minutes I've seen in a movie, but let's be realistic, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put you in a coma, that is, unless it's just for psychedelic purposes Case does not matter. But how would you rate such a boring masterpiece? Depending on how much your attention span can last, it should either be 1 or 10, any other number would simply make no statement. It hurts to do that, but as far as the entertainment value is concerned, it's simply not begotten. 1.1
