The few scenes that actually portray a revolutionary struggle are similar to a pathetic Boy Scout troop carefully weaving between swimming holes. When Sharif or, please, God, Palance, try fiery rhetoric, they sound like Kurtz is swallowing a beetle. The representations of strategic brilliance include a map of Cuba full of smiling fish species in the ocean, and a positive Vaud hypothesis on how the Bay of Pigs came about. What does that leave us? A funny dentistry scene; an excess of high-profile Hollywood farmers who address the camera like a moving train; and only for kicks a Passo homoeroticism, which is not limited to Castro's manic and relentless cigar fellatio. Do not trust Medved, but even a broken clock is correct twice a day: This is a Horrible horrible movie.
