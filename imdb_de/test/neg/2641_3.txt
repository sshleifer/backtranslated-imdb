In this "horror" movie is missing any horror or even mild tension. Even the gore is not good. The plot would have promised something if it were done by someone who cared what they write / film, but obviously the people who made this film did not do it. Basically, the movie starts off in a series of seizures and starts like this: <br /> <br /> The main character insists she is not crazy. <br /> <br /> "Milo" is lurking in his yellow raincoat or rides in front of him a car on his bike. <br /> <br /> The main character insists she is not crazy and touches on her passion as a teacher. <br /> <br /> Someone is killed unsatisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy and that a few bad sobs are buzzing. <br /> <br /> Do we see a pattern here? If you do not, you can enjoy this movie. Otherwise, look at something else. The budget is low, low, low AND IT SHOWS (as opposed to say THE EVIL DEAD, which makes the junk budget forget), and action is bad, bad, bad (with the possible exception of the janitor). In general, the movie is boring, boring and boring. I can not imagine a single scene that was really well done. Actually, I did not like the movie so much that I actually shut it off ten minutes before the end, which I rarely do ... damn, I've watched all the way through the untamed MANOS, THE CLONES and WILD WILD WEST. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Save yourself and see PHANTASM again.
