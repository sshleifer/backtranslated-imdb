This movie was so frustrating to watch. The split screens do not allow you to get very involved with the emotions of the actors. I kept going back and forth, watching all those tiny pictures I finally found with Wiplash. This is basically a rip-off of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Timecode". I was very disappointed with this filmmaker's attempt to be cool. I wish I had gone like many other people.
