If you've really loved GWTW, you'll pretty much disappoint the story. Those who think it's just a romantic story and the South are likely to be pleased with this decent TV production (though I think that's a major failure for Scarlett). But let me say that in the light of the novel, nothing good could come of it. <br /> <br /> I have read GWTW more than 20 times and can really appreciate the customization Mrs. Mitchell has made for the film. It took me some time to understand how good the end was: Scarlett knew she would find Rhett again, as she always got what she wanted. But in the end there was no kiss. <br /> <br /> Then Alexandra Ripley came to fix this by showing us how perfect and powerful Scarlett could be and, of course, described in detail how exactly she gets Rhett even if she has an important affair with one had another person (nothing would have been further from Mrs. Mitchell, I'm sure). <br /> <br /> The story between these points is just long and boring in my opinion Ride went through to the end, showing costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and completely unnecessary ending. <br /> <br /> If Margaret Mitchell were to live again, she would die again at the same moment. She would find out what has become of Scarlett after GWTW. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not fair to compare it to the original, but that's not the fault of GWTW. Is not it good if I do not compare it to the original? Could be. I'm sorry to say that I really do not care. <br /> <br /> I would expect a little more compromise to continue the work of another (suberb), otherwise do not even try.
