I'm a big fan of bad horror, cheap horror, b movies, and all the 100s bottom movies, and I do not deny that this is the worst thing ever to hit the big screen, or even your home video. Some of them, eg. The notorious Manos The Hands of Fate are really bad, and it's a pain for a good movie taste, especially on their own without friends and beer to watch. <br /> <br /> La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano, however, was not that bad. Well, of course it's bad - it's silly, outdated, crazy, cheap, etc. There's an Aztec mummy, a tin robot, a thick masked villain, a crazy scientist, Mexican gangsters, etc. The assembly is bad, the lines are bad. Well, let's say, the lines are not theatrical, FX and SFX are the best that Mexican low-budget production could offer, etc., etc. The movie is still fun. It's so bad that you make a happy laugh for an hour. Of course it depends on the humor, but I'm pretty sure that La Momia should teach all the new arrivals in this cinema how to enjoy it. Please note: The movie lasts about an hour and I think there is just enough time for stupidity that is easy to digest. <br /> <br /> There's another thing - watching La Momia can give you a clue as to what the entire SF / horror genre concept was in the fifties, when compared to today's matrix Compare era of cinema entertainment. I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience have evolved, because watches like La Momia are still being lured into cinemas for some special shows (movies like these are alright) and very often getting a standing ovation ,
