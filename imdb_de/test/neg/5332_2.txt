This movie is bad, as we all knew it would be. Mostly I usually love the bad garbage can comedy of the 80's / early 90's (haha no pun intended). I list ski school, career opportunities, hot shots, summer school and much more from that time. This even has the classic but forgotten comedy of Dean Cameron (aka Ski School Section 8 Instructor and Party Maniac for Summer School). But this movie is just too slow. It takes almost 30 minutes to get started, and we have to sit through meaningless dialogues between the half-understood Sheen guys (E & C). And yes, I can hear how the bloggers died to ruin me with "apparently not on 2 and 1/2-men". Well, Charlie was not at the level he has now during this movie ... not that he is valuable now. Charlie shines only when his co-stars support him, and Emilio is nothing more than an overused wonder bra who offers little support. Actually, this film was written by Emilio and shows that he has no real end (comes on Emilio, even on the ski school of Ski School 2 has burst an end.) No idea how a problem could be solved, no hot babes, no swear to alleviate the bad action, characters, acting ... I am now tired of this tirade and watch the movies that I have listed above. You will enjoy it much more.
