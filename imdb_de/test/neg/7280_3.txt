Inglorious horror movies rarely measure the hype surrounding them, and I have not found a worse culprit than Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes. After not looking at it for years, I was very pleased when I got it for Christmas and waited for an evening when my friend would settle down to see it. She knew she did not feel anything terrible at all. I did not have to bother. <br /> <br /> After a promising - albeit familiar - launch that sets the film firmly in the 'Desolution USA' world of survival horror, things quickly melt apart among the protagonists and antagonists abandoned desert. <br /> <br /> Looks like she was shot for a $ 5 budget. The cannibal clan costumes hired by a dodgy fashion store specializing in faux caveman and Native American clothing follow the story of an annoying pile of unsympathetic WASPs making a detour to California to search for a silver mine in a nuclear test zone ( !). When they collapse, they are attracted to the local family of meat eaters and have to fight for their survival. <br /> <br /> While I was hoping for another salvation, a Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a false turn or a Devil's Rejects, I actually realized I was stumbling over something dusty and unnoticed in the backstreet bargain market. Video store should have stayed. <br /> <br /> With many liters of tomato ketchup for blood and a few gruesome wounds, I can sort of see how an 18 certificate (in the UK) is warranted, but with these reduced close-ups, this would not be a Saturday afternoon thriller on ITV been in the square. <br /> <br /> The whole Silver Mine / Subplot of the Nuclear Test Site is just a McGuffin to justify attacking the "civilized" family against the primitives, but given how easily the savages get their donkeys, it is credible that they believed they had survived a generation of passers-by /> <br /> And then there's the end ... or the absence of it. The Hills Have Eyes seems to lack either a third act or at least a satisfactory solution. Instead, I asked myself, "Yes and ...?"
