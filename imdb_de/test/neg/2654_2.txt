I work in a video library and try to watch the movies we publish every week. I have no problem with that; I feel like it's a privilege. Not so with this movie. , , After an hour and a half, as our hero howled and growled scene after scene, I wondered if they were going to get to the point. I felt I should be paid to look after it in my spare time at home. And if I had known that there would be another hour to endure, I might have given up immediately. I did not care about the characters, the filming was inconspicuous, and Ford made kissing a chore. Even the score was inappropriate and frightening. What a waste.
