Missed it in the cinema, but always something was forced. I found it in the trash bin in my local video store for only two bucks! Will I now pass it on to someone who wants it? Probably! No targeted action, one-dimensional characters, plastic world torn from much better films, no sensible dialogue. You know this empty feeling when you come down from ecstasy? It is this feeling here. The sad part is that the Australia that I know goes in that direction, apart from the melodrama and the simple answers. Interesting just to see the older Australian actors (who once had to act to come by) against the newer Australian actors (who must look good to get through). Like a terribly harsh narrative introduction to a movie that never really starts ... Poor Kylie began her career as an actress ...
