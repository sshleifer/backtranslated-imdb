In my opinion, the film was ridiculous - bad dialogues. Who wrote the script - please keep your job. It's definitely NOT godfather or goodfellas. It's good to be on the other side of the table - bad word choice. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low budget movie without a name actor?
