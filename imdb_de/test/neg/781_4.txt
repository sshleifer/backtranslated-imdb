This is a movie that you can safely avoid. childlike conspiracy and bad acting by Cameron (she really should not take on these serious roles - they do not suit her) Besides looking the most unhappy, we look at that, she's great at Charlie's Angels and she was great at "There is something Mary ... The pope would not be a good president of the US and vice versa My point is that there are some actors / actresses who are suitable for a certain type of character and Cameron is most ineligible for this serious housewife type There are a dozen other actresses who would have done a much better job, the movie itself is pretty unbelievable and youthful in its plot (did I spell Juvinile right?) I noticed a comment from another reviewer, The Box One Rating of 10, who in his comments to other reviewers who gave the film a rating, a valued was rating 1 or 2 and could not spell. I mean, what does spelling do with a movie report? Does it mean that people who spell perfectly appreciate this movie more than those who could not? Come on, professor.
