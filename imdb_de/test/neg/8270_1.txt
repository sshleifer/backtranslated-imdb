Ohhhh MAN, this movie is awful! <br /> <br /> This type of tripe gives the Canadian cinema a bad name or no name. To be honest, I think most Canadian films give a bad name to Canadian cinema. <br /> <br /> Besides the characters (there is a couple who scratch the most in film history), the most annoying editing and tempo of the movie is. It's like a drunken snail is dying to die. <br /> <br /> Thank god Melanie Doane is beautiful to look at. She is the only one who has watched me. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie was constantly interrupting. <br /> <br /> Good for a laugh if you have a bad Canadian movie night. <br /> <br /> I mentioned Melanie Doane The only good point (too bad they did not have the option to keep the camera for more than a blink). <br/> <br /> Another addition to the Canadian Hall of Stinking Movies.
