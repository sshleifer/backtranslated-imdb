As far as I'm concerned, this episode tries to make a statement about how evil people in real life are very evil people, and this is as frightening as the paranormal. The "paranormal" images associated with villain Donnie are purely symbolic. He is really just a normal person. <br /> <br /> The problem is, I just do not buy it. Donnie is just no scary than the paranormal. He is not that scary at all. As a man who seems more confused and funny than malicious, he likes dead girls and hair and has recently become a murderer, he is much less annoying than most real-life serial killers (eg: he's like a very watered-down Human version of Ed Gein). That's why Scully's horror of seeing nothing but bodies with cut hair and nails (something that does not make a difference to normal body care) is completely uncharacteristic, even before anyone is killed or injured. She sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly recoils. <br /> <br /> So, as Comic Book Guy says ... "worst episode ever!"
