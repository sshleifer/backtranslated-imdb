I think that's in the public domain like on DVD. First of all, this is a propaganda film to be shown to an Australian public during wartime. So it's not a serious retelling of Tobruk. The first half to 3/4 is very dry in Australia. I think, as in many American war movies, where the recruits come together, oh one is soooo long. Then we come to Africa and Tobruk, pretty bad cheap stuff. The battle scenes on the DVD copy I saw were almost completely black. See it if you have to, but be prepared to use the fast-forward as I doubt you'll be able to use it after a few minutes. I enjoyed the cheesy Italian "Battle of El Alamia" even more, Richard Burton also did an African theater film that was good at "The Desert Rats". is not feeling well today (I doubt it was considered high then). I say the same thing about my American counter-action films, so do not take it personally, Aussies (I love Australia, been there twice already!).
