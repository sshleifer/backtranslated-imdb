That's really awful, the weakest attempt at comic adaptation ever to the movie. Any thing about this movie that might be bad is. Music, drama, lighting, sets, "special" effects ... One of the only positive effects I can find is that Sue looks cute in her blue tights and the thing make-up is almost passable (face only ). That's it. Post Code. Do not bother tracking down this bootleg copy. it's really not worth your time. Even the broken-down "Captain America" ​​movie from the early '90s is far less of a nuisance than squirming in your seat as you try to endure this mess.
