My expectations were high after watching the trailer. They were even higher when I saw that the film had the same director as Independence Day and Godzilla. The special effects on Independence Day were much better than in this movie. I've been waiting the whole movie for the spiders to show up. The rest of the story was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateurish look, as if the special effects were from a movie from the 60s. I did not see the whole movie When it was played for about an hour, I turned off my DVD player. I watch 3 movies almost every night and have never left a movie, even though it was so boring. The only thing that was good in this movie was the pretty sheriff :) That's why I chose 2 instead of 1.
