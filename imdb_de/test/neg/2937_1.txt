I found this film extremely homophobic ... the main character does not know that he is gay until he realizes that he likes Barbra Streisand and has a flabby wrist !!! I was so offended that after filming at the Toronto Film Festival, I contacted the screenwriter to complain about this movie. This is the kind of movie GLAAD needs to get banned.
