That was the worst movie I've seen this year ... and I look at a lot of cables. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are simply thrown at you without action, without beginning or end of a scene. It's just random idiots with makeup that scream in some plane. The "special effects" (Spielberg would laugh.) His ass is abominable, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute .. I have to say that I could not bear to see it to the end. The scene where the great scientist Bennett lovingly lived on the engine body was too much for me. I'm sorry for my bad English. I'm from Romania (and this is my first post). I only had to register to write a comment on this film because I just can not believe it is a movie that was released in 2007.
