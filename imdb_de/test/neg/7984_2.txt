Oh my god, I was expecting something more entertaining when I downloaded this movie. 1903 was one of my favorite years for movies, but it was shit! The "conspiracy," though I would hesitate to call it that, is about a dumb elephant. It goes slowly on a platform and is killed to death. Lame. Even for a short movie, the plot was too thin to keep my attention. Edison is like the worst director ever. In addition, the elephant has no screen presence. And the end? Wow, that was not predictable at all. * Sarcasm * <br /> <br /> The picture quality is also terrible. You can hardly say what's going on most of the time. The only positive thing about this film is that unlike most other sinister horror movies, no eleven sequels have been made. Besides, this is a complete waste of money and you will never get back one minute of your life.
