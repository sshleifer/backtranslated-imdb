Hitchcock is a great director. Ironically, I find his films mostly wasteful of time. I admire Hitchcok on a purely visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> First the positive. Hitchcock invented the term probing camera. The curious eye who can restrain or seek information. It's not exactly a new visual grammar, but back then it was revolutionary. <br /> <br /> Second, Hitchcock perfected the thriller and the chase movie. He has an economic style and always thinks about the audience. He regularly gives them thrills, regular humor and regular shocks. In short, he anticipates the basic needs of the audience and plays them like a fiddle. Unfortunately, the basic needs of a human are usually stupid. Food, sex, thrills and a little comedy. Hithcock takes care of all these needs on the canvas, with the exception of food, which he uses outside of the screen in terms of size. <br /> <br /> It's the feeling of the audience that sabotages most of his films. A second drawback is that Hitchcock's camera work and visual grammar are now widely used. What his films always have in mind is the simple economics of his stories, the intelligence of his camerawork, and his ability to produce tense action-set pieces. <br /> <br /> So to "saboteur". This is a carefree game in the vein of "The 39 Steps". It jumps from sequence to sequence until it comes to the typical Hitchcock Final Act set. On an emotional level, the relationship between the leads is not with Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in The 39 Steps. Therefore, the whole story lacks a certain energy. The action continues to rumble like a machine, desperate, depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes bring us closer to the end, because it is not clear whether the hook of the hero lies in front of the police, the villains or his action to end the planned sabotage. <br /> <br /> There is the usual Hitchcock logic error. For example, a man is handcuffed with a car strap, etc. (Why does not he drive away by car? Surely handcuffs are not that restrictive.) He can swim in it!) <BR /> <br /> If you have one I'd like you to look at "Foreign Correspondant" for a better 1940s Hitchcock propaganda move. Both are stupid pursuit films with a catchy finale, but Foreign Correspondant uses a lot of umbrellas and tulips, something Spielberg demolishes well in the Minority Report. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 - Some good settings pieces. Apart from that, there is not much you can do without.
