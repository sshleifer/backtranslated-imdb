You know, I always like disconcerting or funny movies, especially when they are shown at the Fantasy Film Festival in Hamburg. but unconscious cruelty was probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Will this comment contain any spoilers? <br /> <br /> No, because I just did not understand this movie. But what can you expect from a movie that was presented to a festival audience? We (the guys from the festival) know that not every one of you will see this movie to the end /> I like splatter movies and I also like movies with a strong graphic language. but this? There are many bloody scenes in this one, but why? What is the director trying to tell us? does he say that we have lost all morality and all religious sentiments? or does he say that incest will always end in disaster? Who knows - I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that will make you think for a long time, look at it. But do not expect to think "wow, I got the message" - I did not understand ...
