What a disappointment! I enjoyed the Jon Cleary books on Scobie Malone, but there is little resemblance between him and the movie Malone. In the books he is a city detective who is devoted to his wife and does not deal with punches. For the film, the character was thrown into an outback copper who uses his fists and is not averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl, though I know exactly what she and the other sexual interest of the film look at him; Taylor was 39 at the time and his face was bloated. <br /> <br /> But the stamina of his character is remarkable; He flies in from Australia, apparently goes straight to the Commissioner's house (knowing he's going to arrest him during a black tie reception), rescues him from murder (gets into a fight), goes to a casino with a girl, leaves with another and puts her to bed. So much for jetlag! On the way back to the commissioner's house (which shows a good knowledge of London's back roads), he gets beat up by the bad guys, but he's still on breakfast day! It is also noteworthy that the Commissioner's limousine miraculously repaired the windshield and headlights within minutes of the assassination, and that a character has a touching belief in the exact timing of a clock-activated bomb is the contempt of Joseph the Butler for the awkward Malone. And at least the film avoids being a London travelogue even though some scenes are playing at Wimbledon during tennis week.
