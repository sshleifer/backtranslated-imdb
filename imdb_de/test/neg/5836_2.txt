Terrible movie. Just terrible. The beginning of this film is something of a bad woman in jail film. Then it will be a B-movie version of Aliens. B-movie in this case means the addition of gratuitous sex scenes and women in lingerie. Oh, and much of the material is exactly the same as in two other films from the same company (including the women in prison). The only thing that saves this movie from a 1/10 is that I actually saw worse movies. Not many and not much, but worse.
