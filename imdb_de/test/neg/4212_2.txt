Brecher Brecher spoke to Chuck Norris as a truck driver and karate master about juggling two different careers. He gives a load that he can not deliver to his younger brother, Michael Augenstein, and when the young man does not show up, Chuck looks for him. <br /> <br /> What the young Augenstein is getting into is a speed trap by Judge George Murdock, who originated from the law school of Roy Bean. Of course, Norris looks after Chuck Norris as usual, and when he gets into trouble, the CB call goes to all the truckers who come and help their good buddy. This speed trap known as Texas City has a bad reputation and the drivers are only too willing to help a buddy. Of course, Chuck is a bit younger and does not have facial hair in this case. He looks like a man who realizes that the Academy does not look at this gobbler. George Murdock exaggerates as the judge roy bean wannabe. <br /> <br /> This is exclusively for fans of Chuck Norris.
