The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so bad that I had to force myself to register and comment. I should add here that I'm a movie fan who rarely makes a tough judgment. But sometimes a movie is so poorly played, poorly designed, badly edited, with such a bad story that it invites criticism. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by all the claims of how great, brilliant and dark this film has been beautifully shot. I can only conclude that the cast and crew here are active posters. The acting was extremely thin. The tempo of the movie was torturous. I gave him new opportunities at every turn (mostly because I did not feel like wasting a Saturday morning in NY), but with every new scene it took longer and provided characters I had no interest in using I could not connect, for which I could not empathize. <br /> <br /> When I see negative films from small independent films like this at IMDb, I sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal ax. He used to make arrangements with the gazer, she dumped him, and now he's going to throw away whatever she's ever been working on. But here, no. I do not know anybody who worked on this movie. And I wish it had been great. But the movie was not dark (as some have said) or depressing (as others claimed). , , These suggest that I have connected to the film. , , No, Henry May Long was just too long, empty and boring. <br /> <br /> That's Tomas Take on this.
