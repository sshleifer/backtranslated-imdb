The selection of the bloated, boring and racist "Cimarron" is considered the worst choice for the best picture in Oscar history. Badly played (especially by the rightly forgotten Richard Dix, whose performance as a selfish and irresponsible Yancey Cravat is considered one of the most narcissistic characteristics in film history) and the racist tendency today shocking his only black character introduced by him sees sleeping in a chandelier. <br /> <br /> Other comments from IMDb reviewers have dismissed the attitude towards this character as merely dated, but many films that appeared during this period did NOT do that to blacks as shuffling, lame mental deficits in the way represent, in which this giant is very happy; so this argument seems to be weak. But whether you see this degrading characteristic as shockingly unlucky for everyone, or simply as the forgivable ignorance of a less educated era, it's very painful to watch with the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> But even this might not matter if the movie was not the extra bore it is. The Oscars were awarded the Best Academy Award in 1930/31, when long-lasting classics such as City Lights, The Public Enemy, Dracula, The Dawn Patrol, and The Blue Angel were not nominated "Cimarron" is by far the worst choice to join the Oscar Pantheon.
