This could be the worst movie I have seen in my life. Usually I do not watch movies like this, but I had to look at it at school. What a pain! <br /> <br /> The story is as average and boring as it can be: boy meets girls on the Spanish coast, boys and girls fall in love, but the love between them seems to be impossible and everything to everyone is against her love. At the end of the film, the movie becomes a kind of weird kung fu movie in which the boys in white fight against the guys in black. Dreadful! <br /> <br /> The action is so bad it makes you laugh. The dances in the movie that I think are cool are so simple and ridiculous that even I can make them! And Georgina Verbaan is possibly the most irritating person I've ever seen on screen. Johan Nijenhuis is on his way to becoming the Dutch Ed Wood. His films are so bad that they make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Victor LÃ¶w, however, performs surprisingly well and Daan Schuurmans is also OK. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie. However, if you like soaps, it may be worth your time. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> <br /> 2/10
