Hello, this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The day I saw this movie, I had a high fever. Nevertheless, I watched the film with much patience. And after watching the movie, I wanted to repent. Because I wasted 3 hours for this stupid movie. I would rather have rested than watch this movie. And I was really surprised that actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab etc. have been involved in this film. <br /> <br /> I do not understand if directors do not find a good story, why then turn a movie do they stay as directors? Why can not you sit at home and spend your time at home? <br /> <br /> I ask all the directors that it is good for them to ask the public, either by mail or through the media, newspapers, radios, etc., to send them a nice story if they do not Do a good story for a movie. I ask all the directors again, please do not make such films.
