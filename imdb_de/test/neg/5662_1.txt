ICarly is about a young girl named Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove), who lives with her artist brother Spencer in a loft in Seattle. Carly has a web show that gets millions of views and earns tons of money each year. So much money she "does not even know it's a real number". Her best friend is Sam (Janette McCrudy), who is as predictable as she comes! She says "normal" things and beat up Carly's neighbor Freddie, who is responsible for all the technical stuff for her web show. Carly calls every word and looks like she has no emotions. Sam chases Freddie around and Freddie screams. In one episode, Carly and her friends shoot Lewbert (the gatekeeper) in the elevator and he survives. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it at all, unless you like teenagers who scream, hurt people and make fun of things.
