So many of these types of films have come out today. This zombie movie falls into the big category of "cheese" as opposed to the much more polished Morning of the Dead and the Day of the Dead. In all fairness, these two films were big studio releases with big budgets. But they were also good movies. A low budget movie can still be good if it only accepts and uses the worst scripts. Who wrote this movie must have been drunk all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie had such special effects and a very uneven plot. The main difference to other films of this kind is the time people need to turn into zombies. In this case, it only takes seconds for them to die and then become a zombie. With the ease with which this "infection" spreads, you can have zombie blood everywhere and do not even seem to be at risk of infection, and believe me that people in this area are covered in blood. The main problem I had is that our two main stars occasionally walked around dozens of zombies and were not bitten. When all the others turn into zombies amazingly fast, these two were surrounded by zombies when they were even unarmed and could easily emerge from them. Our hot chick star even survived a rocket attack on the building she was in. I laughed at this point. Unarmed with ten zombies and a rocket that hits the building, she manages to go out without scratches. OK, sure .... <br /> <br /> Even those who have advised these people on the behavior of special forces, apparently spending no time in the military. They should have seen a movie like Blackhawk first, to get at least an idea of ​​how they behave in combat situations. A soldier was a heavy, overweight specialist. LOL that was good. Another was constantly turning into zombies who thought they were survivors and even turned off his weapon. These people are there to fight zombies, and they act like the soldiers from the movie Stripes. Special Forces, lol ... <br /> <br /> Then they get to the point where they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room, and the whole thing gets very confusing. The explanation is confused and does not even follow the first movie. It made no sense at all. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the anti-Bush jokes. The military lady at the beginning told them that the order had come down from the vice president to the president, and in the end, the vice president was from a "secret place" that issued the orders. That was the best part of the movie for me.
