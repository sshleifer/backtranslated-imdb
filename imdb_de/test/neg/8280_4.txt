Pretty lame and terrible slasher about someone killing members of a high school track team after their star runner was killed during a meeting. Christopher George is an incredibly good performer for the track team. I do not think that ANYONE was ever taken as seriously as Chris here - not even at the Olympics. It's a typically divine CG feat, and if you're a fan of the man / the legend, you should go out and get a copy right away, not the performances, and in most cases, the Graduation Day will not (there are a really good kill). The real horror comes only during a performance of the band "Felony". I have never heard of them. Watch the graduation day and find out why.
