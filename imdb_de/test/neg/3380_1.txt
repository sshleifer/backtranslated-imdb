Although I was able to summarize this miserable episode of Night Gallery in two words, these two words being "horse manure", I am required to write at least ten lines. This is a very sophomoric episode that is not worthy of Rod Serling's standards, but rather an inappropriate attempt at a sort of ironic black comedy. The premise of giant rodents inhabiting the moon, a lifeless bullet, is absolutely ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mousetrap. I suppose we also have to assume that the moon is made of green cheese, and so these absurd creatures survive. I can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to replace the two other episodes that were aired at the time. All in all a waste of film, actors and airtime.
