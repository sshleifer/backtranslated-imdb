This was obviously a low budget movie. It shows in every scene. What is nice to see where it was made. Much of the film was filmed in Columbia, California, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Sonora, California. Part of the film was also shot in Jamestown, California, near Columbia. There is a railway museum in Jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the picture. "High Noon" was shot in Jamestown as well as "Back to the Future III".
