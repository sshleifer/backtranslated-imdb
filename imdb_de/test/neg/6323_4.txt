George Segal lives with his elderly and senile mother. There are many jokes about their Alzheimer's-like dementia, and most of them are not funny, although here and there a few funny moments were sprinkled (like the act running through the park scene and the old home). First, Segal tries to kill his mother because it's hard to live with her and because he's a selfish type. Making the movie like a Wiley Coyote in comparison to the Roadrunner comedy in which he keeps trying to kill this indestructible girl would have been a shame - too bad it was NOT the overall sound of the movie. <br /> <br /> I welcome Carl Reiner's attempt to make a tasteless film that is meant to offend everyone. I have a special place in my heart for films like ED AND HIS KILL MOTHER, EATING RAOUL, and KATAKURIS HAPPINESS - all movies about death that dare to offend. The problem here, however, is that WO is POPPA. has some fun moments, but it also has a lot of flat and the overall product is amazingly bland. Plus topics like homosexual rape, incest and the like are really difficult to make fun of. I've read in "THE RULE LEADER FOR CULT MOVIES" that it's a cult movie, though I just can not see anyone who wants to see this more than once.
