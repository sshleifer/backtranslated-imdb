From 2002, the Dutch cinema was finally better again. This film is still a part and textbook example of the bad period of Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The story is unnecessarily told in flashback style. All "current" sequences set in France are completely superfluous and add nothing to the story, the emotions and the power. For some reason, it is often necessary for European filmmakers not to chronicle the story. I never understood why, or what the charm of it is. <br /> <br /> The story-self is not the greatest either. It's not always clear where the movie is trying to go and what he's trying to say. The story of a young, inexperienced boy who falls in love with a wild young girl who later turns out to be quite psychotic may sound good enough on paper, and even shows some parallels to Paul Verhoeven's "Turk fruit", which was often compared to this film before and at the time of its publication. The end result is by no means comparable. The story can not capture the right emotions, which is also due to the unimaginative performances of the actors. The way the story is told makes the movie anything but interesting or captivating. I lost interest in this movie after about 40 minutes through the movie. <br /> <br /> When this film was made, both Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf promised aspiring stars with great potential and ambitions, both of whom were their careers. I'm pretty dry now. Angela Schijf seems to pay more attention to her family than to her career (which, of course, is not a bad thing), while Antonie Kamerling tried to start a career in Hollywood. He never got any further than playing some small games in two Renny Harlin flops. Honestly, I'm not surprised. It's not that he's a bad actor and he certainly has the right look, but his English is just not good enough to say the least. Just listen to him speak English at the beginning of this movie and you'll understand what I mean. They are not really bad actors, but for some reason they are not shown in this movie. That's probably because of the bad dialogue. I still liked Beau van Erven Dorens somehow. He was much criticized, but his acting seems very natural. He always keeps the characters as he is. <br /> <br /> It's by no means one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not exactly one that I would recommend. Bad and uninteresting storytelling makes this movie a bad movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
