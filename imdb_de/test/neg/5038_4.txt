The Great Rock N Roll Swindle is not only thoroughly inaccurate, but also, when it comes down to it, not much is interesting or even entertaining. Malcolm McLaren has apparently wasted most of the Sex Pistols revenue from this film waste, making it all the more repugnant. It was intended from the beginning to create a monument to the "genius" of McLaren, which to this day takes full credit for producing punk music, creating the Sex Pistols, and sometimes even writing all the songs. Viewers follow McLaren to various locations where he tells his story to his buddy, a dwarf, and simply earns one thing after another. One particularly puzzling scene is McLaren waiting in an abandoned airplane hangar for a plane, followed by reporters and telling them their "big story". The most entertaining elements of the film are the animated short pieces, but even after McLaren's arrogant self-esteem. <br /> <br /> Even as a farce, this movie does not work. It is not entertaining, except Steve Jones, who is surprisingly decent as a person in the pseudo-detective area. Twenty years later, Julien Temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the documentary for Sex Pistol's The Filth and the Fury. While much better and more interesting than "Swindle," this movie is still full of Temple's "artistic flourishes," which simply do not work, like questioning band members in the shadows, as if they were some kind of crime maker trying to get to hide their identity An interesting little thing: The film critic Roger Ebert was one of the original screenwriters for the film "Who Killed Bambi?", From which eventually became "Swindle".
