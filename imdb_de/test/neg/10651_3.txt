Do not forget the serious logical gaps, do not forget the painful-sounding character depictions, do not forget the arbitrary lyrics and you might like this movie. The main character Alyssa loved was the heroine you became to be saved (or in this case to save herself). Instead, she just grins and wonders, are all ballerinas really that stupid? Her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to spread the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to rip your poor, innocent young girl out of her grasp with an ever-present, biting artistic director / villain. And the clich√©! She not only becomes anorexic, bulimic, an over-the-counter junkie and a pathological liar, but all over the course of a few months. It's as if the author had read every horror story he could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much he could be crammed into in two hours (with commercials). <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, but I'm a dancer. This "uprising" or "resurgence" of anorexia and bulemia is absent in all the dance schools I have visited. In fact, teachers are so scared to even assume that a girl would have a better chance a few pounds, most dancers in my classes would actually be considered slightly overweight. I'm not saying that eating disorders never happen, but not to the degree that it's portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another annoying problem this movie had was the mid-to-end writing style. Her boyfriend, who was gone, probably had half an hour total image time, all in the first half. The other minor characters were just props, decorations to promote the story. With the right dialogue, this would have been a very complicated study of a mental health problem. As it is, it becomes a one-woman show, and Kimberly McCullough does not have the chutzpah to get through it. <br /> <br /> For a non-dancer, this film would be a supposed "insight" into what's really going on behind closed doors at a ballet company. For a dancer, this is a very insulting film that portrays ballerinas as stupid and parents as intrusive and ill-informed. These adjectives describe more accurately the people who first sent it. 3.10
