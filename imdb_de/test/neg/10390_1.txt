OK, I usually do not add commentary on movies, but I finally watched a movie so full of bullshit and incompetence that I just had to warn people. Blackwater Valley Exorcist loosely revolves around a woman beating pederast / priest and this punky family of horse freaks, and to make a long story short, the youngest daughter who is harassed by the priest but in love with the hillbilly ranch hand, obsessed. Along with a heroic god who avoids a Mexican gardener who once took part in an exorcism, the woman who beats the priest / priest manages to save the day, but not before the possessing demon can leap to a hooker who takes him The sheriff has killed the city. All in all, this movie is the biggest bunch of useless (I could be very vivid with this part, but why I should waste my energy on this movie) that I've ever seen. All persons involved with this film should be sterilized so they can not pollute the earth with their useless spawn.
