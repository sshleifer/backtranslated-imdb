I've read the reviews of other hacks about this movie, and while it's certainly not the best movie ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre, it's not so bad to accept it for what it is - low-budget, B-movie fare that is (say) strongly "alien" (evil alien monster that flirts its victims) "Species" (gorgeous and confused "Space Girl") and "Incubus" (the beast-breeding with prisoners girls angle). This is a really cheesy movie, and the whole thing was obviously done on a tight budget, though the alien is not that bad (at least I've seen far less compelling men-in-rubber suits). None of the plays is Oscar material and the Isle Of Man is not really convincing for Boston Massachussetts. The conspiracy is also pretty predictable, and the premise that an alien vehicle would cover miles of miles and dump land in the middle of a college campus just for girls - which is a good source for perfect breeding victims - is utterly ridiculous. However, the film has its exciting moments, there are a few aids to nudity and nudity and the film features one of the few film appearances of the beautiful and tragic model / actress Kadamba Simmons (as "Space Girl"), who at the age of only 24 she was murdered shortly after filming in London by her jealous friend.
