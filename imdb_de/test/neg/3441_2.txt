These writers try to recreate the characters they have on "scrubs" in another profession, but the characters they are associated with have no charisma or acting skills, not to mention that writing is bad and effortlessly. These guys are trying to do something that would be good if the writing were not so disgusting, leaving the show only to two attractive teachers who barely keep it alive. The humor in this show seems like he's trying to attract an audience with an I.Q. from 40 or below. Another reason why this show is doomed to failure might be that writing on the show is "scrubs" and this show has to keep going and leave the viewer in an unusual position without knowing if he has to cry or who Hope for new sitcoms loses all together. This is only my opinion, but I think these guys should stop now before they humiliate themselves more than they already have.
