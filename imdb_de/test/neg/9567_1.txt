If this is not included in every "What's not to be seen" list, it should only be because those who keep this list are unaware of its existence, which, as long as that is the case, is the acceptable alternative is. I'm not joking, that's a * bad * "movie". Joseph Meeker returns from the dead, with various vague, undefined supernatural powers, the most used of which appear in new, increasingly weird-looking and ridiculous (and never scary or creepy ... in general, if that is true bizarre, and attempts of the former just do not work, outfits and stereotypes / archetypes, and he's often by David Keith (whom I respect in ... respect Daredevil), usually not uncannily inconsistent (which could also have to do with scripts) One or two characters have personalities that are so incredibly irritating that it's painful to look at them, the editors say it's much smarter than it really is (and what about the red tint for the flashbacks?). Cinematography ... oh, dear, framing, coverage, more effective use of angles (you might as well attribute that to editing), bi Hey, guys, stop me when I say something that you've ever heard of existence. As far as the technical side is concerned, this is a pretty lousy apology for something worth putting in the projector, as a non-exposed movie. But why stop? The plot is just bad. The basic idea was made, and it was done so much better (The Crow would be one). The way it is narrated is tricky and although there is an explanation for the flashbacks, it still does not satisfy. Pacing is about not existing. The leadership is extremely unlikely, and there's more personality in a barn door, not to mention that it's much less wood. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? What are you doing in the name of everything that is good and just? Perine, you've been funny before, in the Drew Carey Show, Nicholas, well, I've never seen you in American Pie before, but if you did not, you were later funny and in these productions the amusement was intentional. Dialogue is ... the less said, the better. The language is unrestrained and tends to be stupid. The violence is modest and they do not even seem to try to hide it (an indication that this was the smarter strategy). Characters, do not let me start. Why muster so much energy to portray unexciting, sometimes completely illogical events? The more you think about it, the worse it gets. It is not even passable as a "bad horror movie" or a B-movie (it can pass the rest of the alphabet very well and go further), it could not scare you on the most fearful day of your life, if it did, it would have an electrified scarring machine , I only recommend this to people who want to refute how bad that is and do not say I did not warn you. 1.10
