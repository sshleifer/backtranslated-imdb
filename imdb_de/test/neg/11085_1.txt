My first contribution to the IMDb must (unfortunately) warn others, so they do not waste their time with The Cavern! There is no story, no character development, no fear and no good lighting. It makes no sense. If you like bad acting, people walking through small parts of caves, posing cameras in bad corners and screaming at people while the screen is in complete darkness, you will love this movie. I could turn off the light in my house and scream and I did not have to pay the rent. The only thing that scared me was that someone made a movie so awful. <br /> <br /> ... one of the worst movies I've ever rented.
