Jumpin 'Butterballs, this movie stinks! It's a boring and listless move that never fades. It's a wonder someone even bothered to make-up Groucho with his bizarre, distinctive eyebrows and mustache, as he has nothing witty or shameful to say throughout this drilling. Chico must have been so disinterested that he had forgotten to use his Italian accent. <br /> <br /> Only Harpo smiles one or two, and there's hardly anything like that anyway. Imagine a hotel manager with loud mouths and another disgusting comic comic in Frank Albertson, and the road gets even bumpier. <br /> <br /> A real dropout.
