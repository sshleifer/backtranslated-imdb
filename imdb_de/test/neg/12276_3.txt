Mild spoiler below. <br /> <br /> When TFW was filmed, the danger of war was clear on the horizon. From the opening scene of European refugees to the definitive prediction that National Socialism will be the death of millions of Germans, this film is as much a propaganda film as the films filmed to Pearl Harbor. There is not much entertainment here, though the dust cup footage is interesting for those of us who are not old enough to remember it. The rest of the story is pretty much forgotten with Mr. Docktor Coburn - with a rather bad accent - and the daughter assimilating to Wayne's help in America. Apart from the dust ball scenes, the only conceivable aspect of the film is the best review. Coburn's speech, in which he compared National Socialism to a cancer worse than cancer, and described the (then) achievements as a brief burst of energy from a patient about to die, was incredibly accurate, and Dr. Actions. <br /> <br /> Historically, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at it for entertainment purposes outside the perspective of World War II, you have to say that this is one of Wayne's less successful efforts.
