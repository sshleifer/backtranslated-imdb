This movie is about a party put together by high school scary girl. The illogicality of this type of film gives her permission to hold the party in a house that used to be a crematorium, a dubious place that was closed and locked for a long time. Apparently the story of this site is one of the secrets of the city best spoken unspoken by the right people, even though the legend is whispered among the young people. <br /> <br /> Why was this crematorium really closed? What happened there in the past? <br /> <br /> I like these kill-kill kill movies of a supernatural nature, as long as they contain something that does not come from a hundred other films. The highlights of this movie are a "7-11" robbery that distracts the employee with a lively look, the "good girl" changing scene seen by her younger brother, the eventual death of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday, the spooky mirror scene and the concept of running water are a barrier to the supernatural; The best thing about this film is when the obsessed party sponsor dances to BAUHAUS in front of the fireplace; this scene rocks.
