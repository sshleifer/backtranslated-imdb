The screenwriters of this mini-series should have been sentenced to guillotine. They slaughtered a very funny story and gambled away the talents of Richard E. Grant. The only thing the authors of the original books thought was the name. All characters were totally changed and the story was not the same. I strongly recommend looking at another version of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Any other version is better than this.
