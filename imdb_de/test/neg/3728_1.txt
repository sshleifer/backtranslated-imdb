This was undoubtedly the worst movie I ever sat through. And that's a lot to say because I've seen my horrible films. <br /> <br /> But I've never seen a movie in which every character portrayed was an unintelligent loser. Seriously, there was not a single respectable character in the entire script. How fitting that the conspiracy was so lame that they lacked intelligence. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz would even agree with such stupidity. And although I have not seen all the other films, I have always enjoyed their performances so far. It was not that the acting was bad, only the whole story was stupid.
