A horrible movie that is amateurish on almost every level - a boring and distracted screenplay full of stereotypical characters played by embarrassing actors for a director who lacks the rudimentary understanding of his craft. The whole thing stinks. It plays like a Slasher movie from the early eighties, right up to the crappy score and the ketchup SFX, but without the nostalgia of childhood that must lovingly search for such slags. One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen - definitely the worst one released in a theatrical version. I've never been out of a movie in my life. Had I been unlucky to see Hatchet in the theater, it would have been a premiere. Avoid at all costs.
