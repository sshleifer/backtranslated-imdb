I just got this unofficial adaptation from H.P. Lovecraft's The Lurking Fear was filmed in Louisiana. Apart from a few changes (names, settings) this is followed in the first 70 minutes point by point of the short story, but then tries to create its own "twist" end, which could be seen from a mile. In any case, it's a much better fit than THE LURKING FAR by Full Moon. Too bad it's a horrible movie. Director David McCormick photographs the thing with the flair of an industrial shorts. I swear I maybe counted two camera moves. The creature design is cheap (we're talking about buying masks), but it's dark (intentional or not), where they're a bit scary. The most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion, but McCormick can not take advantage of that either. File this under good adaptation, bad execution.
