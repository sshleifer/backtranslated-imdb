I know that this show gave much liberation to women in the late '90s and early' 2000s, but come on! They have a whimper, a buzz kill and an over-analyzer. This show has made women look really bad. I can not stand Carrie analyzing every little thing in this show. Even Charlotte howled because of their non-existent predicament that my ears hurt, and Miranda's cynicism was an absolute manslaughter. I mean, can not she just be happy? Samantha was the only cool on the show and the only one who was worth seeing. There was also a good episode when Nathan Lane was on the show, but that was the only one worth seeing - the rest of them were pretty much the same. The humor was drier than a bucket of sand and not very interesting. All in all, not a very good show and I'm glad it's over.
