Impressive sight and some hot chicks with flying swords, oh and those hypnotic Chinese violins too ... Let me think, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"? down-to-earth simplicity and well-developed characters, which still left enough room for the vision, without having to think of the importance of DEEEPAA. <br /> <br /> "Hero", on the other hand, is painfully demanding and demanding, both visually and conceptually. The larger than life morale was terrible. I mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your faith, sacrifice your love so your mighty nation can succeed. WTF ?? <br /> <br /> No, thanks. <br /> <br /> But hay, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud! <br /> <br /> Viva
