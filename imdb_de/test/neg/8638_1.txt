The film begins with a narrative of the protagonist, in which certain crimes are explained throughout the city, and then we learn that the hero is a police officer who is either suspended or has probably retired. I had neither the patience nor the interest to review the above before commenting on anything. If there is a narrative stereotype that has a deep, sleep-inducing voice, then it's high time to put an end to it. I fell seriously asleep and did not turn off the movie. I'm still trying to figure out what the movie was about and why there were no outdoor shots. A third TV series will have more series compared to this crap of a movie, and I still regret the actors and producers involved in this huge bullshit of a movie. It would have had to be produced as a regular television series, or perhaps even as a theatrical drama, rather than showing it on the big screen. Waste of time and money overall. The movie was supposed to be in production for a long time, and it would have been better to keep it that way. With superfluous sleep dialogues and sets, this is the worst movie I've ever encountered.
