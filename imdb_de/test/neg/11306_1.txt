I enjoyed the Mr. Magoo cartoons that I saw when I grew up. And I like the strange skills of Leslie Nielson. So, I thought, this marriage has to produce a strange child. <br /> <br /> I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie was just awful. I can not remember a single funny moment. This is one of the two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) that I wanted my money back. You will let this movie down because you will never have that time again to make better use of it. In a comedy, the plot has to draw the viewer in and serve as a framework for gags. This action does not. It just lies there and snaps like a stranded fish.
