Do not believe the hype. If you have high hopes or have anticipated this movie to some extent, you may be disappointed. Even the witty and talented Steve Carrell can not save this ill-written, overly stupid espionage business. For the purists (fans of the original TV series), this film has little resemblance to the original characters and their influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except their names) are just not the same characters. There are several isolated references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that it is more than a faint shadow of the TV version. For those unfamiliar with the original TV series, you may not be disappointed, but there is a risk that you will get bored. There are also some cheap political Hollywood shots (really pathetic and so typical of an election year). We left after the first hour and were not alone. Some left after 20 minutes.
