This is one of those rare movies that I did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching. It was not because I was particularly fascinated or impressed. On the contrary, I had nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Why? Somehow everything was so exaggerated that I could not take this movie seriously anymore. There was so much sex and violence that I felt strongly that the film was trying very, very harshly to be offensive, as if aiming for superlatives in ugliness, rather than telling a compelling story about two spiraling women Baise-moi had been described to me as "Thelma & Louise with real sex". Well, it's true that the basic idea is similar. There are two women traveling around the country for crimes and knowing that their lives are over now, that the police will catch them, and they decide that now that it's all over, there's no way gives, to hold back. Baise-moi was described as a feminist film in which women who had suffered from male dominance in the past practice revenge on the men they encounter. <br /> <br /> This is something I never translated into this movie, simply because none of these women were ever innocent and because they are not just killing irresponsible, violent men, but also men who seduce them, men who feel like they want to do something Protected sex. And they kill women. No, they are in no way better than the characters they meet and murder in a hideous, brutal way. <br /> <br /> How easily the "heroines" decide on the murder and how much they enjoy it is absolutely impossible for me to address them or even take them seriously. It was just too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I had the feeling that sex and violence were only there to create a superlative in ugliness, instead of conveying a story or putting a point. Baise-moi left me without impression. Do not make me think because it was so far from a real world. So constructed, unrealistic and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There was nothing I could do with this movie, there was nothing to think about except "Why did you make this horrible movie?" If the intense reluctance had served a purpose in this film, I would have easily accepted that. But since I did not find anything, since the story of the film was nothing more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into a movie ... I put it under "unnecessary torture" and myself Determined, NEVER, NEVER, watch this movie again, and I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Worst, not only because it really is not my thing to see people being raped, raped, having sex in other ways and killing each other ... but because, whatever The creators wanted to tell the world with their movie ... if they wanted to say anything ... it just did not work. And there's nothing else that could save this movie because it's also shot in such an ugly style.
