I mistakenly thought this was the 70s art movie about the bed that eats people, which sounds interesting. It's not interesting, I mean, let alone a man-eating bed. <br /> <br /> I'm assuming that Stuart Gordon put his name on "Troma" in the same sense as Lloyd Kaufman set up a video camera to build a franchise library. Little more can be said about this opus than the running time is less than 90 minutes. Of course, it's about a bed being chased by a man's mind, or something that used to kill a woman with a wig and long, false eyelashes. On the way we get a five-minute opening credit sequence (is that too long for "Lawrence Of Arabia") ** a murderer with Marylin Manson's contacts killing with the same technique as the troll in "Cat's Eye" ** Demonstrations of a Sexual Practice That Michael Hutchence may have applied **, previewing what Emilio Estevez will soon look like and behaving like softcore porn, even Cinemax would "whack" Manbutt and pass a topless scene as a crazy (or not) scene ee?) End with unintentionally hilarious hammer blows and leftover strawberry pate (well, it looked to me that way) ** and a rudimentary surprise that would not end much before anything else. It's as if the scriptwriter even fell asleep on the "Deathbed" before the final draft was completed. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not sexy, it's shot on HD video and does not look bad, but it does not look that way. Also, the drama is just good enough not to be bad enough to be fun, and everything else too. No one would probably have seen or heard it, unless it was on a floppy disk with another movie, the modern "double feature". I did not pay attention to parts, so maybe I missed something. But for some reason I doubt it. Rating: PASS
