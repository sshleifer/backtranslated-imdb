I'm also an SF fan, among other genres, and I especially like movies from the '60s and' 70s with their premise "ideas about effects" that have brought so many smart and sympathetic stories to the screen. In short, I fully agree with the Scott-886 review on this film. I heard about this movie, and what I mentioned earlier, a SF buff of the 60s and 70s, with a taste for SF stories with a touch of "Twilight Zone", I expected a lot, and my expectations were reinforced by reviews This film is "second best" to Kubrick's "2001 Space Odyssey". What a scam. "Journey to the other side of the sun" was an ordinary, intricate, half-baked, dumb-looking movie with ridiculous amateur special effects (and I remember, I love movies from that time and despise CGI), and it's more compared to that SF disasters of the 60s are like "Marooned", the "Journey" reminded me very much. The idea behind it is not so bad, but building the plot on the story of a twin planet to Earth, where the same world is reversed, asked to direct a master like Kubrick. You do not have to say that Robert Parish is nothing like that, so he delivered a boring and stupid movie that looked and feels like a matinee series. It's not worth wasting your time, even if you're an absolute fan of the genre.
