Like many other television shows, a particular actor / actress has come to the fore, in this case Miranda Cosgrove, who has made a name for himself in previous movies / series (notably by Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider), can sing the soundtrack (which she did DOES NOT WRITE and becomes even better known). Wonderful: It creates such a major imbalance in popularity as its other co-stars, notably Nathan Kress, who is constantly cast in small roles. In every episode except iDont Want to Fight: Without this show, Cosgrove's music could never have hit the charts and she sang the main title song (which was not written by her) and other covers like About You Now and Stay my Baby Do not forget that she is also lip-synching / sings her song live. Is that how you create singers these days? <br /> <br /> Back to the show, Cosgrove physically reveals more by performing scenes in a bikini, Hawaiian hula-type bra, and mentioned bra many times. Bras and seen in many cases (though not by the other actresses). Wedgies are mentioned, panties were once mentioned. Og, let's not forget "Oh My God" an upcoming phrase (are the scriptwriters / actors Christian?) Granted, the show is not just for kids, I'm surprised about the multitude of feminine underwear mentions, especially in the first episode where the term "pointed breasts" was mentioned. I am not sure if children would later refrain from saying this at home / school. <br /> <br /> I'm not against mentioning or showing female underwear (which the girls are going to wear), but for a Nickelodeon show, people in charge should have known that children would get the attention of such stuff. I doubt that other Nickelodeon shows contain such content. <br /> <br /> As mentioned in other reviews, the Laughter Path is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many areas - for example, when the character cries, how far away is this time to laugh? It distracts people from the joke and is used in almost every sentence. As mentioned earlier, Cosgrove is the star of the show, earning the greatest recognition and support from hardened fans who even scolded a hotel staff when asked to keep the noise level down (see http://www.youtube.com / watch? v = kk0gtfUk98U). Jennette McCurdy is the show's second star, but she competes with Cosgrove in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single to the Cosgrove covers). As mentioned, third co-star Nathan Kress is the least noted. He is portrayed as an atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys, but somehow a wizard in terms of technology. His greatness in early episodes makes him a cute actor, but unusual in the face of his infatuation with Carly / Cosgrove. In addition, Kress does not break into the music industry, and as Cosgrove's fame grows with each episode, Kress falls behind. I bet he's the least paid by all three actors. <br /> <br /> The content of the show is fictional, of course, but also lets you know how it fits into a comedy series at certain times. The laughter track is used.) It also contains several mistakes in continuity (how can you Father and the Air Force Colonel on a submarine?) The US Special Forces have their own branches, and the Air Force does not use US submarines - that's z SEALS). A special feature is that viewers can submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes, but again, the videos are not comedy-related. <br /> <br /> Once again it's a show that is permeated with the references of the female underwear, the exposure of the skin and overused salmon marks. It's a series that pushes a teenage actress so far into the crowd that her songs / actions are overly supported by her fans and leave her co-stars behind.
