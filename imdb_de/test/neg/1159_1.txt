Ed Gein, one of the most famous serial killers of all time, was the inspiration for famous movie killers like Norman Bates, Leatherface and Buffalo Bill. He is also one of the sickest and most disturbing killers of all time. I've seen a documentary about him, so I know his story pretty well. When I saw that, I was curious because I thought it should be a documented reenactment, but I have to say that this was just a miserable waste of time. First, with few exceptions, the facts are completely false, and secondly, this was just a silly story from Hollywood when these horrible murders really happened and they turned it into a cheap coin. Not to mention that if they made it into a horror movie, it was played badly! Ed Gein, he lives in a small town in Wisconsin called Plainfield, but he has a little secret that affects the whole city. He dug corpses and brutally brutalized people. Bobby, a deputy, is about to get Ed Gein, only nobody knows who the killer is, and only finds crime scene for crime scene. But things become "personal" when Ed begins to engage with the policeman's family and friends. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie was just ridicule and insulting to the true story. I've always thought bad action is a necessary tool for a horror movie, but for that story it should have been a better movie, not to mention it was more of a documentary than a stupid clich√© horror movie. Please stay away from this movie, it is completely pitiful and contradicts the story of Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> 1/10
