Although I found the acting excellent and the cinematography beautiful, I was extremely disappointed with the adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the most important parts of the novella is the fact that Ethan and Mattie decide to kill themselves. This is never shown in the film, they show it as if it were an accident while sledging. <br /> <br /> The character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost nonexistent. While they almost change places in the novella, it seems they are both classified as invalids. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Mattie and Ethan complete their relationship, nearly destroying the power and fullness of the finale. <br /> <br /> The narrator's transformation as a preacher was a powerful change. <br /> <br /> Neeson and Arquette are outstanding in their depictions. Joan Allen was also wonderful, but her character was greatly watered down by Wharton's short story. <br /> <br /> I do not expect films to be faithful to novels, but they went too far, nearly destroying the story. Overall, I would not recommend the movie unless you have read the book as you get confused and disappointed.
