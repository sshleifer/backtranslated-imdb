To be honest, I have never read any of the comics and can not remember part 2 and 3. I can compare myself to the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one is really disappointing compared to part 1 and most of the other movies I have seen in the last weeks. The first few minutes seem to be just an unnecessary clone of the first intro of the movie and then it gets worse. There are some good (funny) scenes, but overall it's just another boring second attempt by the German film industry, which (almost as usual) can not succeed. One good thing: the movie is pretty short (75 minutes). The bad: It only contains history and jokes for 45 minutes;) -> Do not look at it
