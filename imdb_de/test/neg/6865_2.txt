I can not believe I'm wasting my time with a comment - but this movie is weirdly bad. If 20 different directors were brought to film different parts of the film, without realizing that the plot would be filmed by the other directors, that is the result I would expect The scenes were not put together properly - things do not always seem to be to progress in turn. The movie behaves as if we already knew about half of the characters. <br /> <br /> And Steve Guttenberg is trying to make a manic, a-la-Robin Williams comedy in this film. Ewww. And the whole premise of hiring an ex-con for a bunch of kids does not seem realistic these days.
