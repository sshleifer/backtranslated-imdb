This step is so bad on so many levels that I do not even know where to start. OK - the good points - Peebles is beautiful as a dirty outlaw in black leather. Some of the landscape shots were breathtaking. That's all. Oh, and it was a nice touch to have the Buffalo Head over the bar in Freemanville. I think it was an allusion to the Buffalo Soldiers. The movie kinda starts OK, but the characters are so flat, so comic book, so much, the bad guys are just overly bad, I choked when I wanted to describe them in more detail. The Spanish-Cuban-American War was from 1895 to 1898. America was involved only from April to August 1998. I think the movie said it happened in 1893 (I could be wrong, but I do not want to go back and check it). Much of this movie depended on how KKK killed Jessie's daddy. Well, boys, the original KKK started in 1865 and was destroyed in 1871 by President Andrew Johnson. The Klan was not even close by at the time of this movie. Of course the evil bases were full again in 1915 and we know the rest of it. BUT for the purpose of the film it is historically wrong and that was a big part of the plot. I think I could go crazy if I got a lot more involved, so here are some jabs and I'm done. I did not know that Boyz2Men and other bands were inspired by the New Orleans Street singers of the 1890s. I also did not know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for Sioux women in the 1890s ... but then I was surprised when I saw a bar singer wearing jazz while making acrylic 1 "nails Wore more like most people than a cheesy Western, and such a waste of talent and money really had a chance to show a part of American history that is not too well known: http://www.coax.net/people / lwf /bkcwboy2.htm for more info That could have been so good, but it was just ... bad from 1 to 10, it gets a 1 instead of a zero, as Mario looks good in his hat and has an Appaloosa horse with him was the movie.
