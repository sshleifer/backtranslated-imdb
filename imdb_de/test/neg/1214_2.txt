Brooke Shields plays a bitter divorce that embroiders her three girlfriends on a "Girl Only Weekend" in Palm Springs, in addition to her "Sudden Susan" duties. The problem: Brooke is "free" and searching while her friends are all involved. Therefore, the title implications and the emotional backlash are their "amoral" weekend causes. Despite some laughter from Dan Cortese ("Victoria's Closet") and the MTV relationship authorities "Adam Corolla" and Dr. Ing. that is dark stuff only for women. D.B. Sweeney, Virginia Madsen and Jon Polito co-star.
