Two years after this movie was shot, "The Juror" appeared. Do not waste your time with it. See "The Juror" instead. "The Juror" is essentially the same story as "Trial By Jury", with better acting, better direction and a much more compelling aura. William Hurt was not credible as a policeman, and Armand Assante could not be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit. You did not spend enough time with Joann Whalley's character to be so upset about what happened to her. The way she interacted with the jury was in no way compelling or interesting. Kathleen Quinlan's role as a hooker / murderer had not been worked out enough and, frankly, was unnecessary for the plot.
