All I've ever heard when I grew up was gender equality, and here's a movie that not only illustrates the imbalance, but also continues with the whole concept that a gender is better. All the while, I was hoping for that redeeming quality so the viewer would feel there was hope for the future, and there was none. I admit I could not finish the movie, I had to switch it off at the point where the old whore told the genetic man Adam that it was okay to be a whore, and I quote, "More tail than anyone Man in the past time. "I do not know that I'm not finished, it's a bad review of myself, but it's the responsibility of the author and the crew to develop a story that will keep a viewer interested, and they failed. This film reveals all the true female natural qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance. Instead, it exemplifies how America was run by lesbian Natzis, and I'm not against lesbians. Thank you, Mr. Director! Please give me a redeeming quality ... wait, I have it! There is no continuation!
