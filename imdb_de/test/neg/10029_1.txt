Lend me 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm. <br /> <br /> Kobold 4, Jack Frost and The Prey. <br /> <br /> I took Jack and Lep 4 because they are good Known bad movies that I've never seen. <br /> <br /> I selected this movie because it is found on badmovies.org with the guide "How to Find a Bad Movie". No real description, no pictures of the movie back, and I had never heard of it, had to be a winner :) <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS, but this movie is so horrible that it does not matter: P) < br /> <br /> This is a real bad movie, Lep 4 and Jack Frost are purposely stupid, this is stupid despite the best efforts of the cast and the crew. <br /> <br /> This "movie" starts pretty much like Evil Dead The actors look similar and have the same style of clothing. Unlike Evil Dead, he never gains speed. For a "Slasher" movie, it's pretty boring, it kills 6 people in 80 minutes, but they're so far apart that it gets boring quickly. <br /> <br /> The director threw lots of boring punches on animals hunting, obviously to go with the whole "Prey" theme, but they do nothing to push the story and are pretty boring. The gore is terrible. All these additional settings should compensate for the lack of a script and a story. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of the movie are mainly shot in slow motion, but this is another way to extend it. The "climax" is a total joke, it's hard to laugh, it's so bad. The back of the box says, "The end will shock and haunt you." Yes, it will, it will shock you that someone could put such a bad "change of plot" on the movie and "persecute" you because you will not believe you paid for that crap. <br /> <br /> Also the slogan is "It's not human, and it has an ax!" A person is killed in the whole movie with an ax, and she is out of the screen. <br /> <br /> A true 1 out of 10 people. I LOVE laughing at bad movies, but this one is so bad that it does not work for him qualities. No bad movie night can match without a real character layer stripe: P
