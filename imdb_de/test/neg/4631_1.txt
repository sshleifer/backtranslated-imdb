Many people in the cinema enjoyed this movie, but I just felt misanthropic. When selfish "intellectuals" rave about their irritating sex life, that sounds okay to you, watch it. I was bored, but I was glad that I knew such people. The premise of the film was that, like all societies or great civilizations, they are ultimately doomed to failure. According to the female historian, who bored us with this fact, the United States shows signs of her decline (Granted, she is closer than me). The next part of the film deals with the empty, tired and unyielding behavior of their friends and colleagues and the various suffering caused by their libidinous behavior with a vague sense of humor. Many people liked this movie where I saw it. I could not relate to that.
