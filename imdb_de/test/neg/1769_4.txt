Normally every movie with Steve Railsback at the top is a good movie. However, this film does not agree with this opinion. Lifeforce is a substandard movie that is extremely confusing at first (reminds me of Star Trek: TMP) but can catch up a bit towards the end of time when London turns into Zombie City. A horror / sci-fi clutter that's very hard to sit through even though the naked spacegirl / vampire is very easy to see. This movie deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.
