Okay, writer / director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood to make his own film and fill the cast with eye-catching names. Good for him! Now he really needs inspiration and talent to develop a truly rewarding scenario, rather than the overly presumptuous and possibly confused crap he's written down here. "Hell Ride" is not a movie; It's a hectic and hopelessly incompetent fan-boy company that pays tribute to the notorious biker flicks of the '60s and the revived Grindhouse movie formula in general. With "Hell Ride", Larry Bishop is embarrassed about his setup and there are many obvious reasons. He has no story to tell? or at least not very interesting? but he seriously tries to obscure this by numerous superfluous conspiracies of plot, a lot of unnecessary and very unfriendly smacks of women, overly long and miserable dialogues that seek cool and vast amounts of pointless violence. The plot looks complex but can actually be summarized in one sentence. The age-old vendetta between two rival biker gangs flares up with the arrival of a new member; a boy who was perhaps the long-lost son of a double-crossed girl executed in 1976. Everything else, from betraying gang members to recruiting veteran members to playing with his nymphomaniac informant girl, is all pointless and confusing. Another big problem in "Hell Ride" is Larry Bishop's own enormous and seemingly insatiable ego. He definitely would not have rewarded himself with the role of a hard and unyielding gang leader, because that only seems incredibly presumptuous and narrow-minded; especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the film. Granted, Bishop played in some real biker-exploitation movies of the 60's (like "The Savage Seven" and "Angel Unchained"), but that was a long time ago and he's really not good as an actor. Maybe it was just Bishop's lifelong dream to play a character who always outsmarted his enemies and that every hot baby craves sexually and writes only a complete script about it. The veterans in the cast, like Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, do not bother to make a plausible impression, and I can not say I blame them. This whole production is lame and pitiful, and I can not choose to recommend it to anyone, no matter how many pretty women with bare breasts and bare butts walk around.
