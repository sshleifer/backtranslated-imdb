I was fascinated by the evil Bossch character as I myself am one and the boss's daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger Ashton Kushner, but this movie is so lukewarm that I had to shut it off. It was a waste of time to see it. When people started peeing in the living room, it was too much to see. Painful, terrible crap movie. If only they had mitigated it a bit. Are there really people who like it and like it? I was relieved to know that IMDb readers rated it so low. The career side of the story was as intriguing as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the bosses' favor. I liked this part. The opening scene with the colleagues on the train was also cool, as I like the characters of his colleague. If you can handle nonsensical films or you are young, you could be too.
