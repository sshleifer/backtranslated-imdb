My thoughts behind this film (despite the fact that it was free) were more or less out of curiosity ... light, easy curiosity ... I was not directly familiar with this "biographical" video. Mr. Gein's report and discovered during the opening credits that horror icon Kane Hodder played in the lead role. My feelings turned not only out of curiosity, but also a glimmer of mild anticipation of what his portrayal of Gein would look like. In the credits (under some grim photos of Ed's crime) were also Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns. "Okay," I thought to myself ... "That may be mildly amusing." As the movie began and slowly progressed (slowly), my microscopic self-confidence (or what I call "micro-hope") faded for the film, and I had an overwhelming sense of humiliation when I died a bit of watching this movie dunghill. Hodder, who is widely known and respected for his work as an unstoppable serial killer, does so inaccurately. Eddie Gein transforms into a moderately withdrawn hermitage and becomes a giant full-fledged killing machine. He lurks at night, killing cemetery administrators, his grave steals buddy and teenage girl, and leaves Plainfield in a panic, as the local sheriff department does nothing to correct the dangerous situation in the least. The deputy and his mother have a heartfelt little relationship that made me feel fuzzy (or that could just have been the cyanide pill I took in half of that turkey). I'm not sure what this movie was about, and obviously the director did not know anything about the subject he was working with. There are already plenty of films that relate to Gein's story that, unless "Ed Gein Snuff Footage" is discovered, I do not want to see any more of it on the shelves. If you're looking for a more authentic movie of this kind, check out "Ed Gein (aka In the Light of the Moon)" from 2001.
