If you are looking for a precise account of Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary who helped Fidel Castro in his quest for power, you should familiarize yourself with Cuban history or even enter his name into a search engine the Internet finally). <br /> <br /> But whatever you do, DO NOT NOTE "CHE!". <br /> <br /> Unless of course you just want a good laugh. <br /> <br /> All reviewers of the time (and the cinema audience) gave "Che!" her voice for the worst movie of the decade. And no wonder Did you see this travesty? The facts are poor at best, Sharif is not convincing even as a corpse and Palance's Fidel Catsro imitation .... <br /> <br /> As I said, if you want a good laugh. <br /> <br It's like watching a co-production between The Learning Channel and Mad Magazine. <br /> <br /> A star. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Palance is also W.C. Fields can.
