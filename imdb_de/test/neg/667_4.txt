Eight juvenile prisoners are taken to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel for charitable work. They quickly realize that it is the residence of a limping psychopath (Kane) who has something for extracting and collecting eyeballs. It does not help that the guard watching over her (Steven Vidler) collided with the beast four years earlier. <br /> <br /> A guilty pleasure of mine are Slasher movies. Most of them are poorly judged and traded, but they still have a certain appeal and entertainment value. See No Evil is a good example of this. It contains cruel writing and actors, but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining. The premise sounds like a mix between Friday the 13th, Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea, but it did not work that well. It was really just a few clich√©s and everything was predictable. Screenwriter Dan Madigan focused only on the death scenes and apparently nothing else. The death scenes themselves are pretty good and cruel. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he found some creative kills. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty boring and inconspicuous. This is because all the characters are one-dimensional and we do not know much about them. It was hard for these people to feel because they were pretty unlikely. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I expected his presence on the screen to be scary, but he did not do a good job. A second prize Jason Voorhees, if you will. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this movie is unlikely to make a career or a career. <br /> <br /> While the death scenes are bloody, they are not scary. There is really no tension, just a few bloody death scenes. For that reason, the movie does not contain much repetitive value. If you do not like Slasher movies you should not waste time with this movie. It will do little to change your mind. In the end, See No Evil is a decent Slasher movie that is generic and memorable, so it's not worth watching. Rating 6/10
