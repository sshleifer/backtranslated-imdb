Jim Carrey is a special kind of humor, and I personally think he is a great actor (for example, Eternal Sunshine). <br /> <br /> However, this movie should probably only be a Jim Carrey vehicle. Immediately realize that if you do not think your comedy style is funny, you'll be stony-faced throughout the movie, otherwise he has NOT recommended anything. <br /> <br /> Even if you like Carrey's comedy, I'm not sure if you'll enjoy this movie. I was there on Saturday night at 10:30 pm and the crowd was definitely ready to laugh. They giggled through the trailers, which was not particularly funny, but when it came to the movie, stony silence. I think it brought five real laughs. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that he does not know what he wants. It can not decide whether it is for slapstick or serious. If it were consistently stupid, it could be forgiven, but (I suspect) it also tries to highlight the relationship between the two central characters. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film is the holding. and there was a lot of potential here. However, these only started about halfway and remained largely undeveloped. In the meantime, you have to sit the first agonizing 40 minutes as the couple's life worsens. <br /> <br /> Four different groups left the movie while I was there and if my roommate had not asked me to keep them away from the house (his girlfriend had just returned from a month's holiday!), I would have the same thing done. And in my 25 years of filming, I only did it once.
