A piggy-Linnea Quigley drinks milk, strips and kills her sister and her sister's friend after they have sex. She goes to an asylum, makes Amy (Karen Russell) a best friend, and the two blackmail their way out of a psychiatric hospital by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by Lyle Wagoner, a regular "Carol Burnett Show"). On the outside, these two man-hating mafia princesses (!) Stop taking their meds and invite six slim baseball friends to their large country home for a party where they are systematically slaughtered bloodyly by a leather glove , dressed mystery killer. <br /> <br /> The vile David Barton FX are so bloody, but so unrealistic that they take on a kind of surrealist quality. The same applies to the film. The dialogue is so strange and stilted, the film is so inappropriate and cut, and acting is so unworldly that you will begin to doubt your own reason. This movie is actually trying to have an action and three-dimensional characters, but it's all handled so badly that it's almost like Ed Wood rewriting an Ingmar Bergman script! And as with any good Bergman movie, this has a sophisticated morality to stick to - every good party needs a proper relationship of man and girl, so there are enough chicks to tickle the lizard. Convince yourself ... or not! <br /> <br /> Linnea (the only reason I ever cared) is very amusing in this movie, has a lot more dialogue than usual, and has several stunning nude scenes. Unfortunately, she also disappears completely from the last third of this movie and the film suffers. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
