I usually find it great to find old (and some not so old) westerns that I have not seen to be the entertainment for the evening. This is a great way to sit back, relax, and escape political and global issues for a few hours. However, this was not the case with this version of The Magnificent Seven. The casting and story of this series follow the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment. good old get-your-mind-right, revisionist story, in which the "bad guys" all have to be white, male, confederate (in this case) and preferably Christian (if it can be somehow incorporated into the script). It's really sad. The best films out there are now and always have been about simply telling a good story on the big screen - not to spread someone's political ideology.
