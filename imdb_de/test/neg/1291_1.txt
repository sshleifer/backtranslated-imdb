I registered with IMDb to warn others about this movie. Where does anyone ever get funding for such projects? That's the puzzle. Harry's farewell may be the worst movie of all time except that I've tried to eradicate the others who are competing with that stupid idiocy. Bad plot, untrustworthy logic goes through. I can not spoil this movie for you by giving away everything that makes your experience less enjoyable. Nothing is pleasing about this film. I have the CD and I will send it to you for free, it is that bad. Who comes first, is only served. If I know you, this offer is vain, because I would not impose this film on anyone, not on purpose. YOU WERE WARNED.
