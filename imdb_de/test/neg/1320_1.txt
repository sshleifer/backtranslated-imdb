As bad as they are. This movie makes the grave mistake of not caring what's happening to the characters. The two women in this movie are so stupid that you start rooting for the bad guys for this thing to end. This movie is one of the few that was so bad that I had to turn to another channel. <br /> <br /> In top-class language, this film lacks correctness. People, not even people from Ohio, just do not behave that way. Well, maybe that's what the authors are doing. <br /> <br /> There is not enough beer in the world to make this film bearable. <br /> <br /> F903
