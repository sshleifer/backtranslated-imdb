Normally I do not try to guess a criminal thriller, but Cleaner was just too predictable. Samuel L. Jackson, who played the character Tom Cutler, created an interesting twist along with his profession at the beginning of the film, but that was about it. Without thinking, I knew where the plot was going to go, and within 30 minutes I had already figured out who the killer was. Instead of trusting me and seeing several films making a turn, I watched until graduation. What a disappointment, I was right from the start. <br /> <br /> Casting characters was good, as did the acting of Jackson and Harris ... except Eva Mendes. From the beginning, she did not play a credible character in terms of the script, and this destroyed the entire plot too soon. Perhaps this was a direct mishap or just a weakness in the story itself. Her role as Ann Norcut would have shown more emotion and pain for the situation that formed around her. This would have made the setup a little more convincing and the end more dramatic. Nevertheless, the cleaner is visible, not memorable. I've seen episodes of CSI that were more exciting than these.
