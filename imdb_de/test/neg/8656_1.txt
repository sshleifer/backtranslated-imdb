Neal N Nikki is voted the worst movie of the year by Planetbollywood. It is hard to believe that the famous Chopra has produced this lousy film. It was presented as a movie for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. It does not make you laugh, but boredom, and there are no sexy girls who make the movie look sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade. I'm the Neil, I'm the man, a rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of Bollywood's worst actors who has not had a theatrical talent yet. After making a lot of super flops and getting no more movies from a producer than from his family. He gives a total crap performance that bores you to death. Tanisha, who is and always will be known as Kajol's sister, gives a terrific performance. Both actors have the most annoying chemistry and are very immature for their age. It has a special appearance of the very sweet Richa Pollad in a miserable role. The end was so stupid and stupid, I can not believe that I actually paid money to rent this crap.
