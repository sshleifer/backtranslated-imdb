This is the result of the city of Milpitas, California, which has made a home movie and subjects the rest of the world to it. Legendary in some circles as the largest cinematic turkey, this film is rightly considered a bad movie. Part comedy, some huge monster horror movie This movie is full of non-actors who are not acting. The property has something to do with a gigantic monster that has sprung from the garbage and pollution in the area and is on the run. The monster we've seen in the last 20 minutes looks pretty cool, but it's not cool enough to watch the previous hour of boredom. Honestly, even die-hard movie lovers will have a hard time getting through to the end. That's a stinker.
