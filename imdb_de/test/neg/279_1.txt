I had read the newspaper reviews of this movie and have to say that my expectations were very low before I saw Ocean's 12. I really enjoyed the first movie, but this sequel is one of the worst movies ever. I would count it among the top 5 of the worst movie I have ever seen. Why do I say that? First of all, there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments, to which the term "history" could be assigned, are sometimes loosely held together, but most of the time the film moves without meaning and drive. The entire story seems to be forced, and the script that surrounds the story is even more compelled to become a farce at times. <br /> <br /> The performers appear but do nothing to earn any credit or rating. Most embarrassing are leading ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) who are either over the top or extremely easy. Damon, Clooney and Pitt are also not brilliant. To be honest, I really do not understand how they want to be associated with something as bad as this movie. <br /> <br /> === May contains spoiler ==== camera and cut. Sigh, where should I start. There are many unnecessary camera movements that make the experience painful. Combine this with extremely impractical edits and look for a wooden spoon to cut out your heart. In particular, the scene in which the entire gang is taken out of jail to be transported by car. The camera zoom for each person gets boring and when you are in 3rd place out of 12, you get the message: Wow, you're cool and can do simple zoom effects - NOT. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny, but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away so as not to experience the chaos. Bruce Willis. Why? Please explain it to me! WHY ??? <br /> <br /> To sum up: If you have to choose between root canal work and observing Ocean's 12, I recommend the former. Make sure they make all the teeth while you're at it ...
