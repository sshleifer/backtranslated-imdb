It's not too bad, but ultimately lacks the quality that the Australian series offers. <br /> <br /> There are few jokes, the actors are attractive (that should not be), the filmmakers Think too much about the cinematography (it should look like a home video) and it's like a serious version from Kath and Kim ... it's stupid. <br /> <br /> It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim are said to be two curvy middle-aged women who think they're hot and are wearing ridiculous clothes. There is no "Look at me, Kimmy!" Jokes Kim's fat girlfriend is not fat at all and she's not even a bit dumb. She is a stereotypical black / latino woman. <br /> <br /> It's just not as stupid or funny as the Australian series. It is not comparable. Nothing is the same. I admit, this show is sometimes pretty funny, but it's NOT something like the Aussie series. I was looking forward to an American attitude of a Bogan family. They failed. It's REALLY stupid and funny, but the actors are not stupid! For me, this is just a typical American television program. It's a downer if you want it to be an Aussie show. <br /> <br /> 2 Stars, because it's an OK show, just not what it should be.
