SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This movie was lent as a joke and what a joke it was. The film is based on a dog catcher looking for El Chupacabra. The dog catcher outfit is so ridiculous. It looks like he sewed the patch to his hat and for some reason he shows his "muscles" by rolling up his sleeves. Throughout the movie, mostly at night, you can see how bad the lighting was. They are in a car that is brightly lit and they are jet-black. Often one sees the shadow of the cameraman on the ground. The costumes are terrible, the lighting is terrible and the acting is terrible. This is a good movie for a laugh ... maybe.
