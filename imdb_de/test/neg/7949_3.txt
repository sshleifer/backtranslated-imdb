Why make the original "Assault" again? In my opinion, "Assault" was the true masterpiece of Carpenter. It had all the elements that included good Zimmermann films. External threat to a small group of people. People accept the challenge because they are forced to do so. Insulation! Remember, the rifles in Carpenter's original made no sound and were thus much more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Focuses on the psychology of the "main character I" and his relationship to the main character II (the evil, but honorable). The Anonymous Threat in Carpenter Film has been replaced by a more conventional conspiracy / corruption backdrop. The "Remakers" simply did not understand the main presentation of the original. And produces something quite ordinary.
