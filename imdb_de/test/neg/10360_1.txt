Yes, I admire the independent spirit of everything, but it's like a bad-road road trip with no budget. <br /> <br /> I laugh when I see American comedies, I do not laugh. This movie made me laugh, but only because of the obvious obvious attempts to simulate high-budget high school high school / pot-flicks. <br /> <br /> If you want a good independent American comedy with pot credentials, then look at Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater flies or something. Do not waste your time with this piece of film. <br /> <br /> I mean, how can you take these comments seriously when most people complain about the characters who do not smoke pot? By the way: In Norway it says "Dude, Where's My Pot"!
