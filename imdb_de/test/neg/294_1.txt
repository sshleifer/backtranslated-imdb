I will not bother to mention anything about the plot - this is strictly a B-movie on the way to disguise. The shock to me, however, is to see what has become of some actors in this film. Erika Eleniak, never something you would call a Thespian anyway, seems to have changed into Anna Nicole Smith (in her great period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear. He has always been a favorite of mine for his martial arts, as seen in the Bloodsport series (including B movies, but if you like martial arts, it's great to watch). Here he is a shell of his former self-confidence, he is older, but he does the mercenary certificate and does not even look interested ... I just do not get it. Do not these people invest? William Forsythe is another "heavy" one I've always liked, but his last different roles are what you would call a "mailing in". I will not even mention Mr. Reynolds - his appearance here is a path, nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, as usual a scary, bad, punk-colored rogue with a sandpaper voice clenching milk - the best kind! This is a movie you are looking for. There is nothing else.
