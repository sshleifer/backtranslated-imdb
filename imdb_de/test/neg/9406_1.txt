Another entry in the Pacino-As-Mentor subgenre. You know the exercise: Young hotshots with fatal flaws (in this case, Matthew McConaughey trying to accelerate a career he's in by applying Pacinos Coattails - hey, it worked for Keanu and Colin, right?) ?) by a glamorous and wonderfully corrupt father figure (Pacino, natch). Young Hotshot learns from Father Figure all the pros and cons of a lucrative but humiliating career (this time it's football handicapping). Father Figure uses money, hookers, and power in Young Hotshot, but we all know that this decadent state collides with resolution and despair. , , until the young Hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the father figure and all or almost everyone he stands for. (Apparently, Stone's * Wall Street * has laid down the basic rules for the Pacino As Mentor sub-genre.) <br /> <br /> We're also supposed to take these Pacino films of the last days as a parallel reality. Again, you know the exercise: Living-Legend Actor demonstrates his undisputed superiority over a substandard young actor. The latter may grudge the process and grin, but he must realize that he is not getting any of the good lines, much less the chance to chew the scenery before dissolving. Now you have to say that there are actually two good movies in the Pacino As Mentor Canon: * Scent of a Woman * and * Donnie Brasco *. In the first case, it was a solo show anyway; In the latter case, Pacino had met in the person of Johnny Depp his match as a scene robber. These two films, however, were serious and not just an exercise in showboarding for the sake of the show. Pacino made damn sure that his younger co-stars in the movies since * Brasco * are not as charismatic as dork. By the way, none of that speaks very well about the Living-Legend Actor. Like his contemporary De Niro, Pacino has spent his last 10 or 15 years on his laurels. * Two for the Money * is the worst example yet, even worse than * Devil's Advocate *, who at least had the merit of having a naked Connie Nielsen and being chronologically ahead of this movie. Well, that happens if you are crowned too early - just ask Marlon Brando. I honestly saw one too many Al Pacino films with the same plot - and the same overreaction on the part of the star - to be even more charitable. Did I say "nothing speaks well"? Actually, it is humiliating for all involved, even for the paying public. Nobody will accuse Matthew McConaughey of being a Shakespearean actor, but even he does not deserve the second fiddle for this unbearable old show-off, with the added conclusion that he, McConaughey, will never keep up with the size. That's Al , <br /> <br /> I have not wasted any space on the plot details. If you want a summary, IMDb provides a simple summary, though I think I presented a fairly comprehensive summary in my introductory paragraph. Basically, you've already seen this movie before. Many times. The special milieu in "Two for the Money" is the dubious world (underworld, really) of sports disability. Pacino operates an office of "betting advisers" - intermediate distributors between you and your bookmaker - and even has a cable TV show hosted with some of its top guys. One thing the movie did right was the sloppiness of this kind of show. , , But one detail that they completely misunderstood was the constant use of the words "gambling" and "gambling." If you've ever seen ProLine or other similar shows, you'll NEVER hear Jim Feist and his cohorts say the word "gamble." They ask you to call the 1-900 number to receive their selection. , , But if you were from Mars, for example, you would not know what to do with these picks. "Gamble" is the F-word in sports handicapping TV shows - strictly prohibited. <br /> <br /> Gambling is against the law, you know. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars.
