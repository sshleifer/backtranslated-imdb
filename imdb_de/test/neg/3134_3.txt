Bardem is great. Actresses are great. But Amenabar did not have to do that. It's all right that he defends his position in euthanasia, an extremely sensitive issue. But to do so, he loses his sense: the film is a false insult to the intelligence, full of tricks and sometimes even extremely boring. Some scenes are promotional material, more than a movie. Women are incredibly attracted to this insane man who wants to make someone kill him without understanding the implications. He does not seem to care about anyone and thanks them for their care, love and attention. I think Amenabar might have made people think differently about this issue, but the way he chose it is not right, in my opinion. He could have made his point stronger without revealing the coin.
