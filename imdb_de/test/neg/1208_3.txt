This movie is the proverbial '80s movie that shows the viewer that he or she can try something better than the pros can be. The main character Doug showed his ability to fly a Cessna plane, which somehow meant the ability to fly an airplane and kill people. We all would like to have a few million dollars to play with ... maybe make a good investment, donate, buy some things, but the directors of this movie decided to make Iron Eagle ... not even ... not twice ... not even three times; Yes, four times. The thing to look forward to the most is the variety of Hollywood endings in this movie. Just when you think the movie ends after a cheesy ending sequence, there is another cheesy ending sequence. Then another. Definitely a movie that you have to watch to believe ... and maybe own your own to remember how awesome the 80s must have been.
