DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE! <br /> <br /> I had to see why all the critics are happy about this movie. I have seen it and still do not understand it. The plot is thin, very thin. After the movie was over, I still did not know what the main female character is called, and one of the two male characters did not even have a name in the credits, he is called a "farmer". I did not care about the characters, so I was not interested in the movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery and cinematography were brilliant, but the stuff of National Geographic or The Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
