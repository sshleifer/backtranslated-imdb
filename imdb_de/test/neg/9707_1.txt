If you have never heard of Jane Austen, saw the original movie or BBC adaptation of 1995, or even saw a pop-up version of the book, this vile attempt to show this classic love story may be considered fickle. <br /> The opening scene is reminiscent of this film because of its terrible acting, abusive abuses, and the lack of classic Jane Austen jokes. Whoever chose to cast actors (except for the distinguished Judi Dench), who obviously has never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read them, should be punished! Keira Knightley grins and grins through every scene and was so abominable that no one would marry her! Darcy looked like he was trying to remember his lines throughout the movie, and the rest of the Bennet girls were interchangeable because they did not portray their characters as they were originally written. This version could not be shown the right pride and prejudice that both Darcy and Elizabeth suffered, and at the end of the longest two hours of my life, it was important if they came together or not! Absolutely miserable - even the few minutes of Judi Dench can not save this garbage. I can not say anything good about this movie unless it finally ended!
