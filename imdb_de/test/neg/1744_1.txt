I recently got 8 ?? by watching this movie in the cinema. It was a waste of time and the only feeling of leaving the theater is a little bit sick of all the disgusting social pornography. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if it had a rather absurd twist, but it was not so terrible with maybe a scene or two to take out and make into very nice short films. <br /> <br /> Another thing I've been thinking about is the way the director uses all Finnish stereotypes as characters. It's quite extraordinary how, as a Finnish director, you can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality. It was sad to sit and hear the audience sit and laugh about things that they thought was a typical completion, but in general, it's just fun to make fun of people.
