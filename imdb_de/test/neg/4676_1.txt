The cast was Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare lost. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that this is trying to get Shakespeare into the masses, but why something so ruined. <br /> <br /> Is it because "The Scottish Play" is my favorite Shakespeare? I dont know. What I know is that a certain Rev Bowdler (hence Bowdlerization) tried something similar in the Victorian era. <br /> <br /> In other words, you can not improve perfection. <br /> <br /> I do not have to write anymore, but since I have to write at least ten lines of text (and English composition has never been my strength), I just have to go on and say that this movie, as the saying goes, it just does not cut.
