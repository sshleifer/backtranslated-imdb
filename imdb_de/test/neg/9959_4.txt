OK, I have now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror / suspense movies as I worked my way through various packs of 50 packs, and I have to say the guy had a limited choice, but he was good at what He was not Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. <br /> <br /> But the poor guy was in a sort of backwater ghetto of horror movies and was not good enough to take him to the next level of interest ... not with the thread-mature scripts and directing and Budgets under which he worked. That's the case here. <br /> <br /> This movie is for the most part slow, stocky and unexciting. The "heroine" is apparently a Rent-A-Center version of Judy Garland, the "hero" is bland as white rice and the poor guy who plays the monster does not even get a good transformational scene deal. His make-up effects are not scary at all - he looks like a slightly shabby version of a farm trader, is all. <br /> <br /> It's not a total waste. Zucco looks good in the camera, he chews the scenery and manages to hold some very affected and fictitious speeches without flinching or losing the flow. There are a few atmospheric black-and-white shots here and there that are not totally shitty. <br /> <br /> So all in all ... this movie helped some actors in the category "C" to "Z" to pay their rent for another month, and never dropped below a certain hacked quality level. Take a look at it, if you like George Zucco, or feel the need to see every Wolfman movie ever made.
