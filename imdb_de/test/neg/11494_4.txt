I have just read Forsyth's novel Icon. I thought it would be one of the most detailed and detailed books I've ever read, definitely in my top 10. I purchased a DVD version of the book with Mr. Swayze. OK, let me first point out that it would be impossible to do a decent adaptation of the novel in 2.5 hours of film time, so I understand the reasons for the teams to deviate from the book version and are different. However, if I say "differently" what I should actually say, take the figures from the book, add some, omit some, take away the plot of the book, add a modern new plot and paste somewhere around the name Frederick Forsyth. "I'm not saying that this was a bad picture, far from it, some of the effects were first-rate and acting was not half so bad, the story was bad and did not rely on logic or reality Forsyth's novel was so good and real, changing the facts of reality rather than exaggerating it, which could have meant much more if it had taken its time and turned into a 10-part series, if you did not read the book expect a decent TV movie with good actors.If you've read the book, try forgetting it when you see it.
