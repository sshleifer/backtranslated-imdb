Technically, this movie would have had it all: decent actors, beautiful scenery, no obvious budget, a celebrity like Richard Attenborough. The plot also sounded promising, suggesting a satire about stupid bureaucracy and ordinary people outsmarting it. <br /> <br /> however, it never delivers. The plot is just too illogical. Throughout the movie, not a single person does a sensible thing. crazy politicians, ridiculous soldiers, brain-dead villagers - all racing from one incredible situation to the next. What they all never make sense in a context beyond the current scene. <br /> <br /> Of course, this kind of movie has to be absurd and exaggerated. However, there should be at least one instance that points to the madness of dividing a city in the middle. In fact, there are (at least) two attempts that unfortunately fail: the main character, who apparently has no idea what's happening to him, and the "writer" who occasionally jokes for an audience that only consists of 12-year-olds , perceived as strange. <br /> <br /> What impressed me most is that the movie was trying to be funny all the time, but it did not make me laugh. I've seen several bad "funny" movies, but so far there have been at least two or three good laughs. In this sense, "Puckoon" is really remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie with a comparable storyline, look at "Brazil". Do not waste your time with "Puckoon".
