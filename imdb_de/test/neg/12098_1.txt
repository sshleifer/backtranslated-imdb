This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen. When I looked at the manga review in a magazine, I thought it might be interesting, but when I got the chapters, I realized it was utter stupidity. <br /> <br /> OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are OK. and the series have a standard. But as the plot progresses, it becomes completely incoherent. The series tries to show something mystical, based on the Christian mythologies, but it is a total stupidity. It contains some demons and stigmata scenes ... total nonsense. It seems that the series is trying to be deeply thought out, complex or mythologically overworked, but an observer with a little sense and cultural clues will soon realize that all these elements have no real meaning: THEY ARE ONLY IMPRESS THE IGNORANT WATCHERS! ! <br /> <br /> The final chapters are full of nonsensical elements: fights with kitten-eared demons, evidence of a supposed fight between demons and demons that control time (for no apparent reason). The finale is totally nonsense. an ignorant observer will see a floating finale that gives them a place to meditate; but the truth is the following: The final and the complete series is overall insufficient and inconspicuously inconspicuous.
