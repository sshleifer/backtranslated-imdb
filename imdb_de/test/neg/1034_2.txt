An ugly spinner who had three families, all betrayed and neglected, built ugly, useless buildings everywhere that are no longer esteemed and disintegrated. His half-Jewish bastard son walks around and interviews arbitrary Jewish elderly people who do not mind us, and shows his horrible narrative and writing skills while playing tragic piano music. This takes almost two boring hours and means nothing. <br /> <br /> Whatever you say, hippie people watching these stupid documentary films, eating salads and eating yoghurt, think all that crap is so important. It is not. Save the whales. Nobody cares.
