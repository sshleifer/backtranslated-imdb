I do not see this film properly understood for the first time 20 years after its release. Why was that such a big success in 1986? His amateurity drips from every scene. The jokes are lame and predictable. The sex scenes are exploitative and exaggerated (that does not mean that Miss Rudnik does not have nice tits!). The song is "terrible". The only really funny scene is the big shoot when the gangsters breakdance die, a feature that firmly dates the movie to the mid-eighties. It really is very puzzling to me how unable I am to realize what triggered the cheering audience's enthusiasm in 1986 (and apparently even today when I read the comments of my competitors).
