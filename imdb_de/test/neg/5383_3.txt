I like movies of different kinds and qualities. Whether it's a typical Hollywood action action movie or your Oscar tears joke, movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be fun for me. <br /> <br /> I just got confused in Soap Girl. First, we meet with Maya, a massage parlor worker who attracts all customers in the salon. A virgin poet named Harry comes in one day and they fall in love. After that, there are various twists and turns in the plot that seemingly lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> Although many have commented on the controversial issue of an Asian prostitute being exploited by the white man, one must remember this film was made by an Asian director who wanted to shed light on the subject. Whether he succeeds or not does not matter because it's about whether the movie is fun or not. <br /> <br /> For me, Soap Girl does not meet the standard I expect from movies. Given the loose plot and mediocre acting, I found it difficult to emotionally engage with this film. Worse, it seems the director wants to make a drama when the tone is more comedy. <br /> <br /> A movie like Soap Girl, which does not capture me in the magic of cinema, will always leave me bored. Throughout the film, I could not help but think, "What is it really about?" A movie must answer this question before it is created. If not, an empty impetus ends up at the end to captivate the audience. <br /> <br /> Note: D +. <br /> <br />
