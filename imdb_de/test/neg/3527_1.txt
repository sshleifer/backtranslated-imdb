"Nuts in May" could be one of the worst films I have ever seen. If Ed Wood was still alive, this would be the kind of movie he would do. To say that this film is bad would be the understatement of the century. But how bad is it really? Well, here are two levels where I'm bad. "It is so bad that it is good" or "It is so bad that it is GOD AWFUL". This movie falls in the last section. The little unintentional humor it has does not make up for the slow, hard-to-understand and boring majority of the movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Two middle-aged chaps Take a nature trip to visit R & R and camping. There they meet Ray, the upcoming Jim (I'll explain that later), whose tent is next to our main couple. During most of the movie, the two main attractions are on the beach, in a quarry and in other exciting places. Between these adventures they talk endlessly about the environment, about vegetarianism, collecting fossils, the duty of a real citizen and the right diet. Everything I want to see in a comedy. They endure anyone who will listen to them. The dialogue is not only bad, but the pace in some scenes is so slow that sometimes I feel like I'm losing weight. Scenes would go on forever and just when something builds up and something happens, the scene ends. Halfway through the movie, I thought, "Nothing will happen in this case, it's really a movie about nothing". <br /> <br /> The characters are annoying and constantly repeating things. In one part I had the feeling that the director was playing a cruel joke on his audience. The scene I am referring to is the "Sing Along" scene. In it, our two boring Britons play some of their music, actually it was always the same four lines. The idea was to get Ray to sing with them, but Ray, like us, knew they were the worst songwriters that man knows. This scene was not boring, as the song was played for the fifth time, I began to question the existence of a merciful God. Words can not describe the awfulness of this movie. The first thing you notice is the incomprehensible British accents that most of the cast has. Do you remember the thick Scottish accents in Trainspotting? Time that at 10 o'clock. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, our hugging, disconnected couples get into a fight with some of Ray's friends, who are completely disrespectful to the rules of camping. Our hero becomes so angry that it comes to a climate battle between our hero and the supreme Hellraiser. To settle their dispute, the two men lead a stick fight. That's right a stick fight! Now begins the uninspiring humor. I laughed so much at the inability that I thought, "That can make up for the other 80 minutes." After this hysterical battle, our hero walks behind some bushes to eject his eyes, and the other man calls Ray, calling him Jim for some unknown reason. <br /> <br /> and a character name changed 3/4 into the movie, Ed Wood would be proud. <br /> <br /> Although I had to endure the last 10 minutes, which in summary are done with a long pig. Why? who knows the hell Once we see a pig and the next moment the credits start to roll over the screen. One of the worst ends of one of the worst movies ever.
