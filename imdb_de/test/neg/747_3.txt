The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be ashamed if they want to hold this unfortunate production of the world. Acting, with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney, is at best amateurish and at worst painful painful. The costumes are exaggerated and have some really scary excesses - was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? Certainly EVERY woman in Bath in the early 19th century had no feathers in her headdress. The production values ​​are bad and the tempo of the movie makes it feel like it's being worked on hastily and awkwardly at the last minute. All in all, a torturous movie that I had to force myself to watch to the end. It's a shame because the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and filming locations. Compared to Emma Thompson's lofty "Sense and Sensibility" or the extraordinary production of "Pride and Prejudice" (1995) or the subtle intensity of "Persuasion" (1995), this production of "Northanger Abbey" has certainly shot Jane Austen in the grave.
