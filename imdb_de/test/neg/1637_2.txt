This was the second MST3K movie I've ever seen, and it still has a place in my heart as one of the most amusing horrible movie experiences you'll ever experience. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe (sp?) is in this case using his chiseled physique to obtain another payment for the mortgage of his condominium. He's stiff, wooden and unconvincing, but he still feels like a cool, sympathetic guy and at least he's photogenic. That's the only decency I can find about the movie, so I thought I'd get it out of the way. The fact that he is in the movie adds another point to the score and saves him from being a "1 in 10". <br /> <br /> In no particular order are examples of how bad this movie is composed: <br /> <br /> 1) OK, the clone of Tanya Roberts (Mila) is looking for the ends of the earth Ator which takes three minutes, including the time she died of a poisoned arrow in her shoulder (which, in my opinion, would have slowed her down a bit). Ator heals her and takes his loyal help Thong and heads back to her castle ... and takes the next 50 minutes of the film to conquer the bottom that Mila has crossed in 3 minutes. How does this work??? I know that the intrepid crew gets bothered on the way back by magical forces and enemies, etc., but still ...! <br /> <br /> 2) Obviously the author / director felt the need to add "depth". to the film by adding an ongoing debate / Socratic dialogue / game with 20 questions between Zor (the middle John Saxon Wannabe) and the wise Akronas (the Richard Harris Wannabe). But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical training from Hallmark cards, T-shirts and bumper stickers, and he does not understand tempo, tempo or timing ... and the actors either. (Crows remark during one of these exchanges is the marker line for my entry). The scenes with these two continue to move, bringing the film to a standstill and killing all the momentum and excitement created by the swordplay and quests of the heroic trio. <br /> <br /> 3) As soon as Ator arrives at the castle (and is conquered) it goes even further downhill. Zor decides to feed a number of female victims, along with Ator and Mila, to the serpent god he holds in his basement. This scene had some potential for excitement, so the director immediately eliminates this potential by reviving the scene with all the drama of the people on the DMV to pay their traffic fines. Ator continues to wage a great fight with the snake, which is hardly more convincing than the fight of Bela Lugosi with the rubber octopus doll in "Bride Of The Monster". <br /> <br /> 4) The climate scene, where Ator invents the dragon of twigs and animal skins, is so stupid that the viewer is completely blown out of the movie and you can roll on the floor. Laugh until your sides hurt. <br /> <br /> 5) Oh, yes, and the filmmakers decided, in the end, to take stock of an atomic explosion with the moral that Ator has decided to destroy the "atomic nucleus" McGuffin, who is driving the film for humankind was not finished. ("Zzzzip! MESSAGE COMING IN !!!") Just like "Bride Of The Monster" think again. All it took was a bystander who observed, "They have changed into God's domain." <br /> <br /> 6) For some reason, the version of the movie I've seen has introductory and closing homoerotic credit sequences that absolutely have NOTHING to do with anyone or anything else in the movie. I have no idea where this footage came from, but it's actually worse than the actual movie it posts. <br /> <br /> Check this out only if you are a big fan of Miles or if you like the material of the MST3K skewers.
