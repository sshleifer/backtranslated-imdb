Well, I was hoping I'd heard wrongly about this movie because I'm a big fan of Ruggero Deodato and really did not want him slipping. But unfortunately, this supernatural charge in Giallo style is just as bad as I had thought before - and that's pretty awful! The plot does not work at all, as the movie tries to mix murders and a supernatural theme over a phone, and it all feels very forced and stupid. Moreover, the plot makes no sense, and you have to ask yourself several times throughout the movie, "What's the point?" The plot focuses on a young woman living in a block of flats and being terrorized by a telephone. The best thing about the film is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful English actress Charlotte Lewis, and unfortunately the good points pretty much stop. There are a handful of death scenes, some of which are bloody; But everyone is incredibly stupid. The one in which someone is killed by coins stands out especially in this regard. Overall, I really do not recommend this. Non-Deodato fans are probably not impressed, and Deodato fans are likely to find the movie depressing. Avoid!
