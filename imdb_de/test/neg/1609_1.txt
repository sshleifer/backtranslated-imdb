I start by saying that I really like action movies (military or other). I am a guy. But this filth was terrible. I saw it for free, Showtime or hbo and still feel like I've paid too much. It was a longer episode of the public hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1 just because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. How or why would 59 others score between 5 and 6? Unless they are all a cast or crew family. <br /> <br /> It could be that this movie was so bad that many came out ....... and as such were too uninvested. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry repetition, but the minimum of 10 lines seems stupid, for what essentially comes down to a warning ......... in the hopes of others 2- Save that hour hole, this movie shows. Trust me, stare at a blank wall, they'll be more action.
