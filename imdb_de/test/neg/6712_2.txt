Why on earth are five Americans repeating this? The title actually says it all: the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you have never heard of and that does not remember anything. <br /> <br /> You will see a ninety minute change of location, most of which will later be blown up in the movie. Right at the beginning, you'll see a beautiful little farm typical of the Berry, which is being relocated in the film near Paris, but does not survive the "transport" to the Isle de France: it explodes 1 minute later. There are also two gangsters who have no tongue, as if that makes sense in the world of SMS and the Internet, not to mention pencil and paper. <br /> <br /> It just goes on, nothing makes sense history. The cameraman has only my approval, the camera is excellent.
