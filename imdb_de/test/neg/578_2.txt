The divorced single mother in a picturesque coastal town finds an anonymous love letter and lets her put her dormant love life into action. Pet Project for actress / co-producer Kate Capshaw, which offers a warm, beautifully modulated lead performance, but this story is so slender and the direction and cut so unpredictable that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in friends giving her the love letter read an interesting visual joke, but the first person with whom they do this trick is Ellen DeGeneres, who plays no lesbian, but because of this gimmick comes as such. In the hope that one would stay, different ideas are fueled, and the continuity is extremely choppy. Supporting the cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who mostly plays shirtless) is very good, but they can not save the final act, which is disappointing. Restrained, in a quirky, pleasant way, but it's good-natured, nothing more. ** 1/2 of ****
