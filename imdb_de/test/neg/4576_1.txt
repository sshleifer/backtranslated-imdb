I looked at "Passion of Mind" because I usually get a kick out of the genre of alternative reality romance, like For example, "sliding doors," "me, me, me," etc. <br /> <br /> But this was the worst I've ever seen! I had to force myself to prevail. I have not even left the credits, which is unknown to me. <br /> <br /> The magical realism was missing completely because Demi Moore was grim and the lovers she played twice were guys who usually play villains, though every style was somehow appealing and appealing. <br /> <br /> There was indeed a psychological explanation for the double life of a vile freak of the Elektra complex; Maybe the spell should not be explained for this genre to work. <br /> <br /> (originally written on May 28, 2000)
