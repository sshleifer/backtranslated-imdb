The only thing I found at the sight of this movie was to hear Star Wars through the wall of the cinema (yes, I'm going to a really bad movie theater). This movie is so stupefyingly bad that I would rather scratch my eyes out of a cat than look at it again. <br /> <br /> Let's compare it to the original. One is charming, funny, exciting, well-played and one of the best movies ever made. The other is so weird that you can only hope your eyeballs fall out, so you do not have to watch anymore. I'm sorry that Christina Ricci is a good actress, but I can not compare her to Hailley Mills, and I can not be persuaded to start Doug E. Doug in a first part of the amazing and absolutely charming Dean Jones. Dean Jones's miniscule part in the new version is the only part that goes into the movie, and it's the only reason I can justify a 1-star rating (also because the imdb has no negative aspects).
