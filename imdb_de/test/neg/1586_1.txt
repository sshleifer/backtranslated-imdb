I caught that on Cinemax very late at night ... nothing else, so I had pretty much no choice. Conclusion, terrible plot, slow, waste of good movie and actor time. In short, do not even bother about it. It is a pity that we can not give zeros as a rating. that really is not even worth considering !!!
