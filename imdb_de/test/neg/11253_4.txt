First of all, I am critical of this film because I really had high hopes and instead shit this movie. <br /> <br /> * possible spoilers * (if you have not seen the TV series) Where should I start? ? Well, let's start with the quality. The film was barely better than the original TV series and the two fight scenes were beautifully designed. The CGI was terrible though. <br /> <br /> Then there are the storylines and questions left after the movie. This film does not close as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe called the FMA, and only returns to expand the universe until we have no choice but to decipher what will happen in the future would. <br /> <br /> And then there are the biggest mistakes of the stories. Add WWII and Hitler ... WHY? The series was perfect ... and did not need Hitler. It did not even take Germany. <br /> <br /> Overall, the whole movie was painful in some kind of FMA movie, and if I were the directors, I would exterminate CoS and do one more "end," end.
