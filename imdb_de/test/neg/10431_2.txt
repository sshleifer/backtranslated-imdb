Plodding, maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue was at a snail's pace. All characters are one dimension, with one exception. Unfortunately, this character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this cliche, which is drawn for two hours. Growing up in the seventies, this film lacks detail, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, a person who should recognize a sharp dialogue and a consistent narration in a script. Cameron Richardson is the only element that illuminates this film. Robin Trower's music is also a welcome addition.
