Snakes on a Train is a movie I rented for the pure entertainment of my thoughts about the movie. Snakes on a Plane was an entertaining action movie, so the filmmakers obviously wanted to make the effort to succeed with this low budget. In 85 minutes, Snakes on a Train is almost unbearable. I had to pause the movie over and over again to talk because there were no events in the movie. Throughout the film's duration, it's never fully explained why this girl has this curse or why she's constantly having to cough this green / purple swarm. Not only that, there are endless boring dialogues of the two main characters, Brujo and Alma, discussing how to get rid of the curse. I appreciate the low budget filmmaking. I'm not picky in movies, I'm open to any genre or budget, but Snakes On A Train is truly one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Were the authors on Acid or something at the end of this movie? Why did the woman suddenly become a giant snake? and most of all, how on earth could the train be devoured? <br /> <br /> Conclusion. Snakes on a Train is a movie that must be avoided at all costs. Do not be as fascinated as I am by the title, this is a movie that is seriously bad. Let's calm down these snakes. <br /> <br /> 0/10
