Why do people make bad movies? Did not know that someone who worked on the picture knew that what they were doing made no sense? There is something about this image that scared me off, apart from the fact that I acted this "film" as unrealistic, pathetic and pathetic. I admire them for trying, but the "actors" in the film sometimes seem to be trying, and no single character has substance or says something moderately intelligent. This movie earns zero stars. But I did not have that option, so she gets a 1.
