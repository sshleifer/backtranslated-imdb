My jaw dropped so much that I watched this streak, I have bruises. Okay, admittedly, I really did not expect the quality of the Others, or even the thirteen ghosts (the new one that was just awful and still head and shoulders above this madness) to prevail. Someone else noticed the thin signs ... I would not call them "skinny". "Thin" means there may be something in it. How would it almost not exist? In no particular order we have: The girl who will scream; The American who will find out everything; The macho guy who combs everything until he's killed: the wise black man who will die early; The extra type that is there to die first; The extra woman who is there to play hard. That's it. This is your character list and that's what they are and what they stay from start to finish. If they were "thin," they could change a little bit from beginning to end. But they do not do it. Okay, okay, the American decides that he will end up with the field work and the Screaming Girl returns to wherever she comes from. That's the change. Otherwise, they all act according to their assigned roles and rarely reveal real emotions when they finally meet the threat. <br /> <br /> Well, the producers are getting props for an original threat, I'll say. I understood that the story would be "trembling," but with ants instead of giant worms. I appreciate the author: these are very cool, very scary ants, and what they do with bones is excellent. (At the first appearance of the "Bone sucker" I admit that I jumped a few steps high.) Unfortunately, the very cool concept quickly becomes "Alien in the Desert". We get a lot of comments about ants that may or may not be true, but we do not get much of the mythology on which the threat is based. And we get every monster movie cliché that's ever been made. People go to places that they know they should not and if they have no compelling reason. Moronic characters try to hinder and die for our heroes. A character has a dual role as a "scientist who does not want to kill the monster but wants to study it". A very cool gadget is just introduced so the American can tell everyone about ants. I hope everyone knows it anyway. Then the gadget is broken. Our heroes have one thing that can keep the threat at bay. And then there's the last, annoying moment when we know the threat is still with us - wondering exactly what and how the hero or heroine came to do it. Everything that has gone before becomes completely useless and wrong. Three stars for the cool use of ants and bones. Nothing for clichés, chunky dialogues and muted pear signs.
