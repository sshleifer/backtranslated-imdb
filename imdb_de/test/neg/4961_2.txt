With my two stars, I'll probably make it to the head of IMDb, "hated it" list for this seemingly hugely popular TV series. Not least because of the enthusiastic comments on this site, I opted for a DVD edition of the Because I usually find British humor to myself, I gave it up in the middle of the second part and according to other comments, the "funniest" bits were already through /> <br /> Now, according to another comment, I know that but then I had to laugh like crazy while watching (and watching again) Fawlty Towers, to which Black Books belongs, albeit weakly thematically related.Why the different reactions? It can be a mere generation of things and yet the differences can be shown. <br /> <br /> Both Fawlty Towers and Black Books are located in companies that are intended to financially support their owners eide companies are not successful, but it seems? through a miracle ?? To survive. Fawlty Towers is funny because the protagonists have to cope with situations they can not handle. The joke lies in the fact that they are seriously trying to be successful, and while they are laughing, they are also sorry. Black Books has no situations, it's just there and the owner spends his time regretting himself. When a situation threatens, it is quickly wiped away. It is remarkable how fast and how often a motive is dropped and the protagonists turn to something completely different to create an extra joke. Telling jokes ?? and not very good - seems to be all black books. Why a bookstore? A hardware store would have done the job just as well. <br /> <br /> No, stop, wait. It is a bookstore, for under the veneer of coarseness, vulgarity and arrogance the protagonists should be tender and cultivated. They are not simple gorillas, but hobbling semi-intellectual losers. Hey, they are like you and me. The way the series claims it is the only way I can explain its success. The behavior of the protagonist is nothing special. The special thing about them are their economically unrealistic living conditions, which many viewers may envy. That protagonists who are narcissistic and vapid convey a sense of belonging and society seems to be a hallmark of the times in which the First World is currently living. <br /> <br /> Recently I saw Tittybangbang, a fairly new British TV comedy. I thought it was really funny. It is often quite tasteless or xenophobic? but always with a definite purpose and with a slap in the black in his social criticism. The humor is mainly created by situations or by characters with a specific purpose. The bad reviews in IMDb might indicate that this kind of humor is not up to date, but I'm glad she's still alive and hopefully going on.
