THE OTHER is a supposed "horror" movie shot in the 70's. It should not be confused with the similarly titled THE OTHERS, in which Nicole Kidman played along. <br /> <br /> The plot looks like this: A woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin sons what is simply referred to as a "game." One of those twins - Niles - is said to be "good." The other - Holland - should be angry. <br /> <br /> The idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the film has been adapted from a novel.I can only hope that the novel was interesting since the film is from start to finish The performance of this film is very similar to a TV movie as seen on Channel 5 in the UK It actually looks like the movie was made for the TV channel in the afternoon. A slight cut for one or two scenes, and this would be a Disney-style underground movie, but even the youngest kids are bored rather than scared by THE OTHER. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be the resume's one Watch director to recognize That horror is not his strength. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mulligan relies heavily on the characters to push the story. This is obvious from the beginning. I have not seen any of his other films, but TO KILLING A MOCKINGBIRD is a highly acclaimed thriller on this site. Unfortunately, THE OTHER has too little to do with the characters, and the plodding script ensures that the movie never takes off as one would expect. <br /> <br /> The direction is as bland as you might find. Almost every scene plays during the day! Think about it - a scene taken during the day in the open countryside of rural America with the camera focusing on a wide area. Does it sound scary or atmospheric? Believe me, that's not it. It looks more like an episode of LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE than a horror movie. And yes, both the aforementioned TV series and THE OTHER were filmed in California. <br /> <br /> There is a noticeable lack of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise quite pointless. <br /> <br /> The end should clearly be very disturbing and perhaps influence that of another movie from that time. I will not say which movie, but I'll give two clues - a little boy was a main character and the movie is known. And I add that the concept was used much more effectively in the latter film. <br /> <br /> The acting is actually pretty good and is the only reason why I have awarded 2 stars. The actors playing the twin boys and the actress playing the grandmother are all struggling with the poor material they receive. Diana Muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as mother of the twin boys. Do not be fooled by their high billing on the cast list. She gets little time on screen, and her presence only acts as a trick to take advantage of her long-time television career to attract television viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid close attention to the rattling at the show back of the DVD cover (the Region 2 version in the UK). Comparisons were made with THE EXORCIST, which I considered a complete insult to this film. There is no comparison. THE EXORCIST had everything that this film should contain, but not - excitement, suspense, humorous humor, extremely disconcerting content, great acting, outstanding characterization, and audience interaction. Ironically, THE EXORCIST was made just a year later, but in terms of style and execution, it seems decades before the bland drama known as THE OTHERS. THE OTHER looks like a work that would have been tame in the fifties in the '70s! The 1970s was a great era for horror movies with classics like THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN and THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE LEGEND OF HELLENHAUS, SALEM'S LOT, to name but a few. That's why THE OTHER proves even more disappointing. <br /> <br /> If anyone finds the summary of THE OTHER interesting, he may want to read the book or find out a bit more about what this book was about. I would advise anyone to skip the movie.
