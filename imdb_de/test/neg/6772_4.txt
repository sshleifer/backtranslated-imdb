Danny I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> He always makes the same mistakes and is no longer interesting to look at. At first, I could feel myself as an addict. My heart went out at the beginning and at some point he crossed the line. It's almost as if he's going to continue this behavior to keep the show going while severely jeopardizing his life and the well-being of his family, especially his children. It is difficult to feel sorry for the poor boy himself. I think he has to see this show, maybe he might have a chance to save this marriage. I can not understand how Gretchen stays with him, and I always wonder how much is for the show and how much love there is. Danny, make a living - a new one, that's it! ... and not with Dr. Let Gary begin. What about him and his face? His skin looks like it's stretched to the max. Apart from that, appearance does not mean anything, but it does not seem to be particularly impartial. I think he, too, upholds this for his own money gain, and often not in the best interest of Gretchen or Danny. These people are few confused and everyone reminds me of a dog that tracks its tail. sad, very sad. Come on, pull yourself together.
