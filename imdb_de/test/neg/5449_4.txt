Congo is another multi-million dollar adaptation of Crichton's works. Like Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, etc., the film raped the book of its true meaning and nature. I'll make that short and to the point. The landscape is beautiful. The actors, that's the best they can. The Screenplay Try to fill hundreds of pages in a one-and-a-half hour movie. They end up messing up, but how clean is that which matters, and the Congo falls somewhere under it. There were some stupid moments, why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava? And Amy, educated by humans, surrounded by humans, can intimidate dozens of killer monkeys in their environment? What kind of reason is that? Which brings me to it. If there was an annoying character in every film, Amy counts to one here. You see, Amy is this naive little monkey who can talk to a special backpack and harness strapping her on. Nice idea, but it gets annoying after she has been listening for a while, as she has spoken. The Congo is worth a trip and not regrettable, but certainly not a memorable movie.
