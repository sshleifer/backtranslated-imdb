I've never seen the original movie that others commented on. So my perspective relates to this film without comparison. <br /> <br /> I found the message of the film as :: if you are only worried about yourself, everything will be alright with the world, everything will go together, your lovers will love you more, your friends will become it Respect and as you do more, your employers will want you more, pay more and even your own children and parents will love you more. <br /> <br /> I find this message reprehensible and completely wrong. <br /> <br /> A big praise for the very funny birth scene at the end; There is no mother who will not laugh in this scene. <br /> <br /> All in all a very disappointing movie presentation. I did not root for someone in this movie. I thought they were all pathetic, selfish individuals who just did not care what happened to them, and that's not a movie people want to see.
