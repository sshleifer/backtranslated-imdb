The film begins with a fateful fight in which three bandits are quickly shot down by a bounty hunter - a bounty hunter who carries more than a superficial appearance to the unnamed Clint Eastwood trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS FOR FOR FEWW) DOLLARS MORE AND THE GOOD BAD AND UGLY). Immediately afterwards you see this man in a gold train filled with Union soldiers. Of course, the cargo is attacked and the soldiers fight like blind guys, so they are quickly neutralized. In one turn one of the bandits cheats the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and rides away with the gold. Soon Roland picks up and wants to find out where the gold is hidden. But at that very moment, the army appears and kills the traitor ... crap. The would-be man without a name, however, says Roland knows about the treasure and maybe a medallion that Roland got from the traitor holds the key. A strange banker is also thrown into the mix. All three want the gold and all three seem to be a pretty macho. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a very eye-catching western. Much is the plot, some of it is that George Hilton (a Uruguayan despite the American-sounding name) is not as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other western stars of spaghetti, but most of the reason is that the soundtrack is just crap. Often, the music does not come close to acting and seems to be added almost by accident. Besides, it's just not that good. This is clearly not the work of Ennio Morricone - the music master of the spaghetti genre. <br /> <br /> All in all, just a passerby - and not very good.
