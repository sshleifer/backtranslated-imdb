A group of people go deep into the jungle for various reasons and eventually find a lost city (where, apparently, the diamonds of King Solomon are) and a race of super-gorillas ... Well, you know you're in trouble, If you make money actors like Linney and Curry in a movie that plays stars ... a talking gorilla, and that's just the beginning. Okay, what else ...? <br /> <br /> For an action / adventure movie, the movie is ... well, that's what's missing. In the first hour (!) Of the movie, they are not even in the jungle. They're just trying to get there, with subplots for subplot (anything about a local military regime or whatever), and when they finally do ... it's just no more fun. <br /> <br /> The effects of the movie are just so and so (and really bad compared to the previous Jurassic Park movie). <br /> <br /> Now the end. The father does not care about the death of his son, but is only interested in the diamonds? Uh-huh ... only in the movies, only in the movies. <br /> <br /> A complete talent trash is this Chricton adaptation (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER). 10.2.
