My wife and I have seen this movie because we want to visit Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately), the landscape and the marine landscape (complete with tuna) are the only credible members of this cast. We expected a decent, well-written and well-made film, but were disappointed. Its only redeeming grace is a vast and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity: thrashing tuna, nets, wooden boats with long oars and passionate, though superstitious fishermen. <br /> <br /> The sequencing of the film is fantastic, its dialogue stilted, and the acting ranges from stiff to totally over-the-top. A scene in which Bergman points out that her macho, native and naive husband, is putting his ferret on an "innocent" (but seemingly deceased) hare would be a perfect shotgun for a Monty Python sketch. The volcano was blowing, we hoped to a pitiless end to suffering (ours and that of Casts). Unfortunately, the film flutters on and finally ends in a melodramatic and absurd end. If you are not interested in old-style tuna fishing, you should pass this hokey effort.
