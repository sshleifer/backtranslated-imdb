This is one of those fundamentalist Christian films that beat you like a sledgehammer with religion over your head. You know that you are in trouble when the story is completely ridiculous. Three men fly to Mexico to deliver Bibles. That makes no sense, because the church is Protestant and most Mexicans are Catholic. Protestant and Catholic Bibles are not the same. The Catholic Bible has books that are not in the Protestant Bible. It is also hard for me to believe that churches in Mexico would not distribute Bibles. I can understand if they are going to a place where Christianity is in the minority. But Mexico is far-fetched. If you can not believe building a story, then do not do the rest of the story. A movie about religion can be entertaining, but not this movie.
