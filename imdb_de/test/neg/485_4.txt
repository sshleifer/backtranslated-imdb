This is better than the early Cronenberg horror movies, but nothing more than your basic what-is-real story. The video game theme has also been told before. There is nothing original left, except for the weird Cronenberg atmosphere (which is not that strong here) with the amusing sexual references and Shore's dark score. History never gets your full attention. It only flows forward from event to event with boring tempo. Rating 4/10.
