First of all, I'm a gay man, although I do not live my life in the so-called "community", and because of such movies, gay movies are not my favorite genre, because 90% of them are crap. Like this one. If I could give this a zero, I would. (I do not understand all the positive comments, unless they were all made by people who made this movie.) I actually stopped this after 24 minutes when the so-called "Anthony" kissed Adam outside the restaurant for no reason. And how does the son steal out of the diner if he does not even live in the city? Cable transmissions? The spectacle was HORRENDOUS! The sound processing? (Listen to "Anthony" and Adam as they sit on the fence eating their lunch, and each time the camera switches between the two so-called actors, the sound changes as if there were no filter on the microphone God forbids to buy this movie. Horrible Horrible Horrible acting and just a stupid story.
