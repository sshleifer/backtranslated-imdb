This is a movie that was probably made to teach middle school kids. Maybe it's funny for them, maybe they even see something weird in it. For me the acting is bad and the plot is bad, the adult viewer has no value at all. I saw this movie as weak and boring. Sometimes there was a chance that the movie would be interesting, but it was never really realized. The creatures look pretty good, but after seeing them for a few seconds, they seem to have no substance other than the look. Sometimes I was not sure if the movie was trying another attempt at comedy, or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again. This movie was just not good for me.
