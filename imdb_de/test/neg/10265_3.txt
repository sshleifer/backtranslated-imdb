(Corrupt more than likely ... nothing really important that you could not find out for yourself) Yes, it's really funny. I rented it to a blockbuster for the reason that there was absolutely NO description of the movie on the back of the box, just a list of the bands that contained songs. But after that I had some time to find it, even here in IMDB. I've always confused it with "Night of the Demons," but basically it's the same thing. <br /> <br /> What I loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage. This black athlete was as funny as he was screaming all the time. Even if screaming was not really necessary, he had a "HEARING NOW !! DOORS WITH CARS !!!!" and so they would drive cars in other cars. But then he got balls and a zombie with a broomstick, I think. The other part that somehow got me excited was the part of the boys falling off the buildings that the girl did not want to come over. What was it? Why was it there? Why did the movie end with a guy breaking the TV in a studio? I saw a zombie running on the screen, but it was somehow far away. I mean, he could just turn off the TV. Yes, this movie was shot on a whim and yes, I hated it. Nice day...
