From the beginning of this movie, with "The Lost Boys," the opening sequence, the bad wire, and the end of the dialogue, this movie has been slowing down at a snail's pace. "The Covenant" was highly recommended by a few colleagues whom I am absolutely convinced have joked about me. At least I hope that was the intention and her taste is not so bad! This movie did not last much more than an hour and a half, but it lasted much longer. The story was so basic that it could be summarized in a maximum of 15 minutes. At least they might have filled the rest of the movie with entertaining magic or fight scenes, but someone (maybe the director, but I do not know if anyone really "directed" this movie) decided it would be filled with some poorly executed " artistic "camera shots and nonsensical scenes of the" boys "who swim and get into bar fight. About half way through the movie, I thought maybe it would be more fun to hit my head against a wall, and partly to free myself from that awful dirty feeling I had if I kept watching it. , So I hit my head against a wall and it was more fun than in the movie! I watched it to the bitter end, hoping that it would ultimately be more fun. No, my efforts were rewarded with "How about if I make you my Whee-Aytch!" I vomited and felt embarrassed for the scriptwriter and sorry for the poor actor who had to deliver this jerk. Acting really was not as bad as other reviewers seemed to believe, but even the most talented Thespian could not save this work and it worked on my nerves! I give films a chance, even bad, because they usually provide some form of enjoyment, and this was not the worst movie I've ever seen. After it was over, I felt like seeing the movie "Stealth" again, and WOW, it was so much better this time! Oh yeah case study, do not worry about this movie, really. Watch a few episodes of "Charmed" and watch "The Lost Boys" after drinking a decent amount of alcohol, and you'll be a much better person. If you fall into the same trap as me and see "The Covenant," be sure to keep all sharp objects away from yourself. You will thank me for it.
