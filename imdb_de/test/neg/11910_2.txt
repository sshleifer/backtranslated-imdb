Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His appearances on Days Of Wine And Roses, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Missing (to name the first ones that come to my mind), were all worthy of the Best Actor nomination. His only victory was Save The Tiger, and that's a shame. He becomes melancholy for a science, but never reconciles it with the driver in his character. Towards the end of his career, he made a similar note with Glengarry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, the wonderful side-work of Jack Gilford as a partner of Lemmon and Thayer David as arsonist is nothing, since the rest of the script is a jumbled mess of clich√©, fear and neurotic nostalgia and senseless moralization. Worth seeing once as a time capsule in the experimental direction of 1970 by Avildsen.
