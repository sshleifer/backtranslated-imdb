Well, that was a waste of Dave McKean's talents, was not it? Do not get me wrong: When it comes to graphic design, maybe Dave McKean is the best in the world. The layered, textured look he can achieve with a few pencil lines on rough paper makes the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher look as if they were: Hackwork. McKean has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics, movies and even magazine advertisements, borrowing the unmistakable collage effect he has done. <br /> <br /> But this movie? It's garbage. Complete garbage. Unfortunately, the story of Neil Gaiman is exactly what Gaiman has been telling us since he first demolished Clive Barker: a pseudo-mythical, overblown, dreamscape populated by characters, titles in All Capital Letters have names. Everything is allegory, to the point that it is impossible to get human drama, emotions or empathy from anyone. People make succinct postulations and speak in riddles reminiscent of how Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead would have sounded if Tom Stoppard had suffered a debilitating stroke in the midst of his composition. Really, Gaiman, overcome yourself. You are not a prophet. You are a poser. <br /> <br /> McKean's direction does not help - his tempo is bad, it takes half an hour to really recover for the main picaresque plot, and then just a separate sequence of events, none of which had any weight. The monsters pose no threat because they are not anticipated and simply thrown on the screen. The story is not about us because the rancid little protagonists do not really care about us. Half of the dialogues murmured in shirt fronts and ubiquitous masks is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Some of the visuals are pretty and I'm sure the fanboys will lick it. Pity. Think about the amount of really good work McKean could have done if he had not stuck to this lame project. <br /> <br /> Note: D / D
