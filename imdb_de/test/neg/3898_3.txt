I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his garbage films, but almost every time I see one of them, I just see missed opportunities and conspiracies that do not perform well. This movie is not different. The film certainly had a lot of potential as Franco blended the intriguing theme of the classic movie "The Most Dangerous Game" with his usual kind of trashy sleaze, but the plot here is too often lost and it takes forever for Franco to become the main point of the movie to get. Since this is a later Franco movie, you may be forgiven for thinking that the director would have been better, but in fact I've found that the opposite is true. because this and the terrible "Killer Barbys" are two of his worst movies. The storyline focuses on a stripper and her devious friend. The couple is invited to a private island by a wealthy woman and her lover. However, they soon discover that they were not invited for social reasons when they were "released" on the island, so the rich woman and her friends can follow her to the sport! <br /> <br /> What fascinated me about this movie was the cover picture and the fact that it was directed by the King of Sleaze Flicks. One might think that I would be pleased that the film shows a wealth of sex scenes and general dizziness. but I'm not The reason is mostly that the sex life and the sleaze in the movie are really boring and most of the time only served to give me the condition known as "itchy fast forward finger". However, my tendency to go all the way through made it necessary for me to summarize it. There was a time when I did not think Girl-on-Girl might be boring, but I've proven wrong since then. The only positive effect I can get from the movie is that the soundtrack is quite catchy, despite stupid foreign pop music. actually fits well into the sex scenes. I enjoyed the last ten minutes. when the plot finally started, but it was too late and unfortunately this is a very dull movie. By and large, I only recommend this movie to those who feel they have to watch all 180+ Franco films. Everyone else should check out Vampyros Lesbos, Faceless or She Killed in Ecstasy.
