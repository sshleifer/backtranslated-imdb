Hubie - like Stanley the Troll of Bloods A troll in Central Park - lacks the spark of personality as the main character who wears a whole movie. We should like him because he is nice, but that's all he is. <br /> <br /> His character design is unappealing. The top of his head is a kind of dome, narrower than the chubby lower half of his head. <br /> <br /> And penguins should not have teeth. I know that Iago, the parrot in Aladdin, had teeth, but maybe that worked because he made him look similar to his voice actor Gilbert Gottfried. Hubie looks funny with his small voice (provided by Martin Short) with this large group of Chompern in his beak. <br /> <br /> Tim Curry, who is usually evil, somehow makes a dizzy surfer-dude accent as a villain (possibly a good voice for a comic accomplice, not for the allegedly threatening main villain). <br /> <br /> The entire storyline revolves around the love of the hero and the villain for the female penguin Marina. Who is as boring as his two candidates. Worst of all is the pace. We have to use the villain again and again to see him again threatening Marina - this time in dialogue, this time in the song ... <br /> <br /> Barry Manilow may be a great songwriter, but in Animated films like this and Thumbelina, his songs feel limp and listless - especially the ballads. The only song I liked was the song "Good Ship Misery" from the 1930s. <br /> <br /> I read that the publisher in this film made some cuts against the filmmaker's wishes, which could have caused some problems - although I suspect the real problem is that they will not cut the rest to have;).
