Do not get me wrong, the guy is a dynamo of success, but he has reached the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats. I get a little annoyed when he sees comic fans as an extension of the same market. <br /> <br /> You see, "The Invincible Iron Man" would not be bad if it were pitched on a Saturday morning and geared exclusively towards unnoticed children. However, it is not aimed exclusively at children. The characters of the periphery are killed every five minutes, and there are enough bloodshed and half-naked bodies to squirm the network censors, making it unsuitable for children's television. <br /> <br /> So what's the goal of this video? then? It is the audience that enjoys an almost understandable story about the revival of a tyrannical Chinese emperor with 5 arcane rings. And I think the audience is restrictively small. <br /> <br /> Many great writers have been through Marvel's leathery yoni over the decades. It is a pity, therefore, that Marvel risks his expensive animation investment for so many questionable storytellers and scribes, who, like Mr. Arad, are more used to selling action figures on the Saturday morning cartoons. How many lukewarm receptions does Marvel have to endure before developing a better strategy? <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> Animation: Walk-in cels only, some segments are better than others, a solid budget looks consistently - this is not a bakshi (Ralph) and it's not Bluth (Don)! CG animation is fine, but not impressive. <br /> <br /> Story: A litany of clich√©s, everywhere, confused, invented and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Characters: So why Rhodes? even here, if all he does is contributing to Stark's sexual ambiguity? Hmmm ... her father is in a wheelchair ... Tony misses his mother ... Asian chicks are hot and apparently little else; The female lead is thoroughly objectified by the end of the feature. <br /> <br /> Performances: I can not blame competent speakers for a bad script. <br /> <br /> Art: very western muscles, very clean lines, faces are very much derived from Eastern art, very boring mats, very boring CG. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Not great, but worth it for fans and those who like superhero myths. A must for collectors. A valuable "what not to do" course for junior animators.
