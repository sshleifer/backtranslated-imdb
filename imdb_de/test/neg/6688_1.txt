Undoubtedly one of the most racist prejudices I've ever seen. The prejudices are fought against Hayden Panettiere, as she has to move into a hard inner city school. She is constantly referred to as "white girl" and because of their color other bows. First of all, would that be the reverse if a black girl was the abuser? and secondly, the stereotyping of the ethnic children of the inner-city school is a shame. The writers' desire to show that they were "hip" did not seem to overlook the fact that the inner city school wins the cheerleading competition, not by talent, but by intimidating their white opponents !! These overtones of film have brought him from the expected direction of a harmless, light-hearted comedy suitable for a family audience in a vehicle that demands nothing from any of the participants. Hayden Panettiere has star quality, but I would be surprised if the rest of the class ever progresses. All in all, an unfriendly movie that was a waste of time.
