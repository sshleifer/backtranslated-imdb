It is tempting to view this film as a daring avant-garde experiment. I like to think that the director has been trying to see if it's possible to use all the conventions of comedy film and produce something that's totally, totally, totally out of shape. <br /> <br /> From Venus "is a definite" yes. "This may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but my brain seems to have shattered all memories of the others, this horrible streak just floats on the border: so bad that the thought still causes pain, but not so bad that my internal censors wiped it out of my mind The director and the performers believed that they did it when they did it or why They had done it and released it as soon as they did, I doubt that anyone involved could have made much money, but surely they could have raised enough money to buy all the prints and burn them. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is nothing to be recommended it is not even pleasantly bad it is just a non-film where nothing interesting happens I thought seriously about it to take it back and reclaim my money, which I've never done before. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about renting this terrible one (much less to buy!). Movie!
