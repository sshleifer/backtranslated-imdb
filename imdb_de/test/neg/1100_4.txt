Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as "zombies") is a rare find. A movie that promises one thing but delivers another. It is one of the few genre films made by Millennium Pictures, a European film studio known for various B-class action films and thrillers, some of which are starring action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. Karen Tuna and her two daughters Sarah and Emma arrive in Addytown, Pennsylvania, to move into a large house owned by Karen's deceased husband after finding a miner in his effects. Once they arrive, they realize that the house is very old and in need of repair. But the condition of the house is the least of their problems, as they discover that the area tends to disappear and Karen is confronted with the owner of the area and orders the move. As night falls, the tunnys learn the reason for the scrapping: a group of zombie children who died in a mine collapse more than 85 years ago kill everything that goes in the woods. With the help of a neighbor, Karen tries to stop the curse before her and her children become the next victims. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD and was expecting a movie with carnivorous zombies, but was disappointed One thing: The movie is more like a ghost story than your usual zombie movie, with the dead children the embodiment of a curse haunting the forest and avenging everything that moves at night (though the internal logic is something). Children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals and repelled by the bloodwatchers at the doors in the same way as Vampires are repelled by garlic and mirrors. Are not these kids zombies?). The plot itself would not be a problem and would be entertaining, but the main problem is that the producers have adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie movie just to face it with this effort. <br /> <br /> As such, a movie like this would be fine as a ghost story, but it's no more than a routine because of a bad script. The greatest strength of the film is the acting, with the performers perform better than the film deserves. Of particular note is Scout Taylor-Compton, who does her job pretty well? It's a shame she's ruining her genre reputation with a very poor performance in the HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe it's just Rob Zombie's script).
