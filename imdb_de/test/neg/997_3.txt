Writer and director Robert Downey, a pioneering underground film movement pioneer in the 1960s, mocked the advertising world of New York Madison Avenue with its avant-garde comedy "Putney Swope." Downey does not limit his ridicule to advertising, but deals with black militant culture, the dynamics in Hollywood's racial representation, the white elite power structure and the nature of corruption in any power struggle. As bold and ambitious as "Putney Swope" wants to be, it's a horrible movie made amateurish in a shoe-string budget with no-name cast and humor without cheerfulness. Everything about this film smells of improvisation. "Putney Swope" sparked controversy on its first release because it did not deal politically with race issues and consumer culture. As in most Marx Brothers films, the plot is thin and an excuse for Downey's anecdotal gags, most of them horrible. The chairman of a prestigious Madison Avenue advertising agency dies during a board meeting. Before the body is removed, the board makes a secret poll to determine who will replace it. Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for themselves. A pure accident happens when everyone votes for the black member called Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), because nobody thought anyone would make an election for him. Swope pink pulls everyone out to one of the white executives, surrounds himself with black pistol-wrapped employees, and renames the company "truth and soul promotion." Swope decides to change the face of American advertising. He rejects the acceptance of customers whose products are alcohol, tobacco or war toys. Swope's clients experience an exodus after being named CEO, and Grand Outstanding attracts a new clientele who pops up in his office, carries purses and is ready to be abused by Swope militants. Swope also takes advantage of his African-American staff to ruthlessly use their ideas after firing them and conjuring up a series of offensive advertising campaigns, all of which are referred to as a "new wave" of marketing genius. Incredibly, Swope's conservatism is proving successful, but the agency is becoming the target of government officials arguing that Swope's promotional tactics pose "a threat to national security." The highlight of this 85-minute black-and-white comedy is the color television commercial. Unfortunately, Downey does not know when to cut off those ads that start consistently from the beginning but interfere with their greeting. The funniest part of "Putney Swope" involves handling our eponymous protagonist with US President Mimeo in Washington DC (Pepi Hermine), a marijuana toking with a Kissinger-style Teutonic adviser (Larry Wolf) while trying to swop to convince an advertising campaign for his new car, the Borman 6.
