What can you say about a movie in whose funny episode a fat man wrestles a garden hose? The acting, especially that of the lead man Jerry O'Connel, is embarrassing. The dialogue is so thoughtful and inglorious that you shudder. The control idea is actually not a bad idea for this genre (infantile teen comedy), but somehow the director manages to make the least of it. I rate it with 2 out of 10 points.
