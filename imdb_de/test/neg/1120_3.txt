Sorry Randy. I love your comedy, but in this case, you've really put a 'Golden Turkey' egg. <br /> <br /> The plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin that looked more woody than a giant redwood and I think the direction did not exist. <br /> <br /> There certainly seemed to be some pathetic attempts to launch other films, Jaws and European Vacation, to name but two. <br /> <br /> If the memory is right Eric Idle played the same kind of character in Nat Lamp European Vacation, but much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo have been approached to make this sequel. If so, they knew exactly what they were doing when they refused their roles. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Chevy and Beverley in their roles can not do better than the Griswolds and Randy Quaid, who have admirably supplemented them in the past. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid should have left National Lampoon while he was ahead.
