Fred "The Hammer" Williamson delivers another cheap produced movie. He might have set a new standard. Look for the painfully obvious special effect mortar cannons visible on the street during a chase scene. You do not just see it once, you see it several times. Search for the blur that was recorded in a scene and the cameraman tries to correct it while the scene continues. Take a look at a group and make your own Mystery Science Theater!
