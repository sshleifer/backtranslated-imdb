that's a terrible movie. it is dumb over. First, the twins are only interested in what they look like and what boys they like. You are in 7th grade. not to say that I'm a prude or something, but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. Being pretty and popular is not everything. But that's what the twins make out. The plot is even worse. The girl's grandfather happens to be the ambassador (France). He has a co-worker who leads the girls around Paris, and they meet two "sweet French boys" on motorcycles. They set off to meet the guys they really love, ETC ... They meet a supermodel who's in the process and walk around Paris with completely strangers who they think are cute. do I have to say more? This movie can be cute for 8- and 9-year-olds. The twins play stupid losers who want to have friends. It makes the wrong idea to girls. The movie itself is not great either. I can not recommend that to anyone. I give paris 2/10 the pass
