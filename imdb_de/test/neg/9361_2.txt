A woman finds herself caught in a seemingly unexplained suicide outburst. Are these really suicides? It seems like a ghost is at stake. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair hiding his face, and he moves with his head or arms twisted in one way or another, creating a very strange look. Recurring themed music plays in unexpected places to announce the arrival of the Spirit, and bizarre sound effects resembling the sound of small twigs being caught always accompany this hapless spirit. Is anything known? Well, if you've seen some Asian horror movies in the last 10 years, then it should be. This film, heavy and blatantly borrowing from The Ring, One Last Call, and some other horror hits, is trying to bring an uninteresting and worn action to a climax, but we've seen it all before. Avoid it if you are not desperate or have not seen other Asian horror movies in the last 10 years.
