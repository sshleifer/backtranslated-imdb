The director seems to be a good, solid man. His parents are struggling with the same problems we all deal with. They have moved away from each other. They loved each other. You got it wrong. And the poor public must sit for ninety minutes over the potential difficulties and hardships of one of the most boring families ever to travel on Long Island. <br /> <br /> There are few interesting options in this documentary - the music is banal, filming is not imaginative and the story is the same story that takes place in every birch street in every city in america. I do not want to sound too harsh - rarely was a sweet, well-intentioned documentary made. The director is a kind of man you want to be friends with. They only wish he had had so much trouble presenting the material as his parents did to keep their marriage alive.
