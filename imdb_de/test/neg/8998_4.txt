This movie is a treat if you love poverty, public domain movies from the first half of the 20th century or a fan of amateur film. The film combines public domain thrillers with newly shot scenes in which the "actors" (with the exception of Redfield, who is nearly dead on Lugosi, all "performers" are simply terrible!) Trying to interact with the movie stock footage The "new" material is covered with digitally added film scratches, as well as the already inferior old material (?? !!). As far as I can find out, the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers gathered on an island for will reading (?). This film, while having a creative premise, such as "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid," is a technical and creative wreck. In a terribly long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes a failed trip to 'Fog Island', whatever that is! The "flashback" then interweaves incoherently old material from completely different eras and of completely different film quality. Independent scenes from "The Lost World" (1925), The Most Dangerous Game (1932), White Zombie (1932), Bela Lugosi meets a Brooklyn gorilla (1952) and a few other poverty lines. This happens through an incredibly bad voice, which seems to have too much room echo, as if the sound had been recorded with a cheap home video camera. <br /> <br /> The "filmmakers" seem to believe that they pay homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving the names of the famous actors (Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc.) and so on. This tactic has been made wise, as well as in 'Final Destination', here it is just uncomfortable! Bizarre and painless listless jokes about Spiderman, Dracula and Superman abound. Even the old dirt 'Dewey, Cheetam and Howe' lawyer is used here - this was old and tired when The Three Stooges matched scene by scene used in the 1930s, and Lugosi uses dozens of different sources. The finale effect is that he seems to be getting older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger, and older by the minute. Oddly enough, the movie did not use this as a comedy subplot and squandered a good chance for comedy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it was great fun to see this late night in bed. Maybe they wanted that too!
