"Season on the Brink" is one of my favorite books of all time - a revealing, relentless look on Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite promoters of all time. That's why I especially looked at this adaptation. <br /> <br /> It was disappointing on every level. Denny's performance was less than inspiring and he did not seem prepared to play Knight - as if he had just taken the role shortly before the shoot. The rest of the cast is not much better. <br /> <br /> And it was obvious that this was ESPN's first movie. It was poorly managed, poorly filmed, and the lack of budget was evident when games were simulated (smaller gymnasiums, empty seats, etc.). Skip this adjustment and read the book.
