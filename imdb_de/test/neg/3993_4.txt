I had always watched the Italian horror troupe Dario Argento as a producer with some suspicion, and this was only confirmed after I had recently seen Lamberto Bava's dreadful DEMONS (1985); The fact that this should be the third part did not sound promising, but I decided to borrow the film, even though we are now in full swing. I watched the movie trailer on the Anchor Bay DVD before I looked at the main feature. The undeniable striking visuals had mesmerized me, but then the movie was right (which does not make more sense than what is shown in this frenzied two-minute montage, and in retrospect you can see that he has put most of his highlights together) , An absolute failure! <br /> <br /> With a medieval prologue straight from Alexander NEVSKY (1938) promising enough, it goes downhill quickly, because he puts too much on surreal images at the expense of the story. As a result, several characters are randomly in focus. the unbearable male leadership succumbed to the dark forces early on, the sinister-looking bishop (Feodor Chaliapin) led to a mere red herring, the mysterious black priest gradually took on heroic qualities, and the lead actress was for some reason captured by a goat. formed demon (culminating in a sexual rite that took place before the other cultists all too obviously overturned by ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]) and a reasonably impressive 13-year-old Asia Argento as a rebellious but sympathetic daughter of the soprano (the daughter of Oracle occurs only survivor in the end). Incidentally, the older Argento co-wrote alongside director Soavi also the film history and the script of the film and (under a pseudonym, after they had obviously reflected with Dario in the early stages of production), original helper Lamberto Bava and the rich genre writer Dardano Sacchetti (den I met at the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004). <br /> <br /> The extremely confused second half of the film then sees a group of people? These include the inevitable teens, but also a stupid English couple (whose constant quarrels are given an amusing, evil punchline)? trapped in a building closed by evil spirits (the church is the burial ground of a satanic cult) - not that this horror outing could destroy the memories of Luis Bunuel's surrealist surrealism (1962), see! In the end, the movie is all the more disappointing (though at least Sergio Stivaletti's cruel effects are notable), assuming I had thoroughly enjoyed the only other Soavi title I had seen? CEMETERY MAN (1994), which I own on the R2 SE DVD. I would still like to see his debut film? STAGE FRIGHT (1987)? and the successor to the director of THE CHURCH entitled THE SECT (1991) ...
