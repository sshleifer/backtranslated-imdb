This mess starts with a real tank driving over a car and images of a toy tank being displayed. This is followed by a family who goes home from a birthday party without saying anything. The inexplicable tank and the untaleable family take, I swear, over 10 minutes of film. Eventually, the family sees a car after it's in a wreck and decides to report it to the authorities, only to find that the city's citizens are all hiding in their homes and the police are hiding in the police station. Interesting? Nearly. When the urban population comes out due to the family's presence, we learn that both the author and the publisher conspire to replace tension with unintelligible narrative techniques, in the hope that the audience's inability to tell the story will somehow plague the audience becomes unwell. , and it works! ... but not as they expected. I was very uneasy about how bad this movie was, but I was not scared at all. The dialogue consists of things that make little sense. Not in a fun way, like David Lynch, but a kind of I-in-the-middle-of-a-boring conversation. Over the next lesson, we learn that the filmmakers are trying to scare us by doing boring, secular scenes in combination with the above "What's up?" Type scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot involves something of the kind of gentle-looking old folks who trance children into a trance by the power of Satan and then take them to a party to play with toys and even more a sinister one Intent, and it's up to a group of white men (all white in the movie) to grab their arms and save the day, and a woman whining with a day-to-day eye candy boy. They search for the abducted children by searching for random places and screaming the names of the children. <br /> <br /> This is a great horror movie for anyone who has never seen a horror movie, because this person is scared only by the fear of Satanism, Paganism, Wiccan or even Catholicism due to a lifelong brainwashing diet from the Trinity Broadcast Network. This portrays Satanism as older people wearing candlelit Halloween costumes, while mingling at an Ankh party. Stuffed with a priest who expresses himself over Satanists while calling them "witches". The message that anything that is not Protestant can be placed in the same category for easy sentencing. <br /> <br /> About 30 minutes of footage has been wasted on showing mediocre older actors who are awkwardly babbling, over-stimulated pseudo-satanic gibberish enough to make a teenager blush Goth, almost always in Olde English and sometimes in Latin that can be words or not. Highlights include a guy who laughs at the idea of ​​little green men for a solid 3 minutes staring at a family out of the windows of their car without speaking for 10 minutes while they take the elevator Muzak listened. A priest who studied Satanism for 4 minutes, with such eerie drawings of demons to frighten the crowd of the Church Lady. Random pictures of dolls. Random pictures of children. Paint instead of blood at every opportunity. Dream sequences at the film school level. Introduces unimportant characters who do nothing before quitting. Sometimes they seem like the nothing they do is a big deal. <br /> <br /> The director is sloppy at best. One example of directing is a scene in the beginning where a man and a woman kiss and the man pulls back to look her eyes lovingly in her eyes, and some dark red paint falls on her cheek. When they look up, they see that it is not blood, but droplets from the snow cone of a girl. Snowcones are ice and colored / flavored water and would not have produced droplets of the same texture as color, let alone the fact that their Snowcone was a bright reddish orange. Certainly with Hackney writing, but made worse by the bad direction. An alternate view of the man, woman, and girl follows, showing that she is about a meter away from them, so the snow cone would not have dripped onto the woman, even if she had her snow cone over the woman's face. Keep it up, Editor! Acting is of course blah. The spectacle of the entire cast could be put on a scale perfectly matched between overacting and underacting. <br /> <br /> The most offensive technique of the director is to give the actors no motivation and then go out as an incessant eye for lunch from the camera lessons, while the actors make a fool of themselves. And finally, we finally come to an end that would have been great if it had been handled by knowledgeable people, not Jerry Falwell.
