A vehicle for Michael Caine. It's pretty well written and there's some OK acting in it, but really, it's a mess - not funny enough, not scary enough. It's a flaccid, modern cockney thriller. <br /> <br /> I like the premise - that even in the broken moral hinterland of East London people are doing the right things. A surprising result for the first real fight Caines old school, Billy Shiner, has promoted the inflammation of his paranoia. In the second half of the film, he chases Shadow to deal with the disappointment of the outcome of the first film. <br /> <br /> My biggest disappointment was that director John Irvin had failed to make better use of the relationship between Shiner and his lieutenant / branch replacement Frank Harper. Harper's, a British Tom Sizemore, understands his role well, while his surroundings seem to have ignored him. Pity. 4.10
