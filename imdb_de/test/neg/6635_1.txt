Yes, the voices are in. This movie may be the plan 9 from outer space for our generation. While Ed Wood's film, despite all its shortcomings, still has a certain charm, the film defines the word "charmless" to some degree. In fact, I would suggest to the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary to cite this film as a key example that defines this word in the next update of the dictionary. Carrot Top is a performer of this kind Abyssal abilities, which are usually rational people I know, as soon as they hear his name, become murderers out to kill Mr. Top as fast as possible. If you go to Amazon.com and look at the customer ratings for Carrot Top's Film and other Performance DVDs, you'll find some that could be interpreted as death threats to Mr. Top. Another curious person I remember that Mike Nelson, chief writer of MST 3000, said in his book Mike's Mega Cheese about good and bad films he saw this movie and soon afterwards he could not remember anything, not even titles , Obviously Mike had a classic reaction to a trauma. The reputation of this cruelty was so mentally stunned that Mike Nelson had to banish it from his head. (Apparently, Mike Nelson found his memory of this film in a later chapter of his book, and Mike Nelson was definitely not grateful for the recovered memory because of his review.) <br /> <br /> The only comment I offer about the film And it's not a spoiler, it's just God's honest truth, it's not funny. None of that is even a nanosecond funny.
