I saw this movie when I was in France and I have to say that it confused me. It's the story of a jewel thief and a young singer who both land in Morocco, meet and connect. Simple enough? Well, the problem is that this is the kind of movie that really happened in the chronology (the movie is not played completely in sequence) or in reality (that's what I just saw, or was it just a dream?). Given these parameters and the bilingual movie, it was really hard to follow, and I was not sure what happened in the end. I can imagine that some deep, artistic types could understand this movie better than me, and it may take more than one viewing to understand.
