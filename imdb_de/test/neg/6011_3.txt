I did not succeed in reading Hemingway in college. From what I could say, he offered reducing stories with his reductionivist words. This film-making of AF2A into a simplified, cruel, confused narrative does not call my suspicions into question: a guy who sees little action on the European battlefield (Hudson) meets a nurse (Jones), and they devour themselves, to spend some time together. Hemingway's great contribution to the story was the romantic travelogue? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They are so absolutely generic. The film never brings the complete irresponsibility necessary to leave the front in favor of a lover. The two have a season in the Alps, directly from the catalog of J. Crew. A number of better scenes are undermined elsewhere by a trite, conventional melodrama. The film is stacked with tiny, unlikely, nonspecific details that fight epic treatment. The cavern hospital where Miss Barkley works is virtually empty, so no secondary line of action could possibly distract from the weak main story. It is not complicated. <br /> <br /> The camera works better than average and offers amazing location shots. Director Charles Vidor (or perhaps Huston?) In the first hour with an on-location widescreen camera makes conspicuous things ... There are no Zweitausr√ºster. Vidor shows huge observation boards with panoramic views of several hundred soldiers marching through the mountains; and then his camera with a 90-degree swing of the Hudson ambulance on him. <br /> <br /> Hudson looks good. He is a better actor than he deserves, but with unformed material like this he can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays a one-dimensional blunder. Jennifer Jones is swollen and suspicious in the lackluster female lead. The movie is best when it is not on the screen. The love scenes are similar to a coffee pot.
