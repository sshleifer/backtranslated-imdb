Today, Asian horror movies are among the best in the world, known for their atmosphere and reflection of today's society. This is not one of these films! Instead, "The Record" is a mediocre slasher movie that comes largely from American films like "I Know What You Last Last Summer" and "Scream". The plot is familiar - five teenagers accidentally commit a terrible crime, but cover it up and swear to secrecy. One year later, they are followed by a knife maniac (with the subtly invisible disguise of a sterile hospital mask and an orange jumpsuit). It does not help that the teens are a generally unlikely group (this is one of those movies in which the murderer's motives seem quite reasonable) and there are many stupid storylines to keep the story going. The direction of the film is unremarkable, more influenced by MTV than current Asian horror movies (like "The Ring"). The last third of the movie is not too bad and provides some decent suspense scenes, though in the end there will probably be one "turn" too many. 4.10
