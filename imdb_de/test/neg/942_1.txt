I see absolutely nothing funny - even from a distance Funny - in this stupid movie. An unrealistic, stupid, ridiculous idea - just completely ridiculous. Hard to believe that the main character, who appears so articulate, intelligent and imaginative, would not be admitted to college. Even more difficult to believe is that nobody has closed the place. The actors portrayed characters directly from Characterville. We have often seen in many films. Nothing new here. I found it on late night TV, and since there really was nothing else, I watched the whole boring, stupid movie. What a total waste. If you're a teenager, you might find it amusing. Movies are made for an immature mind, so teenagers, do it. The rest by no means.
