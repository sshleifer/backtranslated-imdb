Right after I saw the first one, it's very stupid. I first watched an episode of Bones and then the eleventh hour. The 11th hour should be embarrassing. <br /> <br /> It is so weak. Stewart introduces himself as a government scientist. No mention of what a scientist is only general knowledge. In a cloning program, they bring a caretaker, who was paid to dispose of unsuccessful embryos, into a church and let him kneel in front of the statue of Jesus on the cross and ask forgiveness ... and also tell where the villain is like the act can move. Well, that's science at work: (<br /> <br /> There is a stupid, not good stupid bit, in which Picard rages in front of a TV, the skin cries that makes you look younger and "It's one The awesome female assistant is being sought by the local bobbier next door. <br /> <br /> The end of the first episode is like a bad caricature in which the evil old lady named after Pinnochio's daddy died driving plague action, Picard beckons from the street as she gets into a taxi Picard is up one floor and he looks wistfully out of the window ... she's gone, he might try to run down ... or maybe call the police or maybe you'll get the number of the taxi and call or maybe have something other than ... I wave and get into a taxi now and there's nothing you can do about it until next week ends. .. mahhahahahah. <br /> Pity it so stupid is it: At one point, Picard is convinced by a grieving father that even if a replica clone son is born, he would never be his son, since his son has a soul. Pretty good people. The general scientist opposes cloning because every soul is unique and is sure why you want to clone something else. <br /> <br /> Although the general scientist Picard finds cloning a bit sticky, he is ready for stem cell research and goes so far as to allow catastrophes to hit humanity if that's not allowed. He has a pretty screaming critique about how important it is. Of course, he does not mention a single example. This style summarizes the show. Buzz words and carousel.
