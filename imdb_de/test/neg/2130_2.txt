This cheap strip of exploitation is something really bland, made by spaghetti land director Lamberto Bava, who has cleverly left his name on the trash. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this excursion is the discovery of some brutally mutilated people washed ashore in the Caribbean. The authorities initially believe that they are victims of shark attacks, but when the investigation turns out, it turns out that this is much more sinister. <br /> <br /> All of this is ultimately very small, but we have here - bad synchronization Complemented by a similarly weak font, which often consists of nonsensical jabbering and for the most part is really of little importance. Acting can only be described as sub-par, which in this case is self-evident for the course. Really relaxed direction does not help either. <br /> <br /> The special effect is mainly that numerous close-ups of various bloody body limbs are missing and so on. Of course, there is the obligatory creature, which appears at regular intervals to the feeding time. It looks like a big monster octopus thing whose animation consists only of pointed teeth that ascend and descend in rhythmic articulation. All in all, the end result is by no means convincing, sure, but almost entertaining in a kitschy way. <br /> <br /> It seems that the filmmakers were a kind of low-rent hybrid mix of Jaws and Piranha, but the final product is just a bloody mess, much like the corpses that are shown in this picture all the time. It's hard for me to think of any redeeming qualities that justify looking at it, and therefore strictly for incurable monster movie addicts.
