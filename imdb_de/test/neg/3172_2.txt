Stephen Gyllenhaal (director) tried to make a weird but serious film about the art of marijuana breeding, and a few bong rips had a good movie. While the cast is nothing short of amazing, it's extremely difficult to survive this movie. The acting of Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillipe, Jon Bon Jovi, Hank Azaria and Kelly Lynch could not even save this film from failure. It would be wiser to flush three single dollar bills down the toilet and then check this movie at the local video store. <br /> <br />
