Relentless like one of those loud action movies. The entire cast seems to be on tempo. I did not quite understand the intentions of the director. I wonder if she has ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure please! This is a damn mess and I loved Abba. The costumes, the unflattering photography - unflattering to the actors, but loving the locations. No chemistry with their friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman movie, and you'll understand what I was hoping for. I was especially embarrassed by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience seemed to enjoy it, so it's probably just me.
