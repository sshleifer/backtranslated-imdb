I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time. The title, the star and the desert have always fascinated me, but for some (now quite clear) reason, this movie is never shown on TV or I miss it if it's ever shown. Well, after watching the DVD, I now know why the movie is rarely shown because it's not that good. In fact, I would say it's pretty much a mess. <br /> <br /> ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was made by a first director and that shows. The film consists mainly of a series of vignettes that hold absolutely nothing together. Rather like a collection of short films that are randomly strung together. The film can be reduced to: intro (murder); Policeman and girlfriend together; Intro credits; Policemen go to work; crazy guy tells story; Policeman finds corpse; Policeman and boss and girlfriend at the bar; Chase; etc. The scenes just do not go together. They are very independent of each other and therefore the characterization is weak and borderline. The scene at the bar with the girlfriend, the scene on the farm with the hippies, the scene with Big John and the chief shouting at each other were worthy. I almost stopped the movie during those (terrible) moments. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker's lack of experience is evident throughout the movie. The style can be found everywhere on the map, as in the 70s. The intro credit scene makes the movie look like a law enforcement spot. Then it tries to be a buddy movie (Big John and Zipper), then a murder mystery; then a melodramatic love story; etc. A movie does not have to have a certain style to be successful, but I'm afraid the style in ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was confused. You can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete catastrophe. While the content of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is almost amateurish, it is extremely (and deceptively) professional. The cinematography is stunning. Each frame deserves an exhibition in an art gallery. Or because the first (and last) director was involved in the music business and deserves an album cover. The beautiful look of the film gives the end product more credibility than it really deserves. And thanks to Robert Blake's play (of a really badly written character), the movie retains some realism, even if nothing else makes much sense. The special thing about the look and composition of the film is that it has been copied and copied millions of times. The intro credits reminded me of something like TOP GUN, made 13 years later. Scenes of Johnny dressing his clothes on the bed reminded me of the American gigolo. Strangely enough, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has a very modern feel due to its impressive look, even though the story and the underlying philosophy are hopelessly outdated. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, a remarkably undervalued and overlooked film because it obviously influenced many future filmmakers in terms of looks and composition. Few films claim to have achieved this, and legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall should receive full recognition. On the other hand, EGIB is also rightly forgotten because of the poor characters, the confusing story and the confused direction, which is worth nothing to remember.
