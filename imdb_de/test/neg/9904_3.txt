What's this!! it is so bad. The animation looks so terrible, it looks like a PS1 game. The actors are terrible, they just can not act to save their lives. I sat through the whole movie and in the end I was upset when I realized that I had wasted 3 hours of my life. I have not heard about this movie, did it ever appear in the cinema or did it go straight to DVD? A girl was shot?! What's up, it was just a stupid movie. You have completely copied 'The Day After Tomorrow'. It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would definitely recommend people not to waste their time with it. You could spend your time looking at The Day After Tomorrow, it's much better. Well, I think about the movie. Why did I actually waste my time writing about it? It really annoys me, it's now 3 hours and 10 minutes wasted.
