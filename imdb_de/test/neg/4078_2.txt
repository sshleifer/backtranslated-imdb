This movie is definitely with the worst movies I've ever seen, probably in my top 5 worst movies. I laughed once and that was when: EVAN: "I'm building something" Evan's Secretary: "I hope it's a barber shop" <br /> <br /> That was literally the only time I laughed in this " Comedy, "terrible compared to Bruce Almighty, who was not even that great as a Jim Carrey fan! <br /> <br /> There was a lack of humor in this film to have God's powers, and it was more about family bonding. I would call it just a family movie, definitely not a family comedy. <br /> <br /> Seeing a bird droppings on someone's shirt is not funny, not even a beard that grows right back! <br /> <br /> I did not think the special effects were great, the animals It looked like you saw a movie that had not been glued together properly. <br /> <br /> 2/10 film - avoid!
