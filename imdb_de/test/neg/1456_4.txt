Have you ever tried some kind of food that your friend made, and then said to yourself, "Wow, that was not a good mix"? Well, that's how I felt after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Many viewers will feel very uncomfortable with this weird mixture of crime and very, very stupid comedy. It's almost as if I see Mr. Rogers playing a reckless gangster, very funny. Some things just do not mix and this movie clearly proves that. <br /> <br /> There are some very good performances here, as Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are all excellent, but that does not matter for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film. Jonathan Demme has done an excellent job in films like Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but does not seem to be in his element with this film.
