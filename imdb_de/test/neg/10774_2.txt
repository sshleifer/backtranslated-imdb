I tried to watch this movie, but I did not make it in the first 15 minutes. It is a terrible disappointment to think of the cast but I can not ignore the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the actors posing as Indians are not even close. Considering that India alone has one-sixth of the world's population and one of the largest film industries, I do not think filmmakers would have found it hard to find an excellent Indian actress to play the role. And I am not saying this because of a blind patriotism, but because it is absolutely and completely absurd for a non-Indian to play the role of an Indian / Pakistani. Now, some people say, 'as long as she's convinced who's interested?' but my point is that she is NOT convincing and never can - not because of her acting skills but because of her ethnicity. As good as an actor like Tom Hanks may be, he will never be able to play Australian Aboriginal dialogue in English. It destroys both the mood and any semblance of authenticity. If the same movie was shot in native languages ​​(Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles, this might have been an excellent movie. Unfortunately, from today's point of view, I would not recommend anyone apart from film students who want to do "What not to do" in films.
