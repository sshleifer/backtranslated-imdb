I tried twice to see it, though I could not see through either of the two episodes. For me, it's basically not funny. I can tell where to laugh, but I can not. I have never seen the original, so I do not compare it. I also love comedies, including comedies like Married ... With Children and Family Guy. The jokes are lame and flat, and acting is usually annoying. Advertising made it interesting, but it is not. They try too hard to be different and try to force the humor. This style does not usually work so well. I do not think this show ends the season. Of course I could be wrong.
