Well, I think I finally saw my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the paper and saw this movie with the expectation of a good Woody Allen experience (as I've often had in the past). Well, that was not the case. This movie has nothing to offer. Despite the wonderful performance of the talented Sean Penn, this movie failed. One of the features of his other films is several characters - varied, witty dialogues. This movie basically consisted of only one character - very one-dimensional. It was almost no laugh. It probably looked good on paper! I think the only thing that was special was the performance of Samantha Morton. Now I will search for her films in the future. In conclusion, this movie was a big disappointment. >
