This film was embarrassing in its clich√©s, bad behavior and generally low production values. It starts off badly with the long-haired 3-star general, who calls the hero Masters "Major" when he obviously wears the lieutenant-colonel's silver oak leaves. Most worrying, however, was the crew of the soldiers on the Neptune Atoll. How can you deal with any kind of reality? They were all experts in flying a 747, and the scenes of the soldiers digging the ditch were more than funny. SEE ON YOUR OWN PERIL!
