The opening scene keeps me from absolute zero. I wish the whole movie was as pithy and real as the intro. <br /> <br /> A lot can be forgiven for enjoying some movies (hand-blown pistols with 60 strokes, heroes with superhuman powers, all women) are beautiful and half-naked), but Puuuuleeese this "attack on my intelligence 13" is so far-fetched that I'm surprised that the cast for a second day of shooting has turned up being a cop? Based on stupidity, I think. How do the female protagonists justify being half naked in the middle of winter in Detroit or wherever? In fact, no character reacts to the elements of this movie. No windows, no electricity (which miraculously returns unexplained) during the storm of the century and they are all comfortable as beetles in a carpet. What technology is there that disables all phones, radios and brain functions. This must be the same force that causes Maria Bella to step out of her disabled autoknie deep in the snow without fur and barely a gown.
