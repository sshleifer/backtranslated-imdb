Leaning on novels by Earl Derr Biggers, 20th Century Fox's Charlie Chan series was a crowd pleaser - but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the studio feared the audience would turn against its Asian hero. This was a miscalculation: actor Sidney Toler took on the role of Monogram Studios in "Poverty Dispute", in which he portrayed the character in eleven other films between 1944 and his death in 1947. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox The Chan films were considered cheap "B" movies, but the studio was very concerned about them: the actions were often stupid, but the pace was sharp, the Dialogues witty and the casts (played by Bela Lugosi) and Ray Milland) always expert. The result was a friendly charm that has stood the test of time. The monogram was another matter: Chan movies were "B" movies that were plain and simple. With scripts or cast, little care was taken and the resulting films were flat at best, mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a fair cast and some interesting plot arrangements, THE SHANGHAI COBRA is one of the best of the Monogram-made Chan films - but it still barely manages to be consistent mediocrity. In this special post, Chan (Sidney Toler) is asked to investigate a killer who kills with a seemingly cobra-like bite; At the same time, he decides to ensure that a state-owned radium stock that comes from a vault remains secure. Are these two seemingly disjointed plotting lines coming together? Well ... could be! Sidney Toler is always a pleasure as Chan, but most of his Monogram performances seemed to be "called" - and that's the same with COBRA as with any Monogram Chan movie. As always, Mantan Mooreland is the truly enjoyable artist. The changing times have made us consider Moreland's comedy brand humiliating to African Americans, but he was a seasoned actor and comic, and in the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s, his work has a tremendous amount Charm innocence. <br /> <br /> Fans of the 20th Century Fox series are likely to find Monogram's Chan disappointing and newbies who like the Monogram films are likely to classify them as third-rate after seeing the Fox movies. Like other Monogram Chan films, THE SHANGHAI COBRA is best left to determined collectors. Four stars, and that's generous. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
