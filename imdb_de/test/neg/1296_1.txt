I was impressed by the terrible acting and script for this film. All characters seem to have been immobilized by personal themes - more like deer in the spotlight. They wiggle and moan about their feelings when decisive action needs to be taken. I saw myself yelling at the TV when I tried to wake her up for her situation and do something! The plotline is not plausible. Each time a major decision has to be made by a protagonist, one of the other people must address all the issues with the obvious decision, as if it further complicates the decision - it is a mature melodramatic trick and just wants to make you groan Importing the decision is obvious - you do not have to treat the audience as idiots. Overall, there is simply too much emotional melodrama throughout the movie.
