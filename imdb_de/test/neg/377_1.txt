Really clumsy script, and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer, who had agreed to be in it. <br /> <br /> I actually left the theater after about 15-20 minutes and demanded my money back. Actually, I only went out of a movie 3 times in my life (I'm 43 years old) and this is the only one who made me insane enough to reclaim my ticket price. If I had, I would have received a refund for the popcorn. This was a really lousy movie and there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> How can someone who has been educated as a pre-tech barbarian learn DRIVE A AUTO? In California!!!? (Driving a car is a tricky skill, and tricks in California ... I should know, I live there.)
