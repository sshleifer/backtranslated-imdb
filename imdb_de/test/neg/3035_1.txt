This movie really misses the target on most fronts. The accents are ridiculously weak, the acting moods and the comedy at best weak. <br /> <br /> You have a great idea that has been particularly enjoyable for the reasons mentioned above. <br /> <The writer seems to think that putting the word f * ck in every sentence makes it funnier and the main character just seems to be a bit too hard. He's not a brick top, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> Next time, get at least one cast that retains the accent for the entire movie. <br /> <br /> It's a crime to compare this with movies like this The Store, Lock Stock and Snatch.
