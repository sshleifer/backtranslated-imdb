I never found out what was the attraction of Karen Black. She always had those pearly eyes and a strange look around her. She often seemed eccentric or "different" woman. In this case she is the psychic counselor and expert on occultism for a lousy producer of bad publicity while learning astral projection. He's a mean jerk, even without the new luggage. Apparently, this is the path to immortality, because if you do well, you can inhabit the bodies of future generations. I think Star Trek has had such a story with Jack the Ripper for several centuries. Anyway, this guy is really dangerous. He has a nice family and makes her unhappy. He begins to murder friends just because they have an unfriendly comment for them or he does not like them. You can see the end of the back row in the left box. It's a very hard, humorless movie. Most of it has to be understood as truth. Why are some selected but few? I found it long and not very satisfying.
