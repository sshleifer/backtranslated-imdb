Unlike most of the comments in this section, I have to say that this movie hardly escapes the definition of "garbage!". The only readers who know what a clich√© catalog is are those who, like me, live in the northeast and know first-hand what the area looks like. I'm not in the mood for films that are supposed to be "realistic," but the working class (from wherever) is a stupid, criminal low-life, but they apologize for their social background. And funny? I smiled twice and laughed once, but that was the incongruity of two boy actors with Sunderland accents who were supposed to hide their Newcastle accents from the Sunderland football fans! There was only one sympathetic character in the entire movie, and that was the senile grandfather, played by Roy Hudd quietly but very competently - the only non-geordie in the cast. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm just wondering in which university-sociology department the author studied. He certainly had no ear for the local accent. And I have never heard the phrase "Purely Belter" - and I'm not just a native, but also a linguist who wrote articles on the local dialect. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time looking at this garbage. It's not funny, it's not realistic, it's not entertaining and it's basically dishonest.
