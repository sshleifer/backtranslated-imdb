What can you say about a movie that makes "The Erotic Witch Project" look like "The English Patient". Again the plot and the characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact copy of "TEWP". <br /> <br /> Four buxom sisters and a dumb male leader enter a forest to search for the naked female, and the women are sexually charged. The naked girl leaves porn devices and an explosion doll, just like in "TEWP". They lose themselves, the fool is lost and the girls find their way back to their hotel. There they play the end of "The Blair Witch Project" as cameras are dropped and the guide plays Hopscotch, a game that is essential to the thin storyline. <br /> <br /> At least three of the Sisterhood members have unnaturally large breasts full of dimples and stretch marks, as well as the obvious surgical scars. The one "natural" girl here is humiliated by the director. In a very dismal and overlong end credit segment, outtake scenes in which she could not find a correct line are played ad nauseum again and again. Julie Strain shows up in a scared wig to play the game of a naked girl. This one scene seems to be added later, as no one in the cast could be credited with shooting. While the women are frolicking and caressing, in the background you can see someone's picket fence. This could be the backyard of director Jim Wynorski. <br /> <br /> That's just bad stuff. The lesbian love scenes are cooler than those of "The Erotic Witch Project". Most of the lovers consist of four women who mix their eight collective breasts from this poor career decision. No such luck. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the makers of "The Blair Witch Project" should be really crazy. <br /> <br /> This is unrated and contains mild physical violence, strong obscenity, female nudity, sexual content and sexual references. <br /> <br />
