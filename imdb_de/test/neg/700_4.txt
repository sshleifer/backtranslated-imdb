Not the best of the Lone Star series, but it is progressing well with good performances. <br /> <br /> John Wayne is introduced as the "singing cowboy" as "Singin 'Sandy" in the main title and is not successful - you never see a close-up of him as he sings. The actual singer is the son of the director, Bill Bradley, who sounds like many well known singers of the time like Hutch or Joseph Wagstaff. <br /> <br /> The film features: Cecilia Parker (also seen in "The Lost Jungle" series, "Tombstone Canyon" and as older sister Marian in the Andy Hardy films) her best Katherine Hepburn - "Really they are not allowed, I am really not "; Al St. John, before he literally became "Fuzzy," filled in all of his available screen time with his signature business that triggered caps, head and chin scrapes, grimaces, and gross physical gestures and movements; George (before Gabby) Hayes smoking a gentle pipe; and Forrest Taylor, a small veterinarian of 395 films and television programs, who plays the oily villain with a fly and a propeller cigar. <br /> <br /> Fun or strange moments: Yakima Canutt is a great trick under the stagecoach. the 'gay' scene where Singin 'Sandy Bert and Elmer ties face to face, dragging her to his horse and dropping her off at Kincaid's office, where Kincaid says, "You're a beautiful pair of love birds!"; Denton's rapturous commentary on a hideous song and guitar performance by 'Sandy' - "Um, I could hear it all night!"; Kincaid's answer: "We will not respond," after being told by a rancher, "You have the soul of a serpent!"; And of course he says the immortal. "I made an offer to Denton." I can not refuse. "<br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is salvaged by Sandy's Kincaid trickery, and later in many of these films the three spell words are called," I'm from Washington. "FDR has saved us out of depression! (So are the bad guys always either bankers or in real estate?) <br /> <br /> The shootout sequence is from the previous Bradbury movie" Man from Hell's Edges "(1932) All of the Lone Star Westerns are special because of their unique mix of interesting characters, the cast of actors and stunt people, and the spin of clich√©s and repetitive back stories and situations - "Singing Cowboy" gimmick, I give a 4.
