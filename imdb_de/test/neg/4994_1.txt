With the terrible acting, the terrible dialogue, the variety of bad humor, the crappy plot and the horrible movie. That was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I'm the king if I find bad movies. For the effects, they just threw fake blood on people and things, and did not spend the time to create wounds and make special effects that were worth something. Most people who do low-horror flicks do at least something like tissue wraps or something to make a wound. The dialogue was anything but decent and the drama was without guidance and effort. They just threw some actors on a set and said they have it. I swear, I've seen better movies from my movie that I teach at school. How did it happen that a DVD was released?
