The characterization in this movie is among the worst I've ever seen. The dialogue is banal and clich√©s to extreme distraction. None of the problems faced by the characters are ever developed - they are merely superficial details intended to convey a point without the need for a credible dialogue to support this point. Also the presentation of the Chinese characters leaves a lot to be desired - I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns from a book correct English (or it is implied in a scene) so that he can teach it to his daughter. <br /> <br /> The Smile Train is a great organization and it's a good idea to make a film that will make a deeply-ridden film about the impact of such a program on children's lives. But overall, I found the movie more frustrating than anything else.
