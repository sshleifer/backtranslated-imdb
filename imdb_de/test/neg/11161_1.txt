The entire set-up of this fictional Disney family movie (the Ad-Exec gets his horse a horse because she wants "more than anything else in the world") is just an excuse to film the big horse show at the end. All other ingredients (the belly pill advertising campaign, Kurt Russell as the boy's potential boyfriend, Lloyd Bochner as the potential rival for Dean Jones over Diane Baker's affection) are put back at the end of the process to showcase the horse. More than half of the picture fills and worse: it is whiny and unpleasant. The child is the Ninnensorte that cries with a dog in the arm on the couch, and as always she goes through. * from ****
