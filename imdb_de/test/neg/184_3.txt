This movie is not like City of God at all, you might get the same feeling, but it's not like that, there's no intense filming or intense drug scenes, you get the idea. If you ask me, I think that this film was a waste of time, there are many other films that convey 100 times more meaning and teaching than "Wooden Camera". Yes, I may be the only one to comment negatively on this film, but that's just my opinion. It's one of those movies where I feel like I'm going to be overwhelmed, but when the credits started looking at each other, my friends and I all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was. To conclude this matter, I advise you not to look at her. <br /> <br /> Personal Note - Getting Africans to speak English was a big mistake. In the city of God, they used their mother tongue, which gave the movie much more power and reality.
