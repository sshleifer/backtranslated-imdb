It has a bit of this indie-queer edge, which was in the 90s and sets the visual style an explicit expiration date. Characters are uniformly apathetic and farce dead. Street Hoodlums in Greece wear new clothes with no wrinkles or stains out of the box. They all seem to visit the same navy hair chest. All have consistently the same low IQ when they do not do business. When things go wrong, that's all because they are not real Greeks - they are shepherd boys trapped in a strange night city. Tears over dissatisfied immigrants, but it never bothers to investigate the problems with the Russian / Kazakh / Albanian culture. If Giannaris had the right perspective for this project, it would have produced a wonderful Bel Ami production. The glimpse of tinted boy beef is the only spark in this generic little gangster programmer.
