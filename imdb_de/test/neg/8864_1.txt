This is a spin-off of Pulp Fiction. I thought it would be good for some decent laughs. Well, it turned out that this movie was really horrible. The entire plot does not follow the pulp fiction plot. It's about other films like Forrest Gump and more. Some laughs came from this movie, but everything and everything I needed lasted 90 minutes of my life. If you are planning to rent this movie, please do not waste 90 minutes of your life. Rethink the hiring and think about a movie that really makes sense. If there is a Plump Fiction 2, I will definitely not rent the sequel. Just to give the people out there a head up.
