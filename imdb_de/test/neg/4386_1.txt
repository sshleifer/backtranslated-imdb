This film was like a gathering of people who had been in other films and decided to make a really bad movie. It was a guy from "Detroit Rock City," a girl from "The Cosby Show," that dork who kissed the chick and bought the sausage in "Sorority Boys," and there was more. OK, that does not make a bad movie, I just noticed that. The whole thing with the whore and the Frenchwoman of the same name was stupid and the thing with 37 people who wrote these notes, and if you think they would get confused ... shocking enough ....... you called it And the purse, that was just stupid. It was so bad that I saw the movie in two parts and still only reached the 50-minute mark. If you see this and expect "Van Wilder" or a movie like this ... Not.
