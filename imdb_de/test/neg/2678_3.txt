While browsing the comments, there does not seem to be much love for this film, and it's not hard to understand why, it's nonsense. <br /> <br /> Now I want to say that the movie is done The product was somehow violated by the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr. Loomis) in post production. This required a re-jigging of the film's conclusions when Loomis bought the farm and at the end took a double turn when Micheal traded the places with a mysterious "Man in Black" and I do not mean Johnny Cash /> <br /> Now for the story , The fifth film ended rather unsatisfactorily when Micheal Myers escaped from prison with the mysterious man in black. It turns out (aggh) that this man knows the origin of Micheal's evil and also a colleague of dr. Loomis named Dr. Wynn is. They also abducted Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in Parts 4 and 5, but here by JC Brandy). Pregnant Jamie escapes Wynn's camp and so Micheal follows her and kills her. But she had had the baby, so now she has to find the baby so he can kill his big nephew. <br /> <br /> We hear some ridiculous explanation for Micheal's evil, in which Gaelic curses run into bloodlines and mysterious symbols. For some reason, a radio show is broadcast from Micheal's hometown, which leads Micheal to other hapless victims. In the end, just like this review, the film is vague, confusing and directionless with a very anticlimactic ending. <br /> <br /> Some sex scenes and nudity. Bad action, passable effects, with a few good mill strokes, but strong motivation. For what should actually explain everything, only a few new questions were raised, parts 4 and 5 were pointless and a bad way for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and career.
