The cheesiest movie I've ever seen, not scary, just bad. The first WWE-made movie, and trust me, the only person who could appeal to this movie are wrestling fans. It has terrible acting and the worst director I've ever seen. I laughed at the plot and bad actors. I saw that the WWE people really tried hard to use many wrestling moves and various camera effects. I think they copied a lot from Silent Hill. This movie is also not captivating. If you see it, you will vote for the lack of suspense. The end is the worst. No matter what, you want your money back
