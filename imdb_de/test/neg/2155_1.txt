It makes no sense to describe in detail the intricate, overly melodramatic conspiracy of Civil War bitterness, a crooked city chief, and other complications. It's all bad. <br /> <br /> Stella Stevens, Andrew Prine, Bo Svenson, William Smith, Tim Thomerson and Lee Majors are all good actors who are not big stars (or big stars anymore) but have always enjoyed themselves /> <br /> Here they are all wasted on a picture that looks like it was taken in a tourist trap in the west of the west. The costumes were borrowed from the local theater department of the high school. In fact, the acting seems to be high school, which would not be so bad if it were not so presumptuous. <br /> <br /> The name Ed Wood is all too easily addressed days. I think in this case the comparison is justified. But I suspect that old Ed would have made a western one more than this one.
