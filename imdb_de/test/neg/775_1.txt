This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. It's really so bad that I plan to rent it again as soon as I can find it. This movie makes 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' look like an Oscar contender. If I just look at the actors, I want to laugh aloud. I can not say enough bad things about this movie. It is a dreadfulness that appeals to perfection. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think). That's as far as I can ... I laugh too much. I know it should not be funny, but ..... * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL * <br /> <br /> MOVING OVER ED WOOD !!!
