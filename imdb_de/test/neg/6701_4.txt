Last night I visited with my cousin a demonstration of Badland. We were kind of excited to hear when we got there that the director / writer, the producer (his wife) and several actors were also present and that after the film there would be a discussion and a Q & A. But once the movie was over and the credits started (and the movie was not cut well enough and too long), my cousin and I immediately got up and left immediately. As we started talking outside, we found that we both felt so angry that not only did we not want to stay in the discussion, but we could not look at the cast and crew who were near the exit and whom we went right next door. <br /> <br /> I found out that the roots of my anger were planted in the scene where Jerry slices his daughter Celinas palm with a big knife so her blood can leave her a false trail. It was inevitable to associate the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he had inflicted on her mind, murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence, sparing her, and taking her with him on the run , I've already cut my palm (accidentally). Even a rather superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive, and it heals very slowly if you do not keep it immobile because you keep opening it up and trying to live your life. But after a very short period of time, with only a strip of cloth tied around the palm of his hand and a scene with a large band aid, it was as if it had never been cut. My anger has reached its peak - I will not spoil that moment for you - in Celine's closing scene. <br /> <br /> I got angry because Celina is by far the most likable character in the movie (the acting actress) she's a good one); I was and you can not tell me that a good script writer would not know that. She lost in her physical and emotional pain. and the scriptwriter, treating Celinas mental pain so recklessly and disrespectfully, treated me, the audience, recklessly and with complete disrespect. Sure, the script has moments of tears for Celina and some dialogue that tells us that it somehow hurts somewhere. But at this point, we feel manipulated as viewers to shut down. The manipulation starts very early in the film when Jerry's family announces dialogue with the audience that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule one, screenwriters: Give your audience some recognition. Let them do a good deal of creative work alone. Tell the story; Do not tell us everything we should think and feel. We do not like it. <br /> <br /> My cousin also knew that she had problems with the film early on when it came to dialogue when Jerry and his wife had little say. that, damn you, you damn. Some couples actually find themselves so bad that the F-bomb is every other word out of their mouth. But it's like watching comedians cursing a lot. Some of them are really funny; the cursing is by the way. But some of them are replacing curses for humor, and this script writer is not Chris Rock to finish the metaphor. <br /> <br /> This husband-wife team bravely decided to tackle a horribly complex story with a terrible complexity. However, they do not seem to have realized that the meaning of a story, especially a complex one, is different for each audience. To tell storytelling successfully, you must be aware of important facts and not desperate to interpret the meaning of the story to the entire audience. <br /> <br /> I've worked with Vietnam veterans for five years, I've heard more stories than most. I'm always happy to see films that make their stories accessible to a wider audience. It is important that we hear them at all possible levels. However, I am not so thrilled that this storyteller decided before the movie even started, which meant Jerry's story, and pronounced it for us with a very heavy hand. Look out for the details next time.
