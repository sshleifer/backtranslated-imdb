This is a shame for the name of all the adorable and ridiculous Critters' saga. Why do the authors feel the need to make the movie unbearable under all quality standards? The critters are sweet and adorable as usual, but deadly behavior has turned into a killer baby. They are not so frightening, cruel, some like the spine - cool and funny as they were previously portrayed in the movies. I used to love their porcupine shots, but now it's hidden, as if it were repetitive and boring. And what about killing, not food? I thought this movie was cool, but everything was so wrong. Why did Ug have to be angry and be killed by what is known as Charlie? This movie makes me sick. Shame! Shame! DISGRAAAAAACE !!!!
