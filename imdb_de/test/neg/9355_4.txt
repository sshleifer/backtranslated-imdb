Go to a movie fan and ask for the title of the movie directed by Robert Wise with director Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone. It was designed by Ken Adam and staged by Max Steiner with Sir Stanley Baker (sir) Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot were filmed in Cinecitta in 1955 in color, size and stereo with a thousand extras - and they'll tell you to go and stop, to be stupid. <br /> <br /> You will do it, do not tell you that no such movie EXISTS. That the names you quoted NEVER worked together - they were not even at the same time. And that you just picked the names out of a movie release and try to confuse them. <br /> <br /> At which point you can guide them to the IMDb and show them the cast and crew of "Helen" Von Troja. "You will be amazed! This lesser known sword and sandal epic has ALL these names and names More - Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott, and the good old Harry Andrews. <br /> <br /> And it's certainly a curiosity: after the war, 1,000 Italian extras cost about $ 25 a day, and toga dramas were a staple The orgy scenes were filmed twice - one with tops, the other without (you can guess which version of Britain and America was obtained), and I think La Sophia is an extra in this area. <br /> < In any case, the names STAGGER are the brainchild, but it is really just a coincidence that all the named names either only reached the end of their career (Canutt, Steiner) or they started (all others). <br /> <br Only Robert Wise and Niall MacGinnis were In the midst of her career For the record, Leone was not in the credits and learned his trade - Adam still had to invent the descending circle in the blanket of sets (a hallmark he would use in all early bonds) - Baker had Noch in the Starring and contributing, such as "Zulu" and "Robbery" - and then run a Welsh television company called Harlech - and then tragically die young. <br /> <br /> As Harry continues Andrews, becoming one of the UK's most beloved character actors - Janette Scott (Thora Hird's daughter) would never be the big time, but who knows her in "Day Of The Triffids" (though her piece was added later) for paddling and a happy ending forgotten) or "Crack In The World"? <br /> <br /> Sir Cedric was a theater guy, but he knew how to play a movie - and Bardot ... was BARDOT, for Gawdsake! <br /> <br /> But what did these outstanding people in this camp do, old nonsense? Do not ask me. The two main stars were no Italians without names - Helen had a mustache and Paris was pretty - while the British were only there to help. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is called Major FLUKE. In stereo. To be honest, if I had not seen it - I would NOT believe it!
