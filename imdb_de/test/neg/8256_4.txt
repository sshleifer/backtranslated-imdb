I bought this movie because I thought the cast was decent, and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit. <br /> <br /> Let me first say that acting does not have a high standard. Stephen Baldwin leaves his character almost temporarily retarded and sometimes grumpy. Patsy Kensit is so-so, but in some scenes not too convincing, and the supposed poetry that she sprays in a particular scene in her hotel room is absolutely meaningless garbage. Ms. Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here, but in the end I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this film. Ms. Rubin's character is initially innocent, then sexy when she plays Stephen Baldwin's character (Travis) for a fool. The minor cast includes Adam Baldwin (no relation to his better known names) and M.Emmet Walsh, who has worked in many films. I also noticed Art Evans, who was one of John Mclane's allies in Die Hard 2, is a couple of nude scenes with Ruby & Kensit, a bit of action, but that's certainly not a fast or intelligent thriller. There is a particular scene in which they are traveling in the car to commit a crime, and Stephen Balwin's figure wears sunglasses. If you see him again, the area around his eyes etc. is painted black, and the sunglasses will reappear later when they leave. The crime scene and the police are in pursuit, an obvious mistake in the editing. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of one of the ladies or Baldwin, you might find something here that others like. This is a reasonable but unobtrusive thriller and not really worth more than a few dollars if you want it.
