If you think Hannah Montana or Suite Life are at the bottom of the Tween sitcoms, obviously you've never seen iCarly. iCarly is without a doubt the worst show I have ever seen. From lifeless acting to low budget rates, the show smells of equity as the Chinese takeout of last week bubbled in your overheated car. funny girl named Carly, as she and her friends make a live web show called iCarly. Carly lives alone with her older brother, who needs serious advice or something because he's a few brainless cells. <br /> <br /> The actions of the shows are extremely ridiculous and unbearably annoying. It's even worse to watch Carly and her boyfriend Sam in a show at InCarly's little show. They basically show strange pictures and poke things in the nose, while the laughter track plays over and over again. Seriously, every two seconds, the laugh trail seems to be for no reason. <br /> <br /> So, what's the point of this review? You can ask. Just to mock iCarly? Well, but I warn you before this show. Because seriously, if I had to decide to look between iCarly and Barney? No questions, I would choose Barney.
