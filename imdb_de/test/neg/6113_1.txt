I was watching TV with a friend one day and we got caught by "Going Bananas" for the last twenty minutes. Believe me, when I say it's enough to judge the movie correctly. The first scene I saw was the monkey, the boy, the fat man and the black man, who looked like Dave Chappelle and flew thousands of feet in the air in a grain dust. While everyone else was serious about the trip, the monkey seemed to be in a kind of drug rush, screaming something that resembled the English word faster. They then landed on a 20 meter long dock in Africa. After a heart bade goodbye when the monkey (Hahahaha) cried, the "villains" of the movie appeared. In their old Cadillac, they completely ripped their asses off as the evil monkey made an Air Jordan jump from the dock onto the boat that was 40 yards away and she had her beautiful car sunk into the Pacific Ocean. After seeing this movie, I have a new meaning in life; find the dwarf who played the monkey and sting him with a fountain pen.
