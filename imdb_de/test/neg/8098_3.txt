As a group of businessmen begin to die in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. Since the deaths continue to increase, Mr. Martin obviously has no great success. At the end of the film, the strange truth is revealed, which I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> One of the other users commenting on this status: "This is a classic movie and should be enjoyed and not taken apart". I am sorry, but I have to disagree with this opinion with respect. It is "classic" only insofar as it is old and in no way refers to its quality. I've enjoyed many low-budget "B" movies from this period, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> The tempo is unbearably slow, the camera work is pretty boring Acting is pretty wooden (Lugosi is not that great in my opinion either) and the plot, although it has an interesting premise, seems to be a lot difficult way to get mixed up.
