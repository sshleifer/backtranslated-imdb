I found this movie awful. I understand that it was filmed on a small budget, but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just stupid. The plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic idiot. In fact, all characters were unsympathetic and none was fully developed. The audience does not refer to anyone in the movie. It should be exciting, but if you are not interested in the characters, it's hard to get into the movie at all. I felt like an outsider forced to listen to someone telling me a stupid story. All the twists of the plot at the end were just too much - I actually laughed when I guess I should be "shocked". All in all, I really just found it a bad movie.
