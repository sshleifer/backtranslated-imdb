The legendary Cameron Mitchell turkey about an actor / make-up man who is burned by the studio manager as a drink is thrown in his face while he lights a cigarette. Mitchell works at the Movieland Wax Museum, working on a scarred mess and wearing eye patch. He abducts and kills people with a solution that paralyzes them so that he can turn them into displays. Really bizarre bad movie that defies any description. Watch the various wax figures try not to move, and watch as all the tobacco is consumed by several southern states. It's a terrible train wreck and you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. A classic bad movie that will amaze you even if it leaves permanent scars on your psyche.
