This film does not have a very clear picture of what he is or wants to be. There are some good things when Stewart is on the screen and they give him some lines to work with. It works best as a romantic comedy, but the story is becoming more dramatic and lost. In the last fifteen minutes, the plot changes are just a series of dramatic clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The part of the plane feels like there is some leftover footage from another movie that has been picked. <br /> <br /> The main reason I can imagine is if you can watch it You've seen all of Jimmy Stewart's films.
