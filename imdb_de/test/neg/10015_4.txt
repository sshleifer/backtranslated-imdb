The earth was destroyed in an atomic holocaust. Well, parts of the earth, because somewhere in Italy, a group of pure-bred survivors - those without radioactive contamination - are housed in a huge mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity, looking for people with polluted blood to go. The last executioner is the story of one of his victims, Alan (William Mang, who does not look surprisingly much like Kurt Russell) and his efforts to demolish the legally sanctioned hunters led by Edra (Marina) Costa and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan was trained by the killer of former NYPD policeman Sam (Woody Strode), who usually hangs around to give his student moral support and dive for canned meat. Strode is by far the best movie, though he does not look good at all and only appears for a third of the runtime. In terms of story, it's a mix of elements from better movies and stories, including Ten Little Indians, The Most Dangerous Game, and Escape From New York. The Final Executioner moves at a reasonable pace and provides appropriate entertainment for less discriminated action fans.
