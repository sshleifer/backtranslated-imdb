For years I tried to remember the name of this movie (of course not continuously). I saw it at the local dinghy theater when I was eleven years old. I think I did not know that one was allowed to go before the end of the movie. Anyway, I remembered it as the worst movie I ever saw growing up. I can finally give it the rating it deserves. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (that was strangely satisfying)
