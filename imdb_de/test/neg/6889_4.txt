The video case for this film reads "a story of beauty, passion and forbidden fruits". Are you talking about the same movie I just saw ?! That can not be, because the movie I just saw was beautiful, but there was no passion, and as far as the fruits are concerned, it's just Hogwash that should lead the potential viewer to see this movie. If it had only a passion or a life, I would have enjoyed this movie very much. Instead, it was a torturously slow and not particularly interesting movie that I definitely do not want to see anymore. It's not that it's a bad movie (after all, it's filmed very nicely), but it's boring and unbelievable. I've always been waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen, but then the movie ended. There was no great sense of excitement, mystery or anything - just a rather tireless story about a young girl who becomes a servant and spends the next 10 years of her life working as a maid.
