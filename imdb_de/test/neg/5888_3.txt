I am at a loss. The entire movie made absolutely no sense. It was like a Soderburg film for football. The cutting of the camera, the tempo, everything so copied. I thought the topic was too serious for them to handle it that way. Yes, we all know southerners like football and beauty pageants. Do we have to be flooded with it as an audience? I saw about Lee and Jay. I was expecting a young talent in the style of the Dead Poet's Society or similar to Remember the Titans. The movie completely scared me off. You did not get the characters. It was driven by characters, but one could not understand most of the motivation or actions of anybody. The one child whose mother is obsessed by him is a football player. Why is he silent so? What is his deal? Do we really need the scene where he "proves" his heterosexuality? Why should we care? The film gave us insights into the lives of these children and did not pay for the care. It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> And why are you showing a movie about a lost team? I know it's a real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us some pay for these guys who work as hard as they do with all their "imaginable" problems, damn it. We have nothing At the end of the movie, we got a small hint that Mojo had won the next year with the 3rd Stringer (Lee). Why did not you pursue this story? What should we get out of here? The movie led you further, but did not lead you anywhere. I just felt that something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least these two films have taken you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a loser team that lost its star player at the beginning of the movie. The actor who played him was great. They were completely annoyed with him, what was important, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him, but he could not play. So why should we make sure we get his problems? <br /> <br /> And the other team in the play-offs ... shall we believe that these are high school teens? These men looked like college seniors or professional players in their thirties. Who were you trying to have a child with? I know the other team had to be intimidating, but that crossed the line a bit. I liked the tricky element with which they negotiated with the black team, but also how did that fit into the overall theme of the film. Nothing put together. The characters knew more about us than us, and that makes me weird. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was presented. It was all just a mess. No movie ticket or rental fee worth.
