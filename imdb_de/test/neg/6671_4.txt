Norman Wisdoms last star vehicle was a departure from his previous ventures? Updated his accident-prone Milq toast, a product of the Swinging Sixties! The end result is a troubled and occasionally embarrassing comedy that blends the star's typical slapstick (and sentimentality) with mild sexuality and even milder satire. The plot has to do with an executive who is on a trip to a banking conference that falls on teenager Sally Geeson (who has no objection to him, but does not take his relationship too seriously). Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson's girlfriend, warning Norman of her fickle nature. <br /> <br /> The film is not nearly as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB rating would have been and, if anything, for his treatment of life crisis (in many ways similar to Hoffmann [1970] and 10 [1979] Incidentally, I have just seen both of them); In the end, Norman even tries to bring his wife to his new thinking! The Pretty Things themselves seem to be playing a bunch of good songs in a nightclub, and Norm himself sings the catchy title track!
