... A good script or a good director could not be repaired. <br /> <br /> The original "Poseidon Adventure" was a story in which human courage triumphed over terrible opportunities and personal tragedies. The survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength, who took everything that God threw at him. <br /> <br /> The follow-up tries to recreate the mix, but fails due to a formal font and pedestrian guidance. Irwin Allen may have been a great producer of disaster films and did a good job directing the action scenes in 'Towering Inferno', but he can not give his characters any human depth. If the characters are not believable, the danger they face also falls. <br /> <br /> The script also tries to copy the original too obviously. So we have Peter Boyle, who does the thing of Ernest Borgnine by being tough and repulsive (but he has a tender heart); Karl Malden is the moderator of the Red Buttons (and for a good reason is terminally ill). Slim Pickens makes the comic relief for Shelley Winters and so on. <br /> <br /> To make the story more modern, we have a rogue trader ready to beat weapons-grade plutonium to the highest bidder. A really wicked work that ruthlessly gives up wounded men (the actors who play their henchmen were probably paid as extras because they seem to have no lines) and shot a woman in the back - what a kad! Fortunately, the French rescue services made the hole in the Poseidon hull twice as large as 1972 (and on the other side of the propeller shaft) so he could get his goods out. And while we're talking about the subject, how did they bring the boxes to the ... oh, forget it. <br /> <br /> I actually paid good money when it was released. Given the film's current reputation, this may seem strange, but it received rather mixed reviews at the time. Some said it was rubbish, others said it was just as exciting as the original. No matter, nobody can be right all the time.
