From the opening shot of the meteor falling on the ground, you know that you have something special in mind. <br /> <br /> This is an ultra-low-budget recording in a video about a group of teenagers who are stranded on a lighthouse island with some monsters. The story is inconspicuous and nothing you have not seen a thousand times. Acting is not great, but not terrible, but the special effects of which there is a good deal are ridiculous at best. If you can read this sentence, chances are better than 50% that you could be more credible in creating the video explosion and compositing effects in this movie than the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Rescuing the movie - If you fancy a Level 2 turkey in a movie, there's always something going on and never going to be boring. And if you want to make fun of bad movies with your friends, you might find this for a dollar rental. <br /> <br /> And I have to say that I appreciated the opening joke: "That's the dumbest name for an island I've heard before." Probably the best moment in the movie.
