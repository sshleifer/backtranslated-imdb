Unfortunately, with so many horrible spoof films, this is a breath of fresh air for the genre. Compared to classics like Airplane or Naked Gun, this is awful, but compared to current spoof films like Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie this is very clever and original. Do not get me wrong, this was not a good movie in any way. I have laughed a few times, and there are a few inspired gags, but every reference to pop culture is flat, as are most of the jokes in the movie. Lambeau Fields (David Koechner) has been a bad coach in the past, but now he's brought back to teach college football, and this time he'll do a good job. His wife (Melora Hardin) feels far away from him and his daughter dates a football goal to annoy her father. Spoofs of various recent films come into play, as well as many gags and constant stupidity. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the film are the gags that do not rely on the reference to current films. Spoofs from Radio, Rocky, Dodgeball, Friday Night Lights, Invincible and many other sports movies are not funny at all. It's mainly the smaller gags that get a few laughs, like a bizarre scratch scene in the crotch or a joke with chewing tobacco. These little disposable chicks can not carry the movie, and in the end it's hard to look at. The last 20 minutes are grueling to sit through. <br /> <br /> The characters were surprisingly developed for a sports parody movie, but I'm sure the characters were built on clich√©s from the genre. Nevertheless, they are not that bad. David Koechner can pull off a lead actor in a movie. Too bad they gave him so much bad stuff he could work with. Matthew Lawerence has a good comedic timing in a not so funny role as a ballet footballer with a cross-dressing dad. Carl Weathers completes the cast and plays again in a sports movie of comparable size (Not the Rocky movies ... Happy Gilmore!). Overall, this is a silly comedy. Sometimes it's funny, but in most cases it's just very annoying and predictable. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 min. PG-13 for language, sexual humor and drug humor.
