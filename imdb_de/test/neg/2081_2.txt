Paul Mazursky goes up in flames on this film. Writing, directing, casting and acting (with the exception of Victorio Gassman) are all wrong. I remember the reviews over 20 years ago, which were mediocre, but I thought it was still worth it. With well-known figures like Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia (who puts too many accents in most of his scenes) and John Cassavetes, I understandably expected much more. The music selected for the film is staggering, the cuts between New York and Greece are confusing and the tempo leaves much to be desired. Why Paul Mazursky felt the need to update or add to this story is puzzling - this retelling of Prospero and his daughter takes little significance and does not add much to the piece. The play is not one of Shakespeare's best anyway, and it does not seem like a good decision to expand it. Unfortunately there is nothing to recommend in this film.
