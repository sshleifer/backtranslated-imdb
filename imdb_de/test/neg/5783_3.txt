I'm a fan of good, plausible action movies. And I'm a big fan of elite military units like the Navy SEALs. After all, I'm a big fan of Michael Biehn. Unfortunately, none of these films allowed me at that time. I recently gave him another chance when I bought the DVD. Here are the issues with this movie in a short list: 1. It's a poor men's cannon, for example a virtual music video from the SEAL team playing golf, with a soundtrack of "The boys are back in town", ending with Charlie Sheen does a crazy chase to get his towed car back. <br /> <br /> 2. This is simply a movie by Charlie Sheen, when Sheen tried to get famous before doing things like hot shots. Reports I've heard suggest that Sheen had a baby on set and it influenced the roles and direction that the rest of the actors got in the movie. Biehn is the head of the SEAL team, but Sheen rarely obeys him. Any SEAL that shows the lack of discipline that Sheen's character is doing or that endangered the team like him would not even have made it through BUDS, let alone join a team. <br /> <br /> 4. SEALs are trained on weapons cross. In one part of the movie, a SEAL has to "figure out" how to use a US Stinger rocket. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in the movie. The attack entry in the beginning, Bill Paxton as "God," and part of the material in what should be Beirut at that time. Overall, this movie is a loser.
