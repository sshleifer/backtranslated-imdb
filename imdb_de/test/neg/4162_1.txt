If you're a nerd who thinks it's "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman that's your mother's genetic equivalent, then you'll get pregnant, and then you'll have sex with her again if she has an abortion Is related to you, then you want this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not forget that the man is married and has a son at home - it makes it even more repugnant and deplorable that he has no conscience what he does. He can not do with his job, his family or Maria get it right. He is a loser. There is nothing romantic or positive about this film - it is abominable and incestuous. <br /> <br /> He moves slowly and leads nowhere in the first half of the movie. I could not even finish this pathetic apology for a romance. I'm glad we did not waste our money on this movie. 0/10
