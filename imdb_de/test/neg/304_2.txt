I've wasted enough time watching this work in a movie. I do not want to give up writing a great review. Not once did I smile. ALL the jokes were boring, forced and had no joke. I keep saying, "Where is the punch line?" Almost every character was a disgusting stereotype and all situations were stereotypical and half the time there was not even a solution. Things just happened to get to the next scene. For the life of me I can not understand how this has become so many good reviews. If you like chunky plays and poorly composed movies, Fat Girls is the movie for you.
