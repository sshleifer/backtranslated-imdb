Let me first clarify that I'm a big fan of bad science fiction fans, especially when it comes to gigantic, city-shattering monsters. But this is so fantastically lame that I can not even feel it is bad. They seemingly did not draw enough money from the budget by giving up the props (the only prop we need to specify to determine the size of the alien girl is an oversized pencil that costs around fifteen dollars on Spencer's Gifts available) for concept or action. The monster may look OK, in my opinion, but it does not have enough interaction with the backgrounds; H. Not enough destruction to suit most fans of the genre. The general rule for huge monster movies is: If you do not have many buildings with pseudo-effects to destroy, you better fight with another monster with mystery. This movie has no. I can not make my last complaint about the movie without giving away the ending, but suffice it to say the origin of the monster, and the method that was found to get rid of it just does not hold water. Not even as good as most of these films. Skip it.
