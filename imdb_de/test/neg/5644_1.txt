The puzzle as a concept is an interesting idea, but I'm afraid it's wrong if Vinnie plays the role of the hard man, this is his element as in Lock Stock and Snatch. In this film, Vinnie plays a Newspaper sports author (greyhounds, to be exact), who in the course of the movie is easily beaten and bundled on a balcony by a man 10-15 years older. I'm sorry that Vinnie looks tough and makes him look like it's stupid. Attempt to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict near the Thames. He takes on the role of the policeman, while the real police is part of the actors and interacts with flashbacks by Charles Dickens. <br /> <br /> When Vinnie appears on the screen, his reputation precedes him. Sometimes the camera has to work hard, sometimes growling at the camera. If you look at the Mean Machine, it is perfectly staffed and believable, and does a very decent job. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie, which confuses matters a bit, is the review of Charles Dickens, who tells a different story with characters that emerge even in this day and age. These two stories seem to be independent of the story. The same actors are used. <br /> <br /> The tone in the movie, especially by Julie Cox, is sometimes inaudible, and it has not really worked out what her role in the film of Vinnies Love is becoming a friend. <br /> <br /> The death of the prostitute is somehow answered, but not yet answered. Take off Charles Dickens-Kram and you might have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Vinnie, getting Brit Brit Steven Segal, stay on the supporting actor role, you're pretty good at it.
