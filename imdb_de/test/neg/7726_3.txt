I was on a mission to watch Uwe Boll movies to see if they were really that bad. The first one I saw, BloodRayne, was not a complete loss. I liked it more than most people and actually rated it 4 out of 10. Next was the first House of the Dead movie. Well, that was terribly bad. I could watch for ten minutes and rewind a bit, and that was it. I could see where it was going, and I did not need to see any more, just to rate it at 1 in 10. <br /> <br /> But I also had access to the sequel (which, however, was not written by Uwe Boll, but mysteriously by the same guys who wrote the first one so incompetently.) Since IMDb got a higher rating than the original, I thought I would give it a chance. And I actually managed to see everything. It started with a few witty clues and cool lines (as the president received his instructions from the vice president!), And in terms of spectacle it's light years better than the first. Here we have cool muchachas like the extremely hot Emmanuelle Vaugier, whose coolness is allied with Carrie-Anne Moss, Claudia Black and Evangeline Lilly. Man, I hope someday there will be a Matrix movie for you. And the ever-delicious, super-aerated Victoria Pratt. I love sporty women. And there was also Nadine Velazquez (Catalina in "My Name Is Earl"), who did pretty well. <br /> <br /> The story was not much and the action was not great either and the end was a disappointment as they could not complete their mission. Well, at least the two main lines have survived. I think that's a small victory too. <br /> <br /> Good cast, but a pretty bad movie. The actors are doing well, but there is no real substance. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points.
