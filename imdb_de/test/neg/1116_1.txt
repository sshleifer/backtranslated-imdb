Despite the low standards of a dedicated horror fan, I found this movie beyond terrific. It was a big disappointment as it was shown as one of the eight horror-fest films. I can only hope that the other seven were better. In fact, it was embarrassing for the friends I could convince to see that, and these are the same friends I saw in the remake of The Wicker Man. It has every cliche in the book. In fact, it has done everything to involve them. Let's start with the characters. Instead of a young girl in need we get three: the only hot mother with two daughters? A thriving but mindless teenager and a sweet, scary little girl you know has "special" skills, including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The little girl is the same one who was in the remake of The Amityville Horror. She was a little annoying, but not nearly as annoying as Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> On the whole, these characters seemed to be fleeing from a LifeTime movie. I thought maybe horror movies would have evolved from scenes in which the female characters go to bed with make-up and walk around in the dark and announce their presence to someone with ears, but not these. I also find it inconceivable that none of them had the opportunity to protect the front door against arbitrary opening day and night. To give you an idea of ​​how uninterested I was with these characters, most of the time I thought about how cold it must have been on the set, because everyone was in their mantles and how white their teeth were <br /> Despite all the formulaic story lines, the movie does not build up any tension at all, except to wonder when it's over. There is more atmosphere in the local giant in the midst of the lavish afternoons on weekdays. As for the dialogue, I could have tried quotes from ten other films and put together a better, more credible discourse. The gore level, the feast for a horror fanatic, was minimal at best. Without their tiny weapons, the zombies were not threatening at all. You could probably throw a few of them across the room. <br /> <br /> What really kills him is his banality. Horror films, more than any other genre, can not survive unimaginative mediocrity. Give me a horror movie that is weirdly inappropriate or outrageously overcrowded. I can even take the new ones with their squeezed torture. Every now and then, I appreciate a really scary one, anything but that.
