This movie was not the best ... but he had some good actors. Isiaiah Washington was pretty good as a homeless guy, Guy Torrey was good as his disabled brother, Ice-T as a landlord was funny and surprising ... the actress Tami Roman was good as a judge in the movie. I did not know it was her and I'm a real tough Real World fan. She was absolutely believable. Hopefully this movie will not hinder the development of these actors. I know that Isiaiah left the film behind with the success of Gray's Anatomy, Ice-T and his regular role in the NYPD Special Unit, and Tami Roman has found a recurring role in Sex Love and Secrets (UPN's new soap opera) , I also wish that to the other actors, because a bad movie does NOT make a bad actor.
