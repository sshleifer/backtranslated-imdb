I've always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to notoriously bad and unpopular movies. I have always enjoyed such bad bad flicks, you look at someone who liked recently kid-filled kid-flicks like Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004) it turned out that all the critics are right. It's a MAJOR flop, but unlike many flops, it's not fun at any level, not just to make fun of it. It's just a boring Cringe party after the other all the way. <br /> <br /> I had been warned. I did not listen. I'm a fool. <br /> <br /> Do not be a fool, do not waste your time and money on this garbage.
