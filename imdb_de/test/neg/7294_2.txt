I will not say much about this film because there is not much to say because there is not much to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" are back. Some of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, terrible comedy, terrible animations and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful, single Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticism are that all characters are turned into something they never were and should never be, animations that have been downgraded as much as possible -When Kenobi wants to copy Michael J. Fox in "Clone Wars"? I happen to have an answer for that. Because they are the same person who thought to remove Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes, unfortunately it is true. <br /> <br />.
