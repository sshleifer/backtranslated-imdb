"The Beautiful Country" is a big disappointment. It does not meet my expectation. Bihn, a big muscular guy, is a son of an American GI and a Vietnamese in the Vietnam War. We were told that he was treated "less than dust" in Vietnam in the early 1990s, so he fled to America to seek his American father. <br /> <br /> Sounds like heartbreaking stuff? Maybe, but shown in this movie. It's hard for me to emotionally connect with Bihn because the movie is full of stereotypes and I just do not understand or believe him. The writing of this film is a total failure. The plot is full of holes. Some events are taken on a necessary basis to arouse the emotions of the audience. We are not that stupid and it does not work that way. Let's see what the movie is trying to do. So you do not have the feeling that the boat trip from Bihn (yes, he was on a boat!) Is hard enough. Let's have a storm overnight and let the ship shake a little. Still not touched? Fine! Let a young child suffer the heat, hunger, illness and violence of the adults on the boat, hopefully it will do the trick to touch the audience. Still not touched? You heartless SOB, let's ... OK, I do not want to spoil the movie, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> The movie is really long and slow. It never tells us why Bihn did not look for his mother and father until the moment he left to look for his mother and father. What did he do 20 years before he left for Saigon to look for his mother? And guess what? He's lucky and everyone will tell him where to find the person he's looking for, and he'll find anyone without a scratch. I really believe that the Department of Homeland Security should hire the Vietnamese who helped Bihn. The beautiful country Which? Both Vietnam and America seem to be hell to Bihn.
