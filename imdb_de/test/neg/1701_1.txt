I just looked at this "newest" version of Macbeth and was pleasantly surprised by the solid acting and the obvious efforts that had to turn a historic piece on a low budget into a full fledged movie. The music was very lame and added nothing to the intensity of the movie. She sounded like someone with a keyboard and a bunch of samplers as opposed to a full orchestral score. I think Paul Farrer has to pull himself together !!!
