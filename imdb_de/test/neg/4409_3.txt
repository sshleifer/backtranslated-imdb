How many monster tree movies can you see in one life? Well, I'll go to my feet and say one. This movie is better shown in the late evening with a 12-pack of beer, the sound and you and your friends up the dialog. <br /> <br /> On a Pacific Island, a young man is sentenced to death because he has teamed up with the "evil Americans" so that the Doc can be king. "Well, he vows to come back and take revenge. <br /> <br /> Before you can shake a stick, the stupid natives run to the lodge of American scientists and shout" Tobanga come! "<br /> <br /> It seems that the young corpse did just that as Tobanga, the tree monster, yes, his revenge is terrible (and this movie too) .It seems that these natives are not facing a clumsy Tree, so he throws it in quicksand, rolls it down hill, an ax, or a chainsaw. <br /> <br /> The general problems with this movie are numerous. The comedy is a disgusting woman with a cockney accent ( They want her to die on their first appearance, the lead actress is weepy, the lead actor is a boor, the dialogue is stiff and cumbersome, the natives have Brooklyn accents, and the monster suit is a giggle <br /> <br /> Even though this is a bad movie, it's still fun to watch. Your dog can rate it a bit higher, but only if the tree is not mobile.
