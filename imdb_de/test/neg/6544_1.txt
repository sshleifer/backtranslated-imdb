This low budget indie film redefines the word "bla". It will be most surprising that this word is actually found in the dictionary, defined as "nonsense ... uninteresting, boring, lifeless". The film redefines the word because I would have to add to these four words: "PC crap", "presumptuous on a pathetic level" and "pointless". <br /> <br /> The film tries to be so hard "hip" and "in touch" with contemporaries who fight for je ne sais quoi behavior and "thinking" (think?). There is almost no action to speak of, though there is one to sleep to. The funniest and politically right thing is, as a white woman is good friends with a young black stud, the black Saxon player with a penchant for oh-so-wise advice and the fat black psychic. Is not it nice how the races can get along? ... Ahhhh ... At the end the woman reads "Poetry", which is nothing more than one of her boring "Dear Diaries". She gets a standing ovation (!!!), although in real life her listeners would rather be in deep sleep. But this movie has little to do with real life, even if it does. In real life, her "poetry reading" would have received standing ovations only if she felt she had the juicy, sexual details involved. "And then I rubbed his huge penis against my sweaty, impatient little little vagina ..." Cheers! What's worse, the lead actress has a dozen scenes in which she either bathes with someone or screws with someone, but they never have the guts to show off her breasts, which was clearly the only thing that could save this mess. <br /> <br /> The black and the blonde, which are about a meter high, join in: They look like a cheap version of Rodman and Madonna (as if the latter two are not already a cheap combination). Nicole Eggert, mentioned by Howard Stern in his book "Miss America", is the blonde. Stern writes that Eggert has taken out her implants. However, I believe that when they took out their implants, they inadvertently sucked most of the meat from their flesh and muscles, because here they look ravenous. The saxophonist in a scene develops angelic wings; He looks like Al Roker selling Angel Food Cakes.
