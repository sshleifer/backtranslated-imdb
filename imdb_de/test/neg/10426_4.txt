This film tells the story of John Belushi based on his biography Wired, written by Bob Woodward. All films are narrated without regard to a chronological order, with an angel following Belushi during some points after the death of John Belushi. Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is credible enough, but completely without the devastating power of Belushi, and his playing remains just a pale animation. The director does not manage to continue the story, who does not know the book, is very confused. But the worst part is that they introduced Bob Woodward, who talked to Belushi before he died. For these negative points, the film is just one possible attempt to tell the controversial story of John Belushi. My rate is 4.
