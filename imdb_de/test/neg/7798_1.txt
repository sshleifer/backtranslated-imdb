I saw the preview in Femalien and thought it might be a cool movie. It turns out, it's a terrible garbage. There's not much nudity in the movie, not to mention not having much sex either. There were just a few stupid dialogues and uninteresting dances you would normally expect to audition. In our case, you may even see it in the movies. Conclusion: I have none for it. Just leave it alone.
