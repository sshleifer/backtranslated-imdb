OK, so I know better than watching movies on sci-fi. , , Um, sorry. , , SyFy. Or shifafa. Or whatever it is now. So sue me. All Saturday I spent brainstorming for a charity. I can pardon that I knocked in my chair and wanted to see a movie I had never seen before instead of reading Proust in the original or learning how to play the Oud does not deserve Open Graves. Incidentally, I have not seen any of that. Was there any? I fell asleep? Why is that called? <br /> <br /> Some icky visuals. Not much fear. As with too many films in modern horror films, apart from the common humanity, there are no reasons to care for one of these people. Half a point, however, for the legless entrepreneur who had a clich√© but had a good scene. <br /> <br /> It all plays like Final Destination, which comes with a board game. The game looks intriguing and includes one of my old favorite games. I will give it so much. The downside is that the game had more personality than most characters. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the game coming, I think you fell asleep. Somewhere in the wee hours of the genre.
