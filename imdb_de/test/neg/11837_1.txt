I understand that Roger Corman loves doing cheap things, but that's just sad. I did not buy this strip in my local video store a month after watching the original carnosaur. I was blown away; It was the same damned movie, with only a few Corbin Bernese! It reminded me of all those '80s ninja movies that recorded old kung fu films and put them together into a series of white ninjas Terminator "," The Thundering Ninja "," Black Dragon "and" Ninja Warriors ") Thanks, Roger Corman, they only let me waste a dollar.
