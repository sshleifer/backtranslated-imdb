Supreme Sanction is a film about a female assassin who works for the US government. She has to kill a well-known television reporter, but he spares his life when she sees he has a baby daughter. Because she did not kill him, she becomes the next target of her employer. <br /> <br /> The script is not good, although I have seen worse B movies. A hit man with remorse, the government kills innocent people in the name of fighting terror ... What's next? Aliens save the victim ??? No, Supreme Sanction will never win a prize because of the script. And acting is not better, I'm afraid. A few more well-known actors (Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson), who clearly had a lot of bills to pay and were willing to star in this film, along with some other actors who probably do not know what a camera really looks like , <br /> <br /> Why should you watch this movie? If you have nothing better to do than watch an action movie, you're tired of the 10.531. Repeat Mc Gyver or the A-Team as if it could be the movie you want to see. Otherwise you prefer to leave it alone. I give a 3/10.
