If you read the book before you watch the movie, you might be as disappointed as me. The book was great and I was sure, after seeing the movie preview, that the movie was going to be great as well, but I felt I saw a movie where the director and cast did not even read what this one was Characters like. The film is short and they do not really make us feel that these people were really in love and felt like they were the only partners. Even if the film did not go in the same direction as the book, at least the romance between these two characters could be more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry. However, they did not develop action long enough to see how they yearn each other. The book was a true love story and I think this movie could be a lot better.
