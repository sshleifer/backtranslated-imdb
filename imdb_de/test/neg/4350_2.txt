Decent action scenes, but the movie does not make sense with a slow, intricate storyline, an almost nonexistent dialogue that leads to minimal character development, and a truly awful plot. But in their defense, the action scenes were impressive enough, even if you scratch your head, why they just happened. <br /> <br /> There is not much else to say about the movie. It's a smooth, mindless action adventure that makes no sense at all. It's like seeing a worse version of the Matrix and skipping the entire storyline and dialogue.
