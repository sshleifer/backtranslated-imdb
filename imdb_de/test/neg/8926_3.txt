Harlan Banks is the thief at the top of his game, but after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his wife and retire. He decides, however, to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems easy. Unfortunately, someone taps the police and after a hectic chase he goes to the slam just to escape and take revenge on those who have been cheated and even taken there. A typical action party follows. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) in a trenchcoat and wears his beloved Colt 1911 and his usual aikido with bones. The Colt and Aikido were always with him, but the first thing I remember about the trench coat is in 'The Foreigner'. It's not particularly impressive, but it adds a little to Seagal's deadly arsenal of badassness. Or it covers the extra pounds he packs. Consider it the way you choose. His main comrade is played throughout the movie by Treach (another new thing, a rapper in an action movie), and both reveal a small conspiracy of villains on both sides of the law, giving the right to every culprit. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that it is painful and I mean really painful, unoriginal. Seagal follows a movement throughout the movie and even that gets more and more boring as the movie progresses. Then, in the final scene, it becomes boring or completely ridiculous, when people who were apparently dead because they had suddenly killed themselves for no reason began to talk. Moan in the truest sense of the word. The only positive thing here is the decent opening - a chase in Las Vegas with police cars and generally entertaining chaos, but after that short highlight you've seen it all before. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: constant violence and obscenity
