Too bad. What a terrible shame. The table was set, the candles were lit, the guests had arrived ... and then ... <br /> <br /> ... well, really nothing. Just pretentious. It could have been great, OK maybe not great, but it could have been very good. All elements were present, but at the end of the day the bottle was empty: NO FLASH! How that happened is a puzzle in which the director has everything at his fingertips ... <br /> <br /> ... the story was pretty brave, though it certainly took some work with possibly some final revisions to the director Correcting the story and streamlining the characters a lot (the only thing that was constant and constantly and unnecessarily tight was the cinematography, but that's what I come for). But the direction was bad, the acting was just that: _a-CTin-G_ with a heavy side of cheese and a lot of ham, and then the cinematography ... <br /> <br /> ... well, that was something to behold ! But only if you are in the film school "Cinematography 101", as you never use a professional film camera under any circumstances. "Obviously, the student had fallen asleep through part of the introduction of the lecture and only heard" ... use a professional film camera ... "and then returned to La La Land blissfully, as the sentence ended. <br /> <br /> What can I say, amateur and presumptuous to last! I can only see that this film as Chick Flick appeals because he is supposed to be sad, but then flattens out and in the end is "sad" (as an excuse for a movie) ... so that even these "chicks" would not be fooled by this chitchat! <br /> <br /> PS I felt bad for Miss Diaz, she's a lot better at her craft than what this movie allowed her to do, even though she was totally wrong, in fact I'm sorry for everyone in this movie except the director and (you guessed it) that Cameraman! I say '1. against the wall for her when the revolution comes! ' OK, not really, after all "it was just a movie", but maybe a good "tar and nib and out of town" could be more satisfying or at least much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> TTFN :-(
