This starts interestingly, because there is a carnival right next to a house with an oil rig and a kind of shop church across the street with a neon sign "Jesus Saves", all in a tiny area ... well, that's pretty awesome when it's unlikely ... and then we go straight into the movie, which is unlikely to reach new levels. Of course, this is a lame remake of the 1979 thriller, in which Carol Kane plays the lead role as babysitter Jill Johnson. Now, Jill is a chick who has been ripping up her cell phone for so long that her evil parents punish her by making her work, probably something the audiences involved in this film can identify with. Jill is brought by her father to this huge and chic house by a lake in the middle of nowhere to babysit for the Mandrakis family. The children are already lying comfortably in their beds when Jill arrives, and the housekeeper is still there, or, she could not babysit? Of course, despite the remote location, one of Jill's girlfriends comes along with whom she apparently has problems like "boyfriend stealing" or something. Of course, the alarm rings in the house for no reason, and then calls come from someone coming from someone who wants to kill them. Of course, Jill calls the police, and since there's been no threat in her life, she's being plundered by her, but she has to call back if she can do anything else for her. Look at the scene in which Jill calls her friends at the high school bonfires / pep rally or whatever it is supposed to be, it looks like a kind of "Burning Man" festival. There are all sorts of invented horrors, including the cool cat Chester, who, of course, pops up here and there, one of the tired "horror movie" clich√©s that exist. I admit that I fell asleep sometime during this time and did I miss something? Hard to say or really interested. This is one of those movies that makes me wonder how bad the remakes of "Amityville Horror", "House of Wax" or "The Fog" could have been. Anyway, from reading online reviews, it seems like the most scared people are 12-year-old girls, and I can only assume that statements like "it made me pee in my pants" , Well, one can only hope that this puts an end to the Hollywood remakes of films that were not outstanding at first, but do not bet on it. 2 out of 10 and I'm too generous.
