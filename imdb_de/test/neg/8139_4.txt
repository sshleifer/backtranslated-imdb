The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that happens throughout the movie itself. We have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and writer and director Curt Siodmak, cinematographer Charles Van Enger, editorial director Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen behind it. The unfortunate Payton turns his head down on virtually every man she touches, deep in the African jungle where she lives on her husband Cavanaugh's plantation: the doctor Conway secretly wishes her, while the sharp-headed foreman Burr's approach literally has more hands. on. On the other hand, Chaney is (surprisingly) the relaxed but knowing authoritarian figure, and Strode is a local police officer. The plot is very simple, but apparently does not make much sense: After a particularly agitated dinner with a thunderstorm, Burr and Cavanaugh (art imitating life later) come to blows in the garden about their affection for Payton and, quite comfortable for Burr, just crawls a big snake near where Cavanaugh touches the ground! The enigmatic maid of Payton (a local witch, not less) who witnesses the event behind the bushes, curses Burr (who has since gotten Payton married) for some inexplicable reason, who periodically turns him into a gorilla ... starting from his wedding day (when his hand gets a little rough)! Consequently, Burr has to lose himself for days in the jungle? Even if the monkey creature is barely visible even in the entire movie. It must be said, however, that the version I viewed was only 56 minutes long, if the official length is given elsewhere than 66, 70 or 76 !! Therefore, understandably, the film feels hectic and incoherent, if nothing less than combative, for it culminates in the subjectively shot hunt for Payton by the gorilla in the jungle, the former being persecuted by the guns chasing Chaney and Conway. To return for a minute to the tragic blond lead actress of the movie: After a promising film launch alongside Hollywood legends like James Cagney and Gary Cooper? in KISS MOMORROW GOODBYE or DALLAS (both 1950) ?? Her career was soon transformed into the B-class (and less) by her own colorful 'off-screen antics': Her most famous offense was that it turned into a much-noticed brawl in the bar-room between the taunting husband Franchot Tone and Brutish came former lover Tom Neal, who ended up in a coma with the former and Payton let him down shortly afterwards for the latter !! But that was not all: Nymphomaniac Payton also boasted that Woody Strode was one of her conquests (then a controversial topic); Short-lived husband Tone, who had caught Payton's infidelity in front of the camera, spread the damned photographic evidence in Hollywood, and that meant in effect that he ended his days as a starlet? Her last movie appearance was Edgar G. Ulmer's MURDER IS MY BEAT (1955), which I happen to have in my stack "Unwatched Movies". The last 12 years of her tumultuous life spent in Skid Row on alcohol, drugs, prostitution, beatings, arrests and even a sting? before she finally died in 1967 at the age of 39 in her parents' house!
