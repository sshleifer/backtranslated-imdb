There are certain scenes in this film (like the first meeting of the hero with Shirley Eaton, a supercool act), in which it seems to break sexual taboos and fulfill its premise (women want to dominate the world by making slaves) but it never dares. The result is a movie without sexuality and tame violence. Despite the hackneyed plot, the movie is not overly bad until its climax, where its moodiness is rampant (horrible editing, overstressing camp recordings). Worth seeing only as a curiosity. (* 1/2)
