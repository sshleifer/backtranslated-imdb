(Spoiler) It might be the worst movie you see, you might like it as if I really like it. It's one of those odds movie. <br /> <br /> There is a man who has seen a day in life. Black's rats some, how sorry he is (which I think was a good idea). <br /> <br /> The killer rats become friends with man both bodies are covered with big black rats not so much blood. <br /> <br /> (but think of big black rats in the whole body) but start killing humans, but rats become boring until the rats kill him friends and girlfriends, <br /> < There was a scene of sitting on the toilet while rats went to the toilet in the pipes, and the rat gets out of his mouth and comes out of his mouth, which means the rats must have eaten everything in his body ) I had been laughing for weeks <br /> <br /> Why did I like this movie, yes, it is different from the rest, I for one likes it when the little creature accepts humanity. <br /> <br /> If you've seen one of these movie slugs, Slither, You, Spiders, Snakes, Trembling, Cujo, Crocodile, Shark, Octopus. <br /> <br /> If you like them and check out hood rats, <br /> <br /> it's better than terror toons that I can say anything! 4.10
