Mr. Seagal has apparently lowered his (already low) standard even further and has now outdone himself even with bad movies. The foreigner has no content in the script. The director has done an even worse job and the music and music are so mischievous and maltreated that you just do not know if you should laugh or cry. Just 10 minutes after the start of the movie you just want to turn it off. But considering the earlier films by Steven Seagal, you think, "Hey, maybe there are some cool action sequences that are worth seeing ..." ... you are WRONG! In the further course of the film it only gets worse. Everyone (with a few exceptions) seems to kill every person they talk to, good or bad, innocent or not. The only good thing about the movie is that it has an end and a pretty short running time. Summarize the movie in two words: STAY AWAY!
