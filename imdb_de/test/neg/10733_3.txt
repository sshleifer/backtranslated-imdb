Detective sergeant Vince De Carlo (James Luisi) and his company deal with the case of a vicious serial killer / rapist. Can psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help or will she become the killer's next victim? And what about the funny white dude afro of the killer? <br /> <br /> Inspired by the case of serial killer Ted Bundy, "Killer's Delight" aka "The Dark Ride" is a rather boring 1970 serial killer story that does not have much to offer. If anything, it's more of a police operation than a horror movie, as the violence takes place in front of the camera. Sure, we get mutilated corpses, but we do not get much in the exploitation department, especially considering they're from the consequences, not the crime. Those hoping for "The Toolbox Murders" or "Maniac" will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Luckily, there's an impressive scene in which a woman tries to escape the killer who has the right tone and is pretty thrilled to boot. John Karlen is also very effective as a killer, though his cheerful hairstyle (white men with Afros are always worth a giggle) is more than a little distracting. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Ride" is too routine and too routinely mediocre to really justify a recommendation because it lacks the right elements of exploitation and is even dated to the standards of the times. Those looking for a better example should probably turn to "Do not Go In The House" and a few others, as this is simply not the case.
