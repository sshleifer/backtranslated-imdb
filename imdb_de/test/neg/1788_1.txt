Oh my. I started with so much potential - a couple of cute students walking around naked, check. Then off to a bar, where the cheese of the 80s is raised one step higher. The next morning in a wooded state park. A bunch of girls and their professor, wild bikers, a general-store type and the thriller condemned by They Live as local drunks - make a nice body count cover for the foreign horror movie (Body Count! Aka Camping del Terrore). A crazy Indian in the woods doing some ritual, hmmm, OK, I'll let it run, check. And then, oh brother, from here it goes downhill. Awful. The Lochness monster head in the pond, however, made me collapse.
