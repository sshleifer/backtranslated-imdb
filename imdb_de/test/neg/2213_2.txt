It's amazing to think that this movie was only released one year before Star Wars, but it seems a million years behind in sophistication and special effects. Actually, the Art Direction and the Set Design (nice Victorian spaceship) are not bad. It's the monster costumes that are the most ridiculous and are similar to the "guy in rubber suit" monsters from the LOST IN SPACE television series. The evil caveman makeup reminded me of some aliens from old TWILIGHT ZONE repeats. <br /> <br /> The script is stilted and outside of Peter Cushing's comic relief, acting is also quite miserable. This movie is only recommended if you really enjoy bad cheesy SF. And the music ... yikes! A terrible 70s experiment with synthesizers that does not fit the length of the movie and sounds like someone is wandering around with a Minimoog and a 2-track tape machine.
