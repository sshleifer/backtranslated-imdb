I loved the original, I watch it every year. but the second is a piece of rubbish and should never have been made. The second could have worked if there is another location. The son was not an original or behaved like a child of Eddie. Third was too smart for Eddie, who had downplayed his father's role. None of the other kids was in it. It could just be a lot better. I do not know why they even tried to shoot this movie. There was no continuity from the first movie. I will pretend that it does not exist. It's sad that the actors did not even realize they were fools. A really bad movie. I just think I wasted an hour or more for a bad movie and I love all the national Lampoon movies.
