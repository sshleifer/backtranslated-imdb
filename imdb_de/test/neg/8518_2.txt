Eddie Fischer was just bad. Perhaps the worst scene at the beginning of the film was when he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number with a piano and some conveniently placed staff. The song was totally stupid ... I think I could drunk a few lines on a sheet of paper that went way beyond that and would probably win a Grammy. Then, as if the authors could not find a better way to escape the scene's ridiculousness, Fischer says something about the effect, "Do not say (insert the guy's name), he does not like music" and smiles. I can not describe how bad that is, I felt a little embarrassed. And the guy Debbie Reynolds works with, and who always strikes her, is so annoying too. I can not imagine that someone like her wastes a fraction of the time for him. The jokes were delivered without any kind of chemistry between the characters that passed the movie. At least the baby had cute hair. The two stars are for Reynolds, who was like a swan among the ugly ducklings. <br /> <br /> See Bachelor Mother instead.
