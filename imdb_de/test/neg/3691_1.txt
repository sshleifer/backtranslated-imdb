After seeing this movie, I decided it was so horrible that I have to join the IMDb and write a review to warn other people from the pit of renting / buying this movie. To be fair to the film, there is only one good section to this film, and that's the end point, because then you know that crap is really over. I saw it to the end, hoping that I would enjoy the movie a bit. Just tunnels more tunnels and an old man talks to himself (If you watch this movie too often, you'll do it too). As for Val, if he continues to select such films, he can also say goodbye to his acting career. It does not make sense to even write about what's in the movie as it's already done. Keep your money and your mind and keep it clear.
