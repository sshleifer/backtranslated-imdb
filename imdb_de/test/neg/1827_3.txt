This is a pretty lousy picture. It offers nothing unique or original or even interesting. A medical student discovers that a secret society at their university is busy with macabre medical experiments. And of course she's committed to solving the weird deaths at school. This movie has a promising start with a few cool special effects where a man is partially dissected during his lifetime, trying to get away after waking, but then even flickering and the rest of the special effects are pretty plastic models of the human body and that unreal-looking blood, who always seem to have these second-class horror movies. <br /> <br /> And as if the routine plot and the lousy drama were not enough, this movie would have subtitles that many times did not even fit the synchronized English you hear talking, and then add that to the mouth movement that does not match the synchronization. Well, let's say, to try to coordinate everything that is not worthwhile in your head for this mediocre movie. <br /> <b r /> I've at least counted a few skins in this movie, and apart from a bit of the opening credits, this movie did not do that either. <br /> <br /> This is a boring routine of the Mill Horror / Gore movie - short on horror and gore. Skip this movie unless "Ernest goes to Camp" is the only rental left.
