I did not hate this one. I simply could not adapt to the story. it did not really grab me. Michael Mann is a very good director, but I do not have to agree with his methods here. I'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. Some of the projects he's been to are pretty crap, but his acting is brilliant. My favorite films by Daniel Day Lewis are "There Will Be Blood" and "Gangs Of New York". <br /> <br /> There is one thing I loved about this movie. that's about all I liked. This movie also has a high voice, which is a bit random. I can see that a few people will like this, but not enough to get the overall rating of 7.8. <br /> <br /> I would miss this movie if I were you, but there are many high voices I think you should look at it and make your own views on what you think. i did not really like it ............. 4/10 .......... j.d Seaton
