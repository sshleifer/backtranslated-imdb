Why was this movie ever made? They tarnished the original caddy's hack with that crap. I could only see half of it and did not even laugh. At least I did not pay for it because he was on TV. But I will not get back the hour of my life spent in this terrible mess. There was no first star except Chevy Chase, and he probably regrets that he made this movie. Jackie Mason should be the unreached, funny fool like Rodney Dangerfield was in the first, but Jackie Mason was not funny at all. Jackie Mason is not a Rodney Dangerfield. If you want to laugh, look at the first caddy's hack. If you like horrible movies, then you are here in the movie. This movie stinks like a barnyard in July. Avoid at all costs.
