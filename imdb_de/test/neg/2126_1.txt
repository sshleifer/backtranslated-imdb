What could go wrong with a movie that includes a bunch of Italians pretending to be Flordians, and some unclear lava-octopus crustacean stuff called the Hellspawn Devil Fish?!?! <br /> <br /> Everything is what goes wrong, I tell you! <br /> <br /> This is a very good MST3K episode, as direct Lecheln is right on the ball, which is easy to make without mistakes, considering that this movie is a piece of garbage with a lousy and boring plot , <br /> <br /> 9/10 for the MSTied version. 1/10 for non-MSTied version. <br /> <br />
