Much of the commentary in this board revolves around discussing the validity of a comparison with R DOGS on the DVD cover. Forget it all ... This movie - uh - is a home cinema movie. How can anyone claim credibility that it's 10/10? There is no action, no. I could not believe that I was spending money to rent it (more on that later) and that I was wrong to believe that this (based on Box Cover Art and some kind of film festival ringing) has potential. The only thing I really remember was that one of the annoying main characters was probably bullet-boring ... and he survived the wound and completed it until the end of the credits. Impressive. And Killers has a sequel. Double wow. <br /> <br /> True Story - In fact, I had denied so much that I had wasted my money and life force on this rent, that I had kept the videotape for six months. I kept telling myself that it never happened. The video on top of the TV was an illusion - a mental symbol of my self-contempt. After someone pointed out that it was actually real and I needed to get a grip, I decided that I could not just leave it there. I thought, "How many others have I denied the suffering while seeing this masterpiece by holding Killers for myself?" I had to do the right thing and bring it back to hell, from where it came. <br /> <br /> So, as I imagine most of the populous IMDb would be in a similar situation, I gathered some courage and went to the video store ... at 2am. After making sure no one was around, I got out of the car (of course still running), put the movie in the drop box slot and booked hell, never to return. <br /> <br /> I guess I expected some Hollywood Video Corporate idiots to search for me (the bill must have increased to $ 1,238.67 at the time), so I undressed the area back. Coincidentally, however, similar to Killers, nothing happened.
