In 1913, the cruel owner of a mine at the Carlton Mine in Addytown, Pennsylvania, uses poor children to explore. After a blast, a group of children is buried alive. Today, Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) lost her husband after a long period of deadly illness when the family's savings were spent on treatment. With no money, she moves with her daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) in an old house in the mountains, which belonged to her husband. Karen is recommended by her neighbors to stay home at night, and Sarah hears there are zombies in the area. When Emma makes friends with Mary, his mother thinks she is an imaginary friend. When Sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by Zombie children and Emma disappears, Karen and Sarah chase her near the mine. <br /> <br /> "Wicked Little Things" is not a totally bad movie: Acting is good; the make-up is scary; and the cinematography and the music are excellent. The story and thus the script, however, are very weak, in fact a bad collection of clichés. The beginning is reasonable, with a widow who moves into a house in a remote location because the family has spent all their resources with the Patriarch's illness. But when she arrives, the little zombies accidentally attack people without any consequences. For example, families are not looking for the missing persons. Then the evil Mr. Carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes, a typical cliché that he will eventually die. There is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing Mr. Carlton. When Sarah runs away with her mom and says she is tired and can not walk anymore, this is one of the dumbest lines I've ever seen in a horror movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Zombies"
