Somehow boring, somehow disgusting, somehow disturbing, that was not terrible, but not too good. There is a good scary piece when the statue is brought to life, props for this scene. It does not happen much and the movie feels ashamed somehow. I was happy when it ended, and I do not think this is a true story ... very surprised that this is on average 6.
