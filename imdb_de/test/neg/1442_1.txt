Everyone I've talked with said that this movie would be good and really weird, so I figured I'd rent it. Halfway through the movie, I thought to myself what the hell was going on and what the meaning of this movie is. This movie is so bad from start to finish that even the sick parts of the movie did not even bother me. I mean, what's up with Volcano 2 The Return of the Lava? I mean, the movie is so stupid that the characters are so poorly developed, and before Robert Englund makes the movie worse, I think he might as well be turned into Freddy Kruegur and Spook. I actually choked for evil to win, it was that bad. I mean, the father is a cop who does not really care about his daughter going through one of her life's moments. I mean, if my daughter were treated that way, I would do everything in my power to keep the guy behind the jail. It also seems obvious that Dee Snyder's character would turn bad again. This is one of the worst movies ever with Volcano and 8mm. Do not waist your time you will not enjoy ....! <br /> <br /> Note If there was not a grade on this page, I would choose it, that's how bad this movie is!
