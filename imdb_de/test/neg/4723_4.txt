Dr. Krellman wants to save his son Julio, who is dying of heart disease. He decides that a heart transplant with a monkey will cure his son (no - I'm not kidding). He makes the transplant and (somehow) turns his son from a frail man into a muscle-bound man with a mask for a dime store that resembles a monkey! Of course, he gets out, kills men, rips women's clothes and makes chaos. This is all connected with the boring romance of the police. Arturo Martinez and wrestler Lucy Ossorio. We also get pointless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the story. Everything ends up copying the end of "King Kong"! This is (obviously) a pretty stupid movie. The plot does not make much sense, there is the unfounded female nudity (a staple of any exploitation movie) and VERY graphic gore that looks ridiculously fake (except the open heart transplant). Nevertheless, that also has a merit. The whole cast takes everything seriously and is not so bad as an actor. Also the dubbing in dialogue was (for a movie like this) well done and interesting with surprisingly good synchronization. I also saw an excellent DVD print with bright, bold colors (which helps). We're not talking about a classic, but about an OK movie about exploitation.
