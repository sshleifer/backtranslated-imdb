Talk about false advertising! I spent an hour and twenty-five minutes watching that piece of crap, and there was no leisurewear, platform shoe, dancing finger, or disco ball. I saw it on a Saturday night and ended with a terrible fever, but it had nothing to do with the music. Seriously, with or without John Travolta, this movie was bad. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, you will ask yourself, "Where does the rope come from and does it hang me, please?" From its undisguised propensity for the driving skills of Pennsylvania Dutch, to the shameless promotion of the seemingly everlasting capacity of Alienware laptop batteries, to the cheap horror effects that come directly from Japanese cinema, this is the worst movie ever released by The Grudge the cinemas came.
