I chose this film because I had never seen Carol Lombard in any movie before. I'm sorry it had to be this, because honestly, that's a dog? and even Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both great actors. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is simple: it's trying too fast, too much to report on a young lawyer (John Manson, played by Stewart), Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of that Meeting with her getting married. What is the cliché? Marry in hurry, repent in peace ... <br /> <br /> In short, it is a series of episodes that describe the worsening financial status of couples, their problems with John's mother and her Paying bills show the bills, John's status in the office, the arrival of her baby son John Jnr (unexpected and additional friction at home), the couples worried about their marriage, the child's illness worsening, requiring a heroic flight of one lonely pilots (in a violent storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and eventually John was accepted as a junior partner in the law firm. <br /> <br /> How many more clichés could the authors include? Maybe mother dies soon after? There was not much comedy; the drama was, at best, lackluster; The dialogue was painful to hear. Only the acting of the four main actors was appropriate. <br /> <br /> This was the period when the global economic crisis ended, when the US came out of its long downturn. During this time, many people experienced all the events depicted in the film. So it made sense for Selznick to uphold the good old family values, relationships, heroism, perseverance and initiative. ? All against the background of the "average" American family. Who can do better than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /> <br /> And the movie was released in early 1939; So it was planned in 1938? Soon after, the US began production for the coming World War II. Therefore, this type of film was a great impulse to the general public, many of whom soon had to go to England in the war. As many would know, Hollywood and Washington formed an uncomfortable alliance before, during and after the war. <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I saw it? as a piece disguised social-political propaganda. But I have to see other Lombard movies to get a better idea of ​​their acting area. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer noted, just look that you only saw Stewart's films; Otherwise, do not bother.
