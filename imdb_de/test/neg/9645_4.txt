The threesome of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play Coney Island Carnys vying for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a working girl selling saltwater toffee. With the outbreak of World War I, the old man is attacked and persecuted from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe production is difficult to achieve. The three male leads chew the scenery with over-cooked singles and "brisk" dialogues that quickly get tiring. The second half focuses on action sequences as the US Navy tracks both a German merchant cruiser and a submarine. These sequences are lively and well filmed, but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfactory comedy drama with a flat end. Only for fans of the stars.
