This movie is on top with The Oscar and Moment by Moment as one of the most unintentionally funny movies of all time. <br /> <br /> It's worth the rent for some wild laughs. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing in life would happen like that. It is so incredible. the way James Wood's heavy hitter tries and coughs, then they give this supposed two-bit Hustler a job in 3000 miles distance in LA. I stayed alive because of all the 'tootski'. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is as bad as the "I'll love you forever, no matter what, woman" you'll ever see. It was not so funny that you would throw up on it, how sweet-sweet Young tries to project himself. And as bad as you'll ever see. James Wood is overly busy throughout the movie and he's so extremely funny and far too far off, it's just unbelievable Woods seems to be a parody of a Saturday Night Live cocaine freak. But seeing Woods on `ludes' is worth the price of the rental <br /> I love it when Woods tells the guy who wants to give him some more" boys "that he does not do that anymore, just before that, Woods only made three huge coke lines. <br /> <br /> That's a very funny stuff. <br /> <br /> The end is so funny, but the same with the rest of the movie.
