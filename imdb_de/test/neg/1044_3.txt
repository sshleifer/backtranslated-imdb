I saw this movie being previewed before something else ... and it looked decent. I saw some good stuff from the Full Moon video and thought it was worth a shot ... Unfortunately, that was not good stuff. The story is about an obsessive bed. A couple moves into a new apartment, discovers the bed and strange things happen. Strange things like the woman discovered kinky sex. And the man discovered kinky sex. And the woman draws pictures of dirty sex. And the man takes pictures of dirty sex. And both start having dreams of dead people who have dirty sex. You might think a movie with so much dirty sex would be good, right? No. The problem is that this is a scary movie or at least a thriller and it just does not deliver. There is little tension, no tension and no fear. Apart from a few disturbing dreams and visions, there really is nothing to fear for this couple. The whole movie basically consists of the two who have these visions and play around in bed. Sure, you end up having a monster fight ... and some bloodshed ... but nothing spectacular ... There's only one murder and one good fear, and that's about sex too? Do not hope (or anything else). Her idea of ​​confused sex is a woman in full dress trying to strangle her partner with a tie. Not exactly my idea of ​​a good time.
