With all the many shortcomings, I tend to be charitable to "thing". There's the nugget of an interesting, scary, claustrophobic Hitchcock-style story. Give this to a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer the British perspective) to Robert Bloch or the man who wrote Day Of The Triffids. Maybe you have a nasty, restless little haunted story that was the best something in a book anthology of horror and suspense stories. Someone, however, decided to tell this story as a feature-length film, and at a bargain price, and so most of the potential is wasted. A story like this really needs a voice like Sturgeon to put interesting traits in a better light. His classic tale "The -widget-, the-wadget- and Boff" is an example of how he can put together an isolated group of "ordinary" characters that can turn them into the most amusing and likeable characters within 40 pages and intriguing people that you have ever met. A good writer can, with a few select words, make the reader "see" some of the most vibrant and memorable events that have ever shaken his emotions. Instead, we get a movie in which some of the most important are Irritating and unlikely characters that were ever made, are thrown together and in unconvincing "Where does that come from ?? Moments that just lie there. (Ie the blonde psychic girl who asserted "you are all evil and I hope you are destroyed!"). We get lead-free tempo and slow motion blocking as well as dull sets and stiff actors. I blame the director for the 'stiff and flat' part. These are all third-tier performers who have never made the big time, but they are also "real" actors, and a good director could have done better. We are not called for lesbian overtones that make the viewer feel uncomfortable and exploited without making any kind of profit. (If I want to take advantage of my base instincts and feel guilty, I'd like that to be better orchestrated by things). And we get over an hour of spooky buildup, which spreads in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climax I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Good things about "thing"? Um, well ... some close-ups of the wizard's head silently shouting his instructions were pretty effective. The stingy and squeamish widow came to life (though I wanted to stuff a sock into her mouth). The first scene, with the big, "simple" ranch hand silently hitting and killing the oily cowboy, was a bit shocking because the plan had taken the trouble to establish the big man as a pretty likable character. And, as I said earlier, the idea of ​​a treacherous force from the past that shifts the members of an isolated community against each other is good and can sustain interest well beyond the actual value of poor performance. <br /> <br /> What that definitely is. <br /> <br /> But as I said, I'm rather charitable because the director was probably working on a bad budget, with breakneck time restrictions and the best actors he could find the money for. Heaven knows how future generations will judge light crap like "The Cave", "Wrong Turn" or the remake of "House of Wax" in 40 years. I hope that they are beneficial to our own tastes when it comes to supporting the general film supply of our generations.
