As a child of the 80s, like so many other reviewers, I hated the original V and V: the final battle. I own both on VHS and never connect the VCR to watch them. I remember that I did not like this short-lived series so much, but I could not remember why I borrowed the first CD. With the third episode, I refreshed my memory. It is terrible. The writing is more than terrible. It's not even fun. They had a lot of material to work with, but it seemed they just did not know what to do and turned it into Lizard Aliens in 'Days of Our Lives'. How cool and full of potential is the concept of Elizabeth the Starchild? All you could think of is turning her into a whiny, boring teenager to compete romantically with her mother? Marc Singer seemed less embarrassed than he was in Beastmaster II when he was trapped in this jerk. The point is, if you are one of the younger people who have just discovered V, or one of us older sci-fi fans to rediscover old fun, save yourself and skip it!
