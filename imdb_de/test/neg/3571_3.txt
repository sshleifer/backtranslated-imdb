In writing this post, I have difficulty thinking about what to write about. Not much happens in this movie. The plot is a South Asian woman who falls in love with an English Londoner. The problem is that he and his friends had a racist argument. At the same time, her friend at work is unknowing that she has sexual relations with her brother, and escalates from there. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. Once all this stuff has happened, everything is pretty normal. It's easy to pull on, even though it's only about 90 minutes long. This is more of a chick flick than anything else. So if you are male, I can not recommend this movie to you.
