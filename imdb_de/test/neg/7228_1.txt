Since I have to write at least 10 lines and this garbage does not deserve just one, I start with the following: 1. I chose AWFUL for this horrible so called "movie". <br /> <br /> 2. Let me explain why these turkeys, which Mr. David Varod produces, are mainly shot in my beautiful home, Bulgaria (only at BTW, for the illiterates in the area) Uruguay) A few years ago, NU Image invaded our country and started publishing shitty, mostly direct videos. Why here? Because here they pay for the Bulgarian crew and the Bulgarian actors (most of them are excellent actors), who in many ways are better than most of their American counterparts. Personally, I am ashamed of this fact. The reason, of course, is the greed of the Americans involved and their desire to earn most, if not all, of the profits. Actually, it would not be so bad if the production was not so dirty and pale. No good picture has been taken here for years. NU image is currently being sued for boycott of the extremely questionable purchase of our national cinema production center, Boyana Films. No doubt, there was corruption, there was cheating, there were lies in this recent purchase. The Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live the Bulgarian cinema!
