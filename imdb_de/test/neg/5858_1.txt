The people who made it up are SICK AND TWISTED FREAKS How the hell can you exploit people like that? Make people believe that this is real? which I probably do not doubt that it is ... I saw this thing for the first time today, Series 7, and it made me sick in my stomach that I almost puke. I just could not stop yelling my eyes at these poor people, and if that woman really had that baby, YOU SHOULD HURRY ALL OF YOU YOURSELF !!!!!!!!!! I have a 4 month old daughter and it is just absolutely terrible that a "real" pregnant woman is in so much freakish danger! They are bloody ANIMALS and should be locked up for life so that something like this can be put on t.v. If this so-called "Reality Show" is real, then why not put anyone in jail for allowing people to die and not do goddamn things. YOU ALL ACCEPT FRIGGEN DOWN TO BE MADE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
