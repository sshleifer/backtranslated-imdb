I'm giving the show a six because the show was actually a platform for Damon Wayans, since the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby. She had a lot of humor issues, and I felt like she was tailored for a show to let laughter come from the character, in contrast to the jokes. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a smart person. He's PHENOMENAL in movies, but on the show he was there for the joke, and although I loved it, I felt that laughing was more important than plausibility. <br /> <br /> Jay Kyle I've loved her since House Party and she enjoyed her at school Daze and Martin, this was a great role for her, and she chose this sitcom as a teammate. I also feel that Jay and Michael were more equal on the show, but Jay was more the woman who gave the lines to her crazy husbands and went along with his path of unorthodox discipline because she felt it worked , Just stupid, his character should be well developed and even though he has his moments of greatness, we've returned to stupidity as if he had not learned anything that drives me crazy !!!! !!!! Not to mention that most of the situations (in episodes I've seen) seem to be about him. <br /> <br /> Clair The attractive sister, who was with a Christian, I found the character of her friend more interesting than she was (she should rather stay in movies, the authors would have had to do more to show their intelligence but that's not stereotypical enough). <br /> <br /> Kady Lovable and the youngest daughter. I think the writers have established their character on the show the most, apart from the parents and Franklin. I love this character and I think they derived it from Smart Guy (T.J. Mowry), who only lasted one season. The casting for this little genius was great (the effort would have been made if Jr had been the smart guy, but also showed the downside). All in all, this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it's a tribute to the Cosby show is well done, I love the show and wish it had stayed longer. I can not wait to see the finale of the series
