I borrowed this movie one day at the local video library, you know, a box-art movie that's just about to go out and tell you to "hire me." If you see this boring movie in your video library, drop by. Fight the urge to rent a porn because this movie is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the interesting opening, the film falls into repetitive murders and a hardened police stumbles around and deals with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc.). Wondering if the fast-forward function of your VCR works? Rent this movie and put your request to the test.
