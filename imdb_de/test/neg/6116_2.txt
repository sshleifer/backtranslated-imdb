The worst Wrestlemania ever. <br /> <br /> There were no fights and lots of shit. This was in Las Vegas, and WWE made the staff dress up like Egyptian gods! They even changed Howard Finkel's name to Finkus Maximus, which probably means nothing. The sight of seeing Jim Ross in that awful robe still gives me nightmares and I'm 21 years old. So you can imagine that when I was 7 years old! Bobby Heenan was funny. <br /> <br /> Includes The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales in a bad match, The Headshrinkers vs. the Steiner Brothers in a useless match, Doink vs. Crush in a comedy match and a boring razor match Ramon vs. Bob Backlund. Hulk Hogan teamed with Brutus Beefcake to fight Money Inc. You could clearly see that Hogan had a blue eye. For action purposes, Ted DiBiase and IRS beat Hogan while playing poker or similar in the casinos, which is a bad plot. In fact, Macho Man Randy Savage beat Hogan because Savage thinks he's like The Hulk (no pun intended). Not the wrestler, but the movie character. <br /> <br /> The main event was Bret 'Hitman' Hart, who faced up to yokozuna in a boring match. Mr. Fuji threw salt at Hart and Yoko won, but not until Hogan came down and crushed Yoko in 21 seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall rating - E
