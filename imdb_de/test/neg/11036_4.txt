An overbearing, but - to varying degrees - customizable collection of mostly meaningless "stories". <br /> <br /> But let's start from the top. <br /> <br /> Kaurismaki: If you've ever wondered what Finnish love is / romance was like, maybe this boring little curiosity is a clue. Muted feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia! I think the continuation of this story will be "For our honeymoon we move from Siberia to Greenland". Obviously, Aki had no idea what he should write for this little film, so he just made a half-hearted, non-"story" that focused on a band he particularly likes (or maybe they are his friends), because we can see and hear them Listen to their music more than the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Erice: First of all, I have never heard of this guy? and now I know why. Beautiful black and white photography and pretty much nothing else - unless bored boring can be an advantage. You'll be surprised how many film critics and film students love boredom in movies. Therefore, I warmly recommend Erice's 10-minute snooze feast to these two groups of humanoids. Duke: Not a movie, but probably a snippet of his documentation on tribes in South America. This is not a short film, but a report, but considering how boring the first two posts were, Herzog refreshes something and has some interesting moments. If nothing else fits into the pretentious "time" concept of the film, everything is neat. <br /> Jarmusch: As was to be expected, this once interesting filmmaker (with the head of a peanut, a talented idiot) serves us as another sleeper of futility. He has become lazy and can not bother to write anything interesting, either for his own films or for a collection like TMO. The only good side to watching a dumb vegetarian actress spend 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the pretty Chloe Sevigny. Otherwise skip this nonsense. Oh, and by the way: I do not think a young actress hears classical music. Jarmusch tried to be surreal by getting Chloe to hear that kind of music? Is Lindsey Lohan perhaps listening to the opera? Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fan? Who should I say they are not? Jim Jarmusch is an idiot. Oh, right ... that's what I mentioned ... Wenders: Here's the real shock of the whole movie: Wenders can actually do something good !!!!!? Everything else I've seen from this overrated charlatan has been boring and pointless. This short little story, however, is done in style (atypical) and is the best part of the movie. You want to see more, even if history has a solution. Spike Lee: Oh, dear sir? What can I say here Lee makes everyone seem talented in comparison. Like Duke, he chooses no story, but presents a report? and a left-wing political propaganda report! CNN, but black and white and of course one-sided. Of course, "We Wuz Robbed," the backbone of this little sleep aid, is about how the robbed, gullible, and infinitely idealistic Democrats of Bush and his Evil Evil team are being stolen by thieves. This is by far the stupidest and most boring entry in this movie, and I had to use the fast-forward button to avoid falling asleep. Spike Lee is really a product of Affirmative Action. God knows how many really talented (black) directors never had the chance to make films because this overbearing and talentless little guy always has the opportunity to make them. And he always does it wrong! Well, that needs a talent, right? <br /> <br /> Kaige: Chinese history has a solid premise. It's okay, not anymore. <br /> <br /> All in all, there are many and far better films to focus on, but if your time is not as valuable (as it seems to me to be) you can watch this little movie look at. <br /> <br /> "Ten minutes can surely be an eternity in the hands of cinema's anti-masters, time is precious, waste them on better films." Fedor Miklowitz, 1588
