This movie has no respect for the time of the viewer. It takes a 15-minute story and extends it in 95 minutes. To achieve this, they must use a very slow narrative and all have to run around with implausible, desperate fears. At the time when this movie was showing something interesting in the storyline, I just did not care. The problem is not in acting but in tempo. The story is only weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor, but his attempts to bring light humor into a serious role are simply inappropriate. His humor is not generic, so it looks like a watered-down version of himself. The number 23 is causing great sadness and frustration to people throughout history, but the rationale behind it is never logical. Mostly it is only mildly interesting. Jim Carrey has far more skills in a serious role than this movie reveals. Do not waste your money if you see this in the theater. Rent this movie if you had sleep problems. If you're still wide awake after 10 minutes, you've enjoyed it more than I did. The lighting and the artistic aspects of filmmaking were not particularly important to me either. A lot of passive visual eye candy was cast onto the viewer with lighting or effects, and did little to improve the already-weak story.
