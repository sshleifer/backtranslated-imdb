This movie must be the worst film of 2007, it was just bad and I do not think I've ever seen a movie that is so bad. I mean, do not make really bad Hollywood movies, right? Hamish should really be singing instead of acting because he just can not act. God was just so bad. I mean, he was so bad in the movie that he made Mallika Sherawat look like a better actress than her performance for her, she plays the same role in every movie, god, it's just so boring to look at her, I mean, What men see in this woman? Yes, she has a god body, but where is this talent? I have not seen it yet, and at this rate, I do not think I'll ever do it. Anyway, Hamish falls in love with Ria, now this 15 year old girl can act, my God, she was the best actor in the movie and she does not even look 15, for me she looks at 21, but her performance was brilliant in the movie. Bless her, she was really good, I hope to see more of her in the future. So Ria falls in love with Himash, but her dad wants her to marry someone. A typical Bollywood movie is a hiccup anyway (can only happen in a Bollywood movie) and the two marry in the end Well, I would give the music 10/10, it was great, that made the movie a hit, the songs were really fantastic and brilliant. The only thing I can say is to buy the music and not watch the movie anyway.
