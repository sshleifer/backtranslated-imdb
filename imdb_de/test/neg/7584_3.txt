Experts live it in an exotic and dangerous place. They get drunk every night. They smuggle opium. They drop pigs in parachutes. They fly in incredibly dangerous conditions. They dress weird and look weirder. They are iconoclastic, unheard of. They violate any rule of domination and are contemptuous of their employers at the CIA. They are irreplaceable. <br /> <br /> No. It is not "Only angels have wings" and it is not "M * A * S * H". It's an uncomfortable mix of the two, which unfortunately looks dumb rather than funny. <br /> <br /> It targets shock, entertainment and education, but does not really reach its goals. <br /> <br /> As for the shock value, we are now safe, right? Is it really shocking someone that a bunch of hard-flying pilots flew secret missions in Laos in the 1970s? No, that's not shocking. In our current circumstances, it would not even be instructive to find out that a paramilitary excursion was NOT buried in a file called National Interest, Defense de Toucher. That's okay. So we woke up a bit and not so shocking or stupid. <br /> <br /> The problem in this case is that the movie depends on these qualities to enjoy yourself. Without that, the film implodes. A group of shaggy, drunken CIA pilots sit around in a cat house, go out the girls, shoot out the lights with a muffled pistol and kill with the same lizard. Ask newbie pilot Robert Downey, Jr .: "If you behave that way, does that mean there is something to celebrate?" Answer another and laugh: "No, that means it's nighttime." That would be funny if we were to expect the renegade pilots to be just as upright as the rest of us. If not, the gag falls flat like the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course there are action scenes. Anything that can possibly happen in or on an airplane in flight happens in or to an airplane in flight. People fall out of them, their luggage is randomly thrown out the hatches, engines fail, they suffer AAA damage, which is torn apart on crash landings, but we have seen most of it elsewhere, often better <br /> Some find it funnier than me and the acting is pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. is particularly effective as a straight man. Look at the other comments and if they describe a movie you might find appealing, then watch the movie anyway. There could be a few laughs that escaped me.
