That looks good on paper. Michael Caine plays a tough and reckless boxing promoter whose son decides on a title distributor. Too bad that when the story is transferred from paper to my TV screen, a certain part loses everything. I had hoped that we would imitate his final role in GET CARTER, and later in the film he seems to accept the qualities of a hard, mangy revenge thriller, but the whole sound of the movie jumps so much that you're confused what Genre of trying to fit. For example, Caine (whom you can not believe when Billy "Shiner" Simpson, he's just Michael Caine), has a laugh line when he calls someone "Hattie Jacques", then his henchmen have a supposedly humorous moment broken someone's arm. Oh, how I laughed. I mean, it should make you laugh like it's on the screen, right? However, this seems to contradict the way the rest of the film develops. <br /> <br /> Director John Irvin, of course, does not know how to handle Scott Cherry's script. Irvin is not a bad director and is highly regarded for his war movies such as THE DOGS OF WAR and HAMBURGER HILL, but he is ill suited to this kind of violent drama, and one can not but feel he was a bit intimidated Legend like Caine. Caine gives the impression that he only does it for the money and the familiar faces in supporting roles like Landua and Cranham are basically just cameos that anyone could play
