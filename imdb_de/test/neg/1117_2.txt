I suppose the people who call this jerk are friends of the director or something. That's bad and not in the way of Michael Jackson. To compare the pace of this film with the progress of a snail would be an insult to the snail. This movie is apparently limping like an eternity to introduce us to some weird zombie kids with stupid make-up and some kind of revenge or thirst for blood or whatever. Believe me, you do not care. The very idea that Mom would bring her two daughters to this rundown and FILTHY home is absurd. And worse, I just did not care. Background story about the zombie children? Snoring. Danger to mum and / or daughters? I do not care. <br /> <br /> In short, WOW was so boring. Do not bother.
