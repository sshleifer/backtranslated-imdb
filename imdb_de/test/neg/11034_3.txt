What did Rajiv Rai do to himself? A successful director of films like Tridev and Vishwatama is now making one bad movie after another. I was excited at first when I thought of Rajiv Rai, who returned to the action genre, but that quickly went away. As a Rajiv Rai fan, I thought I should try, but I left after an hour. One reason that I left the movie so early, so the amount of Paki-bashing in the movie. This was not in Rai's predecessor project. <br /> <br /> Many directors have tried Paki-Bashing, but I did not expect it from Rajiv Rai Another flop was the music. Rajiv Rai's have always had good music. There is only one good song and that is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not up to date, not even by Rai Loyalist Naseer-Uddin-Shah. Avoidable fare from once my favorite director.
