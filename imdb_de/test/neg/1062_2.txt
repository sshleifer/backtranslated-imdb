It's as if Ghostbusters' Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man has been reborn into Rutger Hauer's body, taking revenge on the pregnant wife of a rival! If you hunt an obese chaser chasing a very pregnant Isabel Glaser (imagine the nervous tingling in this competition), that sounds good. Watch this movie! Seriously, if Hauer looks like an Iraqi prisoner of war after six years in prison, hungry people everywhere in Baghdad should be put in prison. Overall, "Tactical Assault" rates 2 stars instead of 1 because Mike Mitchell is great as Hawk. Mitchell burns as a NATO pilot from the screen until his plane (by an enemy missile) burned itself, whereupon the film loses the little dizziness he had to start with it.
