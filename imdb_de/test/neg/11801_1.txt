The St. Francisville experiment claims "this is not a walk in the woods", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. While Blair Witch was a movie that overwhelmed the viewer's imagination with a simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement surpassed the patience of the beholder. It must be said that this should be a classic of the camp. <br /> <br /> Attention: The spoiler is coming! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in a local theater where the film's "paranormal advisor", Troy Taylor, talked about the making of the film. If anyone wants to see this movie without knowing the upcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who can not resist, read my friends and everything should be said. <br /> <br /> Mr. Taylor, a writer of rather uninteresting ghost stories, who he claims are all true, informed the audience at this video presentation that the St. Francisville experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we did not know ... He told us that all the frightening discoveries the participants had made were all staged and arranged by the producers of the film. In fact, he told us that the last 15 minutes were filmed not in Louisiana but in California. All four participants were real actors (I did not say well ...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician for ER. <br /> <br /> What makes me mad about this movie is that it says it's all true. It tries feebly to outperform the Blair Witch Project by claiming it was true while Blair Witch was joking. The amazing thing is that nobody could believe this movie for a moment. Filled with terrible plays and funny lines like "Surround yourself with the white light" and "I love the ghosts", the St. Francisville experiment is all about midnight movies, so the crowd can pant right, "Boo", "Me love "the spirits! "<br /> <br /> Talk about false advertising - true stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look like the neighborhood scout troop has set up a haunted house - from the bug in the sandwich (ooh ... scary. ..) to annoying Madison, from the "seance", which is nothing more than the foursome played on an oujia board, to the two mice that are found under one bed. Francisville Experiement is an embarrassing joke of a Films: Lion's Gate would be wise to throw this thing into the nearest garbage press or advertise it as it should: <br /> <br /> "The St. Francisville Experiment: A comedic look at how not to Film makes ".
