Simply put, I was surprisingly disappointed. I'm a big fan of Asian horror, and I can see unoriginality (I enjoyed "The Red Shoes" and "Phone" myself), but that was just poor. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of elements that are very high quality: the photography is an eye-catcher, the look is cool, the direction is inspired, the acting is pretty good, the music is good for the ears and ears the CGI is incredible. However, as this is a horror movie, we are expected to be scared, which is just not going to happen with this movie. As with most South Korean horrors, this is almost unoriginal from beginning to end: there is the typical long-haired, vindictive female mind, ominous clumps of thick black hair and puddles of water, and at the end a twist that * almost * makes it all no sense (the phrase is easily one of the best features). And to irritate the viewer, if the film is not recycled (sometimes so accurate that it can easily be called plagiarized), images from other films, it lets you jump. A lot of. And jumping does not mean that things pop out or anything, just VERY loud sounds and screeching in the soundtrack, with which the audience should jump six feet in the air (there are even a few "made-you-jump" moments, they are just annoying). And if other films are not ripped off, it's boring and hard to see through. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame, because "Ryeong" could have been quite good and has everything to offer. It's good, but it's the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and clutter that ultimately sets the movie ruin. A perfect example of how good it could have been: there's a moment when one of the characters looks at a corpse, and without a sound, the corpse looks back. It is quite predictable, but the use of silence in this scene is brilliant. And unfortunately that's as scary as the movie was for me. <br /> <br /> "Ryeong" admittedly has some good features and even a few jumps that are not so predictable and work. There is a very good and sad backstory to explain the events, and the phrase is quite unpredictable. These are the only things that separate the movie from other Asian ghost / horror movies. But the problem with these is that although they work, they have been used before (J horror fans will soon realize that the big revelation was inspired by "A Tale of Two Sisters"), and the back story is well over fifty Minutes to get started. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Ryong" really seems to be a really wasted opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped the storyline and other good features would be distractions, so the audience would not notice the big flaws. But he failed and well ... We noticed everything. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10.
