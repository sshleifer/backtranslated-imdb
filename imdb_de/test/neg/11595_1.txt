As a total film freak with the happy task of video rental manager, I watch all sorts of films, from good to very bad. This was a movie with so many Corn Ball lines, cheesy CGI effects and predictable plot points that I ended up laughing a lot, before shutting it off after 30-40 minutes. The "creature feature" genre of movies has been doing pretty awesome stuff in the last few years (Godzilla 2000 anyone?), But this movie makes me think that the creators have not even tried. It may be worthwhile just to find out about the "fun of me" potential (count the shots!), But I can not recommend this film to a good conscience.
