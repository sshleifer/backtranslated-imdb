I loved the very first "American Graffiti" with all my heart and soul, which I thought was the best movie about rock n 'roll and the best teenage movie I've ever seen. The first film spawned the careers of George Lucas, who later made the blockbuster epic "Star Wars" before the prequels two decades later, while making Richard Dreyfuss a star in Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and other films / > <br /> Somehow, magic is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> "More American Graffiti" shows the audience what happened to the remaining characters later in the sixties, when Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) protest against the Vietnam War while their friend Terry "The Toad" Fields (Charles Martin Smith) is even at war trying to come out. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is still the hot drag racer in California, where he has never quite left his home. The rest of the supporting cast in the movie by Candy Clark's Debbie (Terry's Girlfriend) about the pharaoh's gang members and Harrison Ford and others do not do much. The original film featured adolescents traveling on the streets with no bloodshed, with early rock'n'roll music by Buddy Holly, The Fleetwoods, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Bill Haley and the Comet, Buddy Knox and others starring Nostalgia mistakes brought back classical music. The soundtrack for "More American Graffiti" is a mix of rock, soul, country, hippie music and whatever matches the mood of the late '60s of protesting, drugs, victims and more. <br /> <br /> After watching "More American Graffiti" it looked like it was going to show the crowd what the epilogue of the four main characters of the first film (except Dreyfoot) was, after all, where this was was not necessary. This movie was not necessary either, because I was glad to see that neither Lucas nor Dreyfuss went on bigger and better projects.
