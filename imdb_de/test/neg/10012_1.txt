This movie is absolutely terrible and terrible. It's not a low budget, it's a no-budget movie that makes Ed Wood's films look like art. The drama is miserable, but sets and props are worse than anything I've ever seen. An ordinary subway train is used to get people into the evil zone of killer mutants. Woddy Strode has a bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit. There is sadism, as one would expect from an Italian video of the 80s. No talent was used for this movie. And the female love interest may have a big, binding Italian taste. Even for Italian standards of the 80s, this movie is pretty awful, but I think it came out at a time when there were not so many movies on video or the viewers were not really demanding. This piece of crap has no entertainment value and it's not even funny, just boring and extremely cheap. It is actually and insult to the dumbest audience. I'm just wondering how on earth an actor like Woody Strode became such a turkey?
