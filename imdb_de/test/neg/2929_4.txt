Coming from Kiarostami, this art and art exhibition is a surprise. For a director known for his stories and the attentive observation of people, especially children, this excursion into minimalist cinematography asks questions: Why did he do that? Was that to keep him occupied while on the shore? <br /> <br /> "Five, 5 Long Takes" consists of five long takes. They are (the title names are mine and the approximate times): <br /> <br /> "Driftwood and Waves". The camera stands almost still, looking at a small piece of driftwood as it is moved by small waves splashing on a beach. Ten minutes. <br /> <br /> "Watching people on the promenade". The camera stops and looks out over the sea horizon and a promenade. People are going over the camera frame, their faces are too wide and blurry to make them interesting. Eleven minutes. <br /> <br /> "Six dogs by the water". The camera stops and looks out over the ocean horizon with a sandy beach nearby. Far away by the water, six dogs have not done much, just relax. Sixteen minutes. <br /> <br /> "Ducks in the row, duck shouting". The camera stops and looks at the sea horizon on the edge of the water. Dozens and dozen ducks stream in a file from left to right. I assume that Kiarostami has gradually released her. The last two ducks stay on the track and suddenly a duck shout rolls quietly from right to left. I suspect Kiarostami has collected the ducks and released them all at the same time. It is not the first time that he has dealt with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes. <br /> <br /> "Frog symphony, oops, my cacophony, for a stormy night". The camera stands over a pond at night. It is jet-black except for the apparent reflection of the moon on the undulating water. It is a stormy night and cloud races to cover the moon. The screen goes dark. What remains for us is the cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and finally morning cocks. Hit me on the head if this was done in a single take. I saw this segment as a sound composition that was put together in the cut-room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty-seven minutes! <br /> <br /> Apart from the mildly amusing ducks, this minimalist exercise left me cold. A non essential movie for Kiarostami admirers. <br /> <br /> I thought I would rate "Five" at five, but four are what it deserves. <br /> <br /> The film is dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.
