I was very disappointed with this series. There were many cool graphics and that's about it. The level of detail was minimal, and I always felt that the audience was being patronized - there were many who called me "This is extremely cool, but we will not explain it in detail." because you do not get it anyway. Let's show you some nice pictures to entertain you. "The host dropped interesting-sounding words like" Sparticles "and" Supersymmetry "without explaining what it was, so we had to look it up in Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> I also know a lot about superstrings (for one Layman) and I found their explanations were complicated and could have been so much better, you could have chosen MUCH better examples to explain concepts, instead the examples used were confusing and obscured the subject further. <br /> <br /> And I was fed up with the repetition - they could easily have put the series together to make an episode if they cut off the whole rep: you must have shown the Quantum Caf√© clips about eight times, the host kept saying the same things I do not remember how many times he said, "The universe is made up of tiny little vibrating strings." It's like trying to brainwash us just by accepting that "Superstrings are the best since the bread was sliced." clearly biased towards Fermilab. This should be a quantum physics education program, not whether the US is better than Europe or vice versa! I also thought that was part of the paternalism - "Viewers need to see a conflict to stay interested." You're welcome. Give me a bit more credit than that. <br /> <br /> A total of 2 thumbs down :-(
