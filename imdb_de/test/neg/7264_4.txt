I've never been a big fan of Almodovar, but in general I've always found something to find in his films. Unfortunately, I had more trouble finding something in Broken Embraces than I would normally think. <br /> <br /> I find the biggest mistake in Broken Embraces as the characters and the lack of depth they indicate. The film is essentially a love story, a tragic one and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories. That was problematic from the start. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our "hero", director / screenwriter Mateo, has sex with a very attractive young woman he has just met. His agent comes in as the woman walks shyly. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our "hero", director / screenwriter Mateo, has sex with a very attractive young woman he has just met. His agent comes in and rolls his eyes as the woman walks shyly. Mateo babbles something about having to enjoy life as the only thing he has left. After being blinded by a tragic car accident that also killed his "true" Lena, played by Penelope Cruz, the viewer could turn to this view, unless the rest of the film really never shows why Lena loved that his life was depth to his character or another. <br /> <br /> Cruz plays Lena, the lover of an industrialist named Ernesto Martel. Their union is rather miserable from the start, as Martel grabs the jealousy on Lena, and Lena avoids the uncertainty of being alone by staying with the much older Martel. To skip, Martel funds a movie for Mateo so he can keep an eye on the film's star, Lena. Without a backstory, Lena and Mateo naturally fall in love. And in the world of Almodovar, it's really that easy. In the opening scene, Mateo has sex with a sexy young woman. Now Mateo falls in love with Lena. Later it became known that he had a son with his agent after his love affair. Your son responds to this information with a laugh and a "oh, well". Again, no depth, no understanding of any of these characters, everything just happens. From the beginning of the movie to the end, I did not get any emotions from Mateo. He is flat and does not behave much differently from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> The one scene I enjoyed was when film producer Martel was watching video material that his son had taken under cover, a documentary by Mateo. There is a great moment when Martel obsessively watches a lip-reading confirming his worst fears. Later, while confronting the material, Lena Martel confronts her role loudly, adjusting the video material of her lips as she speaks. Some really great moments. Rather imaginative, but still very fascinating. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the rest of the movie made me pretty bored. I am not interested in these characters or their situation, so Almodovar's wisdom can not compensate for this lack of depth. I think if you're a fan of his work, you'll like this movie, but if you're like me in between, you'll find it's missing.
