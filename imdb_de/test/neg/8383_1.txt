This movie is a nightmare! The feeling you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same I got when I finished the movie, "Uff ?? OK, it's over, what a relief!" I was in pain watching this movie, it was so bad! It's a budget B-series movie, that's for sure, but I think it's no excuse to be so bad! I have seen ingenious low-cost movies, with beautiful acts, beautiful production, good acting and above all something substance! He has not got anything! The plot is funny, it almost seems like an "American guide on transforming ancient Chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie, with some kids playing with the occult" ?? I do not know if the Chinese story in this movie is real or not, but if it is, the "damage" is even worse! The production is just awful, a zero (what are those special effects?). There is no tension. The supposed "tension scenes" are a complete failure. The spectacle is not better; and what about the dialogues? Oh dear God! A movie that has had several dialogues, like: "I'll go on there later, OK, is that alright?" OK, alright. - OK, OK, ok, goodbye then? " I'm sure it does not earn more than 1/10! <br /> <br /> Too bad to be true!
