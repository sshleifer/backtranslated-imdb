I have been a Shakespearean lover since childhood. I am also a Jew. The Merchant of Venice is antisemitic through and through, no matter how hard scholars and literature lovers try to reinterpret it. In the play, Shylock is depicted as demonic and cold-hearted and has no forgiveness. No warmth, no love but money and cruel revenge, whereas Christians are benevolent, moral people. His motives in the game revolve around money (he's pleading for revenge from the start based on damage done to his business and his blind racial hatred), not noble ideals, or violating the pride of the races, as you did in this movie believe. And this characterization is given to him by Shakespeare himself, not by the other characters. As a final proof, the happy ending is where the Jew loses his money and converts to Christianity. I acknowledge that and go on. It's part of the story and I enjoy Shakepeare despite this fact. Therefore, I expect a movie based on this piece to be played directly. I would much rather see the work adapting to the rich language and storytelling without washing. <br /> <br /> But many of the bards' artful subtleties and playful characters are lost in this movie. In the final scene, when the men discover Portia's covert work as a man who has also taken their rings off, the playful game of words and misunderstandings becomes, as the truth turns out, a vicious game in which two bitchy women play play cruelly with their soon-to-be husbands. <br /> <br /> Instead, we are left with lovely detailed sets, fragments of rich language with poor reinterpretation, bad casting, an intense court scene and controversy. <br /> <br /> The truth is, I think it would be much easier to recognize anti-Semitism in history and move on if left as it is. Despite all the deceptions that have pulled the creators of this film from their hats, there remains much hatred, only now people can apologize and pretend that the representation of Jews is not so bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, another problem is that most of the players are Miscast. Pacino is far out of his league and feels very uncomfortable with the language, not to mention the terribly wrong accent. Fiennes as Bassanio is unattractive and awkward with the language. Iron is reliable as always, but does not do much with its role. Portia is reasonably okay, but unlikely and in bad makeup, just like in the movie.
