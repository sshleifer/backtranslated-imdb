I stopped seeing this movie in half. It was just awful! Boring, invented negotiations. A complete lack of pathos, seen in Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill, or Steve Railsback's portrayal of Ed Gein. A film does not have to be historically accurate, but the true story of Ed Gein is a lot more interesting than this third melodrama, which was completely compensated for no reason! Ed Gein, portrayed by Kane Hodder, is a cartoon sadist. The attempts to show the trauma to his mother are but weak exercises in the recycled style. And this movie wanted to be stylish, but it even messed it up. Luckily, there is a better movie in this story. Ed Gein, from 2001, efficiently told the story, and provided some real goose bumps while watching a sick man who was not in control. Steve Railsback, who played Ed Gein at the time, was already famous for portraying another famous serial killer: Charles Manson. His Ed had pathos. His movie is the one you can see. Avoid this mess.
