This sequel to "In the Heat of the Night" will suffer in unavoidable comparisons with her infinitely better predecessor. Rather than looking like a movie for the television, "Mister Tibbs" looks suspiciously like a movie that's been edited for theatrical release, with grainy photographs, cheesy opening titles, and sets that look like plywood. The murder sequence has a blatant continuity error: the camera shows two hands choking the girl, then a shot of a hand reaching for a statuette, then a shot of the girl being strangled again with two hands, and finally the statuette, which comes down to the camera deadly blow. The solution of the case should be simple: find the only man with three hands! However, the modest production figures can not completely disguise the film's considerable merits: Sidney Poitier's performance as a cool detective determined to pursue the evidence wherever he may lead, even if it implies a friend. Martin Landau also convinces as a do-gooder preacher activist, who is suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute's girlfriend. Apart from being persecuted by this case, Tibbs is in conflict with his domestic life, but the problems of race and the barely hidden feeling of Tibbs social outrage are not there. The complex murder mystery that made "In the Heat of the Night" so convincing.
