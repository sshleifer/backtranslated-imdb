<br /> <br /> JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Adventure <br /> <br /> Sam Nell (The Dish), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ (A Leoni (Family Man)) <br /> A better title would be: ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND OF THE REALLY MEANED DINOSAURS, but then nobody would have to watch the movie teenage victims of a hang-gliding accident. <br /> <br /> ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports that JP3 has shot without a full script. This explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to present the state of affairs. Art Special Effects: Of course there are some clever scenes and a few moderately funny parts, but no meaningful plot to connect them together. The dinosaur puppets and the animation in JP3 are very good to excellent and more numerous than ever Movie experience can not hold a candle to the original JURASSIC PARK or even to JP2. JP3 is a merciful short 90 minutes - the last 10 minutes of which are credit it is. Nevertheless, I often checked my watch. The audience with whom I saw it left the theater in silence. <br /> <br /> A better choice: Watch the movie LEGALLY BLONDE. <br /> <br /> Dave
