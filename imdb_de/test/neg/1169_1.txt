I own a cottage on the lake, not far from Plainfield, WI. Ten minutes from the Gein property, to be exact. I saw his land, the cemetery where he was buried and where he dug, and I bought at a hardware store that used to belong to the Worden family. When we visited relatives in California, we decided to rent this movie. It was disgusting. The true story of Ed Gein is so disturbing and scary, why the creators of this garbage have decided to invent their own story. The actor who plays Ed is a very tall man, Ed was a very small, gentle and shy man. That's part of what makes his story so scary. He had no helper to dig the graves, and anyone who owns land in the area knows it's mostly sand with some dirt in it. You will not break much sweat if you dig a hole. They did not have to hire an actor with the body of a wrestler, but only research. And if the writing was not bad enough - there are NO mountains in Wisconsin, and I'm pretty sure 911 1957 was not available.
