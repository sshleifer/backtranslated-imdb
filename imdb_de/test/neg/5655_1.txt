Nickelodeon went down the toilet. They have kids who say things like "oh my god!" and "We're screwed up" <br /> <br /> This show encourages hate for people who do not look good or are not in the crowd. Sexual promiscuity is said to be okay by babbling babes over naked torsos. Not to mention the overweight boy undressing his shirt. The main characters avoid everyone from the ordinary. Carly's friend Sam, who may be a lesbian, beats the shit out of anyone who crosses the road, which says it's okay to be an idiot. This show has so much negative that nobody should see it! I give a 0 out of 10 !!!
