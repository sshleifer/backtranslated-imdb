I like all the main actors involved in this pretty bizarre movie. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce, and Hugo Weaving all proved to be some of the best and most capable actors, but I could not get involved. I do not know if it's because I do not understand the lifestyle or what, but I could not deal with this movie. Worse than that, the actors have made some of the ugliest drag queens I've ever seen. I think that was part of the point, I do not know. I realize that this is probably an insult, but I do not know what else to call it. I have to say, I bought the guys as a performer (the correct term?), But the story was just not very good or very interesting. I'll say that I do not usually appreciate costume designers, although I notice them when they're wrong or inappropriate, but I was very impressed with them. At least very creative, just not attractive, but I do not think they should be. I do not know that I am definitely not the target audience and would never see a performance of this kind of performer, but I would not see ballet or opera, so I do not know. If this is your kind of movie, you'll probably like it, but if it's not skipped, because it's ... well, not for most of us. I just checked that he won the costume design Oscar and I'll say it right. I must say, Ebert was not interested in this movie, although he liked him better than me.
