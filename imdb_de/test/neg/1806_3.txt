If you've ever heard the saying, "the book is always better than the movie," Heart of Darkness is no exception to the rule. I think it was much easier for me to understand the details of the novel in the film because I read the book in my English class. We discussed each section in detail, so I quickly understood the concept. I could not really understand the story while watching the movie. This may be because there were no discussions in class, but I suspect it's because I could not imagine my own pictures about the events of the novel. If you're the type of person who believes in this familiar saying, then drop the Heart of Darkness movie from your to-do list.
