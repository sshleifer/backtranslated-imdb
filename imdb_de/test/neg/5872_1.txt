First of all, this film is disgusting to the point of nausea, and I recommend that you avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again. I tried to look at it because it looked like it might look weird, but it soon got pretty annoying because the ice was made up of body parts and surprisingly graphic effects. It begins with a boy named Greg, who witnesses the cruel murder of an ice man (Greg then goes mad and becomes a title character) by seemingly mob assassins. There is no explanation for this murder, which makes it the biggest WTF moment in the entire movie. Other, lesser WTF moments are the surreal asylum that Greg (with evil clowns) goes to, a woman who speaks in tongues because she was possessed by the Holy Ghost (which has to do with anything I do not know) and the fact that Olivia "Holy shit has pumped her career so badly," "Hussey is in. <br /> <br /> None of these reasons is reason enough to look at that. The only reason for the character is Tuna, the one thin child with pillows stuffed under his shirt making him look like a fat kid, for some reason it seemed strange to me, I stayed awake late at night when I was supposed to watch this movie just to find out if there was a reason why they could not use a really fat kid for the role, even though I fell asleep before the end, I've learned from other reviews that Tuna is losing "weight." Okay, they did not have the budget to to achieve this realistically Proposal a n the director: How about if you do not overweight the character? <br /> <br /> That's it; If the prospect of tuna has not interested you enough, there is no other reason to acknowledge the existence of this film. If disgusting horror movies about ice are your preferred entertainment source, read the far superior "The Stuff" instead.
