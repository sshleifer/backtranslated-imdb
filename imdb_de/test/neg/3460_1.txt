Let me anticipate this by saying: I am a big George Clooney fan and I love John Krasinski in The Office. Well, that was me and I did that. <br /> <br /> This was the worst nail in the world and it took 113 minutes to tear it down. The startling boredom was interrupted only by my frequent attempts to read my watch and estimate when it would be over. Every funny scene was in the previews. All three. There was no real story, no character development, and the script was just bad. I had a colonoscopy that was more fun. <br /> <br /> The title should have been SuperDuper Bad. This movie is a barrier to a Razzie. There should be a whole lot of razzies. I want my money back.
