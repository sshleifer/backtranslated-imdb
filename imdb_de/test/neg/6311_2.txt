It is really terrible. Quaid works more than Shatner. The part in which Elvis comes in and says, "You can have anything," just kills everything that might have been good in this movie and that's bad enough. The drug consumption was completely covered in snow, the only thing that had to do with his life was the fact that he married his cousin. Quaid does not look like Lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. I wish this could be done in the future with someone who does not try so hard. A bigger budget would not hurt and maybe more about his actual life. I was very, very disappointed with Quaid. Do not look at this movie or you will be.
