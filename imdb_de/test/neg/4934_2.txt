It was hard for me to get through this. Every single turn is predictable. They sit there and just wait for it ... wait ... and yes, there it is! As you predicted at the beginning of the movie. Or 10 minutes out. And so on. <br /> <br /> Smart writing? No. <br /> <br /> Torture porn? No, there is no nudity. Other reviews that call this torture porno are most likely written by people who take heavy drugs. Unfortunately, there is no torture and no nudity. The only good thing about this movie is the end, but I will not spoil it. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2/10. A 1/10 would be a terrible B-movie. This movie should act better.
