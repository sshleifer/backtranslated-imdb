I am not sure if I agree with the director of this version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. I imagined Sir Percy Blakeney as a very calm, seemingly lazy aristocrat. This particular Sir Percy Blakeney seems to be overwhelmed with energy and volatility. I did not appreciate the Houdini, James Bond, and Mission Impossible style evolutions that Sir Percy had developed. In the previous versions, joke was the tool for escape, not technology. The figures of Marguerite and Chauvelin were not adequately portrayed. There seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters. <br /> <br /> I do not want to blame, because the reason for my dislike of this film is perhaps just a matter of difference interpretation. If the director's interpretation had been identical to mine, perhaps what I thought was a poor character representation might not have excited me. <br /> <br /> I had the version from 1982 very much favored dude. So also Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen. In my opinion, the style of this historical piece seems to have been lost with this last adaptation. I recommend keeping the previous versions, either the one from 1934 or the one from 1982. <br /> <br />
