I really wanted to like this movie. The previews looked a bit weird, but I figured they'd put most of the fun stuff in the previews. In this case, they did not just do that, but they made the clips look much funnier than the real movie. I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, The Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, etc. I wanted to like this movie, but it just never seemed to do anything. <br /> <br /> I've seen and done Get Shorty, do not bother about it. Too slow and not funny for me. This movie is certainly not better and if anything, it is worse. There were many opportunities for some good comedic moments, but none of them needed it. <br /> <br /> The acting was okay, but even John Travolta seemed toned down. Cedric was fine, but too active to be funny. Vince Vaughn and the skirt were pretty good and ready to be funny, but they just let everything go by. I wished they had been given a chance to work through the fun things they had set up, but instead it was always about the same old thing and just making fun of Vaughn and Rock (though they were never allowed to do that) really deliver punchline or comedy). Overall, this was a very disappointing movie and I am glad I only saw it on video. At least it was cheaper than the theater.
