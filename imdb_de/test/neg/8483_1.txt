Loki, the Norse god of evil, creates a mask that gives the wearer cartoon-like powers. By order of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the movie searching for the mask so that he can not inflict any further grief on humanity. Meanwhile, the owner of the mask takes on a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. If that sounds like a pretty thin plotline, that's it. In addition, the movie is handled improperly from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad. You can find worse movies, but you have to actively search for them. <br /> <br /> For the most part, Son of the Mask is presented at the preschooler's intellectual level, but this assumption seems unlikely given scenes such as the masked baby urinating in six different directions, including his father's. I asked my son, who he thought might have been the film's target audience, and he responded with "convicted offenders," apparently forgetting for the moment that the constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> But just make A bad movie is not a sin or hell would be overrun. What makes it a sin is that $ 72 million was spent on this piece of land. To put things in perspective, we saw "Son of the Mask" the next day, and my son and I watched "Good Night and Good Luck," a film that won six Academy Award nominations (including the best picture ) and was brought in for $ 7 million. Right. Only one tenth of the amount spent on Son of the Mask. This is then the sin - to flush good money into the sewer, if it could have been better if you could make films or feed hungry children, or almost any other purpose. The producers should be really ashamed.
