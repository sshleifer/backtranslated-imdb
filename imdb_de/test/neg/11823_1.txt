This must be one of the absolutely worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The writing and acting is only miserable. With Uncle Sam it's on the worst films of all time. But when I see that crap like this is capable of making videos, it's really an incentive to pursue my wild dreams of filming because I know I could do a better job than the makers of Killers.
