I was looking forward to this movie because everyone was talking about it being a good horror movie and finally a European one. Maybe my expectations were too high. <br /> <br /> It starts with a good, quiet horror / shock sequence, but instantly lets you down in the following scenes, where the action begins as a drama and drama. The motivation / life of the characters does not reveal itself better than any "TV" drama. That holds to the end. <br /> <br /> As far as the horror part of the movie is concerned, it's certainly a good idea and another, but ALL scenes are of the kind seen. <br /> <br /> Overall, my idea of ​​this movie was that he had a good concept that was inserted into a mediocre story, bad drama and less than tolerable plot holes. <br /> <br />
