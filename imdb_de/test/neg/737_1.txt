We really do not know where to start when we talk about this movie. But we start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that the person who wrote / produced / directed this film never read the book. Because they missed the whole point. SATIRICAL, no horror. Just a hint. Second, the bath scene. Enough said. Third, the added characters. The sketchy Gothic Frenchwoman and her black side, who enjoys holding hands and beating the wheel. We do not understand where that came from. And then there was the casting. All were really unlikely. We were very excited that Catherine and Mr. Tilney had landed together because they were so unlikely that no one would ever wish to see them happy. And ... the music. We believe that the BBC producers run out of money and plundered their grandmother's attic. And they found old records. Saxophone, weeping female voices and occasionally electric guitar. * shudder * <br /> <br /> Also, the best line ever: "Since you left, the white rose bush has died of grief." If anyone has an explanation, we would like to hear it. Because it makes absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> We're still wondering what everyone was thinking about when they cruelly published this pathetic apology for a movie in public. We believe that this should be considered a federal offense. Torture is illegal. <br /> <br /> This movie is by far the worst we have seen so far. And I have seen many movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: Give this movie to whomever you hate. They will see it and want to kill themselves. And we agree with a previous post, we would, if possible, award these 0 stars. DO NOT LOOK!! And we strongly suspect that all those who have commented on this film so far have been involved in its production. Or were mentally crazy. These are the only reasons for us to give a positive rating.
