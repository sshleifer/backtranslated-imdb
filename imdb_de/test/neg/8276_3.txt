The title of this review summarizes what I feel about this movie. I can not imagine which audience there would be for this thing, if not for the die-hard fan of Slasher movies of the 80s, who just has to see everything from that time. Otherwise, do not even waste your time with it. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to most films of this kind: Something terrible happens with one of the characters in the opening scene, who ravaged a bloodthirsty killer raging murderously. I know already. To be honest, none of these '80s slashers were known for their originality, so I can not just make out the sense of harp on the film. <br /> <br /> But where the movie fails is in its suspense and murder sequences. I've seen some pretty creepy slasher movies from the eighties that had much lower budgets. This creates no real tension. The director here and there gives some nice camera angles and semi-professional directing touches, but they mean nothing if you're not scared. The Gore is also pretty tame, so anybody who sees these things with the intention of seeing the cool make-up effects of the 80s will be sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film manages to clap dully. Honestly, the key ingredient for almost every slasher is the tight pace - you have to move things forward quickly and put the murder sets on stage at regular intervals, because, let's be honest, we do not watch these things for the Great Characterization and Representation. But the tempo, whether due to the script or the editor, is over. The murders are distributed at irregular intervals, so we have some lengthy scenes (which were no doubt intended to build "character"), which serve only to bore you and make you pray for the next kill (what, how As a rule, this does not work out so well anyway. Do not expect the killer to scare anything original or even distant He (or she?) wears a jogging suit, a fencing mask and his ( or you?) Main weapon is a sword, I bet the writer was just thinking that he had found an original "cool" murder weapon, but the idea is simply impractical and stupid, and it does not pay much attention to that "Whodunnit" nature of the film as if they had either forgotten or not put any red herrings in the mix to throw us off. <br /> <br /> I have the feeling that the people behind it tried something decent to make it and decent, and sometimes it turns out that their intentions in producing a quality movie were probably a little more sincere than unlike countless other knockoff slashes of that time. The attempt fails for the most part, but there's pretty good acting (at least for this type of movie). There's an attempt at characterization, but none of that means anything in the end, so ... What a waste here. All she does is stop the conspiracy and let the murder sequences appear as if they can not come fast enough. Old 80s Slashers, anyway, just have a look, just to say that You saw it. There is a perfection in all of us. But do not expect to be blown away or something. What we have here is a very mildly entertaining Slasher movie that leaves no real impression.
