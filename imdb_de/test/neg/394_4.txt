Really, average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see that. <br /> <br /> The spectacle was average (maybe slightly above average), the camera load was average (actually below average, the picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry.) The plot was good, but moving at such a slow pace and was not used well. <br /> <br /> That could have been so much more if it was not going at a snail's pace and we looked more into the backgrounds of the characters. <br /> <br /> All we see are flashbacks of Alice here and there and how her home life is so "bad" (her mother is a working-class woman trying to put an end to her and her daughter We see a flashback when she was in high school and her friend tells her, "Tell your mother to make some better food" and "everyone says it's your mother." Yeah, that's embarrassing, but why are you running away. <br /> <br /> I could definitely see if her mother was drunk or someone was abusing her, but there was nothing wrong with her house except that she was embarrassed. How immature! <br /> <br /> We did not even get a glimpse into the couple's life (except that they prostitute themselves for a while and the woman who forgot her name gave up her baby when she was 9 months old) .) That could have been much more. There could have been Alice abused by her drunken mother to go to Florida with her friend, but then she became a prostitute. Or something like this, then the plot of the movie (that is, Alice, a girl with probably 90% of the American population (WORKING CLASS) fleeing to Florida, but then distracted by a prostitute. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why it won an award in Sundance (it must have been against a really weak contest to win that one award.) <br /> <br /> Also, it seemed to me Alice's Boston / New England accent of being forced. It did not seem to be real. (I should know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now live in Georgia.) <br /> <br /> 4/10 In my opinion, your time is not really worth it.
