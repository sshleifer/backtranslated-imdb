I go to the blockbuster, pick a random movie, got it, and yes. <br /> <br /> The ... was a good sexual headache porn. For me, this movie was good for his sexual stuff, but not so much for the horror and suspense. It was ... magical ... <br /> <br /> The tension ... not as good as I would have expected. I wanted to sit on the edge of my seat, hoping to jump open in fear, instead I lay down on the couch and did not see much. <br /> <br /> The quality ... not good at all. I mean, if you pay close attention while the people are in the COLD mountains and carry hardly anything. It does not make much sense either. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a crap, not really exciting and a pretty sexual movie, then you have this.
