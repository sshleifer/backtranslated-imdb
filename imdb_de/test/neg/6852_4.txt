This is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999, when a strange disease broke out and ... I stopped worrying. These are probably two people living in an apartment complex above or below each other. There is a leak, and a plumber puts a hole in the floor of the man so you can see into the apartment below the apartment. Since there is a crisis, much of the dialogue is actually news reports ... <br /> <br /> Sounds promising? <br /> <br /> Not really. <br /> <br /> I got distracted and started doing other things, which is deadly in a subtitle movie. Basically, I started not to watch what made the events seem even more surreal when I looked up. <br /> <br /> It might work for you, not for me.
