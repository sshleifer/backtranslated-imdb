I liked every character on the show from the beginning, except for Reba herself. She looks more sacred than you, and frankly a big bully. And that stinks because she's in every scene and every episode. In the later seasons Van becomes unlikely, like a parody of his former self. and Kyra goes around mockingly and is miserable. The first three or four seasons are pretty good if you overlook Reba. Towards the end it is pretty dark. In each episode, Barbara jean goes around and is stupid, Reba is mean to her, but poor Ole Barbara jean desperately wants Reba to like her, which leads Barabara to tell jean Reba how great she is every episode. I think it's pretty obvious that Reba has problems with self-esteem and wants to be seen as the forgiving saint. It's a shame, because apart from that the show had so much potential.
