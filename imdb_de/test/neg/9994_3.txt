In this film we are invited to watch the descent into a moral and emotional funk of a person one can not begin with. What was the meaning of the movie? To show that it would have been better not to have IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, by the way - in order to keep the integrity of our hero intact? Barely. He behaves at the party at the beginning of the film exactly as he behaves from the book after his triumphant reading, so his humiliation is a matter of degree. Must we care enough about Capote to take his claim seriously that he and the murderer Perry Smith are kindred spirits, the former having all the breaks and the latter having none? Mr. Capote's situation did not affect me, I'm afraid if that was the central idea, he was wasted for me. But even if I knew why the filmmakers were visiting this pointless project, the chunky storytelling would still have made me so bored. Hoffman gives a bravura performance without any emotional impact, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I long for more. Desolate beyond belief
