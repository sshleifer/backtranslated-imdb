What a cast ... and what a waste. Seriously, if a movie contains Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone, you would expect some quality. The film, however, is a big mess with an unlikely story that can not seem to stop making twists and turns. Yeah, I think they thought they were really smart with all of that. <br /> <br /> The story is not just messy and unlikely, it's not really original either. It uses elements from earlier and much better poker-based films. But for me it really was the many pointless twists and turns in the movie that made it. It made the story so unlikely that you saw it. In addition, the script remains filled with holes, stupid poker mistakes, and things that just do not make much sense. Why would anyone especially compete against a card player known as the best cheater in the game? That's what the movie is all about and it's about, but it just never made much sense to me. <br /> <br /> Although the film has a great cast, it still feels like most actors are miscast in their roles. I do not know what Stuart Townsend is about. He's a good actor, but in most roles he always feels out of place. Maybe it's his look, I do not know. This was basically why he was replaced in The Lord of the Rings: The Companions. Also Thandie Newton is not very good in her "strong" female role and actually quite annoying. And what was the point where Melanie Griffith was there? Oh, I think I could go ahead with casting the film and could complain even more about the Jamie Foxx character's lack of time, but I think you've got my point now. Damian. <br /> <br /> Nieman is not exactly an original writer / director and he does not handle his own material well. Scenes often feel incoherent, they try to use too many characters, and everything about the movie is flat and predictable. In addition, the film sometimes has bad editing, which also does not contribute to making this film look like a seamless whole. The movie was also a major box office and no wonder that Damian Nieman has not made a movie since then. <br /> <br /> Too much chaos to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
