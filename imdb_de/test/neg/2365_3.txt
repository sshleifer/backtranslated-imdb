"TNT Jackson" is not completely unsurpassed. But either the version I saw on DVD was edited with a Weed Whacker, or the script itself is the lowest level of Grind House / Blaxploitation Sausage. Or maybe both. <br /> <br /> Jeanne Bell is said to have been Playmate at some point in her career, and the film uses the connection by showing his breasts at least twice as often as needed (including a fun topless fight scene) I'm sure she should be funny). I admit, they are very nice. Still, she looks average and does not have the look of a Foxy Brown, not even a Cleopatra Jones. She does have her moments as an actress in the movie, but it would have been nice if the director had pushed her a little harder or the script had made her do more than show an "attitude" and kick people , <br /> Speaking of kicking people: The fight scenes (the other supposed reason to watch a movie like this) are pretty poorly done. There is no real choreography to speak of here, only people who put their feet and fists in the general direction of their opponents. A small exception is a nice moment with an opponent equipped with butterfly folding knives. Another sequence is almost at the very end, where an obvious stunt double for Bell (and perhaps for Stan Shaw) takes a few steps and does some sensible sweeps and preliminary work before Bell / "Jackson" crashes her enemy's liver. Shaw collapses and the script just stops. (Again, I admit that this has been in the tradition of Shaw Brothers Quickies since time immemorial.) There are a few supportive actors who are actually better at making the film worthy of "thinking of Joe" and the man holding the right-hand man the drug lord plays). There is a reasonably decent funky soundtrack that complements the on-screen action and adds a star to the rating itself. There is a semi-shady sex scene that almost manages to be effective despite its impact. <br /> <br /> This scene is for hardcore fans of Blaxploitation only. I saw it out of pure curiosity and I'm not sorry I took my time. But I can not imagine that I would take the time to see it again unless I decide to write a dissertation on the pop culture intersections of "Kung Fu Theater" and "Foxy Brown."
