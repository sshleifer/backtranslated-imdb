This movie is stupid and very short to be a funny movie. Unhappy "Easterners" are not pleased to be in the West. So they hire a drunken carmaker (John Candy) to take them east. Visual gags were just not funny enough to carry this. And Richard Lewis gets on your nerves very quickly. but then I honestly do not like him in everything he does. Ed Lauter is funny as a limping villain. <br /> <br /> The movie was dedicated to Candy. He died of a serious heart attack ten days before the movie's closing. A stand-in and a digital enhancement allowed Candy's character to be seen in the final scenes. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us really good knee beats, the belly laughs in his career. This movie simply was not the caliber of its best. Also featured in the film: William Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Greene and Rodney A. Grant.
