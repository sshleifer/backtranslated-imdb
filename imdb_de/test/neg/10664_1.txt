In Bollywood, it's not uncommon for worthless films to turn into hits, flop good movies, and be good actors who do not make it big. AKS is such a movie, Himesh after a music director and The Singer tried to play Hell Man just because his songs became a hit, which means he should become an actor next. The producers were sure that the movie might work, the songs were also a hit and of course Himesh did his cheap advertising as usual. <br /> <br /> The film tells such a bad story, such a bad direction, so bad acting that you contract. <br /> <br /> Indian rickshaws in Germany, stunts by Himesh and lots of stupidity Himesh's hat is intact, even when he's in the car, which is somersault <br /> <br /> The direction is bad Music saves grace, even though most of the songs sound the same <br /> <br /> Himesh tries hard but sad, his feeling scenes are a joke, lack of expression, he is best suited for his music director and some vocals. He cuts off a sad picture. Hansika is terrible. Malika is fine. Sachin Khedekar is fine, Dars Han Jhariwala Ham
