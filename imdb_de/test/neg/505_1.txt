The notorious Western was at the time the biggest budgeted catastrophe in Hollywood history. I was "lucky enough to see the full 220-minute version in a theater in 1990. It was really amazing how bad the movie was! <br /> <br /> They had a great cast, a story based on a real incident (a fight between foreigners and Americans in the 19th century), beautiful landscapes ... so, what went wrong? Three words - director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after "The Deer Hunter" that he made this god terribly western. He is not completely to blame. His previous film "The Deer Hunter" was considered a masterpiece, and United Artists gave him the freedom to do anything. They left him alone ... and everything went awry. Costs went out of control and Cimino insisted on repeating sequences until they were perfect. <br /> <br /> First off, the sound is awful. Whole sequences pass and you can not recognize a word that the characters say. For example, Jeff Bridges' character is introduced during a dance sequence, but I still have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! This is the director's fault - he should have ensured that the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are flown with so much dust that you can barely tell what's going on. The plot does not make much sense and Cimino has taken the liberties with the facts - in the real story, only one person was killed - Cimino makes it a massacre. Although there are some beautiful sequences that are completely destroyed by a lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. Even the bad tone was not the fault of the theater - all the prints sound that way. <br /> <br /> This garbage has finally closed United Artists and was the end of Ciminos career. A textbook example of a director who is so full of himself that he does not realize what he is doing. Jeff Bridges said this is the worst movie he has ever done. This is from a guy who did "Tron"! An absolute must. <br /> <br /> There is a pretty good book called "The Final Cut" that describes the entire disaster. This will be a 1. I wish IMDb had negative numbers - it deserves it!
