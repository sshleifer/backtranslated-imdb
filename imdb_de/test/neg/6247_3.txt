Hmmmmmmm - Cheerleader massacre. Let me think - girls in high school are slashed, except the nice girl survives. I have it. Next movie. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised that this movie was made in 2003. I really thought he stopped making those movies in the 80's. This was really your run of the Mill Slasher movie with youthful eye candy, dumb male horn dogs, even more stupid male adults and hot teacher. It continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the forest. We have seen everything before. <br /> <br /> However, there were some interesting plot twists that put him above the normal me-to-slashers. So if you have a few brain cells to fry and have 2 hours to kill - you could do worse.
