IFC Town and Country is the lead now, and now. The difference between this stinker and this Pink Panther rip-off is that Town and Country was observable. This is not. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the actors signed up to make money in Europe for someone else. Belushi is particularly irritating. His scene with Candy (Dom DeLuise the Z class) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of the talentless shepherd, and I bet the prisoners in Gitmo would crack like walnuts! <br /> <br /> The real "crime" (besides being green) is the character of Shepherd: a mouse woman who gets a casino in Monte Carlo for half a million dollars! If you buy that, I have an oceanfront property in Arizona that you might be interested in!
