CUJO is a film adaptation of a novel of the same name, written by Stephen King. <br /> <br /> I've never read the novel before, but scanning the comment page gave me a glimpse. I noticed an indication of the change in the end. <br /> <br /> The storyline of the movie looks like this: A Bernard dog is bitten by a rabid bat and claims a killer. <br /> <br /> The storyline now sounds pretty worn after being made in different films. However, it could have been something new when King wrote the novel. Or maybe King's novel has shot the story that was never shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing but the dog being bitten. Nothing else happens - nothing sinister, nothing funny, nothing that gives the characters more depth, and nothing interesting in other ways. I found it difficult to get through this section and kept shouting at the TV: "Come on, get started!". The events I saw on screen were reminiscent of a television movie from the drama genre or an extended episode of a television soap opera. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the film that had a particular focus, so it could not even work at the soap opera level. The dog was the best character in the movie, but there was not enough screen time in this section. There was nothing to suggest why this dog would later commit a murder walk. <br /> <br /> Something had finally happened after the 40-minute mark. The dog suddenly turned from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine. It started attacking some people. There was also an interesting chase between cat and mouse when two characters were trapped in a car and could not walk because the dog would attack them. Even in this overlong second half, the tension would build up well before she died again. It was just a stop-go situation that was repeated over and over until the movie finished. <br /> <br /> Without betraying the end, I can tell you that it was very formulaic and unworthy of a Stephen King story. <br /> <br /> The exciting scenes on screen are exciting to look at. Some great camera angles make the dog's evil nature threatening when it attacks humans. This is especially important because, as others have mentioned, a Saint Bernard dog is by no means as frightening as a Rottweiler. Unfortunately, the film can not use exciting music to support the pictures on the screen. The music is too melodramatic and not exciting. This may fit a TV movie, but it looks incredibly inappropriate in a dark movie that presents the viewer with a living nightmare. <br /> <br /> This brings me to a bigger problem with this movie - The Photography. The camera work and especially the choice of colors give the impression that this is a very cheap TV movie that you would expect as a feature film on Channel 5 here in the UK, from which I am writing this commentary. <br /> <br /> The two best performers deliver good acting performances that breathe life into the boring segments of the movie. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should be given credit for doing good work with the bad material they receive. I could forgive a few short moments of transcription by paying more attention to dialogue, which in my opinion would have allowed no other interpretation. I will not judge the other actors because they have next to nothing. <br /> <br /> As a fan of SALEM'S LOT and STEPHEN KING'S IT, both films of famous Stephen King novels, I had high expectations for this film. However, it turned out to be a massive disappointment. <br /> <br /> Overall, I generally do not recommend fans of Stephen King or horror movies to see CUJO. This is one of the moments when I have to recommend the book rather than the movie. Hopefully it will bring the story to life in a way that the movie did not make.
