I suspect that the producers of this low-budget space / horror movie wanted a serious movie, but the director had his heart for a spoof. So ... we get that. Set in an abandoned spaceship 1000 years in the future and populated with characters and props straight from the 90s. The set is an industrial complex, maybe an oil tanker or whatever. They are used as seen, so that the controls consist of old TV sets. One place is obviously the staff's lunch break and has an old TV and VCR as well as a water cooler with a plastic box. Tiny Lister and Coolio get the best lines and argue throughout the story. The dialogue is packed with terms that are quite outdated even now ("A-OK, Daddy-O"), but then maybe the 30th century is very retro? If the captain declares that the cargo of the ship is a load of coffins from "The Transylvania Station," you know that all this is a concern. It's a bit alien, part JasonX, shameless rip off of the best sci-fi and horror titles. Once Casper VanDien even tells his pilot to do it with a straight face. This movie would have been better if it would just let everyone run on satire, but they're still trying to make the story serious ... maybe supporters were on set that day. Not a bad boredom killer if you're not too picky. FX are as good as the sets are bad.
