About twenty years ago, Charles Bukowski was a hero of mine. I blindly accepted the image created by intellectual types and seen in various films. Of course, I've never met the intellectual types who have prescribed Bukowski as heroes. In hipster video stores and record shops, they are usually safe to find behind the counter. These people barely spoke and when asked they usually smiled and nodded in a vague direction. They were useless when it came to finding a particular title, but their shelves were always stocked with strange and unique titles. In order to be accepted into the secret hipster club, I believed that I wanted to give up my civic education and support the counterculture. <br /> <br /> My introduction to Bukowski began with the movie Barfly, the late 80s movie starring Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. I was a fan of Rourke at the time. He also embodied a kind of modern, fantastic antihero, a brooding intellectual guy. That appealed to me then. Barfly's hero sneered at the gathering. A mid-thirties tramp who lives life without ties does not answer anyone - oh - and be recognized as a genius by a hot female literary snob. After that I read Post Office and Hollywood. Later, Bukowski's experience with the film began. Allow me now to get to the latest film based on Bukowski's Factotum book that I have read and enjoyed. Bukowski takes the form of Chinaski in this novel. I often wonder where Bukowski ended and Chinaski started. 20 years after Barfly, the fictional Bukowski movie is still the same. I have seen about an hour of the movie and have not seen any signs of a cracking of the facade. That's why Factotum Bukowski was my hero. Chinaski is pretty (played by Matt Dillon). He has clean, decent hair, styled but not over the top. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool. Chinaski goes from job to job, ignoring and / or fighting with different bosses. He unscrews two floozies, one of which he lives with, goes out to come back with little feedback. Chinaski is his own man, and we never see him as an emote. He is a sterile, one-dimensional type, James Dean archetype. Factotum lies with the viewer. This happens because the idea of ​​a man (a writer) is abused without consequences. A poor man who suffers for his art. What could be cooler than that? Suppose there are some truths in factotum in which the events took place. What the public lacks is the pain that covers Chinaski's existence. Perhaps in this movie and in most films, it's about leaving the world for 80 minutes, full of consequences, pain and blackmail with an anti-social womanizer who smokes, talks, drinks, cools with aloofness. One who rejects the traditional behavior of work and family. My hero used to be the movie Bukowski. That would have worked a long time ago. It was easier then. Now I have to claim a hero. Things are not that easy. Hipster logic and movie renderings of counterculture icons do not provide a solution or even ask questions.
