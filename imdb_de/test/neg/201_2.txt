Despite its list of stars on the B, C and D lists, this film is a complete waste of 90 minutes. The plot with its few peaks was very predictable. It was so stupid that I can not believe that I take the time to even write a review. To his merits, Flex has gained more and more ability to act since he played Michael Jackson in a TV-produced film a few years ago. Tangi, on the other hand, retired when she was more talented a few years ago in her role as Felicity's Flunkie. As I sat watching the train wreckage of a movie with its pathetic production and terrible sound quality, other four-letter words came to my mind to qualify my opinion on this film. In an effort to keep my writings G Rated, I simply say that this movie is another four-letter word beginning with an L. LAME.
