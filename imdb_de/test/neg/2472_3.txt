Well, it's a standard Hollywood Schmaltz that you can see after a mile. It is partly pleasing, but oh so predictable. I have to admit that I did not really enjoy it, but I find it hard to please, and many of my friends loved it. <br /> <br /> It's pretty cute and the actors are performing well. It's a beautiful setting and the eye candy is pretty good. But the irritatingly predictable, unoriginal and really boring plot holds the movie back. Personally, I can imagine better ways to spend a few hours of my life. <br /> <br /> The genre of chick-flicks gets a little bad press, but there are really good chick-flicks out there; that is not one of them.
