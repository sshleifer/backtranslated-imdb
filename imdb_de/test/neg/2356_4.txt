Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks I had not discovered, and I was less than halfway overwhelmed. The French title "La Cinqui√®me colonne" (the fifth column, a very evocative phrase for underground espionage and sabotage companies) set my expectations as high as the images of the finale on the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <Basically, saboteur is as carefree as the 39 steps (note that this is another evocative phrase, even McGuffin as a title), but it lacks the most humor (the characters are down to earth) and definitely not that fast , As a chase film across the US from LA to NY, Saboteur pulls his feet from sequence to sequence. The sequence on the ranch's beautiful ranch? Nice ranch, nice villain, but on the whole pretty tame, that's no use. The meeting with the blind man, mixing with the circus people, the soda city sequence, the NY ball sequence? They fall flat and bring more characters with very little added tension. <br /> <br /> One big issue I can point out is the relationship between the leaders Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, who are not building like Robert Donat, and Madeleine Caroll in The 39 Stages. Therefore, the entire narrative structure varies depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes bring us closer to the end, because it is not clear whether the hook of the hero lies in front of the police, the bad guys or his measures to end the planned sabotage. In the 39 steps it was clearly listed as "1 / Escape from the Police" (so you know the hero can not just go to the police), then 2 / "he ran for his life and for the rogues, for his innocence to prove." <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock from the war propaganda of the 1940's, I would advise you to prefer the foreign correspondent saboteur. They are both chasing films with a catchy finale, really a gripping and not only sightseeing in Foreign Correspondent, as well as beautifully effective scenes (the screen crowds, the tulip fields, the strange mills ...).
