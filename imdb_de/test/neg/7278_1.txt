Tagline: The lucky ones died ... before I looked at it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a 1920s Bulgarian movie, so I can not say that this is the worst movie ever made, but that's certainly the worst movie I have I've hardly ever remembered it. <br /> <br /> All I can remember is a family of stupid people who do not do anything right. Their car has one of four wheels stuck in the sand, so they decide to do nothing and get ready to spend the rest of their lives there. Then there is an old man who is aware of the existence of a gang of cannibals in the whereabouts but never considered the idea of ​​reporting the fact to the police. <br /> <br /> And talking about the police ... If those freaks had been eating people there for years, many people must have disappeared ... How come the sheriff has no idea? <br /> <br /> But after the first five minutes, I stopped asking questions or something. The rest is boring. A hallucinating unbelievable boredom. <br /> <br /> I will be merciful and will not talk about the dialogues. And the acting. And the effects. <br /> <br /> I'll just mention the last scene in which the freaky girl defeats a snake (the snakes, you end up, what the hell do they have to do with the story?) with a sniper Precise stone-throwing demonstrating Mr. Craven's complete disregard for reality and for things that occur on Earth in general. <br /> <br /> I think there was rioting when the movie was first released in 1977. <br /> <br /> Even if a cannibal is eaten, this would not be an appropriate punishment for the director for this attack on the intelligence services.
