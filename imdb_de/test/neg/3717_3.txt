The movie has weird annoying characters, weird, inexplicable slapsticks and an insurmountable dialogue about smoking. The film has a fictional plot of a search for a bitchy, empty woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn) for love. Although, anyone who would ever like Jeanne's character, personality, or reading dialogue, I can not say. Except that she likes to smoke. <br /> <br /> Sarah Jessica Parker gives an interesting character performance (who likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott does his best to look pretty and soulful (when he smokes). And what is Jennifer Aniston doing there? Oh, she's not really enough for someone to take care of her. (But she likes to smoke.) <br /> <br /> That's a waste of time. I do not even know how I got through the movie as much as I did. I can not even believe that I spent the time writing this, except to warn others of its banality. Does anyone need a cigarette?
