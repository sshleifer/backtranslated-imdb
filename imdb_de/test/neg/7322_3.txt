This movie makes about as much sense as a series of "Ozzie & Harriet" or "Father Knows Best". An old copy of Reader's Digest (circa 1962) would provide more insight into modern life or the relationship between a father and a daughter than this weird mix. <br /> <br /> I was surprised with Diane Keaton. She seems to be sleeping through the movie. (Given the title of the film, I realize that her role has been secondary, but even Martin Short has managed to create a definite supportive character.) I can understand the appeal of an imaginary world that emerges in a good romantic comedy. But this movie is the prozac version of an imaginary world. I am afraid that anyone can enjoy it as a pure fantasy.
