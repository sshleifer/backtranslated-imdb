I started to be interested in the movie. It seemed like a serious drama involving death, grief and healing, with a realistic human conflict. Unfortunately, it has not kept believable characters. Too many characters in this film have been portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. See, I know that should not be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in scripting and characterization. <br /> <br /> The acting was fine, the writing not so much. At some point, James Brolins character is berated because he has appeared at a picnic under the clothes. He states that it will not work to order him. His new wife says when he goes home and gets changed, she'll break down later. That's a howler. This movie had some unintentionally funny lines. <br /> <br /> It was hard to take care of James Brolin's character. When he so gladly gave his new wife the things of his first wife and even silenced his daughter, I lost the most sympathy. Who really cares what happens to him? I must confess that I did not finish the film. If there has been a value of 180 in the last 45 minutes, let me know. It was just uncomfortable to watch and so predictable that I felt I could not finish it.
