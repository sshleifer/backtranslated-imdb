Can you believe that a college professor made this movie ????? <br /> <br /> The same man who did DHOOP <br /> <br /> The movie is awful and has some of the weird scenes that ever happened /> <br /> The main message is nice, but poorly rendered <br /> <br /> The film looks like a collage of amateurish scenes, miscasts.etc and poor performances. <br/> <br /> Direction and everything is bad <br /> <br /> Music is okay <br /> <br /> Emraan's cheeky series works and he does well Tusshar is bad Tanushree and Isha are bad Paresh Anger when he looks in the mirror
