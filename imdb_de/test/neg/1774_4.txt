Casper Van Dien ... what can I say? I enjoy the guy! His films give them a certain flair that is not brought by the director or producer, but by him! Check recycled parcels ... Rip off better films ... check. Wood show ... check. It's not that Van Dien is a bad actor (he was successful in Hollywood glory as a Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow). He was not offered a script worthy of his talents. and yes, he has a different acting talent than eye candy. This film offers a small hint of what Van Dien has to offer, but is jammed with the production of it all. The script can be better developed (see U-Turn by Oliver Stone). The direction can be better used (see Robert Rodriguez 'From Dusk Til Dawn). The DP could have made the desert more exotic (see Russ Meyer's Faster Pussycat Faster Kill!). This script is weak because we have seen this many times, so double / triple crosses are expected. The direction is weak because it offers nothing new and telegraphs many of the weak script moments. The cinematography sometimes paints a beautiful autumn desert, but at other times it does not exploit the scorching light, and the initial sequence is terrible in cornflower blue. Now for the play. Van Dien shows his Jake some grace and charisma. He is neither too methodical nor too disciplined in his role. A good balance, especially since the rest of the cast seems too distracted, how they should behave in this film (bad script or bad direction ... make your opinion). The only other person to mention is Bryan Brown's villain, for he is the only true merit for the acting in this film. Up and coming actors forget about trying to act on the green screen, trying to learn how to behave in a gruesome script, and taking notes on Bryan Brown in this movie. He gives his role additional depth and is a nice counter-roll to Van Dien's character. Jake either seems to be always one step ahead or in control of every situation, whether or not she is beyond his control. The Femme Fatale is weak (after all, this is a desert noir) and is another nail in the coffin of this movie (you decide ... script or direction). The Rosalita figure should have been pushed forward in the film instead of being pushed into the background to make way for the real Femme Fatale. So watch the movie for Van Dien and Brown; and for fun, skip a rock over the action holes punched in the movie.
