My God, the things that went on for entertainment in this country ... <br /> <br /> This is * not * the "Tom and Jerry" you enjoyed on Saturday morning, with an unfortunate cat and a smart one Mouse. This is a much earlier animated series that features a pair of Mutt and Jeff clones that break into various scratches that lead to one of the then-typical dance-skeletal gags that made up much of the early animation This particularly vile excursion, which was originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of black stage comedians of the time, crashed the couple during their flight to Africa in the sea, which requires exaggerated make-up makeup "Negro" dialect and "feet, do not miss me now" - situations. <br /> <br /> It just shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this movie, the American view of the Africans has not progressed much. On the other hand, at least one of them apparently had a pilot's license.
