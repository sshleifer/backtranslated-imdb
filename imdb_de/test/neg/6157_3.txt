The story and the characters really needed REALLY work. The world idea is somehow neat, but no one bothered to develop anything of it, either through exposure or through conspiracy. Despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film, it makes sense to use no exposure because no one is new to the world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) get off track and get lost and presented to the windbreaks and the fat, lazy, wealthy people in the museum, we do not get a real idea of ​​who those people are or why we should be interested in one of them. Smart movies have ways to do this simply by making the characters live in the world. Simple things, like ordering a drink in a bar or talking about something in the past - these are things that make the movie world memorable, not endless shots of crappy planes and cheap CG effects when someone tries to make loops in an ultralight. <br /> <br /> If this is too difficult for you, here's a little tip - take a look at the different locations. If everything gets disconnected because you come by often, stay in one place for a while and let the characters talk a little bit. The unnecessary crap should be removed. Eliminate the entire scene of wind lovers. Disappear the stuffy museum people. Get rid of all that shitty flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story. Leave the whole thing on a big plane or something. Get people to talk about something we care about. <br /> <br /> Hey, let go of Bill Paxton. Let the film center around Tasker's character and his relationship with the Byron robot. <br /> <br /> In fact, the biggest problem with the movie is that we do not care about anyone, because nobody takes the time to explain either their motivations or immerse themselves in their characters. We do not like Matt (good, because he was played by Bill Paxton, among others). He's a villain who does not pay enough to let the androids Byron go. And this action has even less importance than most because of three important points: <br /> <br /> 1. Byron is a murderer. 2. Byron is indestructible 3. Byron can go anytime he pleases. <br /> <br /> We try to like Byron, because there is a kind of pathos, but it is largely undeveloped. All we have left is a whiny, glassy-eyed robot guy, who for a moment seems muffled and wooden, and practically crazy the next moment. We do not know why or how he develops emotions, but he knows that he killed someone. We do not know why he murdered someone or the circumstances of this grisly event because it is not developed. We can not feel sorry for him if we do not know the story. All we know is that he is killing people. And he likes Bill Paxton. <br /> <br /> We do not hate Tasker enough (in part because he's played by the good guy Mark Hamill), as he is rude and reckless, but nothing out of the ordinary does his character - a post-apocalyptic peace officer. He sure kills Montclaire (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they're drug dealers who grow poppy seeds for heroin. And they shoot at him first. He does not kill anyone who does not stand in his way or does not try to physically hurt him first. This also applies to the final argument in the museum. He uses a hint of police brutality against a lazy dilettante (F. Murray Abraham is wasted in this role), and everyone else draws a gun at him. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand what Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), Tasker's partner, is all about. After only 10 minutes with Matt, she is ready to change sides, despite her cry of loyalty, and despite the trash with which Matt talked and beat her. If that's love, then I choose hatred every day. <br /> <br /> Really. Paxton's character is about as adorable as Simon in "True Lies" or Pvt. Hudson from "Aliens". Does anyone notice him in these films? No why? Because he is an idiot and a loser. Why put him at the top of this film?
