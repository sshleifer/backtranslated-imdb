When does this action take place? It has to take place after the first movie, because Kuzco knows that Pacha and Chicha have their third child, but can not take place after the second film because Kronk does not get a girlfriend or wife or anything like that? You never see her on the show. <br /> <br /> Why does Kuzco go to school too? The whole plot of the show is that Kuzco goes to school so he can become emperor. But was not he an emperor before? And who is Kaiser while he becomes Emperor? Should not that be Yzma? Or was Yzma already fired in this timeline? And if that's true, why is he waiting for him not to become Empresses? In addition, he said in the first film that he had been trained by private tutors to emperor from birth. So he should know what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Kronk. Why is Kronk a student? He's about 25 years old, they said in the first movie. He is an adult who goes to high school. Does anyone think he's an idiot? I really like Kronk, but I think because of his age and because everyone knows that he works for Yzma, he should have been a teacher. Being a home teacher would be just right in his alley. Malina, is very unlikely. She assumes to be Kuzco's love interest / moral compass. But a lot of time, she comes domineering and knows everything. She says in general that I like "I should be proud because I am pretty and smart". <br /> <br /> She has ESP when it comes to Kuzco, and knows when he gets into trouble, when he cheats, or even when he sings the Hot Hot Hottie song in his head, even though she's the lead, the school paper and holds in all classes A +. <br /> <br /> She seems more interested in forcing Kuzco to do the right thing and do well at school than to go out with him. In fact, she seems more motherly to Kuzco than a love interest. <br /> <br /> Yzma. When I bought up before Yzma tried to ruin Kuzco, she became Empress. Not sure how to work with the launch and everything. Yzma seems to relive the first movie in each episode. In almost every show she performs, she transforms Kuzco into an animal in the hope that he will fail a lesson. (There are only three times that I can think that did not happen.) The jokes about the age of Yzma are not as smart on the show as the movie. And classic jokes about Yzma are used to death on the show (like "Pull the Level, Krunk!", Roller Coaster, and the Lab). <br /> <br /> Also some other points that make no sense in this series. The fact that whenever Kuzco is assigned something, everyone acts like this task, he will pass or fail the class, but he seems to pass every task he has been given. So why is a task so important? <br /> <br /> Who seriously rules the kingdom while this happens? Do you have a consul or a steward? You will never see anyone who rules the kingdom, unless Kuzco has thrown back his powers or Yzma is an empress. Why is Kuzco going to a normal farming school? Should he not learn how to run a country, what to do in the event of war, or what will be useful to him in the future? I could take a few regular courses, such as farming (so he knew how to prepare the country for famine or the like), but tie knots? How is that helpful? <br /> <br /> Now I know someone will say, "But it does not make any sense, it's supposed to be funny." Then they should have more fun stuff. All the fun things about the show have already been done in the movie. If you notice some of these huge storylines, why not make fun of them, like in the movie? (For example, if Yzma and Kronk come to the secret lab before Kuzco and Pacha and Yzma and Kronk can not explain how they got their first success.) <br /> <br /> There are some good points, it's nice too See some of the characters from the first movie in the series like Bucky and Monkey with the Bug. Pacha and his family are still very good characters with a good floor feel. I think this series would be fun for younger kids. <br /> <br /> In summary, the series is not as good as the movie it's based on, but it may be good for younger kids.
