I have seen tons of garbage in every language, every subject and every trend of filmmaking. From each period, each director and every available budget. That said, I really have to say: <br /> <br /> This is one of the three worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is painfully bad. It is pompous. It is grim. It is incomprehensible. It's annoying. It's a really bad mess. It's a piece of you-know-what. <br /> <br /> And more importantly, a point is missing. And even if there was one, the characters are so unreal and annoying that it's impossible to overlook the lack of cohesion of the whole thing. <br /> I was really sick of seeing this trash. The theater in which I saw it (Lincoln Center in New York) was full when it started. In the end, half of the audience had left. There was a Q & A program in the end, but nobody stayed. With the exception of about two patients, everyone else went to the door, including me. <br /> <br /> Save 2 hours of your life. It is probably one of the worst ever made. <br /> <br /> If there is a cinema in Hell, this movie will be played around the clock for eternity ...
