The real surprise of this effortlessly light film is how a top-notch cast is made up for something that is nothing more than a brazen, unimaginative affair. Presumably it was a proverbial snowball that rolled down a hill and gained speed and size and shape. One can imagine that when Miranda Richardson was contacted by her agent, the conversation went like this: "Would you like to make a movie in Dublin written by Neil Jordan? Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are already here! 'This is a boring' comedy 'in which Michael Caine and Dylan Moran try to go through a well-planned rush to mimic a London Gangland boss (whose imminence is imminent) for a substantial amount of cash from the local Kingpin To collect Michael Gambon. The rest is just a forgetful game, thankfully quickly over. Moran is somewhat amusing in some places, but that's why it's better for life on the small screen in hit-comedies like Black Books. Caine is undisputed in his role and delivers a consistent performance without being overused. One can only imagine why he signed up for this film - in Dublin it could not even have been a summer, as many scenes in the background have a positive autumnal effect. Gambon is actually stealing the show, and anyone who has seen some of his appearances on "Have I Got News For You" will know that he is a wonderfully funny man. But overall, the result is disappointing, and it seems like Neil Jordan shot quality movies like Mona Lisa a long time ago.
