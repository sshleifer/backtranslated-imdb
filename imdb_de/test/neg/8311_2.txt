As bad as this movie is, I really like it. The bad acting, the dialogue and the action made it so funny. I loved John Travis from Omega Cop and stayed up all night to find out how the Death Machines checked in at the airport when they can not talk. She probably had to wiggle / nod in safety questions. Why can not they talk? It does not stick to any kind of film production convention, which makes it curiously interesting to watch - just a lot of people get killed for a very loose plot around rent killer - no "machines" as such and those weird face / mountain front cover and stuff the trailer does not appear! I love the fact that there is no good in this movie until half the time, and I love the many pointless scenes of this plane landing. Many people are killed who have nothing to do with the "conspiracy" and no explanation is given about anything - do NOT expect to understand this movie. Instead, admire how the main good man can not even deal with a casual old man in the bar - portrayed as a villain, but opposed the barman's decision to hire a sparsely-dressed woman who is bad in the corner for "entertainment" to dance - all the good ones seem to enjoy that! Why did the old guy beat up our hero - and why did the random guy decide to help the old guy fight ?! Why did the hero suddenly fall from an old man to the bar, where in the background a jet of water rushes out, making it look like it's coming out of his mouth? Definite Top 20 B-Movie, must look for part 2
