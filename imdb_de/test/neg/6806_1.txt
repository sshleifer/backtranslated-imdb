In order to enjoy "Fur - An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus", Stephen Shainberg needs the viewer to suppress all the realities and previous knowledge of American photographer Diane Arbus. Paradoxically, it is Diane Arbus' name and knowledge of her life and work that destroys this film on a grand scale. What to See Early on Casting Casting The wonderful WASPish and glamorous Nicole Kidman as anti-glamor Jew Diane Arbus is that Shainberg did not get Arbus or what she was working on (unsentimental realism), and only herself attracted by her photos of circus freaks to Arbus. <br /> <br /> What follows is a kind of pretty and insignificant Beauty & the Beast Fantasy biopic with Robert Downey JR as Kidman's hairy, fictitious love interest. However, the banality of the story is not the main flaw in the film, but the director's misogynistic attitude that Diane Arbus, one of the most unique and original women's photographers in the art world, was unable to develop her own ideas about her work. While his earlier film "Secretary" was a study of female masochism, his continued portrayal of the woman as submissive completely spoils this film - and often proves to be ambiguous to the courage, stubbornness, and fearlessness of Diane Arbus as a solo exploration World of outsiders. <br /> <br /> Imagine an imaginary biography of the life of pop star Madonna, with Guy Richie as her Svengali, the man behind her career, and you'll get a sense of how seriously flawed and imaginary this is Film is: It can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the topic or just want to ignore all the facts. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because if you remove all references to Diane Arbus, this movie might do that as an interesting study on fetishism and as a good companion to the secretary. 4.10
