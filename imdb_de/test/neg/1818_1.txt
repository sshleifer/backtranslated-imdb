This series is frustrating and annoying. How do you do that for another year? Each episode has more and more questions and very few answers. To quote another very popular website, I believe this show has now jumped the shark! <br /> <br /> Will I keep watching? <br /> <br /> Probably, <br /> <br /> Will you be able to keep the program on air until the end? <br /> <br /> Probably not ... <br /> <br /> How did two qualified doctors not realize that Naomi was still alive? How did more than 30 people not notice that a body woke up and ran away with a knife in their back? How did someone have enough strength to build two paths and climb a tree to attack Kate? <br /> <br /> We have now introduced a Ghostbuster ... <br /> <br /> Same week next week? Yes!
