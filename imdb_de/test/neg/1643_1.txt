Yeah, this movie obviously tries to be a Conan the Barbarian and what makes me wonder is that it's a sequel (people asked another one?). The first part of the strip is a flashback showing the original. After all, what I have seen is not worth looking into (and Ator apparently always kills a giant puppet in his films). Well, Ator lives with his dumb Sidekick Thong at the bottom of the earth. A girl seeks his help as this evil guy has his father in custody. Let me just say that this villain is extremely patient as the old man constantly insults the villagers and babbles endlessly. The villain waits until the end of the film and finally bumps into the old man who asks, "What took him so long?" In the meantime, Ator and his buddy and the girl go through one adventure after another. They fight cavemen, invisible soldiers (do not ask), hire thugs and people who worship snakes. Ator also fights with a giant snake doll and hang gliding (again, do not ask). Meanwhile, you'll think Conan Ator's butt would kick.
