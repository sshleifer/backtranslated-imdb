I'm not sure what this movie is about. It looked as though it had been made by a historic society to be shown in your local "Pistol Pete" museum. At first glance, it seems to be the beginning of a Mad TV or SNL sketch. But then there is a joke when there is no punch line and you realize that someone took this seriously. The story was not bad, but the inclusion of the SASS members seemed like a trick that made me see the movie. I swear the trailer lists every character in the movie except for "dead cowboy # 5". The reason Westerns are so much fun is the atmosphere and the characters. I just felt like watching coworkers watching Civil War actors. Not even worth the digital video on which it was recorded.
