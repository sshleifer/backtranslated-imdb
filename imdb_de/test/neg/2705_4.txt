I like Errol Flynn. I like biographies and I like action movies. All three of them were there ... but I did not like this movie. It just took too long, although the last 20 minutes were excellent, especially in photography with great shots from the lower angle. However, it seemed like it took me six hours to get to that point, and I really can not say why I feel that way. <br /> <br /> The action is interesting, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are fine. In fact, it was refreshing to see de Havilland support Flynn instead of her normal antagonist role. However, something is missing in this film. <br /> <br /> The film has been criticized for its historical inaccuracy, but I do not hear it for many other films that have done the same thing. In fact, it is rare when a movie is historically accurate. For some reason, this revisionist story offended most critics. If the movie had made General Custer much worse than he really was, they probably would have liked it. Well, too stupid. In their twisted ways, critics prefer villains to heroes. <br /> <br /> I really wish I could have enjoyed it more, but I will take many more Flynn adventures about this adventure.
