Everything I can say about this movie is absolutely boring. The intro of the movie is probably the worst intro of a horror movie I've ever seen. I mean, a mad girl beating a guy with a frying pan in the head is not scary at all, but in fact it was "mild" funny. <br /> <br /> The action in this picture was beyond pathetics. A note to directors, if you are making a horror movie, please hire some good actors, not a popular teen star who has no idea how to behave. ... no Gore, and I'm sorry, but horror movies without Gore or good suspense are just cheesy. I mean, this girl is killed by hair wrapped around her in the middle of Tokyo, and no one sees it as true, they just declare it as "missing", wow that's great! <br /> <br /> Finally, if you and your friends would like to watch this movie. Make sure you bring a few sleeping pills, because I guarantee you will not make it to the end. My friend and I went out because we did not care what happened in the end. <br /> <br /> Cheers
