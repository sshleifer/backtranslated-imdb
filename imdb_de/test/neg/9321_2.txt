Let me first say that I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this film for some time now. After finally having the chance to see it last night, I was unfortunately very disappointed. It's hard to imagine that a movie that made "Exorcist: The Beginning" look good last fall, but "Dominion" does just that. No, wait ... it looks like a great movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was looking forward to this movie too much and it helped me to be disappointed. The idea that Warner Bros. released two versions of essentially the same movie within six months was an exciting attraction. Plus, I'm a big fan of Stellan Skarsgard, and in true ways, he delivers a great performance despite the often ridiculous content of the film. On the other hand, the minor feature in this movie is miserable. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of only one expression - with a blank look, delivering all her lines in the same monotonous tone, while Gabrielle Mann's father Frances is simply ridiculous. The effects in this film are ridiculous at best and the sheer cheese dairy is enough to deprive the film of any chance of being taken seriously. This movie produced more strangled giggles than anything else, and with the exception of a really shattering shot that lasted about three seconds and my girlfriend covered her eyes and whimpered, he forgot to offer anything in the Fear department. I could go into more detail and possibly give spoilers away, but frankly I'm too exhausted to think about how bad this movie was to write all the things I'd like to say. <br /> <br /> The saddest part of the whole thing is that the basic idea that tried to give both versions of the movie ... is a story about a priest who has lost his faith and then finds him again after dealing with himself has dealt with his difficult past ... especially with Skarsgard as the leading man. Unfortunately, this potential was wasted for us. Watch this movie only if you are really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version, but do not expect a good movie, otherwise you will regret wasting your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, be satisfied with the version released first and keep going.
