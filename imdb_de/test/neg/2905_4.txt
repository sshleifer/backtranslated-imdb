You know, after the first films by Chuck Norris, I got the chance to see that a film was produced by Golan Globe, even if I switched in the middle without looking at the credits or the title. What I could say more was Golan Globe within a minute of screen time. Something about the story-structure, the silly relationships between the characters, the cautious dialogue, the playing of wood (riddled with occasionally horrible performances), the scene tempo and rhythms that made Albert Pyun look like John McTiernan, the paper-thin acts and unwillingness for primetime fighting choreography ... Over the years, Golan Globe has remained incredibly consistent in style, theme and perspective. <br /> <br /> What can you say? must work for them, since they have literally produced dozens of films. They go to one of their productions and know exactly what you get. And it's not brain food, people. <br /> <br /> "Ninja 3" is another piece of hacking in a long line of GG Sausage Factory products, offering moviegoers the typical limited pleasures of the palate. You have a Bad Ninja that cuts open the cops and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way. You have a good ninja who was promised to stop him. They threw a Westerner into the mix so that we Americans can identify with him (or her in this case) and be reassured: "We can still beat those annoying Orientals in their own game." They have a love interest (which is usually also the worst actor / actor in the movie) that fights with the hero. You have your endless attacks, assassinations, and boring shots of men gargling in pain, while an arrow or a star is unseating from their eyes, neck, or chest. You have your Beefy White Guy / Bodyguards in suits, who call a ninja 'the son of an A B * tch' and throw a round blow just to shake hands with him. You have a final confrontation between good and evil that lasts for 20 minutes and stops like a RoadRunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax or a solution. Ninja 3 is a bit different, it's all about a worn, athletic woman obsessed by the Bad Ninja. She kills a lot of police, criminals and Beefy White bodyguards in suits as they fall under their spell. But all other elements are as formal as a kabuki drama or a noh drama. <br /> <br /> I actually thought that Lucinda Dickey is pretty likable in this movie. She is pretty muscular and curvy, has great cheekbones and some athletic 'ooomph' for her movements, and you can actually suppress the belief enough to accept that her character could do some of the tricks she does in the movie. She can carry this thing almost, but not quite. An additional start for their participation and good energy. Of course Sho Kusugi is here and he dominates the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. And to show you what 3rd and 3rd grade GG movies look like, the director and publisher cut across the final battle between Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with numerous reaction shots of Dickey and her friend fighting for life and death with a movie watching expression of mild confusion. I'm serious ... for all the emotions and reactions they show to the events, they might consider a sea turtle in an aquarium in Marineland. I can only imagine how Dickey must have felt when she saw the finished product - she probably wanted to let the editor through with a katana, because those reaction shots make her look like an idiot. <br /> <br /> A pleasant waste of time ... but it's definitely a waste of time. If you're a fan of Sho Kusugi or even a fan of Linda Dickey, maybe it's worth it.
