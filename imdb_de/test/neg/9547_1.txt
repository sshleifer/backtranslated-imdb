I imagine the writers in this story came up with this script: 1. Let's do a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat and Silence of the Lambs. People like serial killer. It will sell itself ... 2.The murderer has to accept some kind of pattern. I know; he will copy it out of a serial killer thriller. That has not happened yet, at least not so. 3. Now we need a way to make this movie unique. Of course, the Good can be as bedridden as in Rear Window. 4.Lastly, we need a shooter that gives this movie the success of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. Okay, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie Do not waste your money. One thing that I really hate about filmmakers is that they have an absolutely good concept for making films and ramming them completely into the ground. I wrote better stories when I was in junior high. I only checked my watch every five minutes. When the end of the turn finally came, I was not shocked, I just said, "Oh, who cares ?!" The signs are two-dimensional. You have your typical movie personality. This movie is just one proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script. I give this movie with 1 out of 10 points. He would normally earn at least 2 or 3, but I'm sick of the unoriginality. When will you learn? 1.10
