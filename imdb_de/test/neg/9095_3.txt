This is a candidate for the worst movies I have ever seen. It wanted to be as shocking as "Silence of the Lambs" but has neither the style nor the joke of the above. The make-up is excellent, the acting is pretty good, but the story seems to go on for years and the murders are so cruel that they are more disturbing than entertaining.
