Great Balls of Fire is the movie you show to someone you really hate. It is an absolute torture of the highest order and is probably used by henchmen of a foreign power to extract information from captured secret agents. I've enjoyed some of Dennis Quaid's performances in the past, but he's totally over the top in this movie. He does not cross the line so much, he arches over it and then jumps back to jump again and again. He aspires and drinks like on an incredibly bad acid journey. It's one of those rare appearances that you wish you could go into the movie and beat the man within an inch of your life because he did such a terrible thing. Did he really want to win a Golden Raspberry or any other award for bad behavior? That's the only conclusion I can come to. Thank you, Dennis, you've been putting us off for ages. Where was the director who ruled in this guy? <br /> <br /> The opposite end of the extreme is Winona Ryder, it affects the plastic properties and the plastic effect. I found a look back at her acting style, which compared her to a wax figure. This, of course, was an insult to wax figures around the world, who could all have brought more humanity into the role of Jerry's underage cousin / wife. This brings out the mixed message of the film that it is 100% okay to marry your own cousin and have a child from the union. I can not see what's so "alright" about it, but it looks like Hollywood is thinking that minor incest is Hunky Dory. Talk about "family values". <br /> <br /> Another problem is the format. Is it a forward-looking account of Lewis's life or is it a musical? I'm not talking about the music, I'm talking about the really weird scene in which Jerry goes to school, a tune starts to play and everyone starts dancing like a Broadway musical in search of a Tony. Imagination and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work. But who cares? Not me. And you should not. You can not get back the minutes of life you would waste for this movie. So do not waste your time, it's too valuable for something that is so misguided and poor.
