At the very beginning, looking at a control panel that says "Eight Miles of the Cost of California," and no, I did not spell that out, they really did not spot the cost, rather than offshore. These people must have been idiots. <br /> <br /> It is good if you are interested in horrible movies, but the mere fact that they could not deal with a simple spelling makes me think that they did not really try the movie at all create. Navy uniforms are in no way correct in any way. <br /> <br /> Wow, totally ridiculous, but good if you're looking for something incredibly stupid. How these people earned this money is a mystery to me.
