I'm almost two decades old and have read comics most of my life. I'm not a big fan of the Fantastic Four, but I'm pretty familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Corman (B-movie legend) produced the first, as I think, movie Fantastic Four. The result was such a pure hit that it was never released. However, most copies exist in the network and on conventions. If you are looking for a laugh and can find a copy, do yourself a favor and look at it. <br /> <br /> The film essentially tells the story of the FF and a meeting with Doctor Doom and a villain called The Jeweler, essentially the mole man with a penchant for small theft. As with these comic feature films everything must be integrated in everything, so that the FF with Dr. med. Doom's creation plays a crucial role, and he and the jeweler play an important role in their films. <br /> <br /> First of all, I'd just like to mention that despite everything that went bad in this movie, I somehow liked the guy who played Doom. He does not have many decent lines, but when he does, he meets her. The armor looks pretty good too. <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... it's a dirty, dirty mess. Bad actions, bad acting, bad effects, all basically bad. Boos especially for Jay Underwood, who gives the word Johnny Storm a new meaning. He does not exaggerate, he is persistent. <br /> <br /> As far as the FF is concerned, they all look pretty good, and Sue is played by a very attractive actress, but they do not really seem like a real team. For one thing, they have no reason for Sue and Johnny to go into space. In an early section, Ben and Reed visit the two, Johnny is 8 years old and Sue is 12 years old. It will only cause the romantic couple to get a more terrible feeling. The Thing costume looks more reptilian than anything else, not rocky, and the Human Torch is really just a Human Torch that looks like the silver surfer who is tinged with red. <br /> <br /> I could spend hours typing, but I think the scene that best summarizes it is an exciting encounter with the not-so-human torch mentioned above. He races with a laser beam and he finally destroys him in one fell swoop. Yes, a blow. A laser beam In one fell swoop. Then he flies around and goes "Yippee!" a lot, whereupon the camera is tilted down and he goes back to earth. Obviously, Reed, the intellectual, forgot to tell Johnny that the fire does not exist in space. These and many other scenes work like Looney Toones. If the character does not know he's over a cliff, they will not fall. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I was glad he was never released.
