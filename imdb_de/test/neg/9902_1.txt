I can not believe that I spent almost three hours of my life observing this. This must be one of the most incredible, predictable and cheesy TV movies I've seen in a long time. I was hoping for good special effects and action, instead I spent all of my time staring and shouting "OH COME ON !!!" on the screen. The dialogue is shallow and obvious, acting is at times tense and as the story progresses it's not just funny how EVERYTHING happens at the same time ... not to mention the obvious and disgusting ending ... now I am I'm more Having seen my share of disaster films, I'm actually a big fan and think that they can often do totally unrealistic stuff as long as it's done in an entertaining way, but that's definitely not the case. This is just an insult to smart viewers everywhere. What did you think when you filmed this movie ?????
