This movie was just awful. How could anyone like this movie, and for those who like the jokes, they should really look in the mirror for a long time wondering if stereotypes are not bad. Ignoring the face of racist stereotypes, that was just terrible. It never had its moments when it was paid homage to the 1980s "Airplane", it still has to pay more. Terrible acting, terrible screenwriting, even for a movie with Mo'Nique or Tom Arnold. This movie was bad from the start, but people might have seen it all, thinking that the plane would crash. Stay one of the worst movies ever.
