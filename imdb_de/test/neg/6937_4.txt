In a sense, I liked this movie somehow, because it radiates a "mindless" positive atmosphere. I had a problem with one aspect of the plot, but more on that later. First, the characters were a bit silly and one-dimensional. The 'good people' had similar physical and character traits and the 'bad people' had similar physical and character traits ... hmmm. The basic plot was fine (fairly simple and standardized) - nothing too exciting or objectionable. The main attraction was of course the miniature dinosaurs - a nice fantasy element. However, they had a very low presence in the movie. Outside, the movie kept a brisk pace and was not stuck in any location. I liked that about the movie. <br /> <br /> The problem I had with the plot had to do with the idea of ​​"stealing". I think that this movie was not thought through enough - something is wrong, especially if it is a children's film. I'll keep the next sentence abstract, not to be a spoiler (skip it if you're worried). The "good ones" do not steal and do not have the same information that the audience has - so they steal and that's a bad thing for a children's movie kids, because of a questionable plot aspect I would consider passing as. This whole movie is pretty cautious anyway, so it does not matter. Pass this if you have other interesting options.
