Carlos Mencia is just not funny! His show is painful to watch. His sketches / parodies are all very horrible, and that really feels like a filler for the Chapelle Show, which is not a big fan, but much funnier than this junk. Carlos Mencia keeps the stupid speeches, and he too often depends on ending his monologues with a low-key voice and "the one who's the one". It's just not funny. When he talks to others, he often does word games. They are terrible and painful. If people do not laugh, he blames them ... why would anyone laugh, he is not funny. He has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show. It's amazing that everyone but 3 years old is watching this. One of my least loved things is that it dilutes every topic and makes it look like a joke! I hope that this racist idiot will be blown out of the air as soon as possible because he is scanning a station that does not have to be suppressed.
