I was at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto at the age of 10, and the event I saw back then was quite different from what I saw on the Wrestlemania Collection DVD I just saw. I do not understand that the WWW does not have the rights to some of the old music, since most of these songs were created by the WWF, they should not have to worry about the licensing and licensing fees that discourage shows like SNL Release Seasonal Sets , It's pretty stupid to moan about it, but for me it was a memory I never forgot when I heard Demolition personally join their theme music with a Wrestlemania. This DVD did not exist on this DVD. What's the point if they even own the rights to this huge video library when they need to edit it so drastically to use it?
