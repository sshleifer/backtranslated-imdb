Go to the video library and get the original. I do not understand why Hollywood needs to record a perfect foreign film and make it a new one. "Mostly Martha" or "Bella Martha" has a much better cast. Starting with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the work-obsessed perfectionist than the famous Catherine Zeta Jones, about the Italian cook and the niece who was suddenly deprived of her mother and was not forced to live with an aunt for parenting. <br /> <br /> The American version of the film is in many ways a copy of the German original. They only exchanged the actors. However, they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and unbelievable to materialize a father for the little girl in an American context. <br /> <br /> I thought about it. Maybe the father could have been Puerto Rico or Cuban or Mexican. Well, there are so many "guest workers" in the US. Choose your choice. But I doubt that any of them would be responsible, as the Italian father did in the original. Therefore, the American film leaves out this part, but retains the Italian chef. And that changes the whole story. In the original, "Martha" is so far from reality that she thinks it's okay to send her niece to a foreign land with a complete stranger. <br /> <br /> The American "Martha" is softer and therefore the movie is sweeter and does not have the benefit of the German movie. <br /> <br /> In the original, the "Italian" cook looks not so good, but much more charming, the little girl is more of a brat, but much more believable, and "Martha" is more representative of a career woman in today's world as the watered-down version we present in the American version. And all the opera music in the American version was very annoying. I loved the Italian songs in the original and bought the CD. <br /> <br /> Hollywood realized that "Mostly Martha" was a great movie. Maybe the distribution companies should have put it in more cinemas or it should have been shown in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is so much better. By the way, that reminds me of another remake. "Should we dance" is one of my favorites in the Japanese original version and completely forgotten in the American version.
