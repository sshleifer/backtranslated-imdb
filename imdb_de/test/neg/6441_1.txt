Eastenders has evolved from the indispensable circle in 1985 to a completely miserable circle. It is such a bad reflection of the nation that this crap surpasses the ratings. <br /> <br /> The ideas for action can not be anything more trivial than to put the names of the characters in a hat. The first two (regardless of their gender) will sleep with each other, the third and fourth will have a fight in the Vic, the fifth will be arrested, the sixth will get an addiction, 7. will become pregnant, etc. etc. <br /> <br / > The producers, however, are smart. The 30-minute show is actually just 3 lines. <br /> <br /> 1) Someone will walk in the Vic and say "What's going on?" 2) Someone else gets up and says "let it aht" (out) 3) Then a woman says "Doan choo, before 'n' insult mah fam'ly" <br /> <br /> That's it. That's every show. Apart from the occasional "Get it sort id / Is it sort sort id?" <br /> <br /> The show was once a realistic depiction of East End Folk & its way of life. The buffers started when 1) they were extended by two nights a week and 2) the Slater family emerged. How they attract viewers is not mine. The Cat figure symbolizes everything that has gone wrong in society and treats everyone else as something she has pulled out of her shoe. <br /> <br /> The people who choose her as the best character have to be the same in these polls. Those who vote for Jamie Redknapp as the 'Best Sportsman', even though he has not played a game for 3 years. What I can never understand is whether the show is the pinnacle of British television, why do all the biggest names leave Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, the list is endless. <br /> <br /> How long did the marriage of the longest couple last while being faithful to each other? Yes, people are going, but until the writers realize that characters can be a couple interesting and likeable without sleeping on the show, it will continue to deteriorate. One episode last week had 3 separate depictions of exactly this one. And Zoe and the doctor are even Lofty & 'Shell' as 'Most Conviding Couple' ever shown on TV. <br /> <br /> Yes, Eastenders is the most watched show, that's undisputed. However, many external factors contribute to this. 7:30 pm / 8:00 pm is the perfect time of day to get the most viewership, there is a bus edition for 2 hours and more, millions of viewers watch it out of habit, but if they were completely honest with themselves admitting it (more than ever in 2002), it can be absolutely pathetic.
