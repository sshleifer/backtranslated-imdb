Dooley and his dog partner Jerry Lee are back together in this second sequel (? !!?). I really had no idea that they made a sequel, let alone two. And for a movie that was only slightly better than "Turner & Hooch"? After Dooley's retirement, he has to mate his dog (with other dogs and people) and wait for Jerry Lee to poo. Real classic stuff. I mean, come now. The original had at least a few good laughs. This one has no one. Jim Belushi just looks old and worn out. Both Belushi brothers were great in the 80s. If John had not died, would he be as bad as his brother today? This thought makes me sad for some reason. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: USA network
