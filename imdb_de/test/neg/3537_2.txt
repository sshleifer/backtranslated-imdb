I loved the Millennium series, in which Lance Henriksen starred, which is why I bought the movie. Obviously it was a mistake on some level. Mutant / Monster movies are usually very bad and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> The basic idea itself is not totally doomed to failure (well, anyway, this movie would never be even with a good director Success.) & Actor), but as it turns out, it's just a B-class movie. The scenes that are supposed to be scary seem to me more funny and the creature is not believable at all. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie with a group of friends in a restless mood, this movie will shine as it is unintentionally funny.
