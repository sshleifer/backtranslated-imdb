After watching this movie several times, I have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very bold decision to produce a Muse for Goya when the artist performed what most would find turbulent and passionate, while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era raged throughout Europe, certainly one that had enough drama to support. While I understand that Mr. Forman in the Microcosm was talking about the tragedy of Ines's life and the destruction of the world at that time, I felt that only so much of Goya was left, so much of his humanity. The strongest and most eloquent point this movie has made is that each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life. Each of us has an evil within us that we must fight with the help of God. How eloquent when Goya says he should have helped Ines more, how true for all of us! We must defend and protect the innocent. The most ironic scene, in which the once imprisoned priest was sentenced to death, condemns the death sentence against Lorenzo, who had originally condemned him, is the genius. I wanted something more as the credits rolled. Perhaps less of the unreal coincidences and more of the inner life of the characters.
