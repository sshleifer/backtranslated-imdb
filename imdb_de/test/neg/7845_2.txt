This movie was awful. John Wayne is sometimes a brutal actor. The female lead, who played the role of "Maura," did a good job and did her best to make scenes believable, though Wayne is unable to seem one-dimensional. Seriously, did you see him talking in his sleep? Ridiculous. And his character became a terrible person in the second half of the film, which did not compensate for his behavior, and he is still being forgiven by everyone, including his arch-enemy, without even "sorry." The story was completely implausible. We should believe that two adult men, both tremendous successes in their respected areas, would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men just because they did not like each other? You can pick virtually any scene at random, and you'll probably shake your head in disbelief that someone has paid money to make this movie. It's too bad, because the only other Wayne films I've seen are the shooter and Rio Bravo, both great movies. If you are not paid, you should not look at this.
