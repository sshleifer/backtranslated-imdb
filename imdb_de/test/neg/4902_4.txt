It is important to keep an eye on the true meaning of the phrase "Inspired by a true story" when looking at pride. It's sort of "you could save up to 50%," which literally translates into "you can not save more than 50%." This all sounds good until you realize that the bottom part of "to" is "zero." Similarly, "inspired by a true story" means that someone has heard a story and made them think of it. The only certainty is that the actual story and the one you are about to see is not the same. There's a real Jim Ellis who started training the swim team at the Philadelphia Department of Recreation in Philadelphia in the early '70s, but I feel that the real Jim Ellis could not possibly have had some disappointment to hide about the way the movie was made. Of course, it takes wild liberties with the story of his life, and I imagine him reacting to the odd looks of his friends wondering why the movie is so different from the man they know. <br /> <br /> At one point, which he will certainly be proud of, is that he is portrayed by Terrence Howard, one of our best actors, who played alongside Bernie Mac, who, despite the lack of an original and Powerful story still gives a warm and moving feeling performance. <br /> <br /> The film was set in Philadelphia in the 1970s, a time and place where racism was the norm and not the exception, and the educated and professional Jim Ellis, who is also an accomplished swimmer, Having trouble finding a movie worthwhile teaching until he is finally banished to a crumbling recreation center, which he gives the cleanup before his demolition. We can certainly understand his sense of humiliation. <br /> <br /> When we meet Elston, the maintenance worker (Bernie Mac), for the first time, he is a sobering idiot sitting in his office, surrounded by garbage piles touching the ceiling and on an old day during the day, Dusty TV TV set TV. Needless to say, when Jim shows up to clean up and clean up the apartment, Elston is not exactly friendly to him. He knew his Rec Center was closed, and all his anger was transferred to Jim. <br /> <br /> Due to his past as a college swimmer, Jim is particularly interested in the pool he cleans and replenishes and keeps in shape. A group of black teenagers playing basketball in front of the Rec Center are interested in the pool when their basketball edge is taken away and the heat suffocates, and soon the group has a developing swim team on their hands that takes them all over the city enter swimming meetings. To call them outsiders, of course, would be an understatement. They are disorganized, unprofessional, inadequately trained and have no idea how to behave at a bathing session. <br /> <br /> Of course, that does not matter. The movie is your usual underdog sports story. Therefore, the first sportive outing is completely unimportant, as it is not just a learning experience, but a catalyst to advance its much tougher and more focused training that leads to the final sporting outing affairs. So far, a sports movie is all about the protagonists not having to win at the height of the film, we just have to understand the meaning and meaning of their efforts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie has all the character development of an old Seagal movie. The good guys are the good guys because they're just supposed to be, and the bad guys are the evil white swimmers who laugh and taunt and make racist jokes in our team. Oh, and there's a scene where one of the whites submerges one of the blacks while he's in the middle of a race. I did not know that it is really possible for someone to get under water, but you have an idea of ​​how deep the character development is. <br /> <br /> We understand that this is the group of kids that Jim Ellis filmed by kids hanging out on the street with nothing to do with their lives, and into an organized and competitive team of swimmers but otherwise we do not really know who they are. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that the film's only real message is that effort and organization are successful and racism is bad. Both are so obvious that watching a movie with them alone makes you feel empty and unnecessary. Racism was so much more powerful in America in the 1970s that it feels like a huge loss, that the film dealt directly with it, but did not really say anything about it. It's a kind of feel-good movie, but when it's over and you realize it's much bigger than what's been said, the feeling of wellbeing becomes a sad disappointment.
