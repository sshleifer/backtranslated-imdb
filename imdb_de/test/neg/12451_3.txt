This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work whose writing is amazing. Unfortunately, this film never shakes the feeling that these twentieth century film people do not understand the oppression and desperation of the nineteenth century that Wharton's work represents. Ward and Dalton are not so bad, but Alicia Witt's wood performance made me flinch. She was supposed to play the restless element of the story, but she stood the whole movie like a stick and I never believed a word from her mouth. When she asks Sela Ward, "Why can not I move you?" At the end of the film, I could not help but answer: "I've been wondering for an hour and a half!"
