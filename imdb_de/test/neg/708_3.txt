This movie was hard to watch for me. Stan looked very old and sick compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was harder than I ever remember in another movie. But the most difficult part was the scriptwriting / production gaps where I asked myself, "How did you get from here to there?" It took almost half of the movie to engage in dubbing non-American actors - that was also a distraction. Although I miss great actors like Laurel and Hardy, will there ever be great actors like the old studio time ??? - This film helps me to understand why actors sometimes "bend" in their prime.
