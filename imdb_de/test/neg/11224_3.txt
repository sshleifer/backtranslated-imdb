What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic article on problems in low-income schools. While the theme is an issue that needs to be addressed, the film uses every cliche in the genre and appears as textbook popcorn strips. The characters are excerpts from the inner-city version of The Breakfast Club or even The Faculty. Watch this with your children when they are 13 or 14 years old. With them you could get a lesson about current social problems. For all older people, it's nothing more than something you can watch and spit at four o'clock in the morning, as I recently did at Bravo. The fact is, what did it do on Bravo?
