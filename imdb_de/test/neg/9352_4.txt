Awful Star Wars knock-off with a slightly more comic touch. Robert Urich plays the lead role as leader of a group of ice pirates who steal ice because water is now the most valuable substance in the universe (how all the poor people live is a mystery). He meets with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, about 25 and totally sweet), a princess who is looking for her missing father. Also in the cast are an embarrassed-looking Anjelica Huston in some fun sci-fi conversations and a pudgy, short-haired Ron Perlman (who I thought was seven feet tall from his other roles!). And John Carradine, the day before death and the Hollywood Squares fan (related term) Bruce Vilanch looks. If you ever wanted Bruce Vilanch to be beheaded, watch your movie here. But even that is not worth seeing, since it does not silence him at all (think he might have been a robot, but I nodded a few times).
