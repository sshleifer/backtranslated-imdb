Acting is uncomfortable and scary and not in a good way ... not at all. The writing, the dialogue and the chemistry between the actors is terrible. Nothing makes sense, and any close-up of an actor's expression or response lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long, making it appear like a Mexican soap opera (telenovela). Everything about writing is unrealistic, and all actors involved make it even worse with their camping interpretations of the script. Am I the only one who sees that ??? Describing this Canadian catastrophe with the word "cheese" would be the understatement of the century. Did the director even see the last cut before he went on air?
