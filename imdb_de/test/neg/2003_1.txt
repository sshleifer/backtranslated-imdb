It's pretty rare that a movie is so useless that I've allowed using negative values ​​with IMDb. In fact, I think about this movie and I really can not imagine a movie that had so little to offer. Acting: Your joke right. Direction: no. An action: no. This movie has nothing to offer if you call it a serious movie. This is often the case with films of this genre, but most films of this type can be considered as comedy and you can laugh at how pitiful the characters and situations are and their time is almost worth it. This film is so empty that it can not even do justice to this purpose. I have to give this -1/10, three points lower than any other movie I've ever rated. I really feel that the staff involved in this film should pay me for the 83 minutes I've looked at. I do not really have the words to describe how bad this is. Nobody should ever see that again.
