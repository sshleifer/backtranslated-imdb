It's hard to tell if this ham-plagued B-movie adventure is a parody, a hommage, or just a villain, but it does not work, no matter how you look at it. Based on Michael Crichton's novel, it's a crazy mix of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, nice visual effects, and crazy dialogues. The first thing that outsmarted this impulse is the gorilla, who can communicate in sign language, and the movie does not get any better from then on. Tim Curry makes this old rope worthwhile, turns a feverish slice of ham with a bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems to know that all this is a lot of garbage.
