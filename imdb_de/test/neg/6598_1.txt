The authors and creators of this film should actually be sued ... To pollute the world with this crap! "Man In The Mirror" is terrible indeed! Way, way, far beyond! <br /> <br /> ... and people, I'm not just saying that because I'm a Michael Jackson fan! Or because of the fact that this is truly one of the backward portrayals of his life I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> I say it, because this is a waste of time, money and celluloid! I am ashamed that I have seen everything! That's 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life, I'll never come back! I'll tell you; Seeing grass grow is literally more entertaining than this movie! <br /> <br /> Consider yourself warned!
