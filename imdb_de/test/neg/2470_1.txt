According to the article at http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one of the film's actors, Carina Lau, was forced to appear for free in this film. She was the victim of a notorious abduction just before this movie was shot. Later, photos of her distressed magazine were published in a journal that had since been closed and the publisher was jailed. The actress denies that she was attacked, but the Internet leaked a film allegedly showing that she was raped. (The Hong Kong press has, in deference to her, largely refused to report the incident, but Google will uncover some articles about it.)
