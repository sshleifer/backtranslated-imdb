A potentially good idea is completely disappointed by a weak script that throws all credibility out the window and gives the actors very little work. Roth covers it as best he can, if only he has his mouth shut; Hurt is about as threatening as a fluffy bunny, and Stamp does not seem to be deciding whether to play an ex-London rogue or anything directly from the playing fields in Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol, she does what she can, but her character is nothing more than the image of every northern Europe of the stereotypical Latino woman, who is sulking and hot. If you're a fan of the lead actor, do not be fooled or deceived (as I suspect, many of the other reviewers have done that). Observe it by all means, but remain critical; You know these guys can do it better.
