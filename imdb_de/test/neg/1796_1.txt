After completing the dull novel Heart of Darkness, I watched the movie, which was a complete and utter disappointment. At the beginning, I expected that the movie would put together the puzzle of a book. Although I read the novel, the movie still did not make sense, so I can not imagine how lost I would be if I skipped the book altogether. It seemed as if the authors had picked out their favorite parts and inserted them into the film, leaving out everything that could help viewers understand the pointless plot. This horrible movie made no sense whatsoever, and I strongly advise against looking at it, as it will do nothing more than make you completely confused and confused.
