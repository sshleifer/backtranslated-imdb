Cheap, deliciously bad cheese from the 80s, the decade of cheese. I saw this for the first time uncut and without MST3K, and it was pretty funny, even without the comments. The plot (as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI ​​robots revolted (sounds familiar?), Destroying just about everything and leaving a world in ruins whose air is so bad that no one can breathe it , The few remaining humans act as slaves to an enigmatic being called Dark One, who appears to be part of the computer and part of the organic being. The "air slaves" are working to generate energy for this air. Every now and then, the Dark One has one of the strongest air slaves fighting to the death, so no one can stand up as a leader of a revolt against the dark. Okay, that's the so-called serious stuff. The stupid things, like the ridiculous quasi-futuristic garments everyone wears, including car seat covers, fur clothing, loincloths and greasy things, and feather boas (mostly worn by the stooge of the Dark One, a chick with an unrecognizable) and almost unintelligible accent) , Or the wooden theatrical and stilted lines worn by all so-called "actors" whose dialogue has a high claim and a small meaning. Or the Dime Store Special FX, including pink sock-clad socks for "deadly" channel snakes, a bomb-stringed bomb bomb and tin can, and terrible "mutants" with Halloween rubber masks. <br /> <A group of aerial slaves follows their leader, a mysterious wanderer who has gotten used to the air outside to visit the power plant to destroy the dark ones. The guy's name is Neo, which explains where the Wachowski brothers got the idea for the Matrix. Along the way they meet with a group of Amazons, with the obligatory fight scene in which the female (of course) is surpassed. Has anyone else ever noticed that in every Amazon movie or in t.v. show that these so-called amazing warriors are always kicked in the ass by men or women? I think Amazons are just pansies. <br /> <br /> This group of determined warriors wandering through Central Park ... um ... the devastated land beyond the last standing town (great way to save money on dull pictures of a ruined New York City, at least ) and drive to the sewage system that leads to the power plant where the Dark One and his go-go girl henchman Valeria hang around. Here they defeat wild beasts like the sock puppet worms, a giant spider nobody sees, and the goofy lobster robot, who is one of the personal guardians of the Dark One. <br /> <br /> The last showdown is pretty sad. One of the slaves, a girl whose father was captured by Dark One for giving people the opportunity to breathe the evil air, sees her father "consumed by the true form of dark one," and so on It leads him to be eaten by a giant avocado until only his head sticks out: The three remaining adventurers destroy the dark by shutting off some switches, and the robot holocaust dies with a whimper rather than a bang. The two people exchange a few amazing wooden strips of lines, and that's it. The end.
