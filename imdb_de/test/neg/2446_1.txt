Cartoon-like special effects, terrible spectacle and dialogue and dry action! This movie has everything! My friend and I went to Blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of, but that was just too much. The movie begins with a woman and her son vacationing on an island in the Bahama region. The women who happen to be a doctor / virologist are in the area when a man breaks down. He has a strange wound on his arm and she knows immediately that it is an infectious virus. The story continues, showing an amazingly fast romance between the two teenage teenagers (this is explained by the girl saying, "I know it's fast, but it just feels good.") The CDC is being introduced , We are told that the virus will spread to the United States within three months, killing millions if the virus is not treated and withheld. This information does not prevent the CDC from leaving the island to save itself. Luckily, the cure for this terrible virus is just in time, and the entire island is saved. To celebrate the death of their loved ones, the islanders are having a party where everyone is dancing, having fun and forgetting the terrible epidemic that has just happened.
