This crazy left-wiping trivializes Dante's great work, distorts the author's genius from any appreciation, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire, and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place, earning himself a place in the eighth circle, tenths of Bolgia with the rest of the counterfeiters , Sandow Birk has reserved a seat next to it. <br /> <br /> Stocking Hell, with Republican politicians, Fox News helicopters and Christian Conservatives, is a work of literary sacrilege, not to mention extremely liberal prejudice. It is, however, unoriginal, boring and banal. Nothing in Birk's unworthy and heretical revision is in the least relevant to the original text or in any way entertaining, humorous or enlightening, despite its self-satisfied opposite. <br /> <br /> I'd have eaten a roll of videotape and a better PUKED movie. I regret the two hours of my life I lost when I considered this insult through the concept of poetry. Calliope will cry forever.
