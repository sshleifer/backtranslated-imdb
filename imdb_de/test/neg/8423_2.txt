So, what to do if you are a porn star with fading eyes? I know, become a pop star! This documentary - and I use the term loosely - follows Colton's trials and tribulations as he tries to turn himself from a gay porn star into a singer of electronic (read: dance) music. I just wish Mr. Ford's voice was as muscular as his arms ... I'm sorry his singing is painfully thin. There is not much to do here, but Mr. Ford and his friends are a feast for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Have him record a song that sounds just like any other mindless dance song. See him travel to New York to make "connections". See him return to L.A. with little success. Look in the mirror and ask, "Why am I wasting time to observe this mess?"
