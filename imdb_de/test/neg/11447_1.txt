Aaran is one of the films in which you find the loopholes in Indian cinema. Here is a good example of how excellent authors, directors and actors succumb to the producers. Here's one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, who plays a real story in Kashmir in a movie. The seriousness of the film will be inferior to comic scenes and songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who is in fact the son of the producer of the film. Therefore, he has no haircut, although his officer has asked him. This kid does not know what acting is and he is the "hero" of the movie. God Help Indian Cinema with such producers. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pathetic portrayal of what's happening in Kashmir. A reasonable viewer can intuitively understand the limitations of such wonderful authors, actors, and directors who want to share their real-life experiences. Unfortunately, a film about the highest ranks of the Indian militia is a pitiful sight, with the only impression that the film is stupid and pave the way for good cinema.
