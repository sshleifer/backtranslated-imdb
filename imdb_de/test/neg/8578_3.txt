This movie is very disappointing for someone who has read the book. As written by Rafael Sabatini, this was a clear story of piracy in the Caribbean. It would have been very easy to do. All actions take place aboard a ship and on a deserted island. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters have taken the title of Sabatini and thrown away the rest of the book. Even the name of the main character was changed and his personality in the screen was completely different from the person described in the novel. It is a sad loss for someone who loves a good sea story.
