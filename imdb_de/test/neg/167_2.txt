This film is so poor in desperate attempts to "feel good" and casual, which really made me embarrassed to look at it. I can not imagine how the inner circle of Norwegian celebrities and the press wanted to pretend to the star-rich premiere. His great media coverage is a disgusting example of how ridiculously small and inbred the Norwegian media scene is. If a foreign film of this quality had reached the screen, it would have got the rain of rotten tomatoes that it really deserves. <br /> <br /> The combination of verbal amateur actors, visual effects of self-styled style, awkward dialogue, painful The idle attempts to notice the working-class humor and overly leisurely and senseless action make this film a movie of down to earth quality. Stay away.
