Within about 5 minutes of the movie, the first fight scene I've just seen, I could only help, but the lack of suspense in the scene where the cameras cross back and forth shows he had no idea what he did. Well, the soundtrack shows the best. I do not have a low-budget movie and you will not get top 40 songs, but at least music that suits the scene that does not seem that hard. If I had seen any, I would like to let you know. the script was written so poorly, it would surprise me a little bit now, from the man who directed it, that beep, I'll give the person a 10/10 and that was for the DVD cover, because if I actually saw it It would have been "before I look at this" shop and it was like $ 10, I would have bought it, why good, if you look at the front page of the lid it's done well, you turn back and you see that it actually won prizes. This is a very misleading thing, because even at a small film festival, I would never believe in my life that this would win anything I can say, "Wow, if that were the best, I would not want to know what a crap At the film festival, like "<br /> <br />" films that are so bad were just a good one and that is for an aspiring filmmaker who is used as an inspirational movie.These films are better tools than good movies because they are good. "movie that you almost know right away, there's a good chance that you will not do a movie that well, but if you use a movie like this, you can look at all the things the director or Writer has done wrong so you do not make the same mistakes You have the plus to watch this movie and to say if a beep like this can be done then there is hope for someone out there
