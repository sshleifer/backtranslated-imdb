Other commentators have described this film as a "classic fifties sci-fi," with clever use of footage and documentary material as well as skillful character interactions. <br /> <br /> Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a classic sci-fi of the 50s ... but the sci-fi of the 50s is incredibly dumbest worst. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that the first prey of the Mantis is a radar station that is shown first from the air, then on the ground. .. but the station is (from the air) shown as being on a mountaintop, on one side with snow and on the other side halfway purified dark ground, but when (on the ground) investigators visit the site it is suddenly on a plane , even white level, miles from the nearest mountain. <br /> <br /> Also consider the ridiculous pseudo-scientific chatter of the highly recommended expert consulted to examine a giant claw. He says, "Well, we know one thing ... it can not come from an animal because every known species has a bony skeleton, even reptiles and birds have bones." He then goes on to say that some creatures ... snails, shells, insects ... have no bony skeletons. Excuuuuuse me? Define "animal" here. Not even in the fifties could anyone accept this man as a biology expert for more than six years, as he clearly does not know what an "animal" is, nor is he able to name several large categories of animals that have it missing from bony skeletons (sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, molluscs, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arachnids, echinoderms ... you have the idea.) The figures are cardboard, 2D bearing types ... scientist, buddy friend, big, bad monster. Nothing shows a sense of creativity here. No pulse, no signs of life. <br /> <br /> There are no funny dialogues, the special effects are stupid even for their time, and the footage is used with a ruthless disregard for continuity. This is a worst-case B-movie movie with a production crew that obviously could not even half-heartedly try. <br /> <br /> Use sparingly as a sleep aid or as a punishment for young children who feel easily offended by bad science.
