"Shuttle" is an indie thriller about four young adults traveling out of the airport late in the evening with a shuttle bus and finding out that the driver is a sadistic psychopath, and it is unconventionally interesting plot work, some aspects just do not. The bad dialogue and the unlikely characters give a good reason not to worry about them. But often the tension works and asks the question, "What would you do?" Usually, what you WANT would not be what those idiots do on the shuttle. <br /> <br /> If you expect a pointless, bloody horror movie, you'll be wrong. This is a movie that makes you use your mind, but unfortunately not to the end. Four out of ten.
