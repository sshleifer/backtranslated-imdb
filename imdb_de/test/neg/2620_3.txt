Well, this is a movie that I really do not like. It's one of the most boring horror movies of the 90's, mainly because it starts slowly and centers in a boring atmosphere. The settings are not even appealing to the eye and are not for the purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> The puppets look really cheesy, unlike the Puppets Master 80. What did they do with our favorite toys? The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER explains the uncanny origins of the dolls. There are no death scenes like in previous movies and the f / x are awful. <br /> <br /> I felt asleep the first time, so I can recommend it for sleep disorders.
