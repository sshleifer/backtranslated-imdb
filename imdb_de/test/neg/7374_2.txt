This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Historical accuracy is absolutely nonexistent. For example, James Wolfe, portrayed as an anti-French Canadian, is shown in London in the summer of 1759. Natives are like Indians of a bad Hollywood movie of the 60s: They wear buckskin clothes and ride horses (The Montagnais never rode horses) The film takes place in Quebec City, but the footage is in Louisbourg and shows the Atlantic Ocean br /> <br /> The original scenario should include the battle on the plains of Abraham, but the producers drop that idea saying that the cost of uniforms and attendees would be more than $ 4 million! I think they have never heard of re-enactments. <br /> <br /> The entire film is supposed to be a new Titanic: an impossible love during a historical tragedy (the fall of New France) .There is even a song by Celine Dion at the end of the Films (Yes, I stayed until the end of the movie, but I deeply regret it) But the worst part is that this movie cost $ 30 million, I just do not know how they spend all the money. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for my anger, but I'm just too irritated.
