I saw this movie and thought it was a stupid movie. Even stupider is that someone had thought that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles. The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This film should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it should be shot in Honolulu, Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes, a fact that this film should be filmed in the capital of Hawaii. This movie should be shot in Hawaii, as this is the real idea and not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles, but no volcanoes. To be honest, this is incredible nonsense and very stupid. Finally, I do not want to deal with this movie, because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.
