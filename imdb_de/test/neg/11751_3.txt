Well, I have to agree with the critics on this point who all said, "Leave it alone." I do not know why they had to do this 1960s "psycho" remake. I suspect they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern actors were the answer, as these were the main changes. The dialogue was the same and the story the same. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I greet them that they have not questioned this with much obscenity and nudity and made a filthy movie. But if they wanted to keep things the same, why bother improving Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh, and the original cast? <br /> <br /> Did you really think Vince Vaughn would do this? to be as good or better than Perkins? Are you kidding? Ann Heche will be better than Leigh with her short Mannish haircut? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> Yes, the colors were pretty here, but it's the black-and-white photography that helped make the 1960s version so scary. It's perfect for the story, not for a few greens and pinks! I guess the filmmakers have chosen an audience that never saw the original. <br /> <br /> This was just a stupid project that should never have started.
