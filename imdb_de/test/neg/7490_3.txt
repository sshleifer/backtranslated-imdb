Deadly Contact: Avian Flu in America: 3 out of 10: This movie is both funny and sad. The funny part is pretty obvious, as this is certainly not a sober look at a possible impending crisis. This is a modern version of The Swarm. And just like those killer bees (and the so-called Killerbiene Crisis that prompted them), Bird Flu has joined a media-inspired end-the-world scenario (SARS, Y2K, Global Warming) that simply refuses to actually come. <Br /> <br /> The sad part is the filmmakers' blatant attempt to panic. Disease pandemics have been quite common in the past, with not all people in the forties dying of heart disease. Even the recent pandemics, such as AIDS, reflect the longstanding VD (Think Syphilis) crisis that used to kill more soldiers than bullets. <br /> <br /> The flu pandemic of the early twenties was a nasty business that killed millions, but honestly, life went up. I wonder if our overdramatic media and their power-hungry governmentists would allow life today as normal. <br /> <br /> The movie itself changes wildly from quite competent scenes (triage in Grand Central Station) to the ridiculous (Rednecks attempts) National Guard in Manhattan ambush). <br /> <br /> The scenarios themselves are pretty useless as the filmmakers do not seem to decide exactly how contagious the bird flu is or whether the symptoms are an Ebola crash or just a long illness. One scene shows everyone in bio-hazard suits, and the next one will not wear a mask. <br /> <br /> The film also apparently refuses to give practical advice on what to do in a bird flu crisis. (Except wash your hands, what no tape?) The acting and directorial work is responsible for a television movie, but the script is everywhere on the map. Lastly, the movie on the bottom of the screen is strangely non-exponential. Just like the swarm.
