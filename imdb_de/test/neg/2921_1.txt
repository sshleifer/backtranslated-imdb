I think of some things for this movie: First, it's really a very bad movie. This is really "super bath". The movie looked promising in the trailers, but fell flat ... Maybe the original idea was good, but between a bad script and bad acting the movie got boring and empty. My advice is not to waste two hours of your precious time. You were warned. This is the first movie I rated at IMDb.com with 1 star ... Second, none of the characters is sympathetic. You really do not care what happened to them ... Third, the rogue is very easy to identify. The grandson kills his father, sodomizes the boy's son, gets the maid pregnant, smothers his grandfather ... As JT says, "If you like evil without retribution, this is your movie." Nothing more to say...
