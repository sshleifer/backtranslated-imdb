Her embalmed look was completely inappropriate for the role. Her face was too white, her hair was too dark, her clothes too clean (and well fitting, especially her father's old hat and coat in the scene where Inman comes home) for every sense of accuracy. It would be one thing if production had allowed all other actors to stay clean and perfect, but she was the only one who did not get messy. There was never a stain on her powdered cheek. Should we believe she was the only person in the Civil War to have a bath and a mirror? She certainly looked like the only one who used her. Tweezers too; I mean, what about those eyebrows? She looked absolutely mean! The love story was implausible. She just walked over to the guy because someone had said that he had said he found her sweet. So she goes over to annoy him, flirts with him a few more times, and suddenly this is a love that is like Odysseus and Penelope. You're welcome. <br /> <br /> I should have known better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us "The English Patient". My reaction was the same as Elaine's on Seinfeld: "It was shit".
