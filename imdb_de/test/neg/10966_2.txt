The trailer for this movie promised a new twist on the zombie genre: putting it in the Old West. But of course it's not the real Old West. It's kind of a Future West, in a world where an apocalypse, it is well known, has killed apocalypse, killing people and turning them into zombies. It's zombie virus again, folks, and you know what that means? Get bitten and become one of them. <br /> <br /> In this dusty and dead filled world comes a hero. He is a bounty hunter who is paid to look after zombies. It is not clear who provides the funds, but it seems that a small zombie-hunting country cottage has emerged. But as the trailer says, there is a problem. They no longer have zombies. The only way to continue earning money is to infect new cities with the virus. <br /> <br /> I think that's not a bad idea for a movie. But unfortunately it takes much more than just a good idea and a lot of people tinkering with windows to make a good zombie movie. What we actually get is a Clint Eastwood clone (the actor even called Clint because he screamed loudly) and his "weird" buddy who tries to sack zombies while chasing down some living villains is a big reward to obtain. The whole subplot about infecting other cities is mentioned only on the fringe of the film. Instead, there are many western film stereotypes, bad zombie make-up and bad world class drama. Really bad. The sort that would not even do it for Hollyoaks. Both the hero and the villain beat cigars, jokes are thrown, people are bitten. As the movie comes to a conclusion, the only thing worth asking is whether it will end with the hero's cliché being the only living man who has killed the one he loves, or the cliché that he becomes the zombie in the finale frame. (It's the first movie, by the way) This film was written and directed by Gerald Nott. It's the only thing he did, and hopefully it will be the last. At the beginning of the film, there is a caption with the inscription "Nott Entertainment". At least they have understood one thing correctly.
