That's exactly what we need, a show about the people that nobody likes in high school or at university. Man or woman. People who objectify and congratulate others are exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking. And this show is just disgusting because that's exactly what it does. <br /> <br /> So four men sit in chairs watching two other men try to find women to have sex with. And in the end, one of them wins, great ... just great. I should also accept these four shower bags as "judges" of the "game" of the people. The term "game" is since the term "Bling Bling" the most torturous thing that has come from modern English. In addition, these men are referred to as "experts". It makes me raise what is left of my respect for modern culture. These are not bloody role models, but the result of MTV culture biting our asses. If you enjoy the bullshit that emanates the pages of this monstrosity, you probably think that Paris Hilton and Britany have Spears talent. It is not true and you should be ashamed of thinking so. <br /> <br /> And for all the people who say that I would prefer that if I lay down or if I am just jealous. Do not give a damn, because it's obvious that a real girl certainly does not want.
