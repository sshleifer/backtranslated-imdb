This movie tried, but it was ultimately a waste of talent. It was trying hard to be "sexy". I do not use the works of actresses like Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who will find something worthy of their talent except the "Le Femme Nikita" of television) Not near seduction scene with Mrs. Barkin is a real emotion, though I Knows that the Thespians were eager to get the scene up and running. If the sexual elements of Wilson's disturbed sex victim did not touch our hearts (which was not even earned by an end that did not deserve it), it did not do the murderous element of the conspiracy. Maybe it was the script or maybe the direction, but I did not feel anybody in this movie, and without that feeling, a movie does not work for me. If you're interested in a Lesbian movie, there are at least two movies on each page of the Specturum you can watch: and 2.) The more honest and touching story of a Lesbian who grew up in Hell's Kitchen and "All Over Me" called. It's a well-defined mid-nineties indie that solves the problem of coming age with emotion rather than forced sexuality. Both would be a better lease than "Mercy", which has next to nothing.
