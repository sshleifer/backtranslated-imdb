I will never forget how I saw this show when I was 13 years old. I remember thinking, "This is a Baywatch rip-off show without the only thing that makes Baywatch bearable, yet I was too small to have the remote control in my house at the time, and the highlight of Pacific Blue was an episode in which some whipped gangsters come to beat someone with submachine guns ... on bicycles !!! As a thirteen-year-old, I never laughed so much at something that should be taken seriously, even I knew that the task was, Uzis (because of Mordes) is a task that should never come before borrowing someone's car for the day.This was the crucial moment of this show.Simple crimes and situations tailored by writing hackers to make them unsung Heroes of the world of crime fighting The Bike Cop can be treated .Don't get much stupider.
