The plot in Petites Coupures has certainly astounded this viewer. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> Within about 48 hours, Auteuil's character has an affair with a teenager, losing his wife's affection, trying to seduce Scott Thomas rejected by her, typed yet another female figure in a car and is finally shot for his trouble. <br /> <br /> *** End of spoiler *** <br /> <br /> What? <br /> <br /> The only salvation in this film is Kristin Scott Thomas. Similar to Charlotte Rampling, she seems to be a matter of course in French cinema. I hope that Fran√ßois Ozon will one day be able to play her in a role where she can show her true talent. <br /> <br /> There are some good French films like the notable Le Colonel Chabert still begging for a DVD release. This is the trip that will be selected. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. <br /> <br /> zzzz ..
