When The Spirits Within was released, the Final Fantasy fans just heard how awful the movie was because it did not look like Final Fantasy. This is another story, better or worse. The familiar settings, characters, music, story and action scenes should delight the fans of the original game. The problem is that it's just not a good movie. <br /> <br /> The direction during battle scenes is often sloppy, changing the camera angles ridiculously fast to make the action look more frustrating, but only to make the scenes messy and confusing. <br /> <br /> The CG itself is exceptional, but I can not say that it's the best I've seen since Spirits Within had much more details on the characters, though I have to admit that the characters of Advent Children moved much more naturally. <br /> <br /> The plot is practically a black hole. It's a huge Deus ex machina, which is only meant to bring back Sephiroth for a final fight. Old characters reappear, but serve no purpose but to please the fans. The character development does not exist and the movie does not solve any of the plot threads that get stuck after the game ends. But it's full of neat-looking battle scenes with magic, subpoena and limit breaks, which fans probably wanted anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, Advent Children is a very eye-catching, but completely brainless action strip. This is more of a side story for Final Fantasy VII than a real sequel. <br /> <br /> By the way: Do not think that you hurt my feelings by not being useful. I just feel superior knowing that fanboys / fangirls take my objectivity so much off.
