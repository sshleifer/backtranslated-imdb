Comes to me as routine, as far as television movies are concerned. I can believe that it is based on a true story because the storyline seems too unwieldy, as if someone had written it with storytelling skills. <br /> <br /> For example, good old John Ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded villain) poisons his wife into getting sick, accusing her of being psychosomatic and immediately leaves another young woman. Fourteen years pass before the story resumes. Why 14 years? I would suggest that, though the narrative does not require it, history does. <br /> <br /> However, some of the scenes are so kinematic that they almost certainly were invented by a writer. Through her loft, Helgenberger, Knight's first wife, bumps into an old electrical appliance and has one of those black and white flashbacks with spikes in the score. Suddenly she remembers when she discovered fourteen years ago how knights shaved shavings from a rectifier, carefully collecting them and putting them in her shampoo and eyelash strip (or whatever it says). Later it turns out that he has put it in their coffee. Honestly, I do not believe it. I do not think she had that particular epiphany in the loft or that Knight put selenium shavings in her shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is referred to in the film as a "poisonous metal," and I suppose it's available in sufficient quantities, but it's also an antioxidant sold and swallowed over the counter in drugstores. Someone has to show - as no one does in this movie - that it is a topical poison. Many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed. How come that a few selenium in her shampoo Marg Helgenberger immediately causes a drastic headache? And her eyes get painful when she applies makeup? I think the anthropologist E. B. Tylor called this simple-minded idea "sympathetic magic," but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> corn each divage. At any rate, 14 years later, Ritter apparently tries the same stunt with his second wife, although there is never any hint of trickery if she gets sick with the same symptoms. Miss number two is brought to Mexico and apparently healed, but suddenly falls dead shortly after her return. Against Knight, who plays the villain with all stopovers, a piece of evidence rises. When his first trial is dismissed, he pulls SMIRKS into Helgenberger, who initiated the investigation. Helgenberger was a good friend of Knight's second wife and was terribly worried about her death and manner. (I bet I bet.) And she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems to be in third place in Ritter's marriage spree. (Sure.) The best performer is the guy who plays Detective Mauser - Lawrence Dane. All others act according to the numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with the fineness of a warning at a railroad crossing. But Dane does little things that are original. "I was told you would like to report a murder (long pause while sitting down and waiting), then abruptly turns to Helgeberger and asks in a reasonable and curious voice:" Who was murdered? "I suppose, the bare bones of historical events, nothing prevented the characters or their actions from being painted differently than in real life, I mean, what the hell is Knight still in jail, convicted of murder, and Helgenberger's character is dead, so who is it? I wish the judicial material had become clearer Knight seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals - let me see, selenium, cyanide, a huge dose of chlorine and maybe something else - It's not all I've rooted in for knights, here's a mathematician with a doctorate who insists people call him a "doctor." He even corrects people who call him "professor Most PhDs have this narcissistic problem behind them quickly. "Jes' called me Whitey, although I know how to get a standard deviation and you do not. "Average television price.
