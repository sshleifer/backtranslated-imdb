There are so many logical mistakes in this show that it is hardly worth pointing out. 1) Mystic Gohan does not exist 2) Uub is as powerful as MAJIN BUU, but plays absolutely no role in the show, somehow he's easily overwhelmed by any villain to Super 17 (which is the worst idea for a DB villain EVER) 4) Super Saiyan 4 Goku is no match for Super 17, but untransformed Goku with a move he learned in a movie that should not happen brings him ease 5) Vegeta is completely useless. 6) No character except Goku has influence on the outcome of the battles. 7) The series ends with a ghost bomb ... come on 8) Goku invincible? absorb dragon balls? lame 9) Gotenks? ... even better Goten ??? Trunks ??? both suck 10) Super Saiyan 4 contains a magical transformation into an adult 11) Goku is a child 12) Goku is a child 13) No Super Saiyan Level 2 (marked by electricity) 14) No imagination with the animation of Gogeta 15 ) Gogeta completely useless 16) Big Bang Kamehameha is the biggest disappointment in the anime story (not really logical, but I go to tangent). 17) Shortest character fights of all time <br /> <br /> I could persist longer if I had not repressed the majority of memories associated with this show. If I make enough money, I will fund the remaking of this series.
