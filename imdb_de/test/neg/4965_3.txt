I read online about this movie and after seeing the overall positive reviews and watching the trailer, I decided to watch it myself. What a disappointment! It starts well. The opening scene was actually quite tense, but from then on it's just downhill. I can see that the filmmakers tried to do something different with this movie, but they took all the fun out of watching it. This selection in connection with the editing of "C.S.I", use of music and montage, lack of suspense, fear or humor really pull this movie down. There is too much anticipation and too many "subtle" hints. So if the first turn starts early, you already know how the movie will end. I gave the movie three stars because I think the cast did a good job, otherwise I can not recommend this movie.
