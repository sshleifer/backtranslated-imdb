This movie can not decide what he is - a soft porn or an SF movie. Not enough action for a real movie, but way too much for a porno. <br /> <br /> In a faraway galaxy a good princess (we know she is good because she has long blond hair and wears a white toga) is polite and probing wistfully over her dying mother as we watch her first time around) the Kingdom inherits her older sister, who is evil (and we know this because she has dark hair and too much makeup, she abuses her male slaves smiles and curls all the time with her lip and speaks imperiously about the horrors she will commit as Queen, the evil princess is angry and tries to organize a coup, but the good sister comes to Earth, of course she materializes naked during a wet t-shirt contest in a bar It's really downhill there, the acting is ridiculous, the dialogue sounds like it was written for a porno, and the general story is ridiculous not even enough skin to make the person happy looking for skin. I love "good" bad movies, and this movie is not even enjoyable on a "bad movie" level.
