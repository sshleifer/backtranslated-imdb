You thought "Dreamship Surprise" that German comedy can not get worse? It can. This comedy is another attempt to perpetuate stereotypes of gay men who are masked as a nice comedy. The initial concept (openly gay men in football) would have been a great opportunity to eliminate some clich√©s, but ... The real message of the film seems to be how gay men are so different from other men. Absolutely stupid of course. Even gay sex is perceived as less valuable than direct sex. This film tries to reach only an audience that wants to laugh about stereotypical gays. Do not waste time with German comedy films!
