While this version of Mansfield Park was a close match to the novel, it did not have the compassion I felt for Fanny, which is central to the story of Jane Austen. This was due to the complete lack of acting power of the actress Sylvestra Le Touzel. She had no attraction and sometimes seemed to lose herself in or out of depth. The scene with her uncle, in which she collapsed hysterically, was hysterical. She played this crucial scene badly and I was really sorry that Henry Crawford had ever taken care of her. <br /> <br /> The opposite is the depiction of Mary Crawford by Jackie Smith-Wood. What a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part, to make this character funny and selfish, selfish and yet vulnerable to love. <br /> <br /> I always loved Fanny. She is meek but with a relentless sense of what is right and of whom she thinks she deserves respect and admiration. The Fanny in this adaptation is too gentle and submissive, with little own thought until the end of the series. As much as I wanted to like this Fanny ... I just could not. <br /> <br /> I suggest skipping this version of Mansfield Park to see the real thing ... the novel. Fanny will not disappoint ... you will love her!
