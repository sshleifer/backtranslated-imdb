I spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this movie. I agree with almost all reviewers that Noah's ark is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! Do the executives at NBC have no class? I'm feeling sick because I actually saw both parts of this miniseries. The script is so stupid, so pointless and yes, completely indecent! I can understand making some changes for dramatic purposes, but this movie has changed almost everything in the story. God himself will go to the trouble of killing the entire Earth population, but he somehow misses a guy who drives around trying to sell Noah stuff. Give me a break! And what about Noah's sons, who behaved like Indiana Jones and rescued girls in need? If all that is not bad enough, there is the part in which God apologizes to Noah and says, "I'm sorry, Noah, I was wrong." Newsflash NBC, God can not be wrong! This movie is the tastiest and shameful biblical film ever made.
