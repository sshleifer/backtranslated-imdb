Is it really possible that so many people in this movie believe that the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and dark make-up, should she be a witch? And I get the impression that the movie is trying to present her as someone who is "different", someone nobody understands ... She's just a teenager and a stupid girl in her high school says she's a witch and everyone believes you. In addition, Brandi is either very poorly portrayed or the character itself is so ... fake. She did not convince me she was not a witch, not that I believed it at all. Everyone accuses her of being a witch, and she behaves as if she's not sure if she's a witch or not. And how they dressed them for the court - every day I see old ladies who would not wear it, even if it was the last outfit in the world! Brandi's brother was also not very convincing ... But the most important thing is that "she put this evil, bad girl back on the ground at the end of the film". "She won the fight and showed everyone that she is different." This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in life, way too shallow. I only saw it because there was nothing else on the TV at the moment, so I was sentenced to this garbage. Please do not waste your time watching this movie. When I saw the 7-star rating, I almost fainted ... Compared to other movies rated 7 stars, it's not deserved.
