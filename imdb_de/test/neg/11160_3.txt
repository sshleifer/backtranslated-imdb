Arnold fans scream with joy, fans of mindless action will scream in amazement, Catholics will scream. <br /> <br /> Illogically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and led by Peter Hyams at the pubic, * End of Days gets The Terminator out of his open hospital gown (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart surgery) while in Mysterious Ways blowing up things and blaspheming Bible verses to make Catholics lament more. <br /> <br /> It's 1999 and Doom-Sayers around the world live in fear that their computers will go fritz and lose their downloaded porn. Even as the stink of Y2K stinked in the streets of New York, former ex-policeman Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, who made the backstory "Dead-wife-and-kid" for the Loose-Cannon effect) had to become an alcoholic guard had, the theological defy waters, to the 20-year-old Virgin Christine (Robin Tunney) before calling as ?? to rescue? wait for that ?? The bride of Satan Dun dah daaaarrrh! It creates stupidity. <br /> <br /> For every anti-hero there is his anti-Christ. Gabriel Byrne is the devil here? and he's at a party like 1999, on a mission to impregnate Christine with the Anti-Christian between 11 pm and midnight on December 31, 1999? Ironically, in the hour that all porn will be lost? thus brought about the end of the days. Able to read minds, conjure hallucinations, and use limitless magic, Satan can not beat the impregnation process by showing up months in advance and applying Christine as a teen model, and then easily having the slip raid done at the appointed time closes. Instead, he appears on December 28th as a Keyser Soze Terminator wondering why she does not greet him with open thighs. (See comment on Re: Stupidity.) Here's a movie in which nothing makes sense the moment it's spoken, let alone think about its veracity or mythology. A priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that '666' is really '999' and has a '1' in front of it. So wait - * Prince * is the anti-Christian? <br /> <br /> Satan Soze is following Jericho and Christine (J and C), who are in the city and who are not doing anything that would actually trigger their capture. In one scene, Satan reconstructs Jericho's wife and child to get him to find out where he hid Christine. But if he can see so deeply in Jericho's sense of restoring his family with enough nuance to arouse nostalgia, why can not he see where Jericho hid Christine ten minutes ago? <br /> <br /> Satan can make an assassin talk without tongue, but he can not force that assassin to release a semi-automatic weapon. And when Jericho shoots Satan up close, Satan is polite enough to open his shirt to close the wounds, and Jericho is not worried about the health of Satan - not about paramedics dealing with gunshot wounds. In fact, not only does Satan own Jericho himself to approach and rapinate Christine, but so much unnecessary energy is spent on side projects (crucifixionist cruiser, Jericho's partner (Kevin Pollak) blow up and then save him then blow him up and ridiculously fight Jericho if he could eliminate him with the effort of thinking), that we wonder if an efficient assassin / lover should not be put on the case? Say, Antonio Banderas. <br /> <br /> What I appreciate most about * End of Days is Arnold's valiant attempts at The Method: "sad" means pulling his eyes shut and not creating anything with a foreign accent; "Depressed" means lifting a bottle to your lips and not blowing anything out with a foreign accent; "Dread" means widening your eyes and not blowing anything out with a foreign accent. There is definitely a pattern here, if only we could decode it. In the end, the devil is not sent out by the holy men who pray Catholics for deliverance from such apocalypses, but by the atheist Jericho. While the fearful men of an impotent god exhort "faith" and quivers in their cells while they do nothing about it Satan actually goes under it, the Prince of Darkness is thwarted by a Nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent. Which clearly says something that Catholics do not want to hear blindly: even if the devil existed, those who were indoctrinated to fear him unconditionally and irrationally might not be able to summon a belief in his demise, let alone react to it. Besides, they may not really want to be defeated because only by their opposite polarity does the existence of their god last. <br /> <br /> For it is written in the Book of Revelations: "And the Prince of Darkness will come down the earth without a sound game plan, and impregnate a virgin on a date that has no significance until the Gregorian calendar of the The 1500's taking on the day numbering they do with the Equinox and annoying Anno Domine syntax synchronizes sensible people for millennia, at which time Christians will have forgotten the actual birth date of Christ and appropriated the pagan Saturnalia festival - and the prince should cause a revolution through tight violet pants and ambiguous lesbian band members? "I can believe that people have been bled and crucified and alcoholics built like a Mr. Universe; I can believe that a huge, supernatural monster can not kill a man armed only with a foreign accent. I can even believe that the devil must perform a Celtic Druid ritual of the 13th century as a prelude - but what I can not believe is the 20-year-old maiden in 1999 in New York City. <br /> <br /> Especially near prince ...
