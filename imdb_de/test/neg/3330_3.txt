A group of 7 prospectors walk into a mine recently reopened after an earthquake. Of course, they do not pay attention to the local legend that something is down there, killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror movie has a slight cult appeal and I'm not sure why (unless it's dark). I admit, the last half hour is quite entertaining, but the hour you get there is pure torture. A lot of walking and talking, and our extraordinary strangeness appears only after 45 minutes. Even co-author Chris Huntley admits that he commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from the USC. I hope you know that an exploitative movie should be exploitative. Again, the last half hour is cool as three survivors fight against the stop-motion monster and there's a cool John Carpenter-like score. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it's literally on the screen for 45 seconds. <br /> <br /> Even if the movie is not the best, Code Red DVD has given this attention a lot of attention. They have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer / actor Mark Sawicki and co-author Huntley. The stories about the making of the film are fascinating and inspiring (like a set of caves being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are the USC student shorts by Sawicki and Huntley, which are all better than the feature production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it's a shame he did not do anything. Sawicki has worked steadily as a visual effects and cameraman in Hollywood. The VHS of the movie is legendary because it was so dark and I am sure that this is much better. However, there are still scenes in which the only image is five helmet lights that bounce in the blackness. Sure to say, the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still a "horror movie in a mine".
