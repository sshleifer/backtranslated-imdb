Butter Battle is a fun story about two fictional cities and their arms race. It's also a misleading allegory about the Cold War and the arms race in general. Yes, it's a children's book, but like so many of Theodor Seuss Geisel's works, it hits people with their morals over their heads. <br /> <br /> And this moral is what exactly? Of course, it is commendable to encourage us to focus more on what connects us than on what divides us. It is even a good thing to promote international cooperation. But equating the differences between the nations of the Warsaw Pact and Nato West with a difference in the use of butter is simply wrong. To point out the obvious, many Warsaw Pact nations at times enjoyed a lack of butter and bread - they would have liked to eat the butter if it were available. On a less literal level and regardless of your political inclination, Soviet socialism against Western (especially Anglo-American) democracy is not merely a matter of preference and custom developed in a Cold War with the Soviets, but in a hot war with the Axis powers , There is no doubt that Germany developed nuclear power during the war. Should the United States have renounced nuclear weapons research and trust its (not inevitable) victory in the conventional war? Once the weapons were developed, they were used against the enemy who attacked us in Pearl Harbor. What does a nation do at this time when the mind is out of the bottle? In addition, looking back on 20-20, which means that there is no way to let another half-crazy dictator with his eyes in the development of nuclear weapons. The second Gulf War has shown how difficult it is to identify credible threats and neutralize them. In any case, the cartoon is not much more than a simplified propaganda that probes the nuances of ethical issues behind the atom and instead seeks to stem the fear of gun technology in children.
