"The Wizard of Menlo Park" was deeply responsible for many of the things we take for granted in 2007: even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants, he gives birth to the electric light, the phonograph, the film camera and the electric car battery Electricity network (possibly its most important but least remembered invention), the prefab house and innovations for the telephone and the telegraph, as well as the cassette tape machine and an early voting machine. The total number of patents is more than 1,000 - far more than any other American inventor. But Edison was a ruthless competitor. He often had violent legal disputes over the precedence of his inventions against rivals. The best example is the phone, where he was one of seven or eight rivals who had claims against Alexander Graham Bell. Actually, Edison's invention was not the central idea that Bell and Gray had independently found in 1876, but an improvement in the sound quality of the telephone receiver and transmitter that Bell did not develop. Even so, it was part of the major Supreme Court ruling of 1888, which was the US Supreme Court's longest ruling (a single volume of their reports!) Written by Supreme Judge Morrison Waite - by the way, the poor Chief Justice within weeks killed in 1886 Edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the field of power grids for large cities. This was George Westinghouse, the inventor of the railway air gap. Westinghouse's company had received the support of a new inventor and former Edison assistant, Nicola Tesla. Tesla developed "AC", a competitive system to Edison's "DC". Essentially, the Edison system consisted of a direct circuit system. Tesla's system made it possible to switch power from one circuit to another - it was actually a better and more efficient system. But Edison was determined to break that rival with an ad campaign. <br /> <br /> It started with electrical power lines. Edison had laid his lines early in the ground, so they would not be endangered by the weather. But Westinghouse had to have its wires like a telephone line in the open air. When several accidental deaths occurred among Westinghouse repair workers (especially in an incident where the mechanic was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers in Manhattan's business district), Edison insisted that alternating current was far more dangerous than direct current One result of all this was that Edison helped some inventors get Westinghouse AC generators and dynamos for an electric chair. Edison himself always denied that he had invented the electric chair, but he helped several smaller characters along the way - for the full story read Mark Essig's EDISON & THE ELECTRIC CHAIR (New York: WALKER & COMPANY, 2003). <br /> <br /> Edison experiments with cats and dogs himself (experiments he liked to show to the public). Despite supporting the invention of a new method of execution, Edison was unable to stop public support for Alternating Current. But he never stopped trying. <br /> <br /> In 1903 he had the opportunity to combine his campaign against Westinghouse and AC with his invention of the film camera. He helped drop a known public elephant ("Topsy") who had killed several men. He did this by electrocuting the poor beast with AC. But the entire murder is in the movie - and you can still see it today. It's a pathetic movie - whatever poor "Topsy" did, it was a poor beast - not a Machiavellian killer. The moment we see the explosion of electricity sparks indicating the elephant's death, we know it will be over soon, but the sudden collapse of Topsy is still an unpleasant sight. The film leaves a bad impression in the mouth of a modern film audience. However, it is sad to say that it probably made a profit for Edison - his description of the film in his film catalog is a true pride in his performance here. In 1903, it was potentially exciting entertainment for many Americans. We are glad that more people are appalled today - sometimes you feel that the human race has improved a bit.
