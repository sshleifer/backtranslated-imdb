Critics love this movie. Personally, I found it pointless and tasteless. This is the millionth time that I've got into the "Critic Love Trap" and come out, desiring someone to throw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie. There are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. A warning to animal lovers: Do not watch this movie if you do not want to kill or harass sheep. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Asian movie, you will see Africa. If you want to watch a movie about escaped prisoners, read the classic Stir Crazy by Gene Wilder / Richard Pryor. Avoid 9 souls like the plague.
