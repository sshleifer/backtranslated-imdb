What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of talent. Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused. Jon Lovitz was very mildly amusing, but pointless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And was it just me or could Kari Wuhrer hardly act in this? <br /> <br /> The story was pretty nonexistent and really disconnected. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that happened. Like the surf guys who give up their lives every time they've been threatened in the last half? How about that you never saw her !! The setup of some scenes took way too long and there was not enough profit to give us a damn. Nothing in this "movie" really felt true or sincere. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say is that some (very little) of the scenery were filmed nicely and some scenes were a little interesting. Do not see that when there are so many better, pointless films.
