Sometimes things just should not be done. And although the setup seemed good enough, the audience will only gas in horror. But the problem is, it's not another Saw movie. It is so bad that you wish you would receive a punishment from Jason Voorhees. <br /> <br /> I've lost track of how many sports movies and parodies he has integrated into the movie. And in general it flopped in his attempts. It was a bit strange at first to tell his team that they should refuse that every subject should be a real player, but it was harder to see it. That and the joke about "Radio" and "IPod". <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not see this movie anymore. Even Trantasia is worth more. "D-"
