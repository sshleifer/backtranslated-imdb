Face! Antoine Monot, in an imitation of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob, keeps asking, but author / director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert can not say no to a joke, no matter how cheap he is. The best part about this movie is the soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, an understated old-school bard of "There's Something About Mary," would be famous for any town-cut-out story. When it comes to optics, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cool enough when he is flying in six sunglasses with aviator jalousies with his six-seater BMW two-door. Although he sleeps by chance with his wild-eyed, Bohemian little sister (Marie Zielcke), but who would not do that? Also thumbs up on how he gets black and white with a liberal dose of this mysterious substance they call zero-zero, but if you're looking for a more serious account of what an intoxication can do for you, I suggest out "fear and fright in Las Vegas".
