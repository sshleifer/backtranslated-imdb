This is a cheap biography of a star of black and white minstrel shows, a certain Dixie Boy Johnson. I do not know if this person ever existed, but considering the cast lists, "Lee Lasses White" and Roscoe Karns, who play the said character, are also puns version of his career. The act as it is follows Dixie Boy from career height to depression at the death of his wife at birth, the handing over of the child to friends and his return to the sixteenth birthday of his daughter and the debut of reconciliation. Another forgotten man, Benny Fields, plays Dixie Boy. The man has a nice baritone voice, but no acting talent and is a boring lump on the screen. Gladys George bravely tries to revive the works without success. Judy Clark makes the best imitation of Betty Hutton I've ever seen, though I think she thought she was herself. The score, filled with many numbers for the short run of 70 minutes, earned a deserved Oscar nom. Worth a look.
