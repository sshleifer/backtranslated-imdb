THE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Really disappointing adaptation of genre legend Richard Matheson's science fiction cooler "Button, Button" by the daring child prodigy Richard Kelly, who really packs a small, well-made piece into a WTF tune! The mysterious (and ridiculously mutilated!) Man, Langella, offers a million dollar deal for the "fighting" couple Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla to the point!) Stranger in the world (!) Sure, there are strings attached but is this really important? What is the reason why Kelly tweets so much curiosity in the name of God (ie bleeding in the nose, watery transport systems, that's right? Watery.Transport.Systems), if the tension should be strung as tightly as possible (oh possibilities). If this sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode, you're halfway right (the 80s TV reboot actually made a decent adaptation to the small screen, actually renting it instead!) One of the worst movies of the year.
