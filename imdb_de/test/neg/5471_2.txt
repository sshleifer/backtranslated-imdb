How can you make a mistake with a film that mixes the sophistication of Peter Cushing, the determination of Donald Pleasence and the bust of Luan Peters? Quite simply, you give them a horrible script to work with. Peter Cushing leads in a nasty role a satanic cult that has conquered a few friends of Donald Pleasence. Donald plays a determined but detached priest who wants to find his friends, but needs the help of Fred from Scooby-Doo to find them. He calls for the help of a New York bloodhound, who dresses like the hero of the cartoon in his task. Meanwhile, the girlfriend of one of the missing persons, Luan Peters, joins the search. If all this sounds interesting, you've been wrong, like me. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for the trio to track down the bad guys, but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are stupid. Even women find this a Crapfest. Each time they follow in the footsteps of the bad guys, our two male heroes ask Luan to stay in the hotel, though she can do herself better than Pleasence's playful, squeamish priest. We really fall, it's born no tension, there is no worthwhile dialogue, and the stars are counted by both hands to count how many times Luan Peters is asked to stay behind and let men work men to see a Minotaur in the movie, do not worry. We get a statue of a Minotaur spitting flames. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$ (There are some attacks and some victims, but those of you who are drooling (Gore will be a flop). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (Also If there are three of my favorite actors in this film, there is nothing to save here: Peter Cushing does not have much time on screen, Donald Pleasence is well aware that he is on the set of a stinker and Luan Peters is abused, given the talent would have been much better, but also the Ya Nkees lose a game here and there.) <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (Luan Peters takes a bath, but you see almost nothing. She is not as accommodating as in The Flesh and Blood Show.
