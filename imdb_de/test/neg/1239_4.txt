I looked at the first two nights before coming to the IMDb to look for actor information. I saw the 9+ rating that surprised me because I was not so impressed with what I saw. (As a reference, I happen to think that Lonesome Dove was the best TV western ever.I grew up next to the MGM properties in Culver City in the 1950s and have a certain sense of awe of the Western genre.) <br /> So I saw the glowing first review and decided to read "more". There I found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that my feelings about the lack of character development, bad editing, the feeling that they were recorded on the Universal lot (MGMs is long gone), and the overall impression that this is not the case I would almost change my feelings about LD. My impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was "less than 4.0". <br /> <br /> This made me wonder about the process that gives a 9+ rating. If the people giving the 10s and 9s do not take the time to justify their choice, will the ballot box be stuffed by people with money motives? I've been using IMDb for a long time as a movie-shooting tool and considered it the best available. I'm not so sure now.
