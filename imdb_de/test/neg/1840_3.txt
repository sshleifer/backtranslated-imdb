Doll Master is an example of a lousy horror movie that has fallen somewhere in space with its two less well-established genres, a horror movie and an emotional drama. Apparently, The Doll Master is trying very hard to be a scary horror movie, but it fails. The sound of the dolls moving is like Kayako's croak in Ju-On, and the crawlers are like a sadako-esquire. The killing dolls are reminiscent of a cute version of "Chucky". However, compared to Child's Play, this movie is better. But the story seems to be nothing, the brilliant camera shots and the brilliance of the acting was taken away because of the conspiracy.
