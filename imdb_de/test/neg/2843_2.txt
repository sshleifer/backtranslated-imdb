At first I thought that this was supposed to be some kind of comedy / horror when I saw the body in the bathtub while the lady screaming screaming, but as the movie progressed, it was getting flatter. The conspiracy was stupid by a man who was angry that housing prices have gone up. Now he decides to call a psychiatrist on the radio and babble his anger because he has nothing better to do. Then the law is included and desperately tries to make us feel that it really matters to them who the caller is and tries to track down this guy. One suspect after another is charged. This movie is horrible and the slowly moving love scenes of Adrian B. and her husband are boring and made me bring the movie to life. Avoid it!
