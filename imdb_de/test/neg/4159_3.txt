I thought that this movie was a bad effort by the British film-makers - fell flat, hey, Tim Robbins is an old guy and here is this beautiful young woman who's also in love with him. As lost in translation, it is really hard to lift unbelief in this context. It's a good looking movie, but it lacks punch. If Tim Robbins pretends to be mentally, it looks like he has a little migraine. He looks uncomfortable and life less. The part in which he investigates suspicious employees at the Sphinx is ridiculous. If an investigator came to my factory, I would tell him last of all about my freckle fetish. It's obviously too intellectual. Clumsy. The city is as it is, a favorable backdrop. They obviously chose the most futuristic city (Shanghai) as the backdrop, but the city never really came out and influenced the characters like Blade Runner, where the city's characters often cross history. slow as a wet week. No chemistry, really dramatic highlights, so plot.
