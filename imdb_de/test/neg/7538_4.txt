After seeing PURELY BELTER, I came to this page to review it, but not only that I had to review the CV of screenwriter / director Mark Herman. As soon as his name appeared in the opening credits, I knew I'd seen his name somewhere, and when I found out, he found out that he wrote the movie version of LITTLE VOICE, one of the most underrated British films of the 1990s. > <br /> PURELL BELTER is a completely different fish kettle. It's a dark, stereotyped view of Geordie's life, and beyond that, a very listless one. Everyone is either a wife, a single mother, a shoplifter, a drunk or a junkie. Since many scenes are in a school, the physical education teacher is a sadistic tyrant, and this is the film that comes so close to the film that it does not even meet reality. Oh, and all are very cursed, which adds to the bleak, unlikely atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I did not like PURELY BELTER while I was watching, and now that I know who Mark Herman is, I like it even less. With LITTLE VOICE, Herman has proved that you can make an amusing, uplifting comedy with Nordic souls, but I had to ask where his undoubted talent is in this film.
