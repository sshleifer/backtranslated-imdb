The Toxic Avenger, a terribly deformed creature of superhuman size and strength, is back in this sequel, which usually does everything wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find his father at the suggestion of his psychiatrist, who is in contact with a bad company that only wants the avenger to get a stranglehold on Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who has a different name in this one, a much less sinister, much funnier sound and an action that does not give the original a candle. Even with the completely uncut version, which can only be obtained when purchasing the Tox Box DVD set, the only thing that is the only thing that is intended for this model. And if you come across another version, do not forget to take advantage of this version at all. The first is a low-budget classic, but it just is not. <br /> <br /> My rating: D + <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Erika Schickel has a very fast nip slip; Phoebe Legere goes topless; a villager is completely naked; and a few extras in a bathhouse scene show various amounts of skin <br /> <br /> Tox Box Unrated Director's Cut DVD Extras: Intro and commentary by director Lloyd Kaufman; Second commentary with director Lloyd Kaufman, Troma editors Gabriel Friedman and Brian McNulty; Toxie on Japanese TV; Interview with Fangoria Editor-in-Chief Michael Gingold; Interview with Mike Mayo of Videohound; the same damn ray march that appears on EVERY Troma DVD; Clip by Lisa Gaye; "Toxie 15 years later" Mockumentary; 2 PSAs; Troma Intelligence Test; Troma Studio Building Tour; Advertisement for Lloyd Kaufman's autobiography; Stills gallery; Theatrical trailer; and followers for: "Toxic Avenger", "Toxic Avenger 3", "Def by Temptation", "Class of Nuke 'Em High", "Sgt.
