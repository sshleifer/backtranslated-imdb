Although Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good TV director and has a few good pieces in his honor, "Homegrown" is just a mess in his script and direction. Despite the performances of Billy Bob Thorton, John Lithgow, Kelly Lynch, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson, a good cast could not save the film. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaalics know that Jake and Maggie are in the movie, but they do not see Jake very well and Maggies is only 30 seconds into the movie as the babysitter distracts Lithwow's figure from a bust. It's not even a low-pot comedy, as the movie should be. It just was not funny.
