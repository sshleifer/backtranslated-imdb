For an Indy movie, this is probably a little better than one in three out of ten, but in general it only gets a 3. The effects are not terrible and at least some adults have adult roles and not many kids indy low budget horror films do so. The acting is very wooden, but at least they had a better "presentation" than some movies in the cheapest category. It is filmed a lot in a building and not in the basement of a friend. The plot as a whole is not the worst. It's a resident evil demolishing a bad company invading a small town, and an outbreak turns people into zombies. I would have liked to see some kind of creature and not the big bad guy, just another "super" zombie. I try not to write spoilers, but this review has one, so be forewarned !! SPOILER ALARM !!! Not only are some of the performers just passing the zombies (the same ones are recycled over and over, but at least they have more than 5 people playing them). But one of the action turns really does not fly with me. The deputy going inside turns out on the pay list of the evil enterprises. He kills one of the other employees in cold blood and then meets the boss villain in an office talking about tidying up. The MP has just shown us that he is also a really bad person and says he can clean it up (ie kill all surviving witnesses). No problem. But then, two seconds later, he helps them. There was no real "change of heart" or anything that made me feel like this bad guy had killed an innocent guy a few minutes ago and then talked about saving everyone as a savior. There was no incident or anything that caused me to participate. Worth seeing if you are a fan of cheap flicks, otherwise you will not enjoy this.
