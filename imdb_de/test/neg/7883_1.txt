This movie is about two female murderers going on tour to kill random men they meet. <br /> <br /> Wow, "Baise-moi" just became the worst movie ever on my list. The plot is crazy, pointless and unnecessary. The whole movie is full of violence and sex, and I'm sure no sensible parents want to show this movie to their kids. I do not understand what people make of it when they are doing this movie or watching this movie. Maybe someone has fulfilled his perverted desires somewhere. There is simply no excuse or reason for the existence of this perverted and corrupted work. <br /> <br /> The only consolation I give myself is that I watched it in the fast-forward, so I did not waste so much time.
