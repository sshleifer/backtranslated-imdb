I'm ashamed that I actually went to the theater to see this movie when it was released. Although I suspect that the thinly veiled depiction of the story of Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy is good enough, it is a film that should never have been made. therefore my low rating. The film tells the story of a wealthy Greek shark named Theo Tomasis, who woos and wins the pretty young widow Liz Cassidy of a slain American president. Sounds familiar? Yes, everything except the names. <br /> <br /> The cast is not to be criticized. Anthony Quinn plays the Greek tycoon to perfection, and at least it's a comfort when he's just read that Ari himself has claimed Quinn for the role. Jacqueline Bisset is, of course, beautiful and sophisticated in (in every way) Jackie, and James Franciscus has the American look of the President. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie since it came out, I do not want to see it again. I remember a pretty bad language and a general rudeness. Otherwise, I think this is a sensational and supposedly intimate glimpse into the lives of the rich and famous romping aboard their yachts, beaches, pools and more. <br /> <br /> The guy is okay, I suppose. There is no end to television films about the Kennedy's, which I have to admit to be tuned in occasionally, and not to my credit. This is basically just another. It is much better to leave Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis alone.
