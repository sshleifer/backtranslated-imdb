I happened to read all English manga from Junji Ito. I saw the Tomie movie and it was a big, steaming pile of crap. THANK YOU Uzumaki really lives up to the manga. I think those who have read the manga will really appreciate this movie, as many screenshots and camera angles are just like the manga and it's interesting to see how the characters in the movie are played. This movie reminds me of sinister Indiana. The ending is different from the manga I expected. Kirie looks like her mate to Manga, and her male friend fits in very well. Very scary, I have to admit, this movie feels like a feverish nightmare like a kid. Not really scary, but freaky, if you get my drift? Another big horror from Japan, get a copy.
