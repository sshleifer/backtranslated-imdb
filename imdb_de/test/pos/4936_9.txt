One of my favorite movies ever, I have seen three times. It is a great work to summarize the areas of Isrelai's life, the Israeli sense of humor and the seriousness and problems that the Israelis are experiencing. Universal theme, to be accepted and for what you are. Good subtle humor, and it's the charisma of the characters that makes this movie magical and says a lot about the Isrlaei culture and inconsistency, contradictions and humor, with a great actor, Oshri Cohen. I highly recommend it to anyone, and it's a movie that's suitable for just about anyone, family movie, friend / girlfriend movie, and says, apart from the Israeli culture, that he wants to be accepted, especially how important family is with all its diversity and imperfections. <br /> <br /> Great big movie.
