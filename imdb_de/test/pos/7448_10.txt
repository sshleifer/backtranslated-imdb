I will start with a Disclaimer: This movie is NOT recommended for anyone who is not interested or has never played FF7 before watching the game. The film is based on the audience's knowledge of every character in the game to convey elements of the storyline. And very subtly. Do your homework before you watch this wonderful CG movie, and I promise you it will be so much better. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are some of the most spectacular CG sequences I have ever seen. The whole experience felt like an extra-long FMV sequence from the game on steroids. Yes. The attention to detail in every scene, especially in the highly action-oriented, is so impeccable that I awed awe. <br /> <br /> I believe the soundtrack is simplified to allow the audience to focus on the animation quality more than the music. For those who are familiar with the history and background of the FF7, music should not surprise anyone (though the timing and placement of each original soundtrack accompanies each scene and mood to the point where music simply enriches the animation ). <br /> Once again, I only played FF7 once, enjoying this Square Enix artwork. And that's the feeling in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like a dance. <br /> <br /> In short, if you've enjoyed the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this movie will blow you out of the water. If you are in the unlucky majority that has not yet gotten to know FF7 on PlayStation or PC, this will give you an exponentially greater experience before you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just want to write down the quality of the animation of this movie. Characters move fluently. Each scene background comes alive and tells its own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the storyplot, I urge you to reconsider the animation. Facial reactions, subtle clues that bring about a different level of conversation beyond the typical narrative style of story plot deployment. Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura have set new standards for high-quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children has ushered in a new era for CG animation, where the intricacies of each character speak volumes. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Square Enix. The wait was worth it.
