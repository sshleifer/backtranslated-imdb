The biggest problem facing the television program Key West was that it was advertised incorrectly. If you had seen the ads, you would think that it was a wobbly, and very disappointed. It was a far more complex show than this one. <br /> <br /> I happened to be in Key West just before Hurricane hit Andrew, and I think I actually found a drink or two with some of the performers in Rum Runners. Of course that was before the show hit. I saw the sailboat that was in the opening, pass by a few times, and talked to the guy who was chopping coconuts in the opening. He was a real local. Yes, I would like to see it on DVD.
