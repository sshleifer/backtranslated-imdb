Well, I do not have to agree with Leonard Maltin in this animated short version. He loves it and claims it's hilarious. I enjoyed it, but saw no humor. He does not like hockey or knows nothing about it, and he still loved the story. I live right across the Canadian border and have seen hockey there for 50 years in both Buffalo and Buffalo. Oh, it was interesting and I know what would happen if you wore a Toronto jersey in the Quebec area - a disaster! This is especially true for the glorious years of Les Canadians. That does not make the story funny. <br /> <br /> In the fifties of the last century, everyone in the provinces of Quebec worshiped the Montreal Canadians and their star player Maurice Richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. When his mother orders a new sweater, he wears the Toronto Maple Leafs emblem, so the boy does not want to get caught wearing it. When he finally does it and goes to the local rink, he is ostracized by the rest of his hockey mates. What's so funny about that? I could see the same thing with a kid in Boston hardening Red Sox and his mom bringing him a Yankees shirt! Horrors! They could not wear it and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Maybe for someone who does not follow the sport at all, like Maltin, this situation seems strange and humorous to him ... but it's a fact of life or some bit-time sports fan and his favorite team , It was an interesting story and absolutely believable, but nothing that made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The art was fun to look through, almost like a long series of paintpainting made by a talented schoolchild. The French-Canadian accent was good as well. This movie was part of the DVD "Leonard Maltin's Animation Favorites by The National Film Board of Canada".
