OK. Is Barney the best children's show ever? Of course not. Some comments left by other members of the IMDb might suggest that this was a multi-million dollar production of high-profile actors and a ridiculous special-effects budget. Guess what? It's Barney for God's sake. He shows the children good manners, good knights and it's alright to be who you are. For those of you who find it annoying because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you. You may have gone a bit too far to the IMDb member who wrote the review on the first page. Did you actually describe a Sesame Street character as "down to earth"? Grow up, this is a great show for preschoolers and actually helps children learn in an entertaining and creative way.
