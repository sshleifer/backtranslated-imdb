This is a difficult show. It is not something to sit back and relax. It kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. People are raped, raped, tortured and die like flies. There are male organs everywhere, there are excrements, puke and blood. Oz is a brave show. Issues such as racism, homosexuality, the reality of the prisoners and above all problems are addressed. -Death penalty. It is also successful in my opinion, unlike, for example, the one-lane "medium". <br /> <br /> It bores me sometimes. It had some strange storylines and they spent a lot of time with characters who just did not interest me. Strangely enough, Season 1 was pretty boring for me. If I had seen it while it was broadcasting, I probably would not have pursued it any further. I love seasons 2 to 4. Season 5 and 6 are on display (although I think that it should not be allowed to pronounce the words "Cyril" and "Death Row" in the same sentence) are so many wonderful characters for which one can root. The old boys Bob and Busmalis, in which I totally fell in love with myself from day one. Said, Adebesi, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, whose monologues have so effectively connected the episodes. The staff with people like sister Pete and Ray Mukada - brilliant too. Even smaller characters who had only a few episodes or a few seasons, but also left a good impression. <br /> <br /> My favorites are the brothers O'Reily. Their relationship was the worst and warmest I've seen on TV. If there is something I can always remember, it is you. There will never be another "pairing" or whatever you want to call it that hurts me so much. That's why, when the ends come for them, it hurts too much. I wish it had never happened. I wish I had never seen it before. <br /> <br /> But good, Fontana. I highly recommend it.
