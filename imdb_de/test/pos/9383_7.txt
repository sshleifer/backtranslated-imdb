I can honestly say that "Death Bed" is a much better movie than I expected. Allow me to clarify the plot if the title of the movie is a bit too vague - there is a bed that eats. A bad bed. It eats people. Several unsuspecting women stumble upon the eerie "bag" during a "trip" and eventually fall victim to their hunger. The devouring process of the bed consists of a yellow foam that penetrates the people into the stomach acid. everything complete with Kauger√§uschen. This is a very strange cult movie and the only film by George Barry who had forgotten that he had made it until dialect of his newly found cult status returned to him and he decided to release it on DVD. Not a bad movie at all, if you can look past the lousy acting and enjoy the hokey effects - the most ridiculous is the guy whose hands are being eaten away, and he has only skeletal fingers made of plastic ... very surreal and outlandish - mainly the whole thing involving the artist behind the painting and the demonic back story of the bed. If you like bizarre no-budget bats, look for "Death Bed".
