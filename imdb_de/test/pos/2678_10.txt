Wow, in my opinion, this is the best sitcom since Friends. If you've had a crappy day, just sit down with a beer (if you're old enough, if no root beer is needed) and watch a few episodes. <br /> What I like most is that everyone on the show is very funny and all have a fantastic comedy timing. After a while you will be connected to the characters and really take care of them. I think the secret of show success is that they have an enviable life. Doug is fat but still happy with it, he loves his wife, his job and his friends. The father-in-law is the fly in the ointment, but nothing perfect.
