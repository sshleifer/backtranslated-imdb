I have just seen a few episodes of the "Eleventh Hour", but I have to say that they were enough to impress me. This series is just so impressive and interesting ... I will definitely follow suit. <br /> <br /> First, I have to say that acting is first rate. Patrick Stewart plays his character - Ian the Scientist - believable and cool, and he lets the audience believe in the character. Other characters like Rachel are also believable, and although they are sometimes a bit cold - due to the way the series is filmed - they're also interesting interesting one of the episodes I saw, for example, was cloning and a man who tried to clone people. The way the episode was developed and how Ian - Stewart - always followed the clues and saved the people was amazing. It has also made you think about ethics and how good or bad it could be. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think that this is a good TV program. I just hope it continues - interesting, thought-provoking and with good acting. Although filmed in a cold way - lightning, cold photography, many close-ups - it never stops being interesting. Highly recommended.
