I think it was a pretty good movie. It shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man, but unfortunately led to his destruction due to his ambition and the people around him. It shows that you can not trust anyone, especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy. The character I liked most was Sebeva. She was another ambitious, powerful and reckless woman in a male world that loved and respected Kilo. She also knew that the business was a business and a dangerous one. Everything she did was risky, but the work was done. She helped Kilo get rich with their relationships. Overall, I really liked this movie and I have it in my collection and I'm waiting for El Padrino 2.
