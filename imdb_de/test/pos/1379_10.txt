I tried to find out why I enjoyed this movie? It's not because of the money spent on it, that's for sure !! Did I see a painted water pistol there? Maybe they do not have the same kind of visual effect houses in Scotland? Or maybe they just did not have any money? The Making of clearly shows a group of very brave guys shooting a movie against the odds. Brilliant! What I really liked was the streak of performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead roles like two normal guys. There are no Hollywood histrionics here. <br /> <br /> OK, the effects do not work very well. The spaceships just do not look as good in today's FX world as they should, and I've seen much better free on youtube. But the movie stays together very well as soon as it reaches the planet. Was this filmed in Scotland or only by a Scottish crew? Or does it just work better? Did you handle the water? In the end, I loved this movie and was disappointed when they all died.
