I saw how this movie did not know about it. I assumed it was a science fiction movie. How was I wrong? The plot is intriguing and intelligent, the actors are all charismatic and the entire movie just makes you think for a change. Some of the puzzles totally outsmarted me, but in the end the answers were pretty simple. I'm pretty baffled by the low score of this movie because I thought that was pretty unusual. If you enjoyed the movie Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix you will like it. There are no major special effects or fancy gimmicks at all. It's about the plot, about building the characters and creating an atmosphere. However, it's a movie that does not provide any answers that might upset some people, but I thought the end was great. I'm still not sure if the movie is based on a true story or not .......
