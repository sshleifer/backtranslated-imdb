In August Days / Dies d'agost, Marc Recha has shown a Catalan documentary-style, sun-saturated road movie, which is primarily a meandering, improvised meditation on brotherhood and the reconquest of the dead. The beautiful sometimes spacious, atmospheric 35 mm. Landscapes, a beautiful soundtrack and Catalan narration enchant as a mood piece, if you are satisfied with a trajectory that does not have much momentum and leads nowhere. The filmmaker Marc Recha and his unidentified twin David are the stars and the narration is voiced by her younger sister. Marc had researched the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who was a friend of his family. He felt saturated with information and had to take a break. The film was the result of the break, capturing the mood of the interviews with Barnil's collaborators, the thoughts of the Spanish Civil War, the drought, the harsh landscape, the gentle landscape of the Recha brothers and mutual affection, and tanned nudity and what any characters or stories they encountered as they camped out of their van. This leads to the pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. In the end, David has to return to Barcelona to be with his daughter, and Marc has to return to his project and that's where it ends. I found it intriguing to hear an extended Catalan narrative with a mix of Spanish and French-sounding words (perhaps linked to Proven√ßal?). This is not a major movie, but it attracts attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clear visual and auditory beauty and its ability to play with genres and mix autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought provoking manner , <br /> <br /> An official selection of the New York Film Festival 2006 at the Lincoln Center.
