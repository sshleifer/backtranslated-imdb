I saw the MTV premiere of this movie last night and had to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder. Obviously, this film is enjoyed most by fans of the D because it has a lot of jokes for those who have seen the HBO series, and has more than enough D for newer fans and the mass of converts coming soon. The music really shines with the new songs "Kickapoo" (which is much better than it sounds), "Master Exploder" (possibly the third best song in the world) and "Dude (I totally miss you)". There are a lot of excellent scenes (the chase, the rock-off, the meeting) and cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I could really go on for hours, but I do not want to reveal the movie. Look at it. You will not be disappointed.
