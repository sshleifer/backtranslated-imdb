I have not really seen many films with Holly Hunter, but seeing them in the Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is a hard-core journalist, Jane Craig, who has devoted all her time to the television news program. Her colleague Aaron Altman has worn her torch for a long time without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the slightly different ex-sportcaster who is the new reporter. For Jane, he symbolizes everything she does not like about reporting - from edutainment, not from reputable business. To her surprise, Jane is attracted to Tom. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter does a great job as a cheeky journalist. But I do not see what she finds so attractive about her new colleague Tom. It's something with them that keeps us from getting closer to him. Almost as impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives everything in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent to his job but does not get that much back. Actually, I thought he was Steve Guttenberg from the Police Academy (1984). He has some funny lines and if it's a Meg Ryan picture, they would call it a romantic comedy. e.g. Jane and Aaron's trip to Central America. I am also a fan of the happy ending and had preferred an end other than just a reunion of the three of them seven years later.
