I'm a big fan of the $ 5.50 DVD repository on my WalMart. Hopefully you have one in your local branch. You can find a lot of Campy flicks, a lot of garbage and occasional surprises. This movie is one of the surprises. Recently, my friend bought this, and when I thought it was another cheesy Kung Fu laugh salmon upset, I was really surprised how good it was. I watch a lot of films and can therefore almost always say how a film will develop; and if there is an action, what will it be? Not this movie! The direction is brilliant, the plot is great and the fights are incredibly resourceful. If you see this somewhere for a cheap price, then get it! If you see it at full price, I would recommend it anyway.
