Morris and Reva Applebaum had been Broadway's Broadway in its heyday. Morris is a widower at the age of ninety. He calls his sons - the psychotherapist and the BMW car dealer - and his daughter, the television writer / producer, to a special party, whereupon he will euthanize himself. Literally minded creatures that they are take what they say at face value. He leads them, his grandchildren, and some others, including an Afghan-American Jewish psychiatrist reminiscent of Godfrey Cambridge, on a fun manhunt chase as they try to stop him or dissuade him. The services are excellent. Peter Falk is in top form. This movie deserves more than an audience: it deserves the success of the audience.
