This series is greatly underestimated. Like many others, I met Farscape after the series was canceled. Bought Season 1 and was surprised to find an intelligently written drama with a well-balanced mix of suspense, romance, wit and, of course, sci-fi. Right away it got a 10 for the first series or the first movie that convinced us how our hero - and every alien he comes in contact with - speaks English! Okay, a few others have bypassed the subject, but Farscape has done the best. The point is, the authors pay close attention to detail to make the show as credible as possible. <br /> <br /> With so much bad programming out there, it's a pity that balanced, entertaining shows like Farscape do not get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. While enjoying the four seasons and thankfully the four-hour miniseries, we may be able to make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.
