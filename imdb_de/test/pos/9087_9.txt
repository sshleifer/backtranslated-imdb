Cocky medical students play chicken with a process of simulating death for a (hopefully temporary) view of life after death. Certain twists and turns of the plot are somewhat wrong, and acting occasionally goes over the edge. The underlying message - about the forgiveness of God and others for our real or perceived sins - is positive and unique in the cinema, and the cast is very good. The final sequence between Julia Roberts and her dad is so effective that for years after seeing her I still feel chills when I think about it. Highly recommended.
