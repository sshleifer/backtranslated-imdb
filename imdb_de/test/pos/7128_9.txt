This groundbreaking movie is truly a work of art. I came with very low expectations at the convention in Indiana, having already seen two more movies with "gamer" in the title (both were so bad that I pulled out one of my films at the end of the second movie) own eyes with mine Drinking straw and a twisted paper clip I found between the seat cushion). But from the opening credits, "Dorkness" had me. The temperate northwestern setting provided a beautiful setting for the drama of frustrated Game Master Lodge (powerfully portrayed by Nathan Rice) and his inept group of friends setting aside the real-world dramas they face each day for fantastic dramas in the Setting Lodge opposite them takes care of them. After the first scene (in the fantasy world they inhabit), they are forcibly driven back into the world, desperately trying to escape. This drew so many comparisons with my own life that I was moved to tears. Rice's drama is so amazingly caliber that I really believed in the first 20 minutes of the movie that he was really a man of about twenty who suffers from frustration, male pattern baldness and an annoying group of "friends" who are not conceive concepts like right and wrong. Lodge friends are important here: Leo, the eldest and heaviest of the trio, seems to be the only other character out of the lodge who has a job. Still, he seems socially attracted to Gary, the youngest of the group. This may seem a bit strange at first, until you realize that Gary is actually a sexually confused sociopath who has very few perspectives outside of his "fantasy world." This dichotomy is not meant to confuse but to inform and educate the public about the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint is that the actors portraying Leo (Scott C. Brown) and Gary (Christian Doyle) seem to occasionally make the characters laugh, as if they were informed that they were acting in a comedy instead of a harsh comedy , Beat action / drama. Speaking of action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass, the third and most influential member of Lodge's colorful team. The tension is always great when he's on the screen, both when he's passionate about his belief in lodge, and when he shows off his fantastic martial arts skills as "Silence," his fantasy character. Or even if he suddenly turns around to face the audience and ducks reflexively into the audience, so as not to be hit by his fantastic chin. Lewis lights up the screen, no matter what he does, and I hope to see more of him in the future. As soon as the action starts in this movie, it just will not stop. Drama and action sometimes blend together so seamlessly that you can tell whether you're in the middle of a frenetic action sequence or in a touching dramatic moment. It's really an exciting ride with epic proportions. I would recommend "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising" as an absolute must-see for anyone who loves film. It's almost worth it to lose an eye. <br /> <br /> ~ Chip Deedlenick
