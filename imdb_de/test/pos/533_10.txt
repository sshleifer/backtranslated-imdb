Adam Sandler's films are my favorite comedies. The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie. The Matrix is ​​my favorite sci-fi movie. Everywhere, but here is my favorite drama. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most valuable asset of this film is its acting. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing. At the end of this movie, I felt like I knew her character better than myself. She did a great job. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman has also done a great job. I recently rented her first film, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12-year-old girl. I believe that it is a contradiction. She was a good child actress. Well, 5 years later she is an equally good actress. In fact, she is much better. <br /> <br /> Not only did Sarandon and Portman portray their characters well, they also worked perfectly together. I mean, even now I can hardly believe that they are not really mother and daughter, both in real life and in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is about a 14-year-old girl (Portman) and she is restless mother (Sarandon), who leaves her hometown in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> First, Portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends, and the two start a very turbulent relationship that goes up and down over a couple of years (usually downhill, I could Add). <br /> <br /> Although this explanation is somewhat vague, the plot can only be summarized vaguely. But if you watch this movie, you will find that the plot is not so vague or weak, because it is really deep. What I mean by that is that the plot is poorly sketched, but then they focus on making it strong. <br /> <br /> And she's very strong, but the sequencing of the plot is great too. And there are some brilliant scenes that I hope will one day be considered "classic". <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. I laughed. I cried. And though admittedly there are some loopholes, it's still an outstanding movie, and in the end it really comes together.
