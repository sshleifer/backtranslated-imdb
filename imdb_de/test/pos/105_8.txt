Let's put the cultural aspects of this movie aside for a moment, even though it's a very important site, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very beautiful love story. Two people are in a difficult situation caused by two selfish husbands. They have to live through their sad days without a glimmer of hope. If each of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each had to accept. They found each other and fell in love. That this love violated all social, religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant. They loved each other, found relief in each other, that was enough. The reaction of the people around them is only a small fact that they have to accept, even suffer, and then they can continue their lives, their lives. Very nice.
