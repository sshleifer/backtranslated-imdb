If you have a box of handkerchiefs, a comfortable couch, a large bowl of popcorn and no social engagement on a Friday night, this is definitely your movie! It's romantic, hot and challenging. For most of us homosexuals, religion is just one of the things we did as children and probably just stared at the old boy and how sweet he was! In the last few days, however, you see the struggles of being gay when your entire world turns to beliefs that are totally opposed to being gay. The two main actors were totally hot, but at the same time managed to capture your heart and even make 'almost' cry (I've never cried in a movie!). I highly recommend this movie, you will laugh, you will cry (except you) and you will definitely drool! I love it so much that I even bought the DVD for my collection. It is really the most beautiful movie of all time
