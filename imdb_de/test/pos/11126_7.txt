"Fame" is a very successful portrait of the New York High School of the Arts students. The film focuses on a group of students who dream of making it big while perfecting their craft at the now famous school. Director Alan Parker allows each of the highlighted students to ripen on the screen so that they can feel a connection with each student. The music here is contagious and fun. The dance is exciting and fresh. The film eventually became the basis for an Emmy-winning television series starring Debbie Allen and several other actors in the film. One of the more enjoyable "dance" movies of the 1980s. Got Oscars for music. 8.10
