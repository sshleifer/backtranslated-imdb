This is my first Deepa Mehta movie. I saw the movie on television in its Hindi version, with "Sita" being portrayed as Nita. I also note that it is Radha who has gone through the allegorical process of fire in the movie and not Nita / Sita. What I really loved about the movie, though, was the script of Mrs. Mehta, not her director. The characters, big and small, were well developed and ended up quixotic - something like the end of Mazursky's "An Unmarried Woman". They are brave women surrounded by cardboard guys. And a cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come to life in the last shot we see of him - he carries his sick mother Biji. He finally seems to take on a future responsibility that goes beyond celibacy and the observance of religion. <br /> <br /> Mehta seems to be messing around as a director (but she seems brilliant compared to most mainstream Indian cinemas), as she can not use her script to go beyond the microscopic community of community that she presents , besides the presentation a look at the Chinese minority in the social environment of India. She even dedicates the movie to her mother and daughter (not her father!), But her Radha recalls Halcyon Days with her two parents in a mustard field. Compare them to Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Muzaffar Ali. It is overshadowed by these giants - given their skilled Canadian production team and their financial resources! Mehta's film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be slavery for some, but it only captures the atrophy of bourgeois houses that seem to be striving for better than immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada, Malayalam, and Bengali films touched on parallel themes in India but did not have the public that surrounded the film, and were therefore not seen by any broad segment of knowledgeable filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Ms. Das, Ms. Azmi, Jafri and Kharbanda are believable, but not outstanding. Ms. Azmi is a talented actress who has done well under good directors ("Khandar" by Mrinal Sen, "couple" by Gautam Ghose, "Ankur" by Benegal). Woman That sparkled more because of her screen presence than because of her acting ability. All in all, the film's strength remains in the structure of the screenplay, which is above average in international cinema. I'm sure Ms. Mehta can improve her writing skills in her future scripts.
