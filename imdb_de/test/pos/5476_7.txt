What I saw from Wolfgang Petersen's films was pretty good. He knows how to direct actions, create tension and interest you. Eastwood is usually great, sometimes excellent. This applies to his acting as well as his direction. Both work here firmly. The concept is not bad and the cat and mouse game works well. Malkovich plays pretty well, and his and Eastwood's mutual playing complete the movie. I assume that this does not introduce anything new, really ... but it never really or does not really claim. They are two great actors, each one of whom has a fundamental role to play in other parts of their careers, and who can excellently guide them with an outstanding director. Really, it's entertaining, well done and just delivers. Cut and film are good. Acting and character writing is too. The movie manages to be thrilling and intense, and if you let yourself go, you will probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are excellent films. The tempo is pretty accurate. I recommend it to any fan of the main actor, the director and / or this type of movie. 10.7
