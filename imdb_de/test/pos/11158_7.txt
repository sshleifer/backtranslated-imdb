Jacques Audiard's directorial debut See How They Fall aka Regarde les Hommes Tomber is our old friend. The movie with two different stories that gradually come together and turn out to be the same story that is simply told from different angles. It is a shaggy dog ​​story, with Matthieu Kassovitz 'simple, followed by the unlucky Jean Louis Trintignant with a motherly devotion, who even extends to killing him if he is asked to repay his gambling debts in kind. In a slightly different timeframe, Jean Yannes becomes more and more obsessed with finding the hit man, who puts his policeman in a brain-red coma, over the hill of traveling salesmen, his life, his income and his relationships are gradually being left closer to his prey , While the film is the perfect set-up for a modern neo-noir, the film is often surprisingly playful, more intrigued, and a bit distorted sense of humor (occasionally ironic captions and Alexandre Desplats jaunty, half-discordant score) Thriller sets and plot mechanics. Unfortunately, the film is poorly served by one of Region 1's worst DVDs of recent years: the picture quality on Synkronized Disc is so bad that you sometimes expect to see the heads of the audience like a pirate disc in front of the picture.
