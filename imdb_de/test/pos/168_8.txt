This pleasantly perverted and crazy teen body-count movie of the early '80s may never reach the astonishingly twisted peak of the deeply troubling and criminally underrated murderous moppet film Devil Times Five, but it's still an above-average killer children's opus , <br /> <The slender but useful plot focuses on a trio of mischievous types - two brute boys and a scary, sparkling, though angelic-looking little girl - all born on 9 June 1970 during a solar eclipse. When the weird, antisocial trio, who are holding together in a tight, exclusive circle, turn ten years old, they suddenly go murderous and declare the season on the hapless, unsuspecting local Yokel of the former sleepy and peaceful Californian suburb of Meadowvale. The author / director Ed Hunt, the usually incompetent, unsung hack who is responsible for wonderfully pitiful clunkers, like the adorable stupid "Starship Invasions", the provocatively inhuman Jesus Christ Vigilante parable (!) "Alien Warrior" and the amazing stupid "The Brain". does a pretty solid and capable job here: the kill scenes are plentiful and pretty brutal (the arrow through the eye is particularly uncomfortable), there is a considerable amount of unnecessary nudity and softcore sex, a decent tension is neatly laid out and maintained , some nice buddies of dark humor underline the adamant distorted chaos, and the startling, cruel end manages to really jerk. <br /> <br /> In addition, the cast of the top drawer continues to make the process perfect to see and thrill: Jose Ferror as a small-town doctor, future "Jake and the Fatman" series star Joe Penny as amateur astrologer, "The Prey" s Lori Lethin as a courageous babysitter heroine, Susan Strasberg as a kid's school teacher, "American Ninja" - Michael Dudikoff as Chowderhead Jock, and Cyril O'Reilly (the lone Misanthrope vampire in the melancholy melancholy "Dance of the Damned") as libidinous Teen guy being taken away while washing Think with a naked hot chick behind a parked van. Billy Jacoby (who starred as "Dr. Alien" and "Demonwarp" in direct video in the late '80s), Andy Freeman, and above all the scary Elizabeth Hoy are really scary and convincing as the terrible troika of chilly evil and amoral Rugrats , And, yes, this is none other than Julie Brown, the uncompromising comedian who scored a startling top-40 hit with the hilarious novelty song "The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun," as a lovely, empty, busty redhead bimbo, the one she has great length, alien, but still sizzling and very much appreciated naked striptease as she dances in her bedroom to a cheesy, shrill rock song! All in all, this baby is a stable and satisfying Slasher item.
