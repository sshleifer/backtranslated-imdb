As a European, the film is a beautiful recollection of my time as a student in the '80s and the experiences I've had abroad and interacting with other nationalities, even though the circumstances were a bit different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982 to 1985, so one would think he would fall back on this experience. <br /> <br /> It's interesting how the film balances the message that "you should not generalize" with the notion that "there is a truth behind every cliche." For example, the Italian character is more based The stereotypical aspect of the film, however, is not a figure, but the central theme of infidelity, as a critic points out is unfaithfulness to French film as important as teaching the British film. <br /> <br /> Both the protagonist and his girlfriend are not being sympathetically sympathetic, which I think is aware and great. <It may be inadvertent, but some of the Citizens have elements that could be understood as a metaphor for the perceived role of their countries in the EU The British woman has an airman with an Amer ikaner (who is an entertainer - like a US president of the 1980s), while the Frenchman shows up as a natural leader (if the landlord shows up). <br /> <br /> Although Europe is not as different as New York, we notice that we only see two non-white characters. One is a Chilean woman with indigenous characteristics, who, despite her age as a protagonist, is not portrayed as a potential object of interest. Another is a man of Gambian-Spanish or rather Gambian-Catalan, who seems a bit invented. <br /> <br /> One might ask why Klapisch selected protagonists from the long-standing EU member states in Western Europe. While these nationalities reflect what he and I would meet as students in the 1980s, I believe that exchange programs in Europe today are much more diverse. The Erasmus program covers some 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not members of the EU. However, I understand that the choice of nationalities known to the majority of viewers was considered necessary, so as not to distract from the contrast that Klapisch seeks to create between the Europe of Peoples and the bureaucratic Europe. <br /> Despite minor problems a great movie that made me return to Europe to live there. A French friend of mine, who also emigrated to the US, has captured our shared feelings in this contradiction: "If Europe were more like the US, I would leave it immediately."
