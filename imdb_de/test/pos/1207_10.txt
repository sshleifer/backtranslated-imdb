I saw this movie on cable for the first time in the early 80's. It was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race and a number of things that I certainly missed. About a year ago, however, it came back into my life when I started enjoying it with my son. He's a little young (9) for many topics, but he understands that dancing hippies are fun, and he comes up with the idea that the ending is ironic. Although I can not imagine other films in this genre, I have an independent genius that I love. It is also a unique justice for Central Park. Most musicals are lost to me, one way or the other. "Tommy" was exaggerated and in the right direction, "Oliver" seemed to act on the screen as the control of the audience. "The Wall" was so much abstract and important throttling sounds just right for our time, just like in the eighties, as it must have been in the sixties ... really timeless.
