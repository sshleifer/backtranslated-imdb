This movie is a scary but interesting movie. I'll tell you later why this is scary in this review. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting because it was the first movie ever to contain sound. No, it may not be an hour and forty-two minutes movie, no, it does not contain great action scenes, but it's still a wonderful movie for me. It has sparked a whole revolution, if you will, of sound films. This can be a bit scary, knowing that everyone in this movie is dead now. In the beginning I can hear the voice of a man who no longer sees the earth visible and the sound is crisp and broken. > <br /> I recommend this video for everyone to watch. That's how films were made, as we know them today!
