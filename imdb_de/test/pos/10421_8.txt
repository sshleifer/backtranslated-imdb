I largely agree with the statements made by the Aussies. However, it does seem like a pretty decent plan if it is not original. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inherits a rural estate of which she intends to open a mountain lodge. She is introduced again to Chip (Bobby Johnston), whom she met when she grew up there. The story throbs when James (Paul Logan) arrives with his new stripper friend Shene (Devinn Lane) because Christina has been James's stripper boyfriend in recent years, implying that James had somehow made her wrong. To make the movie Sophia Linn (Monique Parent) even more interesting, a novelist appears as a guest at the lodge, as do Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (Flower), a pair of lawyers from the city. James punishes the local building regulations inspector in Christina's shop as one of his dirty tricks to turn them off. The question is, "How far will James go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed?" <br/> <br /> Look out for Devinn Lane here and in "Beauty Betrayed". It seems to make a transition from the hard core business to the "R" world. Another notable film is Samantha McConnell, who plays the role of "Bait". This is clearly the worst character name in the movies!
