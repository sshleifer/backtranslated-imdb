In Hong Kong (1962), editor-in-chief Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife and secretary Su Li-Zhen drag Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband into an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Her wife and husband stay away from home most of the time, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant near the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a kind of platonic and repressed love. Later, they find that their comrades have an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably the oppressed state of a married woman keeps her love on a platonic level. "In the Mood for Love" is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story with a wonderful photography and a soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had no script and the actors were never sure what they would do. Later, the director edited his story based on the tracks. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in history until 1966, when his conclusion is purposely open and unclear, leaving questions like the boy with Li-Zhen. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Amor Ã€ Flor da Pele' ('Love on the Skin's Surface')
