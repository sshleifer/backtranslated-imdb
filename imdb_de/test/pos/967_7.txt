Big Fat Liar is a pretty funny movie. But when I saw it, I was thinking about something. Some of the events that occur in this movie are incredible. The movie is really a big, fat lie. It is impossible that he would have got away with all this. Here are all incredible things. <br /> <br /> 1. When he fakes, his father had smothered at a meatball and behaved as if he were the father. Jason (Frankie Munez) could not get away with it. Luckily for us he did not do it. So it was not there, the unheard of. <br /> <br /> 2. If the grandmother was blind, she would still have realized that this was not her granddaughter. <br /> <br /> 3.You could not get on the plane, fly to LA, behave as if they were cloak sellers, sneak into the studio and then and then ... Well, part of the movie is a bit unbelievable , But it does not hurt to say a little white lie. Trust me, I do it all the time. <br /> <br /> Big fat liar, even if sometimes incredible, is fun. It is also very funny. But let me just say one thing before continuing with the review. If Paul Giamatti was not in this movie, that would be really shitty. It would be terrible. The big fat liar is also pretty funny, although he is sometimes trite. I give a thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Big fat liar: *** / ****
