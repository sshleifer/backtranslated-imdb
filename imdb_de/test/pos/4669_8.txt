Here is another pleasant surprise. Whenever I hear that a movie is being re-made, I'm terrified. Films such as Gone in Sixty Seconds and The Day of the Jackal are being redone and the results are less than outstanding. When I heard that "the Italian job" was being redone, I expected it to go bad. and has been proven wrong. Granted, it's not original and predictable, but it sure is fun. From start to finish you will be taken on a very funny ride. The scenes with the minis are great and the characters really enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> So, even if there are some mistakes, who cares when it's fun? <br /> <br /> 8 of 10. The only points that have been lost are possibly the few details and a slight lack of realism. But you will have so much fun that you will not even have the chance to stop and notice.
