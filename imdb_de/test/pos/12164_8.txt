I had never read (or even seen) much of the six-headed British comedy group The Crazy Gang, but my positive experiences with their contemporaries Will Hay and Arthur Askey - and especially Graham Greenes' highly acclaimed THE FROZEN LIMITS ("The Funniest English picture that has been produced so far ... it can be compared to SAFETY LAST and THE GENERAL ") - I have been with the nude R2 DVDs of Network of this and the following film GASBAGS (1941, see below) the earlier released almost without fanfare this year. <br /> <br /> A British Western is a rarity, but a British Western parody is even rarer (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] was still around 25 years away). , By the way, the film goes back to the Silent classics mentioned by Greene, THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and WAY OUT WEST (1937) seem to me to be more obvious. It also plays as a variation of the fairy tale "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (which was just immortalized on Walt Disney's animated masterpiece on the canvas) and features the seventh member of the old comic and frequent Will Hay slide Moore Marriott; The gang is actually called the pretty heroine Eileen Bell by that name, and there is even an amusing sequence with the six getting ready to go to bed and whistle the dwarf song from the Disney movie! <br /> <br /> Six comedians (three comedy duos: Flanagan & Allen, Nervo & Knox and Naughton & Gold) are perhaps the largest group in the film - though not all of their personalities appear here: My favorites were Big Bud Flanagan (looks a bit like Jim Backus), straight man Chesney Allen and mustached, squeaky Teddy Knox; Bald-headed Charlie Naughton, however, often took the limelight - as he was the one the others always seemed to be. Still, it's Marriott who steals the movie from his very first scene - where he wants to incarnate every officer in the rundown theater of a ghost town! A very young Bernard Lee is also notable as the villain of the play. <br /> <br /> The Ore routine between Flanagan and Allen takes Abbott and Costello's famous "Who's On First?" (the movie actually depends on it) on a lot of pun for his humor - which does not necessarily have to travel at this point). Nevertheless, there are several comic sequences, some of which even brought tears to the eyes: the opening scene, in which the gang is exposed by a group of angry creditors; they disguise themselves as Indians once they hit the Yukon; the trick of the gang to make everyone rich with the same piece of gold; They all embody the sleepwalking Marriott to confuse the villains (a gag possibly due to the hilarious mirror sequence of the Marx Bros. in DUCK SOUP [1933]). the punctual theater sketch, which makes fun of raucous melodramas; the surreal moment when one of the gang, pursued by the villains, climbs a staircase that is part of the painted scene in the theater; and especially towards the end, when a group of singing Mounted Police gallops to save the gang (despite being attacked by the increasingly impatient ranger hero). The thin soundtrack and the wild nature The gags themselves sometimes made it hard for me to get any jokes - subtitles would certainly have been welcome in this case. The Crazy Gang made only five films - the first two were also highly regarded, OKAY FOR SOUND (1937) and ALF'S BUTTON AFLOAT (1938), and a much later reunion (though Allen had already canceled due to that) (by Eddie Gray replaces), called LIFE IS A CIRCUS (1960), directed by Val Guest, who by the way has co-written both gang films I bought along with some of the aforementioned Hay and Askey vehicles!).
