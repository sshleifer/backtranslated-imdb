The film "... and the earth did not swallow it," based on Tomas Rivera's book, is a sensational film to most people. It's about the exploitation that agricultural migrants go through to survive. Sergio Perez uses Impressionist techniques to depict Rivera's story. He shows some of the scenes with sienna and grayscale effects, and he uses certain photographic techniques to make the scenes look as if they happened in the fifties. Perez also gives the film life with contemporary music, including ballads and guitar playing. <br /> <br /> I think this is a good movie because it shows in detail how migrant agricultural workers live, what they do for entertainment and what they believe.
