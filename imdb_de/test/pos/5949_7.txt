I saw the parade in Paris in May 2006 ... I have discussed what is impossible and a mission is impossible. I am very glad that I chose OSS 117, not only because it was funny, but maybe also a FRench film in France. I had a great time ... would recommend it. It's important to have some understanding of today's French society to really enjoy the humor of this movie. I can not wait for the DVD to come out. I do not know how some of the "Jeu De Mots" are literally translated into English I'll definitely buy it when it's out! P.S. I have seen in 'BRice de Nice', a film with Dujardin that all the children in France talked about. This movie is a comedy, but more stupid than you can imagine ... Comparing both films, I have to say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS 117.
