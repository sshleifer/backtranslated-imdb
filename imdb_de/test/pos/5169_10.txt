This movie is my family's favorite Christmas movie because it's a beautiful picture of what Christmas is all about. Nowadays I live in a big city that I hate. I like watching movies about the life I've always dreamed of. The city in which this film plays is my dream for the life I always wanted and the true sense of community that has been lost in today's society. I really do not feel the true spirit of Christmas anymore, but watching this movie helps to find that feeling again. My family recorded this movie a long time ago from television and now our copy is worn out, so I would really like to buy a couple of copies on DVD for my family and myself, if anyone can tell me where to buy a few copies, please just post the info here and I'll keep looking. Many Thanks.
