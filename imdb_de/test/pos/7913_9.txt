I honestly can not believe that this movie is not rated higher. Claude Chabrol could be described as a Frenchman Alfred Hitchcock, and although this film is only the second of his I have seen (the first being Le Boucher), I can already see that this guy is special on stage is strength of these two films. The film is a French and Canadian co-production and takes place in Canada. The cast consists of British and Canadian stars, and the high-quality performances are a good sign of the rest of the film. Most of it is also of high quality. The film is a murder mystery and begins when a young, bloodied girl is taken to a police station. After being questioned by Inspector Carella, it turns out that the young girl Patricia and her sister Muriel were attacked by a man who killed his sister and Patricia only allowed him to escape. However, during the investigation, Patricia goes back to the station to provide new evidence, revealing a shocking identity to the killer. <br /> <br /> The performances in this film are excellent. Donald Sutherland is subject as usual, but he fits in well with his role, and I would not hesitate to call his performance in Blood Relatives one of his best. The film also features supportive spins by British stars Donald Pleasance and David Hemmings, both of which give good spins. Especially gratifying, who shows how great an actor can be and how sad it is that he wasted himself in Halloween movies. The unknown Aude Landry also does a great job in her role as Patricia. The movie is very secretive for the first hour and keeps the audience really addicted. As Inspector Carella Muriel's diary discovered, the film is more of a drama in which the last actions of the girl are shown. And though this section of the movie is not as good as what he did before, it's still interesting and leads to a big twist in the end! Overall, Blood Relatives is a great movie that really deserves to be seen better. Le Boucher is a well-known Chabrol approach, but it's just as good for my money! We recommend.
