This film is based on the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daunton Lee. This fascinating story takes place at the time of the Whitlam dismissal, during which time Christopher was inducted in secret correspondence during his time as an employee of TRW, confirming the involvement of the CIA in Australian political and trade union circles. The film features several scenes with Gough Whitlam (broadcast on US TV), where events take place to confirm the secret documents Christopher had previously read. The removal of Gough Whitlam was an organized CIA coup. Elsewhere in the film, it has been mentioned that most people have no idea how far the deception goes to ultimately ensure that the US is used as a tool to promote policies on behalf of everyone else. Nothing has changed in the current age. <br /> <br /> Christopher's life has been deeply influenced, shocked by his knowledge of what and how the CIA shapes foreign democracies, including the democracies of allied nations in the United States. Christopher responded, probably not in the best way, at the time he sold top secret information to the Soviet Union, with Daunton Lee acting as his replacement. Eventually, Christopher and Daunton were arrested and convicted for treason. On May 23, 1982, during his time in the US jail, Christopher Boyce agreed to a single interview with Ray Martin of 60 Minutes Australia, because that was the case with the Australian connection that hit him deeply. In the Australian media, it caused a furore for about a week, then it was silenced. <br /> <br /> I liked the hawk's filmic, in which Chris Falcon and Daunton the Snowman (drug) was called connecting), but in reality the title "Falcon" was not used by Chris. <br /> <br /> Christopher Boyce: Criminal or Man of Conscience? You decide. <br /> <br /> Resources: http://www.playitforwardoz.com/boyce.html
