This was a great movie from 1981, which had a great story about three men and two girls taking a camping trip together and walking through dense forests and high mountains with a great waterfall. This group meets George Kennedy (Roy McLean), who plays the role of a Forest Ranger and rides a white horse. Roy McLean warns the young people that they have no place to camp and that they should turn back. Of course, these young people do not bother about it and let a ball swim naked beside the waterfall, play great music, dance by the fire and drink lots of beer and wine. There is an old wooden schoolhouse where the girls and boys are pulled in, and at that point the movie starts very scary. There is an opportunity for a young girl to climb a tree to get away from a human animal that desires its body and begins to cut the tree to catch it. Do not miss this movie, there is a lot of everything.
