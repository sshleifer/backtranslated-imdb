OK, this movie may not have won an Oscars, but it's not a bad movie. The original "D.O.A." is undoubtedly a better movie, but that does not mean that this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> The movie star Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he became truly famous for the first time after "The Right Stuff". made him a star and a very pretty-looking Meg Ryan, when she was still pretty famous now. <br /> <br /> This is more of an "update" of the movie from 1950 than a remake since the setting is different and also the characters are different. The plot is pretty much the same. A man (this time an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin) is poisoned and has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young student trying to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid's estranged wife in a modest but intense performance. She steals every scene she's in. Daniel Stern (also in an early role, before "Home Alone" made him famous) plays Quaid's colleague. Charlotte Rampling is also okay in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> The entire cast is first class; The movie is stylish, with a fast tempo that keeps you guessing right to the end. <br /> <br /> I think this is a movie that is certainly worth a thriller and a modern version of a classic movie.
