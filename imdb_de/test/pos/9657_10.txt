I saw this movie on the sci-fi channel for the first time, and I have to say, it was just great. For those of you who love "The Never Ending Story," this is one that would awaken memories of this movie. Although it is a film from 1996, it looks hazy and feels like a fantasy. The acting was brilliant and the music was great, especially the opening song and the end song. To those of you who have not seen it, WATCH IT! I highly recommend it!
