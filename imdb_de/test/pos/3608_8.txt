To tell the truth, I only saw this movie because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. People may disagree, but he does well in bad and good movies. I've never seen a movie with Penelope Crus, so I wanted to see if she was a good actress. So I think: <br /> <br /> The movie is good (but I did not read the novel). Some moments were really exciting and ... unexpected. All in all, you find the plot pretty simple. The only thing that could save the movie (which an experienced viewer would know from the beginning) either tragically or happily ended was the performance of Cage and Crus. And it was great, great, great !!! In the last part of the film I even liked a pretty broad accent of the actress (Spanish, but for those who do not speak Greek, that's OK, and she even looks like a Greek). Overall, the film is very enjoyable and has a lot of irony (fans of classical music will certainly have fun in a few moments.) <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10. You should see it!
