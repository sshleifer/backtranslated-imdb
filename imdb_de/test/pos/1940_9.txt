I glanced at another commentary in which the author discusses how the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend. One who is overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most troubling of all, no surprise is what the character (Layne) of crispin glover does. He is thrilled when one of his friends has murdered a friend, the killer. Not because Layne did not like this individual, but because he has something to do about it. This poor boy is bored in life and inwardly dead that a murdered friend is something to excite because he offers him something to focus on.
