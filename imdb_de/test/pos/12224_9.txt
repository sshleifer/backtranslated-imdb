I'm always excited about the US networks. What is wrong with you? Another very promising series has been shortened after just 15 episodes, and we do not know what the hell is going on with everyone. I really enjoyed this show and I'm so upset that we'll never find out what's going on with the characters and the "monsters" from the deep. This show had everything. Humor, excitement, action. What do you want more? Why oh why did the plug pull the plug? It just does not make sense. Buffy continued for 7 series, as did Charmed and as pleasant as they were. Surface, Invasion and Dead Like Me were even better. Just because a show does not get terribly high ratings does not mean it's rubbish, and if they last a little longer, probably more people would get involved and they would end up with a big hit on their hands. A season just does not give him enough time to get through, and the networks are too eager to pull the plug. They should learn that they need time to ripen as well as fine wines and cheeses. <br /> <br /> Return Surface and Invasion - P L E A S E !!!!!!!
