I remember going to an inn with my parents and sister. I was in fifth grade and a kid, and the ride came to a standstill 4 years later, but the movie remains in my memory. An adult movie that a child finds entertaining. This is a sign of excellence. Hoffman is one of Hollywood's better actors, and this movie proves it. I like Billy putting down the ice scene and I remember the SCTV version in my own movie. Remember Joe Flairty, who is crying. Please email me if you like the SCTV sketch. Not a bad movie at all, it's a story about a father and his son. Touching and entertaining, I love the part in which Hoffman talks about Killroy and how the streets are changing. A second clock worth 7/10
