I, a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this movie a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with a lot of great actors. It was entertaining and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his best-known character Ron Weasley. His subtle portrayal of Ben and his great acting made this movie very likeable. <br /> <br /> Ben, a very shy boy with an extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and will, I think, call Evie, a retired actress, an "assistant". First, it's just a way to earn some money. After a while, he and Evie seem to develop a friendship. Evie helps Ben break out of his shell a little bit, making him have fun and being happy with himself, and in the end, both seem to need each other. Whether you are a fan of Rupert Grint or not, this movie is a really entertaining movie with some very sweet and moments. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors.
