Toy Soldiers is an okay action movie, but what really stands out is the effort the scriptwriters and director have put into the accurate portrayal of American anti-terrorist forces. Just look at the credits - there are more than a dozen US military and officers. The film portrays the FBI as having taken control of the hostage situation, but ponders the United States Army Delta Force (which is unnamed in the film because the Pentagon still denies its existence at the time) after the President had given up the Posse Commitatus Act US Code. The US Army at the end is dressed and armed for the time exactly. And even using an AH-64 Apache for air support, which may seem a bit over the top, is not unrealistic. Much more expensive and honestly better films have presented the American counter-terrorist forces with far less accuracy.
