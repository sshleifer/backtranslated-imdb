Korean "romance" about the owner of a camera business diagnosing a deadly disease. As he goes about his daily routine and prepares for the end, he meets a young girl who is a client. A friendship and romance grows, though no love for the other expresses. Good movie is unlike anything you'll probably see again in America just because the studios insist the "couple" react to their feelings. He will say nothing because he does not have so long to live, she will not do it because it is not the thing that is being done, and he does not respond the way she thinks he should. Of course it's a lot more complex than I imagine and in all honesty it's the kind of things you should discover for yourself. Is it a great movie? No, but it's a good one that will move you emotionally. The last line of the film still haunts me: "I always knew that love would fade like a photo - but you will stay in my heart as you are in my last moment, thank you and goodbye." It may seem strange, but in the context of the film it is very moving.
