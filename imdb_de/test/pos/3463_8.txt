It is rare that I get the opportunity to read a movie for IMDb that is so closely related to my own life. As someone living with cerebral palsy (albeit less rigorously than Michael, one of the movie's main characters), I do not want to give this movie a "passport" just because it deals with a topic that is rarely addressed. and if it is, is usually treated with a straight face. There were minor problems with the film; and I want to talk about it first, so people will realize that it is not my situation that has tarnished my judgment on this overall excellent film! <br /> <br /> * Parts that I found inhumanly massive at the expense of realism. If I had a pound for every time a well-meaning citizen mentions the electric wheelchair that was resting for me, I would be the richer man. But personally, it fits into the public perception of how we handle our disadvantages rather than the reality of what actually happens. The same goes for looking at people with disabilities who go to the pub - it is not a big deal for those of us who actually do it, as much as it is admirable for outsiders looking in, Michael; But I still think he would focus more on enjoying the experience than thinking about what a big deal it was that he was there at all. As such, the time we spend to see them having fun felt like something too much. <br /> <br /> * I had the feeling that the endless nature of Rory's illness was being brought to our notice far too late; This means that it was only used as a cheap sentimental instrument to get between the two, and not anything that you knew had to be around all the time to deal with a lot of praise. Although I thought some scenes in which they deal with normal life are a bit over the top. The script also ventured into some tricky places that I did not expect, and has a lot of recognition for that. For example, raise the topic of love and relationships; and shows the daily apparatus that is often used to support the lives of people without disabilities. Despite the dull emotional shock tactics of death, the film as a whole is far less dissatisfied than anyone who has a right to expect this type of film. Brenda Fricker can and has for years apparently performed various variations of her role in the autopilot; However, Robertson and McAvoy share a special interaction that needs to be considered. Inside, I make cartwheels, where a group of people has finally made a film that lives up to the joie de vivre of many disabled people.
