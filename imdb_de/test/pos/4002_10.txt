Wow, what a wonderful filmmaking! Mr. Im did it again! <br /> <br /> His last work, ChunHayang (2000), was a great movie, but it's even bigger. The 66-year-old director, who was selected for the second time in a couple of years as an official feature film at the Canne Festival, is getting better at what he does with a Korean culture. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Chihwaseon is a great Korean painter, the ('Ohwon) JANG' Seung-Up 'who was considered a prodigy in the late 19th century. The basic story of this film tells the story of Jang, seung-up and the historical background of his time. He was an orphan, but in his youth he was picked up by a noble man called Kim, Byung-Moon. This Mr. Kim becomes mentor of Jang and lifelong friendship and continues to support his great talent, which he knew from the beginning. With Jiang's great effort and natural talent, his fame grows faster, the stronger the strength of his country, the weaker Korea becomes. Jiang's personality portrayed in the film is very complicated and one of the best actors in Korea, Choi, Min-sik, goes deep into Jiang's soul. Suffering eyes show the struggle of a great artist. He is sometimes very serious, but suddenly he turns into a wild maniac. He drinks like an alcoholic and sleeps with the courtesans at all times. Even, he said in the film, "I can not draw without alcohol and without a wife." (An alcohol and women are my only inspirations) "At the height of fame, he travels the country to develop his own style and never gives his Proud as an artist on authority or money. I do not want to go into every detail, but I think you've probably gotten some ideas about the movie. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing about this film is a cinematography. It is simply breathtaking how they have captured every beauty of landscapes. Yes, every scene is like a work of Yang's painting. And the script is perfect too. It mainly conveys a deeper meaning of what makes a true artist. For example, Kim Jang advises in the film: "Before you take a brush in your hand, you have to set a life goal." This is a very moving and inspiring line and there are many more. <br /> <br /> Walk this movie when you attend the Canne Festival. <br /> <br /> Chihwasun will be the biggest movie ever made, dealing with the life of a painter in film history.
