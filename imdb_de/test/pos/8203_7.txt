When "The Net" was advertised for the first time, it became ridiculous through advertising. When I saw it, it was actually quite good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spends her days on the computer and has never met her neighbors. Through a series of events, her identity is then wiped out by a cabal of shadow people, and she can not prove that she exists. You would probably know which parts if you had seen the movie. Still, it's a good look at what the internet's existence may have brought to unsuspecting people. I highly recommend it.
