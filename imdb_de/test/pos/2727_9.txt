Ms. Aparna Sen, the creator of Mr & Mrs Iyer, directs this film about a young girl's struggle to cope with her debilitating condition. Meethi (Konkona Sen) has been a distanced boy since childhood and has shown signs of deception, no one knows why. The dormant tendency, however, gets out of control as the job takes her to neighboring Bihar, where she is raped by some politicians. The resulting trauma leads not only to her schizophrenia but also to manic-depressive episodes. It gets out of control over the years, gets worse, and sinks deeper into its private "world." <br /> <br /> The juxtaposition of an "insecure" (divorced) older sister and how her domineering manner already makes one worse situation is worse and points out what a fine line between abnormal and * seemingly normal * consists. Ms. Sen also comments on the social alienation of such persons. Social rehabilitation is standard therapy along with all the deadly mental changes. But what about the poor and the needy, who always take care of themselves and usually fall by the wayside? <br /> <br /> The romantic connection between Dr. Ing. Kunal and Anu were unnecessary. Also the cafeteria scene, where dr. Kunal Anu explains how real her world is for her, was superfluous. Anu should already know all this. The English dialogue is sometimes a bit awkward, although the actor compensates for that. Konkona and Shabana prove that their reputation is well worth it. Waheeda, Rahul and Shefali play their limited roles very well. <br /> <br /> It appears that extensive research has been done on this disease, which is very obvious. However, it is not clear whether MDP can co-exist with schizophrenia in the same patient. Also in the first phase Dr. Kunal the ECT (Shock Therapy) while overriding the fact that schizophrenics do not, but only for extreme MDP with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder The end of the remarkable story suggests an unknown solution (perhaps no solution ). The film could have ended more beautifully, because mentally ill people can live well balanced, if not very fulfilling, with good medical care. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is an excellent movie made with extreme sensitivity to the subject. Hats to Mrs. Sen! Nobody in India could have done better.
