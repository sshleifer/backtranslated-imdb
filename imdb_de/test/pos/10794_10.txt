"Talk Radio" is my favorite movie by Oliver Stone, though he has made many great films including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of Talk Radio, a cinematic extension of Eric Bogosian's scorching drama based on a real-world review of a Dallas talk show. In collaboration with Robert Richardson, the Ace cameraman, Stone transforms an exercise from a very stuck exercise into a visually exciting ideological battle in which a radio station is presented as a theater of war. Bogosian is devastating as a tortured on-air transmitter of ill-treatment Barry Champlain and communicates with conviction and a generous dose of self-hatred the contradictory nature of his character. Alec Baldwin, as his alpha boss, makes the perfect note as a man maddened by a man whose monstrosity he helped. Ellen Greene is fantastic as Barry's sweet ex-wife, who becomes another target of his vicious personal vitols. Stone and Bogosian fill every picture with interest and every line of dialogue with sweet poison and ambiguous ambiguity. John C. McGinley, as Barry's longtime screener / technical producer Stu, shows a witty, sharp performance, as does the great Michael Wincott. The film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of great writing, great acting and brutal, uncompromising focus. The Stewart Copeland score is also brilliant.
