I rented this movie because it was a documentary and was rated highly. It's more of a study of a bastard son trying to figure out who his father was, rather than architecture. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the movie is, above all, that we are eccentric praised, possibly a brilliant architect who had little regard for anything or someone outside is a profession. The tragedy of the film is the broken families he left. His baby mothers were more despised fans than irresponsible women, which can only have negative effects on the children. That said, Nathaniel, the film's producer and son of Louis Khan, came across as fairly stable and curious, if not bitter. Of course, the people he interviewed were more interested in Louis Khan's buildings than in his personal problems, but the mix of topics made the film interesting. <br /> <br /> As for his buildings, I found them abstract art - strange, impractical and mostly appreciated only by so-called critics.
