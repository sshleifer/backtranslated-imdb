Debbie Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capelja) want to become one of the cool girls in their high school. Uncool and ugly girls had two choices, be it a mole or a beating! Debbie and Sue imitate them by applying their scams in an exam. Two of the cool guys, Garry (Goeff Rhoe) and Danny (Tony Hughes), ask for their answers and they're all broken down. After a roar from the Headmaster (Bud Tingwell), the cool girls meet them outside in the playground and confront them with whether they have all "flogged". Because Debbie and Sue had not invited the cool girls to smoke to the "Dunnies". At the weekend they hang out with them on the beach and watch the boy surfing. Sue goes out with Danny and Debbie with Garry. A lot of ordinary teen action takes place, including sex, drugs and rock and roll. Garry has a possible overdose of heroin, which makes Debbie face the inequalities of life, and she decides to learn to surf instead of just watching the boys. They are not happy, but take care of them, call names, and finally Debbie rules the board. A cool Aussie movie from the early 80s.
