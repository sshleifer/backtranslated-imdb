One of his lesser-known films, many horror fans have not yet seen this offer by Dario Argento, which is unfortunate. It is mostly underestimated because really not enough people have seen it. The film has the grade A-Argento-Gore, with his usual close-ups on wild rock scores are set. While it is true that this script is not very complex, it is not nearly as bad as other entries in its genre or personal CV. <br /> <br /> This movie symbolizes more of the "fear". that he likes to portray in his films according to his own admission. It is worth to see well every night.
