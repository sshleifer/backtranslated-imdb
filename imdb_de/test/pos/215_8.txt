A criminally short-lived show that spawned three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3). This is a fast-paced, fire-comedy on your face that has more hits than misses. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent detective who rushes around with his boss's capable assistant, Captain Ed Hocken, fiddling with the cases. <br /> <br /> The storylines are at best fake, but it's intentional, because the good is not in the narrative, but in weaving a joke of jokes and some really weird and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> The jokes themselves come in many forms, be it wordplay, slapstick, word games or background gag. Most of them get to the point, though some fall flat. With this "gag every few seconds" it's inevitable that some fail, but the relationship is good. <br /> <br /> The characters are a pleasure. From the guest star of the week who died in the first seconds of each episode, the lab scientist who performs cruel and unusual experiments on children, to the shoeshine who embodies a form of oracle, the scripture is witty and sharp cutlass <br /> < Although not very successful at the time, it quickly became a cult that owed many of the show's relative lack of success to being far ahead of its time and too demanding for the target audience, especially among them none other than Matt 'The Simpsons' Groening: and he should know. <br /> <br /> Dated by today's standards, if you can see through this aspect, expect something good.
