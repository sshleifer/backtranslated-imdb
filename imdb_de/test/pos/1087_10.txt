Satya was excellent. The company was just as good, but polished, probably because of the money earned from previous films. But Tak Chappan is even more entertaining. The dialogue is hard, rough and sometimes funny. Nana Pataker once again shines in a role that only he can fulfill with authority, but the supporting members are very talented. The direction is tight and the story develops at a satisfying pace with a very dramatic climax. As a representation of reality, it may be over-dramatized, but at the end of the day it's a movie, so the balance is perfect. I ordered my DVD and can not wait to see her at home. As a lover of this kind of gangster movie, this is very satisfying and highly recommended for the refreshingly "non-Yash Raj" Bollywood gangster lovers.
