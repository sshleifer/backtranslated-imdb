Peter Coyote was the only name I knew from the cast list, so I did not really want to see this movie. The only comment on IMDb was positive, so I saw it in front of the TV late in the evening. I would recommend this movie as a good late night movie. It's better than a lot of this genre. The plot is excellent, the acting is not brilliant, but it is not bad. I do not usually like flashbacks, but they work in this movie. Like I said, I did not identify any of the performers by name, but Michele Lee, who did a decent, hard job, was the woman who wanted to stand by her husband, who lies to her. (Was it knots landing?) Anyway, she wears really well. Note: You can enjoy it more if you miss the first seconds of the credits. I did and it helped me. When you see the credits, you get what I mean. The really weird Wayne Kennedy character puts it on a 7 instead of a 6.
