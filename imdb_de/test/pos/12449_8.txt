This is one of the most beautiful teen movies I have ever seen (and I wish he would be released as a video). It was released in the same year as another big comedy, in which Tim Matheson played the role of "Animal House" (which was probably the reason it was overlooked). <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable parts of this movie would definitely be the soundtrack that could and should have had a formal label release. The soundtrack includes a lesser-known 70's act called High Inergy, whose song "We Are The Future" played a marquee role in the film's prom scene. I remember when I was a kid, I bought the group's "Steppin 'Out" album, mainly because of the girls' looks and not necessarily because of their musical talent. <br /> <br /> The final song is one of the best ballads I've ever heard, and I can still hear it in my head. I wish I knew the name of the group so I could search it somewhere in cyberspace. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like "Over the Edge" and "Rich Kids", I think you'll enjoy it too.
