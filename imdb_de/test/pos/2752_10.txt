I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dance, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne, let me inspire with their exquisite dance! May they keep shining and dancing. Their chemistry on stage was amazing and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance together! This show is my absolute favorite and will probably always be. Long live Riverdance!
