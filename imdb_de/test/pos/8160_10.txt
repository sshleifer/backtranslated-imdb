In 1982, a small film titled MAKING LOVE shocked the audience with its sincere and open portrayal of a romantic love story that happened to be two men of romance between two men; LATTER DAYS is all that and much more. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's soapy, melodramatic, clich√©d and pretty trite. That's what makes it so wonderful. There is nothing better than a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word. <br /> <br /> As for religion, sorry people, but these things happen and are happening to gay people now. Not only the Mormon Church rejects its gay members. Homosexual people in all religions have experienced harsh judgment and rejection. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It has a perfect blend of a fantasy romance that is based on the reality of everyday life of the characters. If I had more than ten stars, I would do that. Good love stories never go out of fashion; great love stories like LATTER DAYS are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's time!
