Francis Ouimet (Shia Lebouf) is his life before him at the age of 20 - in a way. As the son of an immigrant family living in the United States from the late 19th to the early 20th centuries, teaching was a very limiting fact of life. If you are born poor you remain poor; If you are born into the bourgeoisie, you have a tiny opportunity; When you are born into the wealthy class, they have essentially done it in the shade. British Gold Master Harry Vardon and Francis' Golf Idol (played by the criminally undervalued Stephen Dillane) is the exception proving the rule. Born and raised in a poor British family, his golfing enabled him to rise from the filthy mess of the poorest slums to the lush greens of English country clubs. He did not forget that hour of his life. Francis wants to follow in the footsteps of Vardon and uses his great skills in golf to participate in the 1913 US Open at the age of 20. But with a tough line and formidable opponents (including Francis' idol Harry Vardon), Francis is not all he has to deal with. A little understanding father and cruel social conditions are in his way of living his own dream. I know what you think - I thought so too - a 1913 Walt Disney-produced film about the US Open with the irritated Shia LaBeouf has the opportunity to be entertaining, but it can not possibly be a great movie. Well, I'm here to make you think. Despite all aspects on paper, The Greatest Game Ever Played is one of creation's finest sports movies. <br /> <br /> As with any major sports movie, The Greatest Game Ever Played contains many exciting sports scenes. It's not a movie about golf *, but a character movie about using one's talents. to follow his dreams and overcome class barriers. Where The Greatest Game Ever Played works well as a themed sports movie, it works just as well as a historical movie - the costumes and sets of the movie are the best thing about the actual time travel. The movie * looks * great and the almost unknown composer Brian Tyler has made the film a wonderful piece of music. The cast is awesome with a subtle but powerful Stephen Dillane as British Golf Champion Harry Vardon, a witty Stephen Marcus as Mannesmann golfer Ted Ray, a pounding Josh Flitter as Francis' ready-made caddy Eddie and a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf in the lead role as Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) becomes director for the second time (directing a full-length feature film) in The Greatest Game Ever Played. He produces a fine product - with a lot of heart, ingenuity and attention to detail in the production of the film.
