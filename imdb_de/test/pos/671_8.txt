Watch out, My Lovely recently came on BBC2 early this morning on TV, so I set the video to record and was pleased I did. <br /> <br /> A man finds a dead woman so he escapes, so do not get blamed for her murder and get a job as a craftsman with a widow, but she does not know what she's taking up here. It turns out that this man is a psychopath and a possible killer. He begins to torture her and locks her in the basement. Then he interrupts the telephone line, so that she gets no help from the outside. A boy who buys regularly for them, notices that something is wrong if he wants to send them. Finally, the man leaves and acts as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> I can see why "Beware, My Lovely" received an X-certificate when it was released in cinemas. Some scenes are pretty uncomfortable for that time. I also thought that the man would do something to the boy as well. <br /> <br /> The cast offers an outstanding performance of Robert Ryan as a psychopath, Ida Lupino as a widow, and Barbara Whiting and Dee Pollock as a boy. <br /> <br /> This is certainly Robert Chilly's worst performance I've ever seen. A must. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
