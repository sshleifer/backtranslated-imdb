I saw this movie on TV yesterday. I was curious that Emilio Estevez was directing and starring him and his real dad Martin Sheen. I love seeing a movie about a father-son relationship that is a real father and son. Of course, there is an immediate chemistry between Sheen and Estevez, and their conflict scenes are even more intense as they know they are actually connected. Of course it helps that the two are great actors. I've seen Martin Sheen in intense roles before, but I think that's Emilio's most intense role - I mainly remember him from the "Mighty Ducks" series and was very impressed. Talent really runs in this family. And Kathy Bates steals the film in an Oscar-worthy performance. With every word of dialogue she moved to my heart. Kimberly Williams - the beautiful actress from the "Father of the Bride" movies - is also very good as she asserts herself among a group of talented veteran actors. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit gradual, the dialogue is obviously geared towards the stage, but that did not bother me. This is not an action movie; This is a character study. And for a film based on one piece, it never gets too claustrophobic. When Emilio's character reminds Jeremy of his days in Vietnam, we actually see his shattering memories come to life. <br /> <br /> The film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental. In the end, I expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family to become a hunky dory, but it was not. The end made me cry, without resorting to the normal Hollywood melodrama. This proves that reality is much more enthralling than anything Hollywood can summon. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a beautiful, powerful drama with wonderful performances that will tear your socks off, check out this undervalued gemstone. Hopefully, Martin and Emilio will one day unite with Charlie and they'll all make a great movie together. <br /> <br /> My score: 9 (out of 10)
