I saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it, but even more shocked by the comments I read here. One person wrote that it was not clear whether the victim was guilty of torture or not - hence ... One person wrote because he was not an American citizen, so ... Some people say the people in the Middle East hate us and therefore wants us dead ... So then we say that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who is not an American citizen? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who hates us and wants to kill us? Say, the Declaration of Human Rights and the Constitution of the United States, as written down in the Geneva Convention, "torture is wrong, but some torture is less wrong than others?" When will it be "right" to torture? That's why this movie is so powerful - it's ambiguous, but not because of torture. Torture is always wrong and when we are ready, even in the name of justice and "national security" or "freedom and democracy", we are wrong and we are evil. We do exactly what we accuse our enemies of (and we call them "wrong" in the same breath). My favorite line in the movie was "If you do not want to compromise, join Amnesty International." Right on.
