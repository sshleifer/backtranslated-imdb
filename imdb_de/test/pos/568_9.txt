I've just watched the movie through Netflix. I was intrigued by the way the movie was described, but in the end it was better. I was moved in many different directions when I saw this movie. I was filled with pain, hatred, anger, bitterness, pain and finally relief. To look at the young defendant would break your heart and convince you that he had the wrong person. The complacency of the police makes you waver, because just when Rodney King Beating brought the brutality of the police to light, this film brings the complete lack of moral background in these police. And the fact that they beat that boy and get away with it makes you even more angry. <br /> <br /> But I have to tell you, I fell in love with lawyer Mc Guinness. One of my favorite lines when he told us what a hole the cops had ... The policeman told him to keep sucking on that crab stick. Mc Guinness said to the policeman, "I always have a cigarette before sex ..." I let him know that I was going to screw him up. "<br /> <br /> I have new respect for some laws in this country.
