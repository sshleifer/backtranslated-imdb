Can you capture the moment? When do you first hear rain on a roof? Some things are beyond the sum of their parts and express the poetry of life. The things that matter. <br /> <br /> The poet Dylan Thomas has captured the seemingly unspeakable. "A good poem helps to enhance each individual's knowledge of themselves and their environment. (Bob Dylan has named himself after him.) Why did it take so long to make a movie with the great Dylan Thomas? A simple biopic The writer Sharman Macdonald has chosen a different, better approach. <br /> <br /> In The Edge of Love, she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them The life of four friends: Dylan, who loves greedily and to the fullest, wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller), his lively support, war hero William (Cillian Murphy), who saves him from a street brawl, and then there is his childhood sweetheart. Vera, love Vera, take your breath away Vera, she's Caitlin's closest friend, Williams's wife, and like a muse of the "star" in Dylan's dark skies. <br /> <br /> It all starts in the 1940s London Blitz with Bom accommodation in the metro. Enter Vera (an impressive Keira Knightley) under makeshift stage lights. She meets Dylan for the first time in years, her heart is red. Her eyes shine through the smoke of the room. The purity of her former passion. Dylan (Welsh native speaker, Matthew Rhys) is not a sacred, sanitary poet. Master of his vices, he must fully experience all. He introduces his beloved wife and continues to woo Vera. <br /> <br /> The Edge of Love is a visual treat. The soundtrack makes you want more. The achievements of these actors may be the best in their careers. It's pretty good as a lush love story. As a glimpse into Dylan Thomas and the reality of poetry throughout our lives, not bad at all. And as a tribute to a great man, inspiring. <br /> <br /> Production strived to project the mind of Dylan Thomas without compromising historical accuracy. Dramatic tension involves a move between artistic freedom and conventional morality. Spectators looking for an experience based on the latter can be disappointed. And it will do the audience whose boundaries are those of Albert Square less well. Sharman Macdonald seemed to be aware of the stubborn nature of artistic freedom and its limitations when talking to producer Rebekah Gilbertson (granddaughter of the Real) William and Vera). "Remember all the things I do not want to write about," she said, "because I have carte blanche." For Macdonald, the limits were to insult Dylan's memory. But for many artists, especially men, the boundaries are those that women and families could put into them. A woman will not allow lofty ideals to interfere with the problems of common sense, and even put her children's interests before their own. (This happens occasionally in the opposite direction, as Virginia Woolf refused to defend himself from Leonard Woolf Earth - in the hours). <br /> <br /> Despite the tension between Caitlin and Vera, these two women become closest friends. It's one of the most important (and beautiful) themes in the movie. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film tell a story in itself. In a dreary, war-torn Britain, Caitlin and Vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of gray. Shortly after we meet Vera's illuminated stage character, we meet Caitlin through her searing blue eyes, sparkling in a dark railroad car. Her dramatic red cloak roams the streets of colorless homogeneity and triumphs on a beautiful staircase as she finds herself with Dylan. But Vera's red lip brightness is less permanent. For her, marriage is the second best, even if she is obsessed with genuine love for her husband. <br /> <br /> Outstanding cinematography involves the use of montages to juxtapose images, much like the interplay of unrelated words adds meaning. Terrible war scenes in Thessaly are associated with Vera screams during pregnancy. Birth or abortion? We will not be informed immediately. Pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to the present. <br /> <br /> Constant echoes of Dylan's poetry in film take us beyond earthly opposites. It reminds me that Marlon Brando reads TS Eliot in Apocalypse Now. A light beyond the horrors of the world. A different view. "I'll take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no one died?" Dylan tells Vera as they walk along the beach. Elsewhere, Caitlin remembers childhood with Vera: "We're still innocent in Dylan," she says. <br/> <br/> It's time to leave your underpants at home or share a universal cigarette. (Not literally, maybe.) A time to be inspired. Enjoy the possibly best British movie of the year.
