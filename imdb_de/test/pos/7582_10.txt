I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw your audience into the character. Horses on Mars do this and much more. If you see a good movie, you do not want it to end. That's how I felt watching this movie. It is visually expansive and the microbe assumes such human qualities that you feel as if you are traveling with it on the journey. <br /> <br /> Really looking forward to exciting adventures Mr. Anderson will embark on in the future. Well done.
