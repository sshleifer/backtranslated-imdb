IMAGINARY HEROES is a nice little movie! Written and directed by Dan Harris, this is a classic theater that combines comedy and tragedy so closely that the climax of the movie takes your breath away. <br /> <br /> The Travis family is a weird bunch: no member is who everyone seems to be. Beginning with a suicide committed by recalcitrant "heroine swimming champion Matt" (Kip Pardue), father Ben (Jeff Daniels) falls apart and isolates himself from his family and himself while mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) turns into Pot and Rage sarcasm her daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) returns from school repelled by her family's behavior, and her remaining son Tim (Emile Hirsch) takes the brunt of all this by serving his classmate, his girlfriend, and his neighbor Kyle (Ryan) Donowho gets out of the way) to jump into drugs and sexual experiments. Throughout the movie, Tim tries to hide bruises on his body that have a secret in them, but make his girlfriend feel rejection. His mother rages against the trailer park trashcan she believes to be the cause, and finally opens the window into the deep scars this family has suffered for years. Secrets and lies here and their dissolution is painfully dramatic. <br /> <br /> This may be the best role of Sigourney Weaver, though Emile Hirsh, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donowho and Kip Pardue (despite its small size role) all contribute to peak performances. The story begins slowly and seems to meander, and this fact may lose the attention of some viewers, but stick to this little powerhouse movie and the effect of the work will stun you. Highly recommended. Grady harp
