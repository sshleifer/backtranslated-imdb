I've just seen the movie in its entirety for the first time (although I saw some of it when it was first shown in Britain in the mid-1990s). I really believe that he is a masterpiece of late twentieth-century cinema. Undoubtedly, a film of this size raises many questions. Why is there in this film between the 60s Hermann in "home" and Hermann some differences? For example, in the first film, Hermann has a fairly meaningful relationship with his stepfather (he finances Hermann's electronic music), while in "The Second ..." his father is barely mentioned until the last episode. <br /> Another point interests me; I read Edgar Reitz. I am surprised by the historical similarities between him and the Stefan character. (Spoiler Comes) In the last episode, it became known that Stefan won a prize at the Venice Film Festival (Reitz received a prize for best debut work there for his movie "Meals"); Reitz 'film company is called "Edgar Reitz Filmproduktion", and Stefan's is also called eponymous. I am interested in the fact that Stefan is an autobiographical figure, because apart from Helga he is probably the least sympathetic friend of the friends. <br /> <br /> Maybe Stefan is a red herring, I do not know what I know is that I loved this movie and I wish more was done except Michael Hanke's "Cache" and Werner Herzog's "Grizzly There is not enough ambition, audacity and passion of this kind in modern cinema. I can not wait to see number 3.
