If you love the book as much as I do, stop watching the video after Jean and Joe meet in Australia. Up to this point, it's a pretty faithful rendition of the book and the look is great. 10 out of 10 at this time and I have enjoyed it many times. After that, the story is seriously redesigned and reworked in a way that truly destroys the key part of the book, d. H. How Jean creates a city like Alice (Springs). In the initial phase, the most important change is making Strachan a 40-year-old bachelor, rather than a seventy-year-old widower. This distorts this love story, especially when there are small changes that help make him more selfish and stingy, such as: In the book, he tells Joe on the ship that he may expect more than a letter from him is waiting for Australia, but in the video he gives Joe no indication of the whereabouts or intentions of Jean. The last hour of the 5-hour video is the last third of the book. I see no reason why they threw themselves into a fight between Joe and Jean - it's quite uncharacteristic and seems to be just an Aussie search on Pommies because they told them what to do. Then they bring Strachan to the wedding (instead of three years later) - and let him read the toast !! - very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between Jean and Noel, as shown in the video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of screenwriters. These abominations took time in the last hour, which was not long enough to live up to the fascinating story of how Jean Willstown becomes a place where she and Joe can both be happy.
