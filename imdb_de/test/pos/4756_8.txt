A team of die-hard New York cops led by tough, hardened buddy Manucci (excellently played by the ever-prolific Roy Scheider) follows a group of vicious gangsters involved in a kidnapping ring after one of their members was killed by them. Producer of "Bullet" and "The French Connection", director Philip D'Antoni creates a powerful, pithy, totally amoral no-nonsense tone, performs a steady tempo, and stages the action scenes with considerable force. Don Ellis' rousing string score further enhances the intensity of the raw 'n' attraction, while the run-down Big Apple locations and rough, grainy cinematography of Urs Furrer greatly enhance the gross realism overall. In addition, the fine line that distinguishes police officers from criminals is blurred confusingly in this image: the titular force uses sharp, brutal and morally dubious strong-arm tactics as a means to enforce the law, and there is none among the thugs Code of honor and thieves who populate the shabby urban abdomen that is vividly portrayed in this film. Nice supportive performances by Tony Lo Bianco as a worm, snooping snitch Vito Lucia, Undertaker, Richard Lynch as a vicious, psychotic Hoodlum Moon, Bill Hickman as Moons equally cold-blooded partner Bo, Jerry Leon as a funky flatfoot Mingo and Joe Spinell as a caretaker. An extremely wild and exciting, lengthy, mundo-destructo chase in the heart of the neck is a definite highlight. The climatic shooting also supplies the mix. A real little winner.
