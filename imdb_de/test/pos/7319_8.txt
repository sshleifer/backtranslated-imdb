Although I'm not a big fan, I'm a three-stooges purist. I think her best work was by far the third assistant of Curly and her first films are generally her best. Because after a while they started to make their films new, and the gags became obsolete. Here, in 1934, they were still pretty fresh (in more ways than one) and funny. <br /> <br /> Here the boys play very unlikely roles - respected doctors in a hospital! The three are running amok who behave silly, beating each other and putting off the pants of anyone who expects things to get better. The uninterrupted energy and freshness make this film a must for fans. By the way, although I liked this movie, I urge you to try to find a much less known short film pictures. NIFTY NURSES resembles MEN IN BLACK, but manages to be funnier and is about the best hospital comedy of the era - even better than Laurel & Hardy's COUNTY HOSPITAL.
