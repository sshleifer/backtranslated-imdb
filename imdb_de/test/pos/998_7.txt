With her ww2 timing, falling in love with and out of love and the eye Kira, this is a revival. <br /> <br /> This is a relationship story with focused main characters working out the balance between first and quick love in the home front of World War II. The poet Dylan Thomas makes his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky lightning London and later in windy Wales. <br /> <br /> Veras Ex and Next ignite each other while the poet and the soldier become secondary, while the girls band together and share. A simple timepiece that works well in the time when it is just a few steps away. Works well with French subtitles, but I've been to many Art House movies lately.
