Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this movie / musical. The opening song from Ms. Andrews, "Whistling Away the Dark," will always be in the back streets of my mind. The plot of the First World War is great and exciting. If you are a romantic, you will love this movie. This is a movie that I like to see again and again.
