If you have not heard of this film, it follows two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa to America, where they convince themselves that they will find success and fortune. Life is more difficult than expected in the States, and this film captures the frustration you feel when things are not going well. Life is so well captured that many moments appear as a script because they are so perfect. Whether at work, at school or in between, the two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with the filmmakers and make some very thoughtful comments about life in the States. It is one of the few documentaries that I can remember. I wanted it to last another two hours at the end. It might be difficult to find this movie because it was not well distributed. However, check your local "art house" or your independent theater, and definitely try it here, it is well worth the rent. Rating: 28/40
