You can not really call Roy Andersson productive (6 movies in 37 years). You can not blame him for being conventional. he is not "straightforward", at least when it comes to narrative. "You, the Living," his first movie in seven years, is like a surreal documentary that sees a large number of characters doing nothing, and if that sounds disgusting, I can assure you that's not the case , This is a funny, approachable and surprisingly warm-hearted film, a slice of life far from what we normally see on screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, 'Slice of Life' is hardly a real artist suitable for this film, as most people's lives are unlikely to be. The on-screen incidents range from the most frighteningly ordinary to the most insane, and as characters rush past, sometimes never seen again, while others appear again as feared, Andersson gives them a kind of benign affection. That and some crazy music make the time we spend with them a good time.
