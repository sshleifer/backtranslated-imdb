Too bad that someone did not have the art to publish this movie in theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on the cable. After the first shock of realizing that this movie is not like any other movie since "Bringing Up Baby", you have to keep it up and running it. Only when it is over, you realize that it deals with problems that are not only subtle, but also significant. Alienation, rejection, wish fulfillment for the beginning. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she has never been better. The entire cast has the feeling of action and knows what they're doing without going into unnecessary hamming except where needed, like Julie Andrews' bits or Jonathan Pryce's stock videos. If you are not open-minded, you will not understand. (See Mark Adnum's bizarre review, which he dedicates to the love of Stephanie Beacham, her career, and her brother's OBE for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives.) If I take that as a cue, I might as well be Amo Gulinello's stellar cameo inspire as a TV station or Jack Noseworthy's shower scene. So, throw aside all previous concepts of the movie comedy and have a good time. I loved it.
