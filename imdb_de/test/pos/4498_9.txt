one of the best and most inspiring films about a different culture that I've seen in years. tragic and touching. worth the clock. maybe a few times. We all know how brutal children can be. I know my own and my brothers as children and this film has hit the nail on the head. Perfect! The kite run is incredible and I need to explore the validity of this event. Although it is done in CGI, it is still amazing and very interesting. Maneuvering a kite with a single string seems impossible, but makes it believable. Anyway, this movie has a lot of twists that, I'm sure, are many easy to understand, but they beat me before I could. that makes a great movie for me! If you find out the whole movie in the first 10 minutes, it somehow gets ruined. But it does so smoothly that it's hard to guess, even if it happens ... I'm a guy and I do not mind saying that the tears flowed into more than one spot in this movie.
