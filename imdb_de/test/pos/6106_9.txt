Margaret Colin plays the main character in this story. When I saw it, I remembered her role in Adrian Lyne's "Ãœnfaithful" as Diane Lane's neighbor in a Texas suburb of NY. <br /> <br /> This movie was surprisingly good and Diane Stillman deserves an accurate account of class, crime and offense that actually occurs in upscale neighborhoods (spoiling the thought !!!). It's real, but not overly dramatized. the audience lives by their accident, the pain it caused; and the ultimate decision. <br /> <br /> It's more than just a question of "what's a good person" since Colin talks to her husband .... is the character of a person defined by a single act; and should they be condemned for their actions forever? The questions are relevant. It is also amusing to see several cinematic references to Martha Stewart: Colin is sometimes referred to by her friends as a "perfect hostess with perfect genes." (Gag); and a scene in which Colin is confronted by the police (the "friends" will reveal them later) ... <br /> <br /> The denial and facades of American society are addressed; (Oh, murder does not take place here; it's similar to the theme "A Season in Purgatory" by Dominick Dunne about the true murder of Martha Moxley, in Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of her crime; conscious, however, of perpetuating the facade until it finally collapses, renting or buying this film; She is an undervalued actress who does quite well in these roles.
