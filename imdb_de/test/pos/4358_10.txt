This movie is one of the most amazing examples of captivating and artful films I've ever seen. Duke seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieter's story as well as his lovable personal character. At the end of the film, I wished I could have met Dieter before he died. <br /> <br /> Technically, the camera is intimate and amazingly beautiful. The narrative is intricately woven, with a great awareness of the subject and its ability to re-live and re-enact traumatic events. Few documentary directors are so capable of investing the audience so thoroughly in the character. This movie is a must !!!
