BBC's 3 Hour Adaptation of the Sarah Waters Novel ... "Fingersmith". Life is hard without money, especially in Dickensian London. Dark deeds lead to despicable dilemmas. Is love really just a luxury for the rich and the outdoors? Elaine Cassidy as "Maud Lilly" and Sally Hawkins as "Sue Trinder" both perform fantastically well as the leading ladies asking this question ... from each other ... while Rupert Evans shines as the gloriously bad "gentleman" Imelda Staunton's "Mrs. Sucksby," David Troughton's "Mr. Ibbs" and Charles Dance's "Uncle." The plot turns and turns, and I was not sure if I could take care of characters who could hurt and use themselves this way ... but somehow ... I'm interested ... and that's because of the Quality of performances ... Love feels like love ... Hate feels like hate ... betrayal .. confusion .. well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you get the DVD and enjoy it. (Elaine Cassidy is just great at this .. great in fact .... I have to explain that I'm in her fan club ... hello Elaine :)
