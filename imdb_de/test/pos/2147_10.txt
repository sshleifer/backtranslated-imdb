I saw Heaven's Gate almost twenty years ago in its opening week. The tickets were sold in advance, as Cimino has long been in the succession of his 1978 masterpiece "The Deerhunter". Critics came and critics destroyed the movie vehemently. An influential New York film critic went ahead and most critics followed the example and 3-hour time. 40 min. Movie was pulled out of the distribution. United Artists let Cimino shorten the movie by about an hour, and he was re-released many months later for equally dreadful reviews and gritty business. At that time, the film cost about 40 million US dollars (considered today as a low budget), making it one of the most expensive in history. Cimino had the project with endless repetitions, although it was only his third movie. "The Deerhunter" had also received a negative backlash, based on a perceived political ideology that was not popular. I mention all this to represent a possible prejudice against Cimino. I found the movie very good back then, and when I saw the shorter version, it was still very good, just less. The film was shown again in a museum in the early 1990s. They should show the long version, but they could not find any existing print. Still, after watching the movie years later, I thought Heaven's Gate was a masterpiece. Finally, the long version appeared in some selected cities. I saw her recently and it was worth it to wait. Heaven's Gate begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we have some flaws in their characters early on. Despite the mandate given to Joseph Cotton in his graduate class speech to use their education to educate and improve their country, many of the graduates behave as if they were part of an elite country club. The film flashes 20 years before Johnson County in Wyoming. A livestock company called the Shareholders' Association has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiming to be cattle stealers. Kristofferson is on the side of the immigrants, John Hurt is a member of the association. Although Hurt is absolutely against this insane action, he is too ineffective to do anything about it. A massacre is taking place, but the immigrants defend themselves well. A United States Cavalry rescues the union to allegedly arrest them after causing the greatest damage when they actually approved the mass murder. Kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends years later as part of the elite class of his Harvard days, married, bored, on a yacht, but lived inside dead. <br /> <br /> This is a very complex one Film that is brilliant in every department, such as themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, stage design and acting. Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston and Cotton are excellent characters. Some of the main complaints I've read about this film are too ugly, too incoherent and too long that the characters make no sense and the words are often incomprehensible. In his defense, Heaven's Gate has the impression of photographs from this period, just like "McCabe & Mrs. Miller". Some of the scenes are smoky, suggesting the industrial revolution or sometimes horses, wagons, people passing by from all sides and creating a sense of reality.) But despite everything, the compositions of the individual images and the cinematography are impeccable. The movie makes sense if you pay attention. Not everything is clearly defined for the viewer, and one has to watch closely to understand the motivations of the characters or their subjects. In terms of length, it is a beautifully structured piece that is sometimes moving, poetic, exciting or devastating, with practically one big scene following the other. Sometimes some of the words are incomprehensible, especially in some of the lively scenes. However, one can understand such a film as a film by using the film language, the glances between the characters or their actions. One day, this full-length movie was to be re-released for people and critics to give it a second chance. Do not let Michael Cimino become another Orson Welles who was treasured during his lifetime and is unable to make the great films he can produce.
