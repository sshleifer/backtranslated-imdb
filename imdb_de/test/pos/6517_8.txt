This film was about a young woman who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they have difficulties in life. I had to think of other films like the "Song of Bernadette" and "Francis of Assisi" and have a very strong Catholic faith in the film. Ann Blyth is very charming, first as a Catholic student and later as a young woman who buys a statue of Saint Anne (which, incidentally, is the name of the street I live on) and many prayers for intercessors when in her life Problems arise. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith Show) and Edmund Gwenn (from Miracle in 34th Street) play relatives of her. A local priest of mine used to say that my sister Ann Blyth resembled and both names had the same given names and given names. A nice, good family movie that came from a time when life was a bit easier.
