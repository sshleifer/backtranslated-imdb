I have to admit that I liked this movie much more than I expected. Will Smith has that pure charm that you can not help but like. The plot was a small change from the basic stuff of the romantic comedy, which reminds a bit of Jane Austen's "Emma". This guy Kevin James has a real sense of weird timing and physical comedy. I've never seen his TV show, but he was very well cast in this movie. Amber Valletta was good enough. I can not remember why she was a big celebrity in this movie, but if she was an actress or model, the casting might have left something to be desired. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery and wish she had had a bigger role. Eva Mendes stole the show more or less. Her beauty and charm and just the right amount of originality always made me stick to the screen when she was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This movie is definitely worth a look.
