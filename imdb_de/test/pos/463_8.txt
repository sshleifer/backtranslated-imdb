I just watched this movie at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, AL, which was a really fun festival and was overpowered by it. It was the best movie I have seen all day. A prostitute at school meets a middle-aged man trying to end deep depression together. It's an insight into the darkest parts of human sexuality. The story comes from real life, torn right out of the headlines. Raw, dull dialogue window and a killer twist at the end. The film contains graphic sexual dialogues and nudity. Definitely not suitable for children. For some people too depressing. Definitely worth a visit, in my opinion.
