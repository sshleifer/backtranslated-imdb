In England, we often feel very connected to British films that we like, as we get used to the usual American settings and accents. I'm from London, where Virtual Sexuality is based, and felt strongly connected to it. The characters in Virtual Sexuality, especially the women, are exactly what British teens look like. I felt like I was almost in the movie. I immediately referred to the character of Alex from the film. His shyness is common in most British teenagers, especially girls. Because of virtual sexuality, I felt really good because it's one of the few British films that is not about gangsters or the middle class, but about the people watching the movie, average teens. Americans would not really feel the emotional bond, but every British teenager should see it. Everyone from London will recognize the parts of the city from the movie, it definitely has a special place in my video box!
