"In Love and War" is a simple TV movie that feels good and should be considered as such. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> It's the story of World War II British soldier Newby was arrested with his command by the Italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. When the Italians surrender to the Allies, the command is released and tries to flee. However, the Germans arrive and the command is taken again. Only Newby remains injured. The rest of the film tells how it is hidden and protected by the partisans and its survival. <br /> <br /> (end of spoiler) <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, "In Love and War" is a refreshingly direct film. Half-comedy, half-romantic, the story is simple and clear. The 'atmosfera' is warm and sunny, and the various stereotypes (the desperately disorganized or romantic Italians, the seriously strict Germans and the phlegmatic and pragmatic Britons) are unoriginal but still humorous. The music of Nicola Piovani also contributes to the Mediterranean flair. <br /> <br /> Although it's far from being "Tea with Mussolini" or "La Vita E Bella", "In Love and War" is a cute simple thing a movie that a smile and maybe even a little tan on your face will conjure.
