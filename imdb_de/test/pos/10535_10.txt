This is absolutely the best cartoon of the 80s, maybe the best cartoon ever. It had everything action, adventure, thrills and much more ... <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how hard it was for the company Ruby-Spears to make this great cartoon, it was spent a lot of money for this masterpiece of work, and it was worth it. For example, only the most radiant scenes were hard, because I would not call the 80s for a great technology year with computers like now in the world in which we live! <br /> <br /> The cartoons will never be the same, so I hope they will all be released on DVD, especially The Centurions, as it's my favorite. I have the full set of 65 episodes on DVD-R, but it's not the same, because if they appeared on DVD, people around the world could buy the DVD and watch the DVDs in almost every store, which means a lot to fans My good friend Ted has filed this petition to either retrieve the show on TV or better on DVD, that is, if we receive many requests to bring it back to DVD at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition. html
