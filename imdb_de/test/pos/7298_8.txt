Okay ... so I look through the extensive DVD collection of my mother and father (mostly because they do not charge any late fees ;-)) and I come across "A Thousand Acres". I was amazed that this was a movie starring Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer (with a small performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh) that I had not seen. I do not think I've ever heard of it before. Well, that's exactly the kind of find I dream of, since I have to admit that my parents have built up two movie lovers in my brother and myself. With a few exceptions (none of us can even get them to watch The Lord of the Rings films, but my dad LOVES the Matrix trilogy - GO FIGURE), we have a very similar taste in movies. <br /> <br /> It was a particularly terrible day today, weather permitting. It rained all day, so I got into this movie and shortly after I was fascinated. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the best "sleepers" I have ever seen. Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are great in their roles, especially as they play very different types. Jessica Lange's character is a pleasing follower, who despite her high age rarely plays a leading role in the family. She bows to her father (Jason Robards) and her sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and is hell-bent on teaching her little sister Caroline (Leigh) how to follow suit. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a very strong-willed cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger about her unhappy life in check. This movie is five years before White Oleander, mind you, so it was definitely inspiring to see her play such a strong, angry character. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is probably more appealing to women. Real movie lovers who enjoy a movie for what it is, regardless of their genre or audience, will find it hard to capture the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do, those involved, and those who love them. to deny. I do not know how I missed this movie before, but it was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon. ENJOY!!
