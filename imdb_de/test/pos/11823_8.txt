This is one of the most touching films I have ever seen. No movie influenced me like this. This is a great movie that you have to see for yourself. Normally, I'm impregnable with these Sob story films, but this one did it for me. I was in tears at the end. They long for the friendship shown in this film. If I can give that movie a billion stars, I could.
