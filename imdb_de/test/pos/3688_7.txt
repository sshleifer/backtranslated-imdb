I'm a big Rupert Everett fan. I love Kathy Bates. When I saw that it was available, I decided to give it a try. The synopsis did not really tell you much. In parts it was stupid, touching and in others some parts were hysterical. <br /> <br /> Any person who is a big fan of a personality of any kind will find some small identifying features with the main character. (Of course, there are many who do not want them, but that's the point.) <br /> <br /> If you like one of the actors to see it, but do not look for something dramatic, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I could also mention that you can see how damned the great Rupert is. I mean, I knew he was 6'4 ", but he seems to be even more in this movie, he even seemed to bend over a bit because of the size of the other characters, he's tall, I mean big !!!! And for you Rupert fans there is a naked breast scene ... WONDERFUL!
