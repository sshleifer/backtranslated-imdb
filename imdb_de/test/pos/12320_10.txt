The final film by John Huston, the great American director of Irish descent, is an adaptation of the last short story in the early Dubliners collection, the greatest writer ever to come from Ireland. The movie is a family affair. The dying director, following the script of his son Tony Huston, has made it into one of the most poignant, beautiful, and profound short stories ever written in that language, and has been considered by many THE BEST English-language short stories. John led his daughter Anjelica on her best screen performance. The movie is only 83 minutes long. It has no action sequences, no action, it is almost not eventful and can appear slowly. The guests, friends and relatives come to the party that takes place during the Epiphany week in January 1904 in Dublin, in the home of two older sisters who give each year a dinner with music and dancing. What the audience will see for the first hour is the ensemble conversational piece. The guests chat, listen to music, discuss the last opera premiere and sometimes make awkward jokes. Gradually, the conversation turns to the long-dead friends or relatives whose memory has never faded. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you need to stay in, let it sweep you, hear what and how guests at the party say how they communicate with each other. Watch out for the body language, the glances on their faces as they move away from the light, laughing, and leaving contemporary music to the bygone, but never truly valuable, memories where the Dead of the Title are not dead forever young and so alive. By doing so, you will be rewarded with the final scene of the emotional power and impact that always stays with you. It breaks your heart into pieces, pulls it together and puts it back fixed. The film and Joyce's story revolve around Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann as James Joyce's alter ego, who provided a very moving, understated performance) as one of the party guests traveling with his wife Gretta (Anjelica Huston). Gabriel is still in love, feels connected and fascinated by her. After the party he discovers that even after many years of communion he does not know everything about her past, her pain, her regret and the unforgettable feelings and losses that she had experienced as a young girl, and he is no part of. For the first time, he looks at her and does not think of her as an indelible part of his existence, but as another human being with his own inner world, his own loneliness and sadness, and for the first time "a strange, kind pity for she is in his soul He is the one who tells the last, most powerful, and profound lines of the story, "Snow is common throughout Ireland, falling faintly through the universe, and falling as easily as the descent of the last of all living and dead people." <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie or read the story of Joyce, please do so. They are really works of art that will leave the eternal impression and change the best in you.
