Joan Cusack steals the show! The premise is good, the plot is interesting and the script was fine. A bit too simple, when a gay man's coming-out story was so positive when it's not that positive. Then it's fiction again. :) All in all a fun gimmick. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was that there was an "inside joke" effect. Since the target audience was likely to be direct, the gay "stuff" may not be related to the story. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline showed a facet of his acting abilities that scriptwriters sometimes ignore when they suggest Kline for a part.
