Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win his wife, in this case Juhi Chawla. Little does Juhi know in the film that Shahrukh has fallen in love with her so much and constantly persecutes her. I have to admit that some of the things he did in this movie were pretty scary ... like the threatening phone calls. Never in my life will I forget the line: "I love you K..k..k..Kiran!" <br /> <br /> It's just too bad Shahrukh and Juhi were not "together" The movie. But Juhi and Sunny make a pretty good couple in the movie. Although Shahrukh's role was quite psychotic, I still think he did very well and can not possibly imagine someone else taking on that role. No wonder he received an award for Darr for 94 '! <br /> <br /> Juhi ... what should I say ??? She looks great in this movie! It's not that she does not always look great in her other films, but Darr has given the public a wonderful image of her! <br /> <br /> As for the music ... it was excellent! Especially "Jaadu Teri Nazar", one of my favorite songs of all time. I also thought that "Tu Mere Samne" was nice too. <br /> <br /> A must for everyone! Overall, Darr earns a 9/10!
