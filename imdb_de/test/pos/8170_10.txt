I may be a sentimentalist. But I found this movie really moving. It was the first movie that brought me to tears. And it has done more than once !! I would recommend it to anyone, both gay and str8. Religious or not! Jackie Bisset, who co-starred, stole the show, especially with their one-liners. The nude scenes were also superbly designed and everything was good taste. Most shocking was the portrayal of the Mormon Church's landmark reversal of orientation. It shocked me that this is still happening in the world. Nevertheless, I liked this movie enormously. This is definitely the best gay movie since Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the other gay movies that were offered this year - The Fluffer.
