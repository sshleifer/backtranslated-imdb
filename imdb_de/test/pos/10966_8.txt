It ends with the statement that "the film you just saw was an improvisation" that once made you feel like an idiot because he thought improvisation was a good movie and amazed at the genius from Cassavetes ... again. Of course, Cassavetes told a guy that it was not really an improvisation on his deathbed by itself, so ... it's the story of a fair-skinned black woman, Lelia, who goes white, and her family: the white brother named Ben and a black and black brother named Hughie. When she falls in love with a white idiot named Tony, he is unpleasantly surprised when she finds out she is black. From there it is about the individual aspirations and shortcomings of the three main characters. Hughie is a jazz singer who is about to fail, and Lelia is still hopelessly depressed about Tony, and Ben is generally scared and violent. Overall, it's probably about stasis vs. Change in human life. I suspect that Cassavetes had organized the plot sufficiently and only the dialogue was improvised. The dialogue itself is very uneven - sometimes someone says something very memorable, sometimes it is very uncomfortable. Amazing is the extent to which the amateur actors embody their characters. Cassavetes went through the drama lessons he was teaching when he decided to make Shadows and whispered to the ten best students, and that was the result ... the guys playing Ben and Hughie are very good. At first, I did not like Lelia, but as the movie progresses, it's becoming more and more apparent that she's one of those actors who get better with increasing suspense and drama - not necessarily the best with small talk. Shadows is hailed by many as a forerunner of indie film movement (1959) and is definitely recommended.
