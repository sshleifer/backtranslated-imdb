I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was great. Almost everything I would expect from a sci-fi movie by Bruce Campbell. It's campy and very funny. Ted Raimi was also funny and extremely stupid. The conspiracy is crazy, an American businessman goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who rescues Bruce Campbell by implanting half the brain of a former KGB litter taxi. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the movie trying to avenge his death, and has many inner quarrels between him and the KGB agent. The movie has all the awesome Bruce Campbell baton and humor. The movie is a bit predictable. I knew when the woman was killed, she would share a brain with her killer. However, I did not see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar-winning screenplay, I saw it because it was a sci-fi movie by Bruce Campbell and I was not disappointed. I strongly suggest you visit him on his book tour or wait on the sci-fi channel next month. Although he said before the film, the sci-fi channel had cut out part of the film to make it TV-friendly. If you're a fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it.
