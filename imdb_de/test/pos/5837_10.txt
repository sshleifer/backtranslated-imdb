Oz is without doubt my favorite show of all time! The best word to describe it is "genius"! the writing, the acting, the stories ... everything about this show is absolutely incredible! <br /> <br /> I just discovered the show and got addicted to it right away and I was really surprised that she did not get the recognition she really deserves. It's violent and most characters are not meant to like you, but the show is so brilliantly written that you can leave the violence and the criminals behind and see them as real people. They are the lowest forms of scum, but they still find a way to understand many of the characters and even take care of their stories. As realistic as possible, but the series is not about violence, as some believe. It's really a work of art and I'm sure anyone who gives it a chance will love it as much as I do.
