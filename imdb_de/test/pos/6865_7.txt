I have (unfortunately) seen the sync version on Encore. <br /> <br /> The student Paula Henning (Franka Potente, who was also in the cult favorite "Run Lola Run") plays a serious medical student who goes to a prestigious school in Germany. However, she soon discovers that some students are missing and the bodies they work in at the Anatomy Lab are incredibly fresh ... <br /> <br /> I was stuck when I saw the dubbed version on Encore. It hurt a lot (the words that did not fit the lips quickly became annoying), but I still liked what I saw. The acting was good, it was beautifully photographed, it was not too cruel and I was never bored. Even more refreshing was a sympathetic heroine who resists when the bad guys persecute her. The (mild) nudity was, in a refreshing twist, male! A previous poster mentions that Benno Furmann (who is excellent) has shown his butt, but I do not remember seeing him. Nevertheless, this is a well made, scary and excellent thriller. Of all that I read, the original German version is the best (I do not doubt that for a second), but the dubbed version can be viewed. I give this a 7.
