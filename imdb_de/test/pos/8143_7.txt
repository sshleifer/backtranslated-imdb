"Purgatory Flats", recently shown on cable, is a small movie that packs a lot. Harris Done shows in style. The screenplay by Mr. Done and Diane Fine is a good thriller. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, you may want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> The film is the story of a young LA doctor who made a mistake and gets paid for it. After his release from prison, he wants to hide in a small town where he feels forgotten. Bad choose! What Thomas Reed finds in Purgatory Flats is hell in the desert. Right after landing a job as a bartender, Thomas meets a pretty young woman, Sunny, who is clearly someone to stay away from. The young doctor is called as Sunny's friend Randy, shot down by a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> We get to know Randy's family. His uncle Dean seems to be alright, but his brother Owen is a loose cannon. Everyone in the household is connected to the nubile Sunny in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> The services are ok. Vincent Ventresca is Thomas, the man who should have gone to his US office instead of making a detour to the small town. Alexandra Holden is Sunny, a young woman with a great ambition to escape from her surroundings. Kevin Alejandro, Gregg Henry, Brian Austin play well in the Mecklin family. Nicholas Turturro also does a good job as a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> The film shows a director who will be promising, speaking of this tightly constructed film.
