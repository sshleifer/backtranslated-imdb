Crackerjack is a simple but very good movie in which the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is being tried on both sides. <br /> <br /> The combination of the central character played by Mick Malloy and the central environment in which the local pub clubs are located attracted an unusually wide crowd, ranging from a large number of teenagers to one There were a lot of seniors - and everyone laughed about the comedy There was a lot to cuss with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy, but it was not over the top, and the audience I was sitting with really enjoyed it! <br /> <br /> Mick Malloy did a great job as the lazy guy who joined the team has Bowls Club (three times) to easily get parking (one for himself and two for letting to others at an extra cost), but who has it all when he has to play or lose his membership. <br /> <br Judith Lucy does a great job as a local journalist / love interest and there are fabulous people The achievements of Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan, Lois Ramsey and many others. <br /> <br /> John Clarke's role as a villain is not one of the funniest, but he delivers a solid performance. <br /> <br /> The not-so-subtle pokes in pokies give this otherwise lightweight comedy a serious touch. <br /> <br /> I am sure that even those who like The Castle and The Dish will like this movie.
