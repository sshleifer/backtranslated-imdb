As I leafed through the canals, I was lucky enough to stumble over the beginning of this movie. I have to admit that it caught my attention almost immediately. I love older movies and that is or should be considered a classic! One of the most wonderful rarities of this film is that the main character was not only female but also a bad girl. I highly recommend this movie!
