When it comes to these weird and weird little thrillers, the sorts revolve around characters bordering on scum and living in equally shabby surroundings, and in addition they have a wavering and grim feeling thanks to a rather grotesque cinematography and a very grim one black comedy. Dead Bodies is the kind of movie Paul McGuigan wishes he could do. Unfortunately, the crazy and sporadic Gangster No. 1 as well as everywhere in the business, but an interesting exercise in surrealism mixed with realism, the effort titled The Acid House is the only one we have had to do so far. Dead Bodies is Robert Quinn's play, based on a Derek Landy script, a film that spans the line between psychological horror and neo-noir. Criminal and terrorist elements are linked to issues related to morality and unnatural, obsessive disorders. <br /> <br /> McGuigan's British crime efforts have a curled and distorted feel, as if you are witnessing someone's nightmare and sitting in the front row. His films are able to excite some areas and amuse others with their unusual and omnipresent approach. They have a very dreamlike sensitivity, even though they are in a very realistic, run-down, dirty world. The real world, with as much emphasis on the horror and horror of the situations that make its characters, than anything else. Dead Bodies is a film that tackles both some pretty harrowing character situations and a short study of a study of a delicate psychological mindset. Only here are the eccentricity of the characters balanced. The horror of the scenarios they are in, and the questions of morality that are much better off. Dead bodies are effective and rather simple, without ever feeling manipulative. His suggestive and knowing tendency to want to hammer home exactly what people think and feel does not affect the experience. Early on we meet Tommy McGann (Scott), a young guy whose girlfriend Jean (Davis) dominates him, his life and the screen whenever she runs in the short time she's in. The point in relation to the fact that he lives in a less than desirable house; With a job stacking shelf and a partner with whom he does not know well, he is taught in different ways. Just as the audience gets the clear permission not to like Jean, what about the brave, corrupt, and expectant attitudes she so clearly possesses. Later, the film will pretty much linger on the face of a police officer as the suspicion and tensions rise, which is clearly a cheap and easy way to tell the onlooker that our hero is not yet in trouble. <br /> <br /> However, compare this to Gangster No. 1, in which this is the episodic and misguided approach that McGuigan applies to the material. a vital plot point arises when a character is seen leaving a building from another person on a random drive in a scene set a few months after the previous scene. The feeling is not so grounded or fulfilling. The establishment of Dead Bodies is dominated by Kay Davis Jean; a wannabe femme fatale who just itches when it comes to choosing a fight, but can not really find one. She got Tommy to jump through rings; to go there doing this and that without Tommy really responding as he could, mainly because he is dominated by her promise of sex life. The beginning builds tension as Tommy's oppressed response to what is happening ends, and there is a clear release when the incident occurs, and Jean dies. <br /> <br /> If setup is easy enough that's one thing, but the pinch of the project is the way Tommy decides to free Jean from his hands by burying them without anyone to tell a best friend of her death bar. Things got tighter when it turned out that there was a second body in exactly the same place where Tommy Jean buried, with mistrust, rejection and general annoyance the ubiquitous ingredients of the day. At this point, the film blurs the boundaries between Noir and Horror; In fact, Tommy lives in rather a large, menacing, scary, and even gothic house, which he shares with an elderly relative living in the upper reaches of the house. This is reminiscent of Hitchcock's movie Psycho of 1960 and Bates' attitude he made with his mother and where she is. It is no coincidence that this place of horror is the scene for Jean's unfortunate end. <br /> <br /> Placing a corpse directly in the hands of the hapless, male leadership so they can act like the initial incident is a classic set for every Noir; from Ulmer's film "Detour 1945" to a more recent and contemporary film "Dead Bodies" (2006) titled "Big Nothing". What unfolds in this film is twisted; rather unpredictable and rather frightening story about genre hybridity and mind games presented under a palette of dried out images. The voice-over and fine-line kicking, which makes the lead right and wrong for most of the film, helps push it into a realm of neo-noir. If we look at the fact that the leadership is essentially innocent and his murder charges unfair, then that is one thing, but his attitude towards Jean initially saw him without thinking, and his cover up of her death is the antithesis that he dropped the case has murder charge Dead body is being taught; entertaining, without feeling exploitative, and provides a consistent tone for the rather unpleasant physical and psychological content being researched.
