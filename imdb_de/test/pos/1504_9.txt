This is an interesting movie. I find it very humorous, although the humor is very black. Fulci is good and funny, he is a really funny and really crazy "self-portrait" of an artist ("I do horror movies, if I made love movies, nobody would buy tickets ..."). And it's really SEXY movie: Almost always there is something "action" or tension. and many sexy girls / women ... Maybe it's really about why anyone even starts to make movies / art ... It's a real psychedelic journey that you might best see a bit drunk or a similar state of mind. Of course, there are really unpleasant Gore scenes because it's Lucio Fulci. In fact, some of these scenes are pretty disgusting. Anyway, it's one of the three best and most complete Fulci movies I've ever seen (the others are House By The Cemetery & Zombi, I have not seen the hereafter). In fact, the script is in my opinion exaggerated enough. You might see this film as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (fashionable words): the character has a compelling need to confess "crime" or bad thought; He did not even commit any crimes. And he keeps asking himself: What if I did it? What if I want to do it? Did I do that? Will I do it? He overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts. I'm sure Fulci was interested in psychology and maybe even read something about the area. In his "House By The Cemetery" movie, for example, there is a character called Freudstein. This is perhaps the most focused and direct personal film that Fulci has made. I also like the simplicity of the photography / pictures in this movie. The only thing that bothers me a bit is sadism, especially towards women. I do not quite understand why? Is it entertainment? Is it art? Is it horror? However, this is a really interesting and well-made film that definitely recommends a classic movie, at least for fans or anyone interested in the genre. For the others it may be too much.
