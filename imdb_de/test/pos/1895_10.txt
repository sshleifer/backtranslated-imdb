If you watch this movie, quote it and refer to it for a long time. It has been years since I saw Dolemite, and I quote it to this day. It is a true classic. It's so amazingly awful it makes a weird view. Every terrible line of dialogue is absolutely amazing. Every wobble shot a work of art (?). And every beat and kick made so miserable. You will not believe your eyes. It's all I can say. If I really understand how intriguing this movie is, I will not be able to stop, and I will go far beyond the limit of IMDb 1000 words. <br /> <br /> Please watch this movie. You will be hysterical. Depending on your sense of humor either 1/10 or 10/10.
