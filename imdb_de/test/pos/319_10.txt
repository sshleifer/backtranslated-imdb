My favorite movie of all time. This was a flawed work by Coppola, and the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola was King of Hollywood at the time, having made "the Godfather" and "Godfather II," and had developed the necessary ego to even make a movie like "Apocalypse Now." Through sheer arrogance, he went to the Phillipines with a screenplay and thought he knew what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he knew what to do when he arrived at Col. Kurtz. And like Willard, he did not know what he would do once he got there. This is a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is a perfect metaphor and backdrop to the story. What I like best about "Apocalypse Now" is that there are no answers or conclusions. Because of this openness, it therefore annoys some viewers who find their films much more obvious. <br /> <br /> This film contradicts categorization. Some call it a war movie it's not at all, it's more of a personal study of man. The best picture of Vietnam, in my opinion, is "platoon", and if a viewer is looking for a retelling of the Vietnam War, you should first look for answers there. <br /> <br /> Coppola should be recommended for his attitude to the bureaucracy of the war, which he communicates quite effectively with his meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer boldness of Kilgore makes it an unforgettable character, and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic. <br /> <br /> It's an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal end, making it a movie that's not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch, but also rewarding. I could offer my explanations for each scene, but that would be completely pointless. This film is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to instant gratification. <br /> <br /> A little footnote, anyway, if you're seeing Apocalypse for the first time, check out the original version first, the 'Redux' version I think, rather for the hardcore fan and more curious as a "new and improved" version of the movie
