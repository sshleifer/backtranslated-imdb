This movie is great from beginning to end about a group of medical students who come together and literally kill themselves by stopping their hearts and then reviving themselves. They then research what happens from the "near-death experiences". As everyone goes through the experience, they are haunted by their deepest fears that seem to manifest as reality. This ranges from dead kids with hockey sticks to dead fathers who seem to be upstairs. <br /> <br /> The cast is first class and Oliver Platt is extremely funny in one of the best roles of his career. I'm not a big fan of Keifer Sutherland, but even he does a great job. This is a movie that I can watch again and again!
