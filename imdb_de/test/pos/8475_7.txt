In recent years, there have been a number of biopics of famous singers, and Ray, the story of Ray Charles, has much in common with Walk the Line, which was made the following year and told the story of Johnny Cash. Cash and Charles were near-perfect contemporaries, both of whom were born in the early thirties and died in 2003-04. Both grew up in poverty in the American Deep South. Both have lost a brother in an accident in childhood. Both were successful in the 1950s. Both had problems in their marriage and both were drug addicts. All these things are highlighted in both films. There are also similarities with Ron Howard's "A Beautiful Mind". Although this film was a mathematician and not a musician, he emphasized how both "Ray" and "Walk the Line," the role of the woman of her subject, helped her husband overcome his problems. <br /> <br / Ray Charles was born in 1930 by a single mother in a poor black community in Georgia. (His original name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he began his career as a musician, he dropped his last name to avoid confusion with the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson). In a way, Charles was even more difficult than cash, having two additional drawbacks in his blindness and racism that had affected all black Americans, especially in the South, during his lifetime. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood when he witnessed the death of his younger brother George in a drowning accident and went blind about a year or two later. He seems to have been haunted by nightmares and guilt over Georges's death throughout his life. The first half of the film is rather slow and is a standard showbiz by Biopics The story of how the young Charles learns to play the piano becomes a nightclub artist and then earns a reputation as a major artist on his way to the beautiful Della Bea in love. The best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks to Karl's childhood. There is an effective, recurring image of colored glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house. Perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind. There is also a memorable scene in which the adolescent Charles accuses an unbiased bus driver of putting him on the bus, pretending to have lost his sight on Omaha Beach (in reality, he would only be in the Normandy landings thirteen). <br /> <br /> The second half of the film becomes more interesting as it progresses into controversial territory, focusing on Charles's drug addiction, the issues in his marriage, which are due to his affair with Margie Hendricks, one of his backing vocalists , were caused. and his struggles against racism. In the early 1960s, Charles caused a sensation when he refused to play in front of a racially divided audience in Georgia (although, unlike the film, this did not mean that he was not listed in the state). He also fought against racial differences within the music industry himself, not only performing traditional "black" musical styles such as gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditional "white" ones like country and western (considered by many black Americans as American music) music the choice of the Redneck community). <br /> <br /> As Peter Bradshaw, film critic of "The Guardian", "Ray" noticed a sunny film that diplomatically turns away from the dark side of things. Noteworthy is the death of Charles's beloved mother Aretha during his teenage years, his short marriage to Eileen Williams in the early 1950s, and his later divorce from Della Bea in 1977. She also reduces the number of her women and women's lives illegitimate children. There are similarities here with "A Beautiful Mind," which also omitted some controversial details about the subject's personal life, including a divorce. <br /> <br /> Fans of Ray Charles will undoubtedly enjoy the movie for the music. But it's also worth it for those who do not know much about him, mainly because of the Oscar-winning performance of Jamie Foxx in the title role, which reproduces Charles's mannerisms so accurately that we believe we actually see a blind man, though Foxx himself is spotted. (Unlike Joaquin Phoenix in "Walk the Line," however, Foxx did not sing himself - no doubt Charles's signature voice was too difficult to reproduce). He is supported by several other artists, notably Sharon Warren as Aretha and Kerry Washington as Della Bea. The movie is uneven and overly long, but still rewarding. 10.7
