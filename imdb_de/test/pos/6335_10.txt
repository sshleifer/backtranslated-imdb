The creepy demons "The Gentlemen" capture the voice of the Sunnydale people to steal human hearts without a scream. Giles says that according to a legend, when a lady screams, the creatures are destroyed, but Buffy and her friends, including Riley, must fight the monsters speechless best episode of the fourth season of Buffy until this moment. With a lot of humor and funny situations I liked a lot. Spike is weird, the romance between Xander and Anya is cool, but I loved the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley in the end. The gothic scenario of the last fight against "The Gentlemen" is reminiscent of the environment of "Dark City". My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "SilÃªncio" ("Silence")
