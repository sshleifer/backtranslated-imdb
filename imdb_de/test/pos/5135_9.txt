This is a delightful gem of a movie, unfortunately classified as "only for kids". The plot revolves around a young man, Roy Eberhardt, who has recently arrived from the Montana Mountains in southwest Florida. Roy tries to sit down with the other children in his middle school and discovers a brother-sister team that wants to protect endangered owl-diggers at an illegal construction site. Look for Carl Hiassen, author of the book on which this movie is based, as the evil secretary's male secretary at the corporate headquarters. Author and director Wil Shriner is also an employee of the Public Records Office, where the intrepid teen detectives find that the burdensome Environmental Impact Report is missing. Luke Wilson steals nearly all crucial scenes from the charming teen actors who have the best lines. Wilson is the limping policeman in his three-wheeled electric police car with blue lights and funky siren. As Officer Dave, he's doing so well that he's fine, but he usually ends up in the dirt in the truest sense of the word! Multiple times! Jimmy Buffet, as a tacitly supporting science teacher, is quite reluctant. But the young actors Logan Lerman (Roy), Brie Larson (Beatrice the Bear) and Cody Linley (Mullet Fingers) are outstanding as teenagers who have finally put Officer Dave on the right track. I hope you get away from this movie and feel as good as me. Just fun! A small complaint. I hope that all non-Floridians realize that not everyone from Florida is as surly for newcomers as depicted in this movie. We are really a friendly group! Just ask Carl Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet !!
