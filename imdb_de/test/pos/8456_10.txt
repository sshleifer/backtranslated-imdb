When THE CHINA SYNDROME was released, many right-wing critics and nuclear weaponists blew up the film, especially as its three main stars were all known for their liberal policies and their open distrust of nuclear power. But it took only two weeks and an almost catastrophic crash on Three Mile Island to silence the critics. <br /> <br /> Fonda and Douglas are the LA news crew who are experiencing a potentially nasty accident at the Ventana nuclear power plant. Douglas films the event through the soundproof glass of the system; but the TV station does not lend the footage for fear of a massive lawsuit. So it's up to Fonda and Douglas, despite a massive factory owner's attempt to cover up the accident, to come to the truth. <br /> <br /> But a conscientious shift manager (Jack Lemmon) has revealed certain deficiencies in the pump support structure of the facility. He believes these defects were the cause of the accident and, although this would be extremely costly and lengthy, if repairs are not made, the next accident could be apocalyptic. But he can not make anyone who works with him believe his story. The result is a nightmarish climax that brings together various political, technological and human interest stories in a disturbing package. <br /> <br /> Although obviously politically liberal in nature, THE CHINA SYNDROME, well-directed and co-written James Bridges (THE PAPER CHASE) is also basically an embassy film about the dangers of blending technology and nuclear power , Nuclear power can NEVER be made safe because people NEVER can be perfect. That's what the movie says; and in a most entertaining and exciting way it says it brilliantly.
