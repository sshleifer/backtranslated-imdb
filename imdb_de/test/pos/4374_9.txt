Unfortunately, this is Carlin's last HBO concert from a series of more than 30 years. Although this may not be his "best" work, it is superb, funny and thought-provoking. This recording also differs a bit from most of his other concerts. It is a bit longer than most other concerts. Throughout his long, prolific and influential career, Carlin has continued to develop observational humor and fart joke on a "humanitarian" point of view of society and culture. His focus on the English language and euphemisms increased over the years and culminated in this performance. However, I would argue that his audiobook "When will Jesus bring pork chops?" He best shows his great joke about language, euphemisms and the collapse of our values. It is bad for Ya is a reference to his long transformation from comedian to writer. <br /> <br /> If you are offended by insulted language or the downgrading of the church, you probably will not like Carlin's material. However, if you are mentally stimulated and can tolerate speech and blasphemy, you would probably enjoy this concert very much.
