I recently watched Episodes 1 through 4 and can not wait to see 5 & 6 available! (I've heard that they're coming soon.) Commander's Log seems destined to become a cult among the university people and everyone else who likes a fancy comedy. It's obvious the budget was small, but the care in creating the script is obvious. The simplicity of the show allowed me to pay more tribute to writing and acting. Bowlsby is a master of defeat ... I just wish I could remember the best that could be used for unsuspecting employees later! Let's just say, if you do not like Commander's Log, I personally will make sure your underwear gets extra strength!
