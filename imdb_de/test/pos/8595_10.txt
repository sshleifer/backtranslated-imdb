This movie is the best movie I have seen in a long time. It's also the best movie that uses a drama to tell story without going to speculations like JFK, Nixon or Hoffa. It skilfully shows the clutches Belgium had in the Congo. It also easily pulls out to us the European and American forces behind the power Congo has done today. The film was sure to engage the US in the murder of Lumumba. This film could never be filmed in the US, as American film rarely deals with imperialism and murder. (Save Stone's JFK) It also shows us the problems of inner conflict in Congo, between Lumumba, Mobutu and Katanga. We can see how precarious countries sit in building new governments, when their history is colonialized and those who were colonizers continue to pull the strings of power and violence. The film is superbly shot with Eriq Ebouaney, an outstanding Lumumba. The cast is great and they really draw you into the feeling of climate in the Congo during that time. <br /> <br /> This is a must for those who love a drama with a correct historical background. See my notes on Quilombo.
