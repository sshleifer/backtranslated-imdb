I have a problem with the movie snobs, who think Americans are clumsy half-literals, who do not appreciate the sophistication of the more refined Europeans, Les Francais, Les Italia. If the humor in "My Father, the Hero" is different from the one in "Mon Pere ce heros", it's because the French humor is different from the American's. Not better, not "smarter", just different. If you think it's glaring for Hollywood to "borrow" from French cinema, consider how much French cinema borrowed from Hollywood. Where would Belmondo and Delon have been without Bogart? Truffaut without Hitchcock? Jerry Lewis - not known for his subtle and cerebral style is an idol in France. Go figure ........ Monsieur Depardieu is exceptionally good as the unlucky divorced father of a precocious 14-year-old daughter who is vacationing in the Bahamas. Without knowing it, she introduces him to the other people in the hotel as a lover, to make himself more interesting for a boy she has in mind. Surprisingly, no complications occur. There are "tributes" on "Green Card" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" that are used amusingly and M.Depardieu makes everything very good natured. He makes a good impression of Maurice Chevaler with "Thank Heaven for Little Girls," which is indeed funny and quite poignant, as his audiences all believe he is the lover of a 14-year-old girl. Get up and let two people stand - two as he rolls over, fortunately unaware of what's going on. When he turns at the end of the song to acknowledge the expected applause, the expression on his face is priceless. Without him, the film would indeed be very average. It's a lot of fun with its huge, confusing figure that dominates the screen. No pecs, no sixpack - just a real human being.
