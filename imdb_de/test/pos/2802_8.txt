"L'auberge espagnole", one of the biggest French successes of 2002, was also well received abroad, which is quite extraordinary for a French film. The reasons for this success are not difficult to define. This film, made by one of the most interesting French filmmakers of recent years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students from all over Europe who have gathered under one roof in Barcelona. These students are described as those who introduce themselves or who you see in everyday life: either messy, serious or with humor. I think if the movie worked so well, then many students have recognized themselves in the portraits of the main characters and especially in Xaviers himself. <br /> <br /> We watch the movie and so its experience abroad Erasmus student through his eyes. Xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities, his mistakes. An intelligent approach with many ingenious ideas expresses his lost mind and his fear of the world and as an Erasmus student perfectly. On this topic, the best examples can be found in two sequences. The first is when Xavier asks a woman at the university for the papers he has to send to prepare his DEA. If the same woman informs him about the various procedures required, all the papers will appear on the screen when they are named! In the next sequence, Xavier's voice-over entrusts the viewer with his vision of the modern world. Where can I find the second example? Well, the scene in which Xavier conducts a thorough medical examination, in which Klapisch films his visions, is far enough to speak of himself. <br /> <br /> Also, the director was not interested in the studies of his main character. He left this point aloof. Rather, he has put a lot of effort into Xavier's personal life, of course in his love affair with Anne Sophie, but also and especially in his relationships with his roommates. It is a true friendship story that shows us Klapisch with his moments of happiness, but also with his arguments and tensions. Through Xavier's adventure and at the end of his stay, he is initiated into life, which makes him mature. The message the author wanted to send is not hard to guess. You naively believe that you live in a messy and complicated world. You do not have to give up, but look hard to get what you want, even if it's difficult. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, we might also fear that Cédric Klapisch would not avoid any trap on this subject: the stereotypes. Let's be honest: they are included in the script, but the director does his best not to spread them too much in his film. Then the script contains comfortable and predictable moments: At the airport and before boarding, we see Xavier shed a tear after leaving his family. But thankfully, the shortcomings of the script stop here. Pretty funny dialogues and cool young actors who feel comfortable in their roles make the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Despite its weaknesses, "l'auberge espagnole" is a symbol of success in the film "Young". The whole atmosphere that emerges suggests that this film is primarily aimed at a young audience. Ultimately, the end of the film and its great success suggests that Klapisch has fallen into a fashion that fits American cinema: the development of sequels. In fact, the filmmaker is currently working on a sequel titled "les poupées russes". Let's hope it's as good as l'auberge espagnole.
