Ok, let's get that out of the way first: As a piece of cinema, Lifeforce is garbage. As a cheesy entertainment program for SF fans, it has a lot of merit. If you like to see old black and white SF-B movies - huge mutant spiders / ants or alien monsters wandering in the desert - you'll really get a kick out of Lifeforce. <br /> <br /> Bad Things: History makes little sense and the drama is pretty bad. Good things: the special effects are reasonably decent; It has a welcoming history centered in the UK (playing in London), which gives most SF films a different feel. and it's the affluent Mathilda May (amusing called the "Space Girl") who wanders naked. <br /> <br /> In short, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I've seen it half a dozen times now, and every time it appears on TV, I take the time to look at it - admittedly that has something to do with naked Mrs. May - but it is also to enjoy a bit modest and stupid SF.
