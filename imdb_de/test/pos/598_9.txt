The first feature film by Muppet Movie, and besides perhaps The Muppet Christmas Carol, the puppeteers around the world are still looking for a guide. Disney has given the Muppets a disinterest and this film proves it again and again. With classic comedians and guest star cameos, a simple but original storyline, classic Muppet jokes, Paul Williams' genius in songwriting and Electric Mayhem madness, and an amazing movie, especially when you realize that the main cast is dolls. Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with dolls. Half of today's fun is that cameo actor / actress is still alive. I can only hope that Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers Kermit and Company can somehow save and revive Disney's deadly grip.
