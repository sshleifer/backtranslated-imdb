Eichard Gere & Diane Lane in another romantic love story. They are an excellent team, BUT somehow this movie will not be among the best. <br /> <br /> Director George Wolfe uses a screenplay by Ann Peacock & John Romanao for Nicholas Spark's novel. This is another story of two strangers meeting and falling in love, then they go on and on when they meet again and start a life together. <br /> <br /> SPOILER, but not really. It comes to a tragedy, one dies. <br /> <br /> How many times have we seen this? <br /> <br /> Anyone who has never seen such teardrops will hopefully like it more than me. This story has about every clich√© that exists. <br /> <br /> The only reason why there are the reviews I will give. is the fine act & excellent production. The cast alongside our 2 stars includes Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis and Scott Glenn. They all give really good performances and give the best with the material that was given to them. <br /> <br /> There is a good but not overly-done assault sequence. The sex scenes are well done, no nudity and almost no foul language, <br /> <br /> rating: *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 out of 10)
