It's great to see a new line of puppets causing havoc in this series. I found this chapter very funny. In fact, it would probably be my second favorite in the series. This movie has very little violence and is only rated PG-13. This is very different from the other R-rated puppet films that were full of gore and violent chaos. However, the lack of violence does not reduce the fun. This movie also has much better special effects than the last movie in this series. Well.
