This is a brilliant series that matches the Simpsons. Follow a family as it goes through their lives and problems, etc. Somewhat less realistic than Simpsons, baby and dog talking to somebody? Family Guy goes where SImpsons or Futurama do not dare, and passes by sicker jokes and racy jokes. And believe me, it works! Almost all gags have reached their goal and you will be in stitches (especially the random, frequent flashbacks!) When my brother showed me this for the first time, I was not addicted, but after a few episodes I was addicted. They will be 2. 10/10 for a really brilliant show. Greetings to Seth Macfarlane for bringing this show to life. :)
