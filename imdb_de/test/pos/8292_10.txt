I loved this movie for a long time. I had not seen it for a while, so I checked it again and found it even more enjoyable now. I liked the Chipmunks cartoon when I was young so of course I loved "The Chipmunk Adventure". It's not wildly creative, but I've always wanted to travel around the world, so I just have so much fun seeing it as my yearning for travel grows even more. The part in which Elenore sings the little penguin always makes me cry ... <br /> <br /> 'The Chipmunk Adventure' will forever be a favorite of mine, I'm sure. I think it's because I saw it when I was so young. I do not think it will have a big impact on someone seeing it for the first time. (Unless, of course, they have a young heart)
