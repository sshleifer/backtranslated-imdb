I'm sure that all Canadians on IMDb are all too familiar with the Canadian content and how much of that is ... well, let's say we did not make it. There are some select Canadian shows that are really worth watching, but this is definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> Simple premise. Two guys who pick up girls with specific rules and rules in a bar add some funny and clever comments from a group of surprisingly likable, self-styled "Alpha Men" and you have a very entertaining program yourself. Every episode is solid. If the "players" are below average, there are some unpleasant moments, and there is a gentle fun that focuses on them. If the "players" are good, it will result in moments when you just have to stand up and applaud, and a weird praise will be applied to them. A guy who is usually proud of me for the typical horrible reality television and I have to admit that this show is actually funny and entertaining. <br /> <br /> One thing that needs to be pointed out is how The Comedy Network completed this show with a terrible job marketing. Most of the time, I did not even know the premise, and all I knew was that somehow there was a naked torso who loved "pumas." However, after actually watching the show, I was surprised at how surprising it looks for Canadian content (despite a rather lame preload sequence). So give me a chance. I still need to find someone in the target group (18-30 year old men) who actually saw the show (and not just the annoying commercials) who did not like them. <br /> <br /> Bring her back for a third season, Comedy Network. It actually has a good condition, unlike some other Canadian shows that you had (coughing * girls will be girls * coughing). Usually I reserve 10/10 artwork reviews, but I just enjoy watching this show and think that I've wrongly judged my many, which I just had to do.
