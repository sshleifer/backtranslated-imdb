There are usually few things that are more discouraging than Hollywood's attempts to be brave. "Message Movies" mix carefully with hard handedness and knock loudly on the back to solve daring problems. CROSSFIRE is not completely free from this pollution; It contains a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred, which is embarrassingly obvious when it starts from a naïve naïvity level of its audience, whose contemplation is depressing. As late as 1947, it was a big deal that a movie announced that anti-Semitism existed and that it was bad. (For Hollywood, of course, it was unthinkable to deal with the actual subject of the book on which the film was based - his victim was homosexual.) Nevertheless, thanks to good writing and excellent acting, CROSSFIRE remains a compelling test of what we would become a hate crime describe. <br /> <br /> Post-war malaise was one of the main ingredients of Film Noir, and CROSSFIRE deals with it directly. The film takes place in Washington, DC, among soldiers who are still in uniform but idle, spending their days playing poker and crawling in the bar. Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), an intelligent and benevolent Jew, explains that the end of the war has created a void: all the energy put into hate and the fight against the enemy is now unfocused and bottled. Samuels meets three soldiers in a bar: the sensitive Mitchell, who is about to collapse, the weak-willed Floyd Bowers and Montgomery, a tall, arrogant tyrant who vilifies a young Tennessee soldier as a dumb hillbilly. The three soldiers land in Samuels' apartment, where the drunken Monty is increasingly abusive and calls his host "Jewish boys". Samuels is beaten to death and Mitchell disappears, making him the prime suspect in the murder. <br /> <br /> Detective Finlay (Robert Young), Dry and By-the-Book and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows that Mitchell can not murder. Parts of the puzzle include Ginny (Gloria Grahame), a nightclub hostess who met Mitchell and gave him her key to the apartment, and Floyd (Steve Brodie), who is a witness to the crime in a run-down hotel room. While there is no real "whodunite" spiral, the story remains exciting and the trap for the killer is extremely clever. <br /> <br /> The strong Noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling didactic or peaceful. The cinematography is a striking shadow play with intense darkness and bright light. The rooms are often lit by a single lamp that is filtered by cigarette smoke. World fatigue is as pervasive as noir lighting. "Nothing interests me," says Finlay softly. "To nothing" is Ginny's toast in the nightclub. Gloria Grahame, the model of noir femininity, almost steals the film with her two scenes. Platinum blonde, dull and corrosive, she's the epitome of the B-girl, poisoned by the "stinking gin mill" in which she works ("laughs," she says bitterly), her sweet face coagulating as Mitchell tells her she his wife reminds him. Every now and then a yearning kindness peeks through her defensive cover as if she's dancing with Mitchell in a deserted courtyard and offering to make spaghetti in her apartment. When he goes there, he meets a shaky, crumpled man (Paul Kelly), who seems to be wiping Ginny away and whose conversation consists of a dense layering of lies and false confessions. Gloria blows Mitchell's good wife out of the screen in a scene where she is asked to give Mitchell an alibi. Slim and fragile in her bathrobe, with her girlish lisp, she lets us see how often Ginny was insulted and fooled as a jerk. Robert Young is an inconspicuous actor against whom he has no chance against Mitchum's charisma, but he does well to maintain his pipe-smoking character by bridging the film's serious message, this side of the pompousie. Mitchum now gets some cool dialogues, but not nearly enough to do that. Even if he just lazes in a corner, you can not take his eyes off him. The third Robert, Ryan, creates a completely shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant, unstable bigot; we see his fake genius, his bullying, his resentment against anyone with benefits, his "Am I right or am I right?" Complacency; how easily he labels people with labels and what satisfaction he gets from despising them. The message from CROSSFIRE now appears cautious and outdated, though not nearly as much as in the same year as the A gentlemans agreement. Finlay's speech on bigotry policemen who searched for a white victim for a hundred years to remind us that Irish Catholics were once persecuted; Then it could be people from Tennessee or men wearing striped ties. Or maybe blacks, Japanese, homosexuals or communists? The script does not seem to mention real problems of the present. It sweetens his message by sanctifying the Jewish sacrifice, as if his innocence were not sufficient; and care should be taken to relieve the military, with a superior officer declaring that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery, and emphasizing that Samuels served honorably in the war. However, right after the Second World War, it did make some courage to portray an American who might have been happier in the Nazi army, and the basic assumption of the film is still valid. If Monty were still alive today, he would have moved out on September 12, 2001, and beat up a Sikh.
