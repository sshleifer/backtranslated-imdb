This is a fantastic movie. Hána is a very old man with a very young heart. He knows how to fully live his life by uniting with his friend to play pranks on almost everything, even his own death. While his wife can not handle his "irresponsible" behavior, she also knows that for exactly that reason she loves her husband for almost half a century. I would like to hang out with this old guy because he knows how to enjoy life and never be afraid of death. He is cheerful, funny, mischievous and never boring. Vlastimil Brodský brilliantly played Hána at the age of 79. Every look from his eyes and every movement of his aging muscles bring so much to the viewer about the figure. This is a movie that leaves behind a big smile on my face and makes me take a closer look at my own life. Tomorrow I will buy a villa and have some fun. If Hána can, I can too. But I think I'll skip the smoker's part.
