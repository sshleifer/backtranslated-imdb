I recently shot THE SEVEN-UPS on video and I have to say that it was a very nice movie. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are great as policemen and crooks, and young Richard Lynch is a great psycho henchman. The late Bill Hickman is doing pretty well as his colleague Bo and sets up a brilliant car chase chase that will take you to the edge of your seats. The other three members of the seven-ups team are pretty bland, but that's only to be expected. <br /> <br /> I am glad that many people on this site supported this movie. I think it should be a movie released on DVD and not just forgotten. I enjoyed every moment. The last scene between the two leads is excellent as the villain faces the consequences of his actions. THE SEVEN-UPS does not disappoint.
