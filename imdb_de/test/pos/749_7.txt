I loved the movie Do not Look In The Basement, with some great characters. It's about a young psychiatric nurse named nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), who will work in an isolated asylum. There she meets different types of different characters, including Dr. Geraldine Masters, who takes the asylum after the owner of the hospital, dr. Stephens, was killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an ax. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in the film are Mrs. Challingham (Reah MacAdams), a very funny little old lady, Allison, a nymphomaniac, and Sam (Bill McGhee), a young black man who roams all day a separate world all the time. The movie was a very cheap movie, but still a really great movie. I know it was on the 'Video Nasties' list back in the' 80s, but I did not think it had a lot of Gore in it, though it had some disturbing senses in it. GREAT MOVIE RECOMMENDED !!!.
