What a refreshing change from the PG movies, where teenage girls jump in and out of bed, counting young high school boys, how many girls they can connect to, having kids, taking drugs, etc., etc. Hiaasen has it written many books that are fun, but hardly classical literature. but he finally wrote something the middle school kids want to read. And this movie sends a message to kids that maybe they can make a difference, that their voices may be heard. The landscape shot in South Florida is beautiful and natural and REAL. Who cares if it is predictable and a little bit crazy. So was FREE WILLY and how well that has done. This is a good family movie .......... a rare breed.
