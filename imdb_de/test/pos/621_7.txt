Mute Witness is a modest but very solid thriller who never received the attention or good comments he deserves. The film ?? written and directed by Anthony Waller? is an exciting, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. No pointless humbo jumbos or endless twists - just jump to the dot puzzle. Mute Witness deals with the devilish subject of "snuff" and is effectively shot in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** As production costs are lower there, a US film crew temporarily moves to Russia to shoot a horror movie. An old hangar serves as a filming location. The make-up artist of the team is accidentally detained overnight. While she's looking for a way out, she's experiencing the shots of an authentic snuff movie! She has been caught trying to escape but since she is dumb, she can not scream for help and she can not explain to the police what she has seen. The girl's life is now in real danger, as there is a very hidden network behind these snuff production and they do not want the witnesses to live? *** End spoiler ***. Mute Witness contains several very exciting action sequences and is pretty bloody. Some of the mysterious clues are effectively kept secret until the end. In terms of the similar theme, I would say that it is definitely better than the more famous "8mm" by Joel Schumacher with Nicolas Cage. The acting in Mute Witness is not that great, but the lead actress (who is herself Russian) looks really cute. Sir Alec Guinness also makes a special appearance. And a very cool, I can say. Certainly guaranteed with fun and fear.
