For a short moment. The opening scene with Traci Lords and the techno bar <br /> <br /> is incredible. I would probably follow her until my death! Best vampire movie ever, but with a twist. The fight scenes are great. Wesley Snipes shows a sportiness that you can not see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and believable as an ambitious new employee who calls himself into the hierarchy by all means necessary. Great strip 9/10. Where is Blade II?
