I've just previewed this movie and before I read my comment you have to know it's very subjective because I love techno, trance, club, house and music. <br /> <br /> The film deals with Carl, whose brother Jason (or whatever his name was) died in an accident: he fell "drunk" from the roof. Carl meets his brother Sunny's girlfriend and they are quite unmotivated about a private investigation into Jason's death, and Carl becomes involved in Jason's ex-life, which was full of clubs and drugs. From an artistic point of view, the movie itself is nothing but a big pile of porn. The storyline is predictable, all characters are extremely clich√©d and two-dimensional (stupid boy from a small town, young handsome innocent girl, big bad drug king ... the list is endless) and most actors like The Plot are just not believable. Matthew Rhys's stupid boy's performance, which has come to London and suddenly taken drugs by people he does not even know about, does not seem very believable, unlike his female colleague Sunny, played by Sienna Guillory, whose behavior the viewer seems more realistic. No less than a joke was Tim Curry's performance by drug king Damian: a fake caricature, too "eeeevil" and just too ridiculous to be true. <br /> <br /> BUT: If you like club music (the club scenes like the selected titles are just awesome), if you enjoy a simple love story with a cute girl like Sunny (yes, I admit, I've lost my heart ;) ... that makes my comment even more subjective, I think with some (predictable) twists and turns, you will definitely enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone else: FORGET .... IT! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (objective view) <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 (my personal opinion and also my final vote)
