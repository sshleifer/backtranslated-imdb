It is very true that this film defies convention by not spelling out the plot to the viewer. While some must have trouble finding out for themselves, I embrace "Uzumaki" for his disrespect. There is a PLOT, it's just that it's not immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. This is a movie that, like any great art, invites for numerous interpretations - however, this movie is also very entertaining and makes it a rare movie experience. It is both provocative and fun.
