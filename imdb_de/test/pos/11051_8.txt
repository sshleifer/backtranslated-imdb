For Greta Garbo's first talking image, MGM chose the Pultizer Award from Eugene O'Neill, who won in 1921 with ANNA Christie. <br /> <br /> Also, the producers have backed Garbo not just with one member, but with two members of the original Broadway cast (George Marion as Anna's father, Chris) and James T. Mack as Johnny the Priest - to "Johnny "cast the harp" for movies so as not to offend). <br /> <br /> This little change is interesting, like too many movies (which is said to be MOVIES MOVIES and ignores their origins), "little To be more than filmed stage plays ", the problem is not the play, but the filmmakers who would not be faithful to the property, by diluting a great cinematic stage work to insult or open them as they CAN, lose out Luckily, the respect that the studio had for both O'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie, the usually destructive one, to film the qualities that made the piece worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Thankfully Process admirably to survive in Frances Marion's generally sensitive screen customization. Marion of Miracles, Marion even allows the point of the scene where Garbos Anna reveals her past on "the farm" to the man she desperately wants to marry, and the father who sent her there! What must the League of Decency have thought of that! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem of the source game has always been that Chris's friend Marthy tends to go away with the first act and then vanishes from the last two, so Anna can step on the stage - the two sides of the really good ones Woman men do not always recognize. <br /> <br /> The perfectly cast Marie Dressler (who also had her teeth cut on the Broadway stage before leaving for Hollywood) is the perfect balance for Garbo's Anna in this area too, and the fast motion picture movie at only 90 Minutes, does not leave us too much time to miss her - one of the few benefits shown by the fact that the atmosphere is not eloquently shown in the original - AND scriptwriter Marion is smart enough to deviate from O'Neill to Dressler for a touch bring back two-thirds of the film, which will recall Julie Laverne's second appearance in SHOW BOAT. <br /> <br /> Anna and Marty's early scene on the screen (16 minutes after the film begins), which measure each other and build all the excitement of the rest of the story, is one of the most memorable scenes in the entire piece. Not to miss. <br /> <br /> ANNA Christie is a great tragic game and a good movie drama. It's hard to imagine that a remake of the last day, which would almost certainly lose the courage and atmosphere of this 1930 remake (it was first filmed in 1923 without sound - even with George Marion's original Broadway Chris) - could enhance this superb filming , <br /> <br /> The inner scenes are closest to the play, but the outsides should not be overlooked by anyone who has the atmosphere in mind. While the background screen work is not state-of-the-art, the backgrounds give a better insight than most of the actual-world movies in which the script plays (especially in New York Harbor). <br /> <br /> Nearly all naturalistic performances by Garbo from the Sound era have been outstanding (but the too often parodied death scene of CAMILLE, 7 years later, occasionally attracts fuss over the harsh plot and the parodies), but this ANNA Christie, along with the variety of her 1932 films, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the great Lubitsch note on her 1939 comedy NINOTCHKA ("Garbo laughs!"), which is certainly among her best. <br /> <br /> O'Neill fans on the verge of his acclaimed "Sea Games" should find the fine World War II film released the year before the US enters the conflict LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940) was published. It's almost as skilful from these sea games as this one by ANNA Christie, and it shows a young John Wayne in one of his rare non-westerns, supporting a good cast of experienced actors who show him the way.
