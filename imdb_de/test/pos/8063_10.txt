Over the years, I've been very interested in the life of this teenager, who has shaped the world so deeply and indelibly. My fascination also arose because of fear, because this could happen again. <br /> <br /> And in the following years, yes, I'm afraid, "it's still happening around us and of course it was" it happened "long before Anne's" it "is, of course, a so-called turning civilized society on its own or on an innocent country / race / continent and murdering cold-blooded citizens for their weakest excuses? I leave that question out there. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader Adolf Hitler that the only profound fact that Hitler never mentioned was that he was democratically elected. The atrocities committed were the result of a consistent poodle press and a propaganda that was repeatedly played by a subservient population. <br /> <br /> One of the atrocities was Anne Frank, who looked at her face to the extermination camps by the miracle of survival of her diary Kenneth Brannagh does wonderful work in the commentaries and interviews, he has the rare gift of minimizing his own personality so that the subjects can speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Many new facts and people who have never been interviewed before are brought to life in the meticulous research that I will not go into here as they add immeasurably to the reality and painful suffering of the film /> <br /> Glenn Close reads the selection from the diary and from her The voice is perfect for the role, it brings a naivety and freshness in the role. Anne's childhood friends are extensively interviewed and her final days before death are well recorded and, together with her lively and experienced wife, witnessed a mischievous personality. <br /> <br /> This is not to be overlooked. A wonderful and respectful film about the seldom seen Anne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
