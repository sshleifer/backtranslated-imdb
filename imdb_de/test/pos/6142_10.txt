I like the earlier description of this movie as a life poem. I caught this by chance on the Movie Channel last night and was so intrigued that I could spend all the way with it. There is really only one unique voice in the film, a narrative poetry that is meaningful without falling into the claim. There are also many funny moments from Wirey's middle school days that are raw without humor on potty. It's sad that this movie is rated so bad. The fact that there are so many ones makes me think that the numbers are cooked. I can not see how anyone would consider the movie so miserable. Sure, this is by no means a typical romantic comedy, but it's a very unique look at a very unique life, a man whose attraction comes from his distance, a distance he must overcome before destroying it. Give this movie a chance. It came out of nowhere and I feel so much richer.
