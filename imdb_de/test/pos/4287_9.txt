Now we have this kind of movie weekly. Nowadays it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast. <br /> <br /> There are no explosions, car chases or car chases, there are implied sexual situations. This is not the case film for the younger crowd, It is for those who appreciate the people who talk to each other, they argue a lot because we have married a couple with problems in middle age. Emily Watson & Tom Wilkinson are apparently very happy middle-aged man and wife. Rupert Everett lives in this small suburb of London, handsome. He returns home to visit his wealthy father. He meets Emily Watson, of course. It would be easy for anyone to love Emily. I'm not saying any more, except there's a fatal accident happening at the beginning of the credits, the rest of the movie is about the effects of this accident and all the lies that tell the different characters. <br /> <br /> The acting of this trio and the others are excellent. Julien Fellows wrote the script after a novel by Nigel Balchin. He also directed, this was his first directorial effort and he did very well. The entire production is first class. <br /> <br /> The film had a few months of theatrical performance at the end of 2005, is under 80 movie theaters. This is a shame for me, stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens, but really good drams, as this and many others are only opened in a few. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are some very funny lines about certain situations <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
