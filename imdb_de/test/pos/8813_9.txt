I have a totally biased attitude, mainly because I live and enjoy the lifestyle of club culture. As a DJ and frequent clubgoer, I see the honesty in this movie and I love it. If you do not know the club / rave culture, this is a great push into this culture for those who do not know it first-hand. The honest presentation of human emotions and themes in the part of Jip that I loved. The characters were well constructed and I enjoyed this movie very much. I really do not like you having to write ten lines on this website. I will write at least 6 or 7, but I feel that I can represent my point with less than ten. Here are some extra lines to make the IMDb gods happy.
