In one of the best of Charlie Chaplin's longer short films, he places the Little Fellow in the trenches of the First World War, where he brings his unbearable courtesy and infinite patience into the drudgery of trench life where the troops lived for months before finally going over Tip to overtake the enemy, and usually to their death. It takes some of Chaplin's skill as a comedian to turn something as dreadful as Trench War into such a brilliant comedy, but the irony he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions highly amusing. All the best of Chaplin's films, short films, and more This film is full of brilliant and memorable scenes, such as the scene in which he kills with a piece of chalk on a board in the ditch, and one deletes when he gets it. Helmet shot off, the scene in which he and his comrades under Water sleeping, opening the beer bottle and lighting the cigarette and of course overtaking the enemy. All these scenes are show-stopper and remind of the most beautiful Chaplin scenes. This should not be missed!
