I think my husband and I are a bit slow. We usually do not warm up to a show until they are almost at the end of their production time. In that case, we did not start seeing KoQs until the sixth season. I'm not sure how our radar escaped for so long. Apart from the fact that we are not big fans of "appointment" televisions. Our schedules are such that we do not like watching shows every time they show up (and we did not have a DVR yet). I guess it was not that long before TBS made repetitions in their daily setup in the evenings, and we started watching consistently. <br /> <br /> When we became addicted, there were only a few seasons left before the series was canceled. But we still see it on TBS almost every day. I almost prefer seeing series in this way because you can see several episodes day to day, and this helps build continuity and what's going on with the characters without having to wait a whole week. But the episodes stand alone, that the stories are not transmitted from week to week. But that's good for me, because you can see an episode, then miss weeks - and still catch up. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that the writing was not always consistent. Some episodes would be outrageously funny, and others would be just a little funny. I am not sure if it was the quality of authors who had Seinfeld or Raymond. But I loved the casting and the characters are all very believable and realistic. Kevin James is just funny to watch! Although the plot is not great, James body language and expressions make the show worth seeing. Leah Remini is great as a "play it straight" woman. I think it's harder to play the straight character for laughs than the funny character, and she does a great job. She has a sense of sarcasm and insults like no one else. She is a tough cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie's father living with them in the basement? <br /> <br /> This is a great show and I was sorry when it was canceled. Many thanks to TBS for keeping the King alive in repeats!
