I have both read the book and seen the movie today. The story is so powerful that almost every screenplay or screenplay would do it justice. Not much there. However, this is still a beautiful movie because you can think and feel like the book. It's not like watching a documentary about a failed state and feeling sympathy for people suffering from a repressive regime. It's like watching the story of every other man across generations and continents. Amir's cowardice, his guilt, his dilemma, and finally the choice of a path of salvation could have been a story of ours. There is no infallible character to look up to, but all are gray, just like all of us. <br /> <br /> Another important finding is that the film documents life well by Afghans through the twenty years of turbulent political scenarios. The vibrant, carefree childhood of Kabul predates the Russian invasion, and the devastated, ruined remains of the city reflect what the Taliban did to it. <br /> <br /> The performers of the child earn "thumbs up" all the way. You can shame any mature actor. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie or read the book before, just go to the theater and remember that you will experience a multi-layered story on a multi-colored fabric of human emotions and feelings. This film should not arouse anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban feelings, but to feel the trials of human existence. <br /> <br /> I've read some of the external reviews that are linked to the site, and I have to admit that I'm not reading the point where you read reviews that summarize the story like a distant viewer and point out technical details about amazing cinematography or the like. At least for this film, one should try to connect with it instead of judging it objectively.
