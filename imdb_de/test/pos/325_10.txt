This movie is absolute gold. If you have not seen it, do it. Mani Ratnam surpasses again. This movie also introduced me to Nandita Das, although everyone in this movie is shining. I just regret that I have never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs. We are led from the jungles of northern Sri Lanka to the quiet beaches of southern India, from the terror of war to the final conquest of the love of the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, funny, with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer. This movie keeps on being seen again and again, and the story in the story, The Umbrella, is as well done as we look at the scene of drawings in a book Beautiful. Look at it.
