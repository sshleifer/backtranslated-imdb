The Lone Ranger was one of my childhood heroes, and I've never missed the opportunity to experience his adventures on Saturday morning in the mid-fifties. Somehow, however, this film came from me until I was able to catch up with him today thanks to my local library. I've been impressed with a number of elements throughout the story, because right from the start you'll have a new Lone Ranger theme song before you hear the traditional opening of the television program. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheels) in a nicely extended role, even though he takes his part of the lumps everywhere, being beaten and shot more than once. The most interesting of all is the ranger, who in some situations actually shoots to kill. His character is in contradiction to the vision created for the television series that he would never kill with his weapon just to hurt or protect him and others. <br /> <br /> Besides, you have a pretty traditional western adventure. The Ranger and Tonto are helping an Indian tribe whose members are being murdered by covert robbers trying to locate five medallions that together form the key to a fabulous treasure. Interestingly, the Evil Leader is an already wealthy woman disarmingly portrayed by Noreen Nash. Her best henchman is played by Douglas Kennedy, and it was no surprise to see Lane Bradford as one of the bad guys. Bradford's character was one of the men the Lone Ranger shot, which led me to wonder how many times this could have happened in the TV series. A quick glance revealed that he appeared fifteen times on the show "The Lone Ranger," while Kennedy appeared a total of six times. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this image is perhaps the attempt to portray Indians in a revisionist light, at a time when TV and movie westerns still represented the Reds largely as illiterate. The character of Dr. James Rolfe (Norman Fredric) is the most insightful in this regard; He is an Indian who received training and later became a doctor. He returned to the land of his tribe to take care of the needs of all citizens. For the purposes of history, he had to pose as a white man to be accepted by local ranchers. That was the hardest thing I could actually accept in terms of history, since Dr. Rolfe was the grandson of elder Chief Tomache (John Miljan). That nobody in the story except Paviva (Lisa Montell) knew that he really was an Indian, was a kind of stretching for me. I suppose it was possible that he left the tribe early, but without that extensive backstory it would not make sense to me that no one else in the tribe would know who he was. I do not know why I'm so fascinated, but After seeing and browsing more than two hundred Westerns on this site, I suddenly came across three films last month that were a blanket-pull gimmick like the one from Tonto's Scout Scout in this picture. Roy Rogers' trigger had a similar stunt in "Son of Paleface" from 1952, and I caught it again in 1958 in "The Big Country" by a horse named Old Thunder in that streak. It's kind of a comic relief in a situation that would not normally be for a horse, and it makes me curious now when the play was first made. I have to keep looking at old westerns. Not to be outdone, Silver had the chance to shine in the picture as well and salvaged an Indian baby to be used as a hostage by villain Brady. <br /> <br /> Speaking of gimmicks, Clayton Moore borrowed a tactic from the TV series when he disguised himself as a southern gentleman to smoke the villains posing as hoodlums. Whenever he did this in half an hour's format, it was always wise enough to hide his true features, usually with a beard like this. One of the more interesting episodes I remember had to do with the ranger who played an actor in the guise of Abraham Lincoln. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye out for a few fools I've discovered on the way. In an early scene at the opening, an Indian is shot dead by one of the undercover robbers, and in a close-up is blood on his shirt, but not a bullet hole. Later in the story, Ross Brady and Wilson rode the Indians after kidnapping one of the villains from prison. Brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the robbers, but he is immediately shown how he can escape with Wilson on horseback.
