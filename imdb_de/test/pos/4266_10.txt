This is a movie everyone who lives in Sweden should see. The film shows the political unrest that took place in Gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective. It includes interviews with the convicts, where after the riots these people get the first chance to tell their side of the story and why they think the world can be a much better place to live and part of it to be. I react emotionally when I see that, as I am just as angry as these people were treated both during the riots and after the riots. <br /> <br /> I hope that as many as possible will see this movie. How it really comes to mind: is that possible? In Sweden a democracy in 2001?
