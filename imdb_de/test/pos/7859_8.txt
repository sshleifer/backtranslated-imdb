This super-scary southern gothic melodrama shows Clint Eastwood as a wounded Confederation officer in the Civil War who was picked up and nursed by a rural girls' school. There is a strange clash between the sexes, in which the supposedly "dangerous" male part falls victim to a group of seemingly harmless women who prove to be just as brutal as the men who wage war on the fronts. This is a classic spider and the fly story, but here is a single fly and a whole bunch of spiders. Geraldine Page plays the headmistress of the school and she gives a typically sensational performance. Page was trained as a theater actress and shows it in all her performances. No matter what role she played, she has always been 100% committed to it and has never once renounced her character. So here it is, with this deadly spinner exploiting her sexual oppression against this helpless man. Each of the other girls also reacts in their own way. The two most prominent are the nasty girl, who can not wait to throw herself on him, and the virgin girl (played by the other than the affectionate Elizabeth Hartman?), Who pretends to faint if anyone else So much as I said the word "penis" would be to her. The schematic Madonna and the whore storyline would seem cumbersome if the movie did not scare you off and was so unsure what would happen next. <br /> <br /> The Most Memorable Scene in The Movie was made for me when the group of women did an amputation of Eastwood's leg that was infected with gangrene. Again, the allusion to spider and fly is clear: they hobble him so much that it is much harder for him to escape from their net. <br /> <br /> A classic cooler. Not a great movie, but a morbidly entertaining one. <br /> <br /> Note: A-
