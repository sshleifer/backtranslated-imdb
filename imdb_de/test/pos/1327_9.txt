I've heard that the sequels are going downhill after the first Oceans movie. I think that's not the case (at least not for this movie). This movie is even better than the first movie! The original crew returns three years after successfully robbing Terry Benedict's casinos. Now Benedict visits each of them personally and tells them that they should get the money back within two weeks. In order to achieve this, they have to make some raids in Europe to get the money. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. The All-Star cast exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some confusing moments in this film. But that does not matter, since there are only a few confusing moments. In any case, this movie is just for harmless fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great heirloom movie. I rate this movie at 9/10.
