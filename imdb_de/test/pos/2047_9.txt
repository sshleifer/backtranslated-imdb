Rent this, I own the DVD and got it for $ 9.99. A theft that is so undervalued. Sure, there are better films. Movies with fewer or no holes in action or action. But I do not have the problem with this movie. If a movie stays true to itself and exploits its mistakes (and obviously does!) In the name of the conversation, then it has served its purpose. I took care of it because it was important to the creators. The entire film is absurd from beginning to end, but the makers took the whole thing seriously, and I did not feel manipulated to take the movie seriously. And that's so true because I want to take every movie seriously and still let many, oh so many, abandon me. Despite all his distaste, this movie is almost perfect and absolutely entertaining! What a funny script! It has also become incredibly relevant given the events of September 11th. In no way do I want to minimize the loss. But this film contains the tradition of the WTC collapse, before it happened in a way we would never see if the movie had been made after these events. "" Would not you agree? "
