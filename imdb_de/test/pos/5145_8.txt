It's great to see a movie starring kids whose notion of "actors" is not sensual. Instead, these children see a problem in their community and take responsibility for solving this problem. Hoot is a movie aimed directly at families looking for a fun day in the cinema. The production values ​​are good, especially at Montana and Florida. The soundtrack by Jimmy Buffet fits perfectly. The young actors are spirited and refreshing. <br /> <br /> The story of a trio of children working together to rescue some burrowing owls by an unscrupulous pancake house builder will engage children. So many movies make children seem unconscious, it's nice to see a movie that shows how kids work hard to make a difference. And though parents are absent or temporarily distracted, it has been pleasant to see children following in their parents' footsteps and trying to correct injustices. <br /> <br /> If you have enough of the selfish story lines about children filling the movie theater, Hoot will give you a chance. Then spend some time talking to your children about the adventure, serving others, and taking care of the world in which they live. A positive message from a positive movie.
