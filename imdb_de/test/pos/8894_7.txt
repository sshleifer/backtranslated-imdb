Owen loves his mom ... only he would love her better in this dark, laughing comedy, both stars and directed by Danny DeVito, with admirable helpers from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the title role <br /> <br /> "Throw Momma From The Train" is a terrific comedy, even if it's not a great movie. It is partly too shallow and the end feels less organic than pinned. But it's a great trip, and Crystal and DeVito use great screen chemistry as they pinpoint their own comic to be a fighting writer (DeVito is a passionate but untalented artist, Crystal is blocked and bitter) <br /> Crystal's Professor Donner believes his ex-wife has stolen his book (the unfortunate "Hot Fire") and can not write more than the opening line of his next book, which is not easy. He teaches creative writing lessons for aspiring mediocrities, including a middle-aged woman who writes Tom Clancy-style fiction but does not know what the submarine captain is talking about; and a upholsterer who wants to write his life story. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughing minutes on screen, a quirky jerk who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus, "100 Girls I Like Pork." <br /> <br /> Then there is DeVito's Owen Lift, who calls himself Professor Donner's "star pupil" even though the teacher does not read his classroom work. Owen is a somewhat unusual character in a movie, a 30's man-child living with his overbearing mother Anne Ramsey, who calls him "Lardass" and other lovable feelings. In any other movie we would apologize to Owen, but "Throw Momma From The Train" puts the cruelty of life on this sad sack of laughter and expects us to join in. That's a big reason why this movie is likely to lose a lot of people. <br /> <br /> For those of us who enjoy the humor of this character, even identify with him and the rest of what we see here, as Lark, it's not such a big stretch to deal with the bigger one Gambit to join this comedy, and challenges us to look at each other in amusement, while Owen claims the help of Professor Donner in a plan to kill his mother. In fact, he first goes to Hawaii to kill Thunder's hated ex, then tells the professor it's his turn to kill Mrs. Lift and "swap murders," as seen in Hitchcock's "Strangers On A Train." , <br /> <br /> As a director, DeVito not only completes the productions of his actors, but sets scenes that accentuate dialogue. He makes some bold visual statements, and adds a little amusing unreality to keep the audience on their toes (and not to take things too seriously). Writer Stu Silver also helps makes laughter laugh with his talkable chatter. "They have rats the size of Oldsmobiles here." "She's not a woman ... she's the terminator." "A little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper." These are all Crystal's words, but some of the funniest lines that only work in context but absolutely kill are DeVitos and Ramseys. Apparently, according to IMDb, Silver has never written a script again, and that's a shame because he had real talent for it. <br /> <br /> The best scene in this movie when Crystal Ramsey meets was actually used In its entirety as a theatrical "coming attraction" presentation, I have only seen one movie so advertised. Owen introduces his mother's professor as "Cousin Patty," and when Momma says he does not have cousin Patty, panicky Owen loses it. "They lied to me," he roars, banging the Professor's forehead with a pan. <br /> <br /> In reality, the professor would not actually groan something funny from the floor, but 'litter Momma From The Train works effectively at such moments, playing out his Looney Tunes mood. Of course, DeVito has not disappeared from movies, but it's a mystery why he did not really pursue the directorial promise of this movie. Maybe it's because, as 'Throw Momma From The Train' shows lack of mainstream success, his kind of vision is not for everyone. That's too bad for those of us who can see it and like it over and over again.
