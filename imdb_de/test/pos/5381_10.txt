"Brotherhood of Satan" is one of the most underrated horror movies of all time. Why he did not achieve cult status is a mystery to me. This is a shattering story of terror and witchcraft that contains one of the most powerful and disturbing highlights in the world The Annals of Screen Horror. In the American town some children have disappeared and their parents have been forcibly murdered. What is the cause of hysteria? The movie is really scary, some scenes are genuinely confusing and will not be forgotten. Acting is really good and the climax is bizarre and disturbing. Look at this forgotten jewel of satanic horror. Highly Recommended.
