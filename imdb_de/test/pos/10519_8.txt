I tried for years to remember the name of this movie. Read today, 03/09/2005, where the name of Stacy Keach was mentioned, and recalled that in 1974 I saw a movie in which he was at the Atlanta Film Festival and found The Gravy Train. We should see Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they could not show it and instead replaced The Gravy Train. We were terribly disappointed that we could not see the much outraged Duddy Kravitz, and had not heard of The Gravy Train, and since none of it was heard We were pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was, and as I recall it was pretty humorous. I would like to find it on tape.
