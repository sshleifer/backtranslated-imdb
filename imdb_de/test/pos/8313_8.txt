Tomorrow Is Another Day is NOT the sequel to Gone with the Wind, but a love story and a surprisingly alert and moving story. For an alleged hack that dispenses with B-minus features like The Devil Thumbs A Ride, Felix Feist proves that he does his job with unexpected, imaginative details. Steve Cochran leaves the prison after 18 years when he killed his brutal father at the age of 13, and now he is still a timid, wavering adolescent moving in a man's limp body. Lonesome, he visits a 10-cent dance palace and falls in love with brass and seizes Ruth Roman. But the sudden shooting of her police-beloved friend causes the unpaired couple to take to the streets and ends up like the Joads in a Californian migrant labor camp. <br /> <br /> Roman is the revelation; In her best-known role, as Farley Granger's fianc√© in Hitchcock's stranger on a train, she became ill and understaffed. Here she modulates convincingly from blond taxi dancer to the sacrifice of wife and expectant mother (and a brunette). Cochran is almost as good, he vacillates between the suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of a subordinate man. The end is not convincing, but still welcome. Together with They Live By Night and Gun Crazy, Tomorrow Is Another Day shows a redemptive sweetness and warmth that believes in his film noir pedigree.
