As an adult, I'm grateful to have accidentally caught this movie as a teenager. During this time I had family problems. With this film, I was able to capture what I saw from a locked world. How much peer pressure is too big? I actually had to buy this movie because it reached me at a level unlike most movies that try to reach an audience. How far can an individual achieve social acceptance? Who is the "bad" mass? Teenagers struggle to find answers to these questions, but ultimately ... who is the "pack leader" if there is one? Is it the strong one? The beautiful? Maybe the person we all seem to like? Could it be the moral character? As far as the movie is concerned, the cast worked together as if it were predestined. I just hope more directors and producers are trying to do a job that will reach us all as this film has reached me. I wish I could vote higher than ten because that title deserves much more.
