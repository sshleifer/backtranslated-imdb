OK, OK, I have to say, I was impressed. It's hard to say what impresses me the most: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy, lest I erase my eyes or the movie itself. In any case, "Hitch" was pretty good. Hey, it was good enough for me to look twice. Will Smith was funny and good. Kevin James was just funny and absolutely essential to the movie. Just as this movie was about Hitch (Will Smith), it's not the same without Kevin James. <br /> <br /> The story is: Hitch is a matchmaker who helps the guy win the girl. His job is to give the girl a chance to see the guy if he would not otherwise. After the encounter, the rest is all for the guy to make or break the relationship. He works only on transfer and remains largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is Hitch's project this time, and Albert has Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta), a Paris Hilton character. As this plot unfolds, Hitch himself has his eyes fixed on Sara (Eva Mendes), a sharp, independent, failed gossip columnist who wants nothing to do with a relationship. <br /> <br /> The two stories make for fun moments and you tie up for a bit of swamp. Of course, there is no love story without the obligatory misunderstandings, misunderstandings or misadventures that chase the guy who is chasing after the girl. Luckily, they make it short and unhappy. Hitch was a fun and funny movie that went very well and rolled smoothly.
