Almenábar once again provided us with a film of the highest quality. This director is amazing and has proven to be equally talented and effective when crossing genres. <br /> <br /> The film's excellent character development, through dialogue and personality disorders, but also with more subtle details (Ramon's fatherly gaze), allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very well and recognize the importance and importance of the film emotional impact of the events that take place is the deeper. The visuals are sometimes simple, sometimes breathtaking (the dream to the beach), and I think that Almenábar's films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music - it fits in perfectly with the different moods of the film. <br /> <br /> More than just a film about euthanasia, which is an important topic in and of itself, it is about the duality of a man who sometimes seems to truly enjoy life (albeit to a very limited extent ), and yet one who does not manage to die of his desire. The overwhelming sadness of the film is underscored by timed jokes of humor, all the funnier as they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy that you will surely feel. This film is an excellent work that represents the countless views of Ramon's friends and family. Worst of all, Ramon's father said, desperately, "There is only one thing worse than losing a child, that the child wants to die." <br /> <br /> 10/10.
