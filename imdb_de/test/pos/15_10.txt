Like others who have commented on the Web ... I am a 130-year-old Coast Guard pilot. After saying that and being a skeptic I am expecting the exaggerated cheese factors. There was some cheese, but overall not much ... and the movie was pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> I watched the trailer again today. After watching the movie yesterday, it became clear to me that the trailer gave the impression that the movie was just salvation after rescue scenes. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The movie is really more character / story than action. The internal struggles that both Costner and Kutcher deal with. Kutcher's film reveals itself further in a movie as Costner's film. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a little love story ... no surprise. Most of the time, however, the film tells of two lives that come together and after a while help each other to heal old wounds. <br/> <br/> As girly as it sounds, Costner and so much I try not to like him. Kutcher works really well together and complements the film very well. <br /> <br /> As critics have said, you've seen it all before ... Top Gun, Officer and Gentleman, etc. But which movie has not been rebuilt a million times? <br /> <br /> I can only remember one F-word being spoken ... and not really remembering another language. <br /> <br /> The movie lasts more than two hours, and for some it may end up a bit long. <br /> <br /> You'll laugh, you can cry, but I can honestly say it was worth the $ 4 I paid. <br /> <br /> I hope you like the movie.
