Part of Hick's "Revelations" and other stand-up gigs are featured in this documentary about the life and comedy of Bill Hicks. It also includes interviews with comedians and industry people who knew him, as well as reporters and journalists talking about how his political commentary was crude and brutal. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. I had already seen "Revelations", but the comedy clips were still refreshing. It's a nice balance of comedy and documentary that will explain Hick's popularity to non-fans and those who are already familiar with him. <br /> <br /> I rated it at ten.
