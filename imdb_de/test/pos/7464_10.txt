My friends and I only rented this movie to satisfy a friend who had hired to rent it, though he had no idea what it was about. We all thought it was like "a Canadian American pie," but when we saw it, we were completely surprised, we were all dumb throughout the movie and loved it! It was nothing like American Pie and had a conspiracy that teen girls will surely love (as the guy gets the crap out of him at the end). After that night, he became my favorite movie, not just for the conspiracy, but for the actors and the great writing. There was not a moment when I thought it was unbelievable. For anyone living in a small city with small perspectives, everything is very realistic and understandable. I absolutely love this movie and would recommend you to rent it the next time, if you have a chance, it's worth it.
