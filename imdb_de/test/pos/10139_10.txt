Spoiler !!! To understand what happened first, you have to be a warrior, stay alive in real war, think offline, analytical, critical, and not linear. Otherwise, you will come to the wrong conclusion that Maj.Gray was a dumb or unstable person. Truth is something completely different. He was a hardened veteran and the only way he could be killed by Captain O'Malley is because he wants her to kill him. It was his way out. He chose it. He was not a man who will retire. If you have never been in a first line, you can not understand it. He purposely prepares his suicide. First, he seduced Mary Jane, when she purposely acted as stupid, as a step-by-step argument - to close witnesses' cases (to protect her later, after she had done what she asked her to do when it came to trial), then she admitted reassuring her son that he could later charge her weapon) came that night, loaded her weapon, woke her up, put her weapon in her hands, acted as he attacked her after he had fired the first time, he raised a knife and shouting "One Kill", so he shot him again and before he died, he stuck the knife off, as if he wanted to bring him back after the first shot. He also gave her a message with his last cry. "After the first killing, everything in your head will change and destroy your life, this is the only way for me to die as a man, but to be killed by someone I love is my choice. War and army are not what you've thought before, grow up and save your life until you can. "She left the military life in the end. She understood him. And he did not die in vain. The man who helped him prepare everything and afterwards to conduct the trial and the outcome of that trial was Colonel Sam Doran with the help of Lt. Tim Macy. Macy did not know what was really going on and what the result would be, but he did what was expected of him. He took photos of Mary Jane and Maj.Gray on behalf of Col. Sam Doran, who gave this order because Maj.Gray had asked him. After refusing to leave the army (as Col. Doran had asked her to do), Col. Doran persuaded the prosecutor to charge her with deliberate murder (he knew she could not be found quilty) rather than manslaughter (there were a way to be quilty). with recorded photos. Col.Doran also suppresses the suppression of the reasoning in order to prevent the prosecutor having doubts about deliberate murder charges, but it should be revealed during the trial, which greatly influenced the jury. I have no doubt about the outcome of this process. Why did Colonel Doran do that? Because he will do whatever Maj.Gray asks him to do. Why? Because he saved his life on a battlefield. Why does Mary Jane choose to go to court? Because she was a person who has integrity, a principle. That's why Maj.Gray chose her. It must be someone who deserves, someone who is honorable. She keeps his secret about what really happened that night and also proves her honor. Miroslav
