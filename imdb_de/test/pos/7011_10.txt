It's weird how the time has passed and never seen this movie ... until last week, when I was enchanted. I have seen it twice in a week and it still was not enough. It's a great movie and I'll love to see it again. The story is great and really moved me. I would love to live such a story. The actors are great, as well as the music and you can dream of your own love story. I just hope that one day I will be able to dance like Johnny and Baby. I have the feeling that dance connects people and brings them together. I think people should learn to dance ... it helps a lot, especially in a relationship. It's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body.
