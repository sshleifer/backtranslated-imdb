This movie makes different nods to different science fiction films. The prologue reminds me of the original version of THX-1138 (the trailer for BUCK ROGERS, here were clips from an early Japanese SF television program). When the city was first taken in 2345, the dragon flies over it with a billboard and immediately reminds BLADERUNNER. The BLADERUNNER aspect is even more pronounced when we meet the hero who is referred to as the replicant (he is blond and is called Ryo, a homage to Roy Batty, Rutger Hauer's character in BLADERUNNER?). Soon a fight scene follows, immediately reminiscent of THE MATRIX. The government that forces the population into drug use is like THX-1138 and the Chief Enforcer, while looking like a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd, turns out to be a robot, much like the TERMINATOR. The final battle is reminiscent of TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is hilarious. Probably not one of the best SF movies on the market, but he is pleasing, certainly much more enjoyable than trips like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.
