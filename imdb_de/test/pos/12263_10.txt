I say sadly, because if you watch this movie now, you realize how deep our media has sunk - all the warning signs in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, I think, the last great James Brooks movie, but others can not agree. It has rich characters (which are also believable), great acting, great writing, and although the music was a bit cheesy, I actually liked it. William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is amazing. And Albert Brooks walks away with every scene he finds himself in this triangle of people, beautifully drawn and captivating, and has made the whole movie about his vital and important topic of the news and how it is slowly being compromised in our nation. <br /> <br /> See this with NETWORK for a really entertaining and frightening evening.
