a scary real drama, there is no drama out there that scared me so much. The characters are not typical Islamic terrorists. They have a blond, blue-eyed guy as stupid as he looks. He's a converted Muslim. A respected businessman pretending to be Jewish, and a Frenchman converted to Islam who has clearly taken the word of the Koran to a whole new level. The hero of the conspiracy is Darwyn, a covert FBI agent who has infiltrated the terror cell and has to do all sorts of dreadful things for the god to prevent him from being discovered. The first episode is a little taste of what should follow. Although they are Islamic terrorists, the drama has a unique opportunity to point out that not all Muslims are extremists, which is reassuring for those involved in racism, considering that half of the terrorist cell is Islam-converted To be scared of. The most horrible drama I have ever seen. The reason why it's so cold is that you never know who your friends, husband, or neighbors really are. Terrorists can be anywhere, anytime.
