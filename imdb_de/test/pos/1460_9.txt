There are only a few films that you can call "must see", and SHEPHERED is one of those films. In many ways, it was ahead of its time (and one can say that it was a source of inspiration for several well-known films) The story is complex, but unfolds as a tense but often amusing thriller that ponders the nature of humanity stimulates. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people live underground and chaos reigns. C. Thomas Howell is a "shepherd" who protects the population for various religious leaders by killing all inappropriate members of society. The whole idea made me think about our society. It's really a brilliant social comment, which is more than I can say for some current science fiction / action blockbusters. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS did not feel like a real innovation was happening, just boring video game effects. But SHEPHERD also scores on the action scale ... <br /> <br /> This movie does not make the viewer even take a breath. Peter Hayman proves to be one of the few ingenious action directors. We speak of 100% high grade kung fu fighting! It was excellent. Really good special effects, shootouts, dark futuristic cyberpunk noir style? The movie really has its own elements. <br /> <br /> When talking about SHEPHERD, you can not say what style it has. The vision of this city is really breathtaking. It is reminiscent of Tim Burton's memorable vision of Gotham in BATMAN. And these sights are photographed by Graeme Mears with a degree of skill that shames Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall. Even the special effects were amazing. Undoubtedly, the scenes in which fighting is a milestone in all areas of filmmaking. This film is a ballet with an impressive visual representation. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, there is an interesting story, which is supported by a strong cast. The acting (especially Rowdy Piper) and the plot are great and superbly directed. Unlike many futuristic films made with a strong, artificial taste, the characters are believable and the dialogue is natural and witty. I'm always proud to see a great movie like SHEPHERD. It's a shame that it was not distributed well and did nothing at the box office. It is a rarity to look for. This movie will impress you and you'll feel 10 times cooler when you've seen it!
