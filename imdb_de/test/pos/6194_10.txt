I found this show by accident and was surprised to learn that nobody I know ever heard of it. This was by far one of the best shows I've seen in months, if not years, and I can not wait for more episodes to appear. Sleeper Cell describes a psychological struggle of a covert agent within a terror cell, who must constantly make difficult decisions in order to keep his cover while remaining true to his true cause. This is a very successful show. It keeps you fascinated from the first episode to the very end, and although slow, it's fast enough to feel marginal. Realistically and humane, it touches on important topics and each episode poses an interesting question to think about. This show is not 24 or any of the cop shows on TV and also tries to be nothing. It is real and unique. It's a show about a man, his difficult choices and his life in combat, where a simple mistake can cost him everything. excellent music and realistic characters, each with a story to tell.
