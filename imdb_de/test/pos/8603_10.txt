Black Rain is a great movie, but watch out for the DVDs that are currently being sold for up to $ 300 apiece. I have the DVD and it is terrible. Very small non-anamorphic image that needs to be resolved. Acceptable sound. This is a primitive DVD that needs to be re-released. Incidentally, I also own the Laserdisc and Black Rain VHS. The VHS is a big step up from the DVD! And the laserdisc has by far the best picture of all? Subtitle in black, sharp, big picture, simple but very good soundtrack. Buy the VHS and avoid the absurd prices that these cheaters charge!
