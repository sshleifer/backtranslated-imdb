One Night at McCool's is a very funny movie that is smarter than it should be. Its shape is more sophisticated than I expected and the randomness was excellent. The thoughts behind the film (myogenesis, sadism, stupid men) are infantile. I have to say to this film that he not only hates women but also abhors men. There is really no compassion for one of the men. It seems so because of the shape, but the end says it all. Nobody cares. <br /> <br /> The first 2/3 of the movie was told by three Flashback characters: Dillon, the stupid bartender; Reiser, the mysogenistic stupid lawyer; and Goodman, the stupid, holier than you cop. History is therefore always perverted by their own self-images and altered realities. Reiser's BBQ fantasy is a great thing. In the end, we never really know the truth and nothing is what it seems. Dillon has never been so innocent. <br /> <br /> Actually, the rest of the movie is funny too. From the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the film to the all-too-obvious manipulation of Tyler, the film seems to have its own energy. Everything is just out of the blue and nothing seems to make sense. Is it really important to us, if so? No. <br /> <br /> It's also a very dark comedy, but has a flat presentation. Think of Sister Betty or Jawbreaker. On the outside very covered with sweets, dark inside tough. If you have your movies random, dark or just plain mean, watch this movie. This will satisfy your wishes for the strangeness that is One Night at McCool. <br /> <br /> 8/10
