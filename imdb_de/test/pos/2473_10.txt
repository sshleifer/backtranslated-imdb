I can not believe I missed this. Made in 1970 on a budget that could probably make you an indifferent episode of a TV soap, this is 90 minutes long and sharp as a knife movie. You will find the outlines, the plot, etc. elsewhere on this website. Remember, however, that the whole thing was shot with a single 16mm handheld camera ... all the dialogues are improvised ... none of the "actors" appeared in front of a camera ... That sounds like a disaster recipe. Instead, we get hippies against cops running around in the California desert, which turns into a "that's not fair." I am in the scenario of this person. The only problem is that the director gets you to postpone your loyalty, and after 90 minutes we're still not sure who has one. Brilliant ... Pretty brilliant.
