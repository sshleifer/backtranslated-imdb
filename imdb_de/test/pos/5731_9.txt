This program was very interesting. The way the program was displayed made it all the more interesting. The string theory is also very interesting to hear. The whole three hours were worth it in my opinion. I enjoyed listening to the ideas of the physicists. Extra dimensions overwhelm the mind. If you have the chance, look at this amazing documentation.
