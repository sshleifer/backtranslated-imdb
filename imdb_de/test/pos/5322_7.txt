One wonders about the state of a society that produces a father like Albert T. Fitzgerald, whom we meet for the first time in an airplane, as he approaches the place he had left long ago, and where he is a woman and has left behind a child who is accused of murdering a mentally handicapped boy. When we first see him, he found a headline in the newspaper that reads the woman in front of him. Rather rude, he asks her if he has the newspaper, and the lady offers other departments. Well, that's not what he asked. The woman wants her to give him the front section she reads. Matthew Ryan Hoge wrote and directed the director of this disturbing film, which in many ways reflects our society as it is today. In fact, Mr. Hoge points out exactly what's wrong with that. <br /> <br /> The film shows Leland, a teenager who can not even distinguish between fantasy and reality. It is obvious that killing a person, even the sweet and innocent boy who has done nothing to earn it, has fatal consequences, not only for himself, but also for his own family and the family of the slain boy. In fact, Leland seems to have no idea what motivated him to commit the crime because he shows no remorse. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that Leland was traumatized by his parents' divorce. His own father is a distant man who is no less interested in him. It is Pearl, the teacher of the juvenile detention center, who wants to see and help the uproar inside the young man, but unfortunately he has no chance. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. The ensemble cast is doing a good job under the direction of Mr. Hoge. Kevin Spacey has a good chance to play the selfish father of the accused murderer, and makes us abhor him as arrogant idiots. <br /> <br /> Although the film is a bit long, the film leaves more questions than the answers.
