This movie starts at the end and ends at the beginning. In the middle is a collection of comedy, philosophy, music, observations, commentary, mini-stories, colors and much more. It looks at the world and our lives and tells the story of The Monkees from the point of view of the group members. It also watches TV and movie and makes a visual comment. It also shocks with theaters of war and shows how we are only farmers in a big game. It says all that and much more, but if you do not look at it objectively, you do not see much more than scenes strung together to connect the music. It's a kind of movie that can never get boring because it's so clever.
