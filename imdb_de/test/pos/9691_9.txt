I would give this movie 8.5 or 9. I thought it was just funny. I do not know how to make this movie funny, but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was a bit too much rough stuff. Personally, I think when they leave motorcycles and things are a lot funnier, but I'm sure there are people who think the other things are very funny. That's not my decision, but it's still a great movie, and after that it should be fine if you do not like this movie, that's fine, because I'm sure there are a lot of people who think that this movie shows how downgrade of our society is or whatever my personal opinion is and you have your opinion. Also, the Jackass Box Set is definitely worth a download or purchase or whatever you do to get your videos
