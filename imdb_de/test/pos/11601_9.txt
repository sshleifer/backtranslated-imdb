It is very difficult to portray a Tagore novel by cinematographic lines. And if you forget an obscure production from 1967, then Chokher Bali emerged for the first time on a large scale. Overall, the sets looked fantastic, with the right accents for a successful period drama. Prasenjit, accustomed to doing gross commercial things, made good efforts. I saw the Bengali version and found that Aishwariya's voice was dubbed, which somewhat eased her dialogue readiness. The director has done a good job and depicted each of the characters with finesse, but there was little sense of meaningful conspiracy, probably the story itself was missing. However, the development of the characters, including those with supporting roles, seems to be the strongest point. It is difficult to turn some Tagore stories into movies, as only the visual parts seem to be realized.
