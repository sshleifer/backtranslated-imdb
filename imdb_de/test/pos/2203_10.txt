Although video technology may be outdated, this classic piece of music, now on DVD, is the best version of Sondheim's most important and sophisticated work on Broadway. If you've never seen SWEENEY TODD, you'll need to buy this DVD. I saw this production in November 1980 at the Kennedy Center in Washington - and fell in love with a penultimate "Murder She Wrote" Angela Lansbury. Then I tried to find all her work, including: MOVIES: The Harvey Girls, The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Manchurian Candidate; CDs: "Mame", "Dear World" and "Gypsy"; and many more. The rest of the cast is also impeccable. All in all, this wonderful DVD gives us the final version of the Sondheim Opera!
