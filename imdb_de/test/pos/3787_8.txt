SPOILERS BELOW <br /> <br /> 'A Dog's Life' was especially noteworthy for his excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other film "Shoulder Arms" from 1918, the silent film genius focuses on a completely different kind of humor. His wartime comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin commands unprecedented creativity and composition. When the soldier's bunker is flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can perform his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier disguises himself as a tree, a disguise that taunts Chaplin much more ingenuity and stupidity. Of course, when the enemy discovers his cunning, the soldier shoots straight into the forest. The subsequent hunt is a visual wonder: Chaplin not only hides the soldier in front of the Germans, he also uses the forest to mask the soldier in front of the audience so that the camouflaged soldier stands unblocked in the middle of the frame and still somehow remains invisible. Meanwhile, we thought our little hero would make a quick attack on the German army. to our delight is also the joke about us. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
