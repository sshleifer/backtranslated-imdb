It seems Hack has been described as unrealistic ... but that is television. The television is to escape from everyday life, and I find that Hack makes a great job in this regard. Add to this the slow process of uncovering its past and interesting / interesting conspiracies; They just do not seem to get enough. And with such great actors as David Morse, Andre Braugher and even little Mathew Borish, what more can you ask for? So, if you're looking for an engaging experience and a liking for "underdog" characters, I suggest giving Hack a chance, especially now that he's finally getting out of his feet.
