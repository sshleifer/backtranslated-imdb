Huge fun both as a movie and as an excuse to sit back and play the 'oh, this is Whassis Name' game. Every star of the golden age of English movies seems to be in this movie and it was a pleasure to see them. And the biggest of them, Richard Wattis, was as gorgeous as ever. <br /> <br /> There is indeed an action that looks very nice, there are also some great jokes and funny moments, but the key to the triumph of this movie is the characters in it. Alastair Sim is great and somehow convinces you that a six-foot, fucking-legged Scot can be the headmistress of a girls' boarding school. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl all have their moments, but with Alastair and Richard, Joyce Grenfell is the star of the show. It's an absolute one-off and brings a smile to the screen when she's on the screen ... Her Rolling Walk and plum accent are performed perfectly. <br /> <br /> And for those who play this game you can even see Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle, if you look closely.
