I am glad that I first read the Sarah Waters novel, since I had my own pictures of the characters in my head. However, casting for this production was not at all disappointing - in fact, after getting used to Rachael Stirling as Nan, Nina Gold has done a damned good job in the casting department, in my opinion. (Can Keeley Hawes be more delicious?) <br /> <br /> The BBC has made it again: This is a wonderful production of a very good book, and they have done it in style. If you can get this (VHS, DVD) in your hands, you should definitely buy the 181-minute version (the uncensored). It is a wonderful trip, if sometimes a bit rocky, which you will not regret.
