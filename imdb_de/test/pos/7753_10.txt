Superficially, TMHS seems to be another generic high school drama. But surprisingly, it hides immense depth, originality and eccentricities that not only make it memorable for the viewer, but also undeniably make it one of the best animes that the medium has spawned in recent years. <br /> We see the world through the Eyes of Kyon, who meets Haruhi Suzumiya on his first day in high school, a girl who willfully provokes the rest of the class to have no interest in "normal people" and in topping them off randomly charging aliens, time travelers, Sliders or Espers to meet with her. Kyon stares in disbelief and wonders if she is joking or has a few screws. Despite all the instincts he defied, he begins to talk to her. It quickly becomes clear that she is no ordinary high school girl. Not too long after that, she creates her own appropriately named "SOS Brigade" school club and pulls Kyon among other extremely unhappy people. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this anime conforms to the usual standard conventions, Kyon the protagonist is an overly cynical pessimist and contributes a witty narrative to the show. A distance from the usual male 2D main characters that tend to populate the medium. The episodes themselves are not chronological, forcing the viewer to think about evolving events and their relationship to past events. This is a stroke of genius; The effect is like a jigsaw puzzle. When a new piece is laid, we get a bigger picture of the bigger picture. Previous scenes are now given completely new meanings, and their realization is deeply satisfying. This, however, means that it feels unconnected (it is anything but), a cleverly written script has bypassed this problem and ensured that it flows smoothly from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The story itself is strikingly original, but I go no further than the simple outline of the bare bones I gave before, as it will undoubtedly spoil it for you. However, what I would like to mention is that the storyline covers a variety of genres, from comedy to sci-fi. How they managed to achieve this within fourteen episodes is a mystery to me and undoubtedly a great achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> TMHS is a true gem that has such diversity and depth that it appeals to just about anyone who is interested in anime. You see, this is something unusual that does justice to - and even surpasses - the tremendous hype it has received.
