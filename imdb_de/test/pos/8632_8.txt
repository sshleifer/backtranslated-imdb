Abbott and Costello's talents shine in the happy, childlike version of "Jack and the Beanstalk". The use of sepia tones and colors, music and choreography, song and dance, the transfer of players from one character to another, and various other aspects of this very good film make it clear that the techniques and styles used in "The Wizard of The Wizard "Oz is played here. And that works well for our intrepid duo. There are certain other things that make this movie a pleasure for me ... Buddy Baers, Max Baer Jr. of Uncle "The Beverly Hillbillies", performing as a cop and giant. Pat Costello, Lou's brother, was involved in writing the script. These things make this movie fun. However, it has a dark side. I think the choreography is done badly. The cute melodies and the associated vocals, however, help to affect the rather sloppy dance numbers. Some of the players, or rather the couple in love (prince and princess), are not very good at trading. But these things are a small price to pay for an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable walk through the yellow stone ... uh, I mean ... climb up the beanstalk.
