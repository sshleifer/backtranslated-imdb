I was pleasantly surprised to see this movie as a small preview in my local theater. <br /> <br /> We've all seen this action (Top Gun, GI Jane, an officer and a gentleman), but good script still works. Essentially, this story is about training a Coast Guard Rescue Team with a few side stories. Kevin Costner plays with Ben Randall a highly successful leader of the rescue team, who is forced to lead the training team after a tough mission. The film takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the Costner character and Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher. I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this part. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this movie, and you'll probably see what happens long before it arrives. The use of humor, exploring the resilience of the training and the fun of seeing Ben Randall "doing his own thing as a coach" fascinated and thoroughly entertained me. I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the whole audience laugh, gasps here and there, and in the end it pays tribute to the movie. <br /> <br /> We all had a good time (despite a couple) of hard moments in the movie) and I think you will too.
