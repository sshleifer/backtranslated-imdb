This movie is a refreshing change from the thoughtless Hong Kong triads that made me so tired. There are no spectacular firearms. No chases. And practically only minimal action. The audience is for the most part kept in suspense, although certain aspects of the so-called "trick" of Andy Lau are evident. <br /> <br /> The film was referred to as a departure from the genre of violent triad films and as a "smart" thriller. To a certain extent it is so. To some extent, however, the test of credibility persists. It's hard to imagine that a Triad member is dumb enough not to see through the female disguise of Andy Lau in a second. It also appeared that "if someone was seriously ill, someone is supposed to spit out plenty of blood," which Chinese films seem to be all the time. <br /> <br /> The subtle relationship between the two main characters is a refreshing change. <br /> <br /> All in all an entertaining movie, even though the concept is not new and there are few surprises. >
