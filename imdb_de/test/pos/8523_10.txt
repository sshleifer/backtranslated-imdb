In 1983 two Bond films were shot, one was the official Bond movie Octopussy starring Roger Moore, who starred in Live and Let Die as James Bond for the first time, and the other was the unofficial Bond film Never Say Never Again starring Sean Connery Role as James Bond for the first time in dr. No. This movie was also the first 007 James Bond movie to be shot. Never Say Never Again is called unofficial because the company that made the other James Bond films did not do so. Never Say Never Again is also a remake of the 1965 007 Thunderball. There are several differences in Never Say Never Again that let you know that it was not made by EON. One thing is that the opening is different, there is no rifle barrel sequence and no pre-credit sequence, another difference is the music score. Some things in this movie feel like a James Bond movie like the gadgets and cars, and James Bond always has to do with the ladies, and the movie has a lead song. Sean Connery is still doing great work in Bond, the acting of the other stars is also great. <br /> <br /> Never Say Never Again is a good movie that's just entertaining as an official James Bond movie. Look at that. 10/10
