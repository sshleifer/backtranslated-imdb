What can I say? The BBC only expects the best in drama. MESSIAH is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> MESSIAH is a great thriller, a really shocking and scary story about a serial killer who cuts off the tongues of the victims and replaces them with silver spoons. Police officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team are tasked with solving the mystery of seemingly random events before more lives are lost. <br /> <br /> But be warned - despite rating "15" (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a cruel movie. Some of the murder scenes are similar to those in SE7EN, and one or two can really cause stomach pain. But if you can resist that, sit back in your chair and enjoy ... though you're most likely on the edge of it or hiding behind it. <br /> <br /> Rated by the BBFC with '15' moderate violence and strong horror.
