I saw Anatomy when it came out and bought it recently and the sequel from 2003. Since I watch a lot of foreign films in different genres, you have to watch movies in their original language. It's not only annoying to know that the voices do not belong to the actors, but they always look happy, as if the whole movie was a big, long toothpaste commercial or something. This makes a great movie horrible and I had to convert many of my friends who thought that foreign films are not as good as North American films - that they are not "Hollywood enough". Moreover, the translation is never right, it is too literal and affects the mood of the film, even if it basically says the same thing. I recently looked at Anatomy in German and then subtitled with my roommate because he was on his laptop and did not want to miss any parts if he could not see the subtitles because he typed. After 30 minutes, he asked me to let him finish his work and start the movie with subtitles. He loved it! Both movies are fantastic as intellectual horror movies! Kelly
