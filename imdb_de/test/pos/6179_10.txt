I absolutely loved this movie. Great, realistic-looking combat material for one thing and a touching, real story. The quiet, unobtrusive nature of the main character Franta makes him very likeable. Human relationships in history seemed to be as typical and possible as one could expect in wartime. The connection between Franta and Carel shows the loyalty that wartime comrades can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans. The subtitles do not affect the story at all and underline the problems of the Czech pilots in the RAF. The post-war history recalls that for many, the suffering of the Second World War did not end in 1945, especially in the countries occupied by Russia. The cinematography was also very good. I wish I had seen it on the big screen.
