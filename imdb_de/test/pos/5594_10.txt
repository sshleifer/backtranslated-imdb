Yikes! and we all thought Joan Crawford was THE horror mom. Sweetheart ... well, Laura Hope Crewes, as a mom in this pungent 4-character movie (and cops) delivers the goods in this cracker to a marital mommy mangle ..... THE SILVER CORD is a really sensational pre-code Drama by RKO, which was published in 1932 from a 1929 piece. So amazing, open and honest is every baffling verbal exchange between the wife of one son (IreneDunne) and the fiancee of the other as these two younger girls go to war together - and relish the clearly incestuous delusions of their mother towards her highborn son played by virile Joel MacCrea and her younger "Beau" / son were paid by 25-year-old actor Eric Linden. I think that in 1933 this movie was played in front of many howling, appreciative viewers in huge theaters, and even gave the audience a very fruity melodrama in 2005, which is animated by crackling dialogues, without fear of calling mother exactly like that. how she is. It was impossible to make this film after the censorship code was received after 1934. Other comments from the IMDb support my reaction, and you will almost all be lucky enough to see (and record) the SILVER CORD. It's going to be a memorable film-sharp screenplay in a superbly produced movie. It would have played like the 1919 VIRGINIA WOLF. Laura Hope Crewes must have kissed the RKO's stage for this lifelong role ... even more than her fluffy twist in GWTW. Irene Dunne is as gorgeous and believable as ever, fighting for her husband again, and it's worth seeing The Divorc√©e, written in 1929 to accompany THE SILVER CORD. Joel MaCrea is certainly in the same league as Cary Grant and Randolph Scott in the beautiful and lovable stakes. I've never seen Eric Linden in a real acting role (he played the leg amputee in the hospital horror scene of GWTW), and here he is surprising and youthful and has a great role as Robert, the younger and more sensitive son. Some verbal barbs that were again turned against him did not pass the Codex Office if later made. This is a really good movie, and if the viewer forgives some of the squeaking of his time and chooses a sparring fight of unprecedented sharpness for a 1932 movie, you'll be well rewarded. At first, I thought that part of the neck that encircled Mother's melodrama was outdated until I realized that it was an awesome script that would make the audience laugh at her as if she were a feeble little one old lady ... NOT. .... but the other two women in this powerhouse do not play in the movie, so the fantastic retort dialogue. This ocean liner in role 1 is THE LEVIATHAN, the monster ship the US won in the First World War from the Germans. It was so huge and unwieldy that the crews were nervous wrecks struggling on the Atlantic. It is notorious to plow up a colossal wave in a storm and shoot over the crest at such an angle that the spine was broken at the bottom and the ship was split vertically between the funnels. It limped to port with chattering steel plates and blinking rivet holes ... and collapsed with crew and passengers. It was sunk in 1935 after being cursed and plagued by all the mechanical problems of the horror. No such a war price. In any case, the dialogue in THE SILVER CORD is enough excitement for one night: eg, "Mother, the doctor said there was nothing wrong with you, in fact he said it would kill a dynamite stick you". Whammo!
