Why this film was released only in 4 states, I do not know. I thought this movie was a divine story. The name says it all: See other people. This movie has more logic than laughter, which is why it works so well. Common sense also appears in a seemingly puerile sex comedy. Alice freezes her feet in the cold when she feels irrational, as she can act for her fianc√©e, not only sexually, but also as a partner and friend of them. One fling at a time causes trouble, as if it was not a bad idea from the start. Funny dialogues and comic setups make this the hell of a joke! Nicholson and Mohr set the tone early and keep the promise they expect. Other highlights include Lauren Graham, Andy Richter and Helen Slater (in their first theatrical film in 10 years!). Climax begins a mad turn, but a simple ending makes this game far more enjoyable than most movies today. Mohr fans will see something different in his Ed character, and fans of Helen Slater will enjoy their glittering moments of a quick but excellent comeback. Each judge takes home the prize for the most moralistic character. Romantic and funny or just fun. Seeing other people is a gem that needs to be considered.
