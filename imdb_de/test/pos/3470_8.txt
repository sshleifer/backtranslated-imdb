Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, especially the "flowering" of one of them. An embittered teenager ("Spike") (McAvoy) with Deuchenne's MD is in a home for the disabled and quickly becomes friends with a cerebral palsy (Robertson) adolescent. Robertson has never known anything outside of the house, but McAvoy is and he is committed and determined to return to the real world. Together they create this in this witty and heartwarming and often heartbreaking story of inner strength that overcomes physical deficits. The two approaches are great, especially Robertson, who had certainly spent some time studying the handicapped to take on this tricky role. He performs in almost every scene and is an absolute storm. For anyone who does not know, he might think he really has CB. Highly recommended.
