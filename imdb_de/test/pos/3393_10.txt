This movie is very long, but it is worth dividing over several nights. It's an all-star cast, and if you're a Patrick Swayze fan, it'll make your heart throb! :-) My mother is a fan of civil war and history teacher. Every summer we saw this movie (we had it on TV) over several, several nights, until we got through the whole thing. We memorized every line in the movie, lol. Pop Pop Pop, sit back and enjoy the action and romance. It's a great movie for those who like action, war, blood and courage, but also for those with a soft, romantic side. The women's clothes were beautiful! Sometimes I think I was born at the wrong time, lol.
