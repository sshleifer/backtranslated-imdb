Released recently on British DVD, this is a good movie (as long as you have an attention span and an IQ of more than one fruit fly). Not as depressing as it could have been, it's the dirtiest kitchen. Terrance Stamp is great, the music is sweet, Carol White is very credible like the single mother who can not stop loving criminals. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where Carol and her friend work The pub with her (the one with the huge beehive hairstyle coming down over one eye) sits outside and chats about the men who ran past them Carol's first Husband, but if you get past it, you're fine. And Donovan delivers some of the most boring, mature, bittersweet lyrics of the 60s.
