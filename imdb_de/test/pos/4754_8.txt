This movie has a great chase scene. If you listen to the soundtrack, when the cars chase each other, it sounds very much like the soundtrack from the movie ball. You hear the shift of a 4-speed gear shift and show the brake pedal in Roy Schneider's car, it's an automatic brake pedal! I think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the evil Richard Lynch looks at the driver of the car in which they find themselves as if the guy was crazy. ........ the rogue who runs the garage is also the guy who was in the first Rocky movie, Rocky's Boss. good movie! Even if the door is torn off, you can see the guy sitting in the car and pushing open the door. The guy helping him out of the car looks a bit like Brady's Mr. Brady, right?
