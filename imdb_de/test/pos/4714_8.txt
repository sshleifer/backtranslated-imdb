I came across this movie on TV. I had never heard of it and almost changed the channel, but it quickly impressed me. <br /> <br /> The history of the Burmese people's struggle against a military dictatorship has been provocative. The magnitude of the brutality with which some are prepared to remain in power is hard to believe. I am grateful to live in a country where the government is unlikely to shoot people on the street. <br /> <br /> The story of Laura Bowman was a good thread to keep the history of the political struggle together.
