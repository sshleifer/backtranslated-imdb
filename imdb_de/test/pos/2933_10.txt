This is the best show ever, no matter what you say! I have seen this show since cycle 1. This show never gets boring, it's wonderful how you see the dream of the peoples being a model. Tyra tries her best to help young women, do not be ashamed of their bodies and let them believe that they are beautiful in their own way and that you do not have to feel beautiful due to anorexia. And just like Tyra says in the Tyra show, what if you're curvy and what if you're I have a big round booty. What if you have a big nose? What if you are not as beautiful as people in magazines that you are nice to her? LIKE THIS ................. ..............
