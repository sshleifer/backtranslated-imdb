This film is about an Arab leader (Amir) who dies and wants to live on. A Dr. Lloyd Trenton is paid to transplant Amir's brain into a "willing" participant. But in the doctors' cellar, his dwarf assistant Dorro (Angelo Rossitto) takes blood for doctors to young girls. In the meantime, Doctor Llyod pays a man to kill the people who helped Amir into the country (Reed Hadley, Grant Williams, and various unknown bodyguards). Grant is the only survivor when his car crashes off the road. While this is done, the other assistant Gor is sent to get a body for Amir, which injures him so much that Dr.Llyod can not operate. Meanwhile, Grant finds Amir's "girlfriend" Regina Carrol and tells her his story. Grant sees the man who drove him off the street and Dorro kills him. Then, since Gor did not manage to get a body, Llyod puts Amir's brain into Gor's disfigured body. Then Grant and Regina go to the doctor's lab and <br /> <br /> ------------------------ SPOILERS ------- - ---------------- find out his secret. Soon, Amir (Gor) and Humans are killing each other, and in the jumble of what I think is Plot Dr.Llyod has a brain cannon that injures Amir on command. It turns out that Dr.Lloyd wants a country where all scientists can work without a law. Then Regina dies. And in the end, Amir's new bodies say (I think) that it's supposed to be a new country. <br /> <br /> I still do not get the end, but overall this was a very enjoyable piece of stinking cheese. In this film Grant Williams is shown in his penultimate film role. I recommend it to any fan of Al Adamson or if you like Brains.
