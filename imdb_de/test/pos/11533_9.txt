The plot of this movie is not complicated. A very attractive young girl is looking for the reasons for the suicide of her older sister ten years ago to Europe. There she meets her sister's former boyfriend, and together they travel to all the places where their sister was, and gradually the reasons become clear. <br /> <br /> But what makes this movie so special and hovers over the limited plot are the beautiful depictions of the characters. Although the elder sister's boyfriend is a dropout hippie, he has noble ideals, moral standards, and incredible strengths. And though the older sister we see in flashbacks shares these ideals, she has no sense of limitation or balance, how much is too much. And although the younger girl is very loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was just a normal girl. <br /> <br /> The very special moment in the movie is when the girl's sister and sister's sister finally cease fighting each other. I can not remember ever seeing a nicer, more touching, more romantic tenderness in lovemaking in a movie! <br /> <br /> In all these areas, this is a really nice movie, a movie that must be appreciated and re-seen again and again. 9 out of 10.
