The story line for this game is very jerky when it seems that the authors have been trying to find ways in which a character appears in certain areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul. Apart from that, this is the only criticism I have about the game. <br /> <br /> The incipient FMV is spectacular with breathtaking scenery and interesting new equipment, eg. For example, the ability to create one's own character and one's own and design martial arts discipline. There's even a second story mode that makes up for the awkward story design of Tale of the Souls. <br /> <br /> Parts of the FMVs during Tale of the Souls are also interactive, where you can determine the fate of your character A degree that is an interesting feature. <br /> <br /> With the many combinations of characters you can create, the varied ways you can explore in Tales of the Souls and the story mode "Chronicle of Swords", this game will retain all Beatem Up / RPG fans enjoyed themselves for a while!
