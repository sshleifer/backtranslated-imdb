This comedy from 1931 gets better with every viewer due to the comedic talents of Marion Davies and a terrific performance by C. Aubrey Smith. Smith plays a rugged old man who collects his adult children (from his more recent days as a rake) in his waning years. One is American (Davies), one Englishman (Ray Milland, who looks about 18) and one Italian (Nina Quartero). There are some surprises as the action moves with Ralph Forbes (which had no incentive) for Davies. Davies and Smith are just wonderful together and very touching. Davies is also allowed to do a few dances and make some "big" entrances. And of course Davies is just amazing. Halliwell Hobbes, Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, Guinn Williams, Edgar Norton and David Torrence as co-star. If they had given the Academy Awards in 1931, Smith might have been nominated. He is just outstanding in this gem.
