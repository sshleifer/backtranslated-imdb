This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. At the beginning there are outstanding performances by Debra Paget as a princess / dancer, by Michael Rennie as the villain, the handsome boy Jeffrey Hunter, who investigates crimes in her city / state and others. The film is an unusually colorful adventure, and we even see the princess rehearse the dance she performs later (exceptionally). She manages to skewer Hunter before she learns he is on her side. Unusually beautiful are the photography, the costumes of Travilla, Lionel Newman's music and the style of the film. Add to this sweeping action, intelligent characterization and fine-tuning of the 1249 AD, written by Gerald Drayson Adams, and you have the ingredients for a pleasurable Greek Middle East. However, there is much to praise for the unusual and well-developed storyline, as there is much more to be praised than just the fast pace of the movie, well managed movement and superior technical aspects. Classically trained actors like Michael Ansara, Edgar Barrier, Wally Cassell, Jack Elam and Dona Drake are not common in a single "B" movie; There are also no fascinating sets, a multitude of locations and a puzzle about the quality that is delivered here. One way to rate a movie is, "If I had the experience, would I choose to experience these events and take those actions?" Since my answer in this case is a clear "yes", this film remains one of my favorite decisions and a very underrated film work. Could it be that American critics all too often despise women as warriors who, as in many other cases, have closed minds misjudging the apparent anti-tyranny and entertainment qualities of this cherished film?
