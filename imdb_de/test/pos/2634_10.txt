Chris Penn is funny as the best Stoner brother of Jeff Spicoli. This movie is great because it was much more real and funnier than fast times at free high. The casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van Halen, who later became songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the great Stoner movie heroes with Cheech and Chong. Fast times were depressing rather than funny. Abortions, friends cheating on friends, wanking in the bathroom, doing bad jobs and failing school. Someone hates to hate the eighties to enjoy more than the wild life. The movie even had great cameos like the manufacturer of city limits that shocked Michelle in the liquor store or Ben Stein in his first role in the surplus business of the sun.
