I have never seen "American Werewolf in London", but this movie was very entertaining. When I rented it, I thought it was a horror movie, but it turned out to be rather a comedy with some horror aspects. I thought the transformation sequences were well done, but the effects were smart. The best scenes were those where the effects and lighting were matched. The transformations reminded me of many werewolf transformations in other films, but the werewolves themselves are very animal and not very dog-friendly. Gore: I really think there's too much in this movie that really takes away the horror when there's blood in every frame. Taking violence is hard. <br /> <br /> J. Hurst (8th grade)
