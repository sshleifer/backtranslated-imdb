Of the 600 or so spaghetti westerns, this had to be somewhere in the top 20. Can not believe that this has received no reviews! Gemma is outstanding in that. Van Johnson is also good, although his voice is a bit absurd, but that's the charm of the Italian style. Beautiful photography and some excellently staged action. All minor characters are well played. The severity of the racist strip of evil is quite tough even by today's standards, which makes Gemma's character very emotional in some situations that happen. Absolutely AWESOME notch by Luis Bacalov. See this in the wonderful widescreen DVD from Japan. A spaghetti must have.
