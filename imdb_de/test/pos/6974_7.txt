Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this amazingly personal story about the escape of a married woman from her husband - and the fact that the youthful joy and excitement of her younger years are behind her. We learn little about this woman's marriage except that she feels that her independence has lessened lately; She also recently learned that she is pregnant, which further complicated her heart (she does not want to be a complacent woman, despite the maternal way she talks to her husband over the phone). She meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who has left permanent brain damage following an accident during a game, and a sexy, stumbling motorcycle cop who has great difficulties in his own life. The clear, clean landscapes (photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler) and the characters are ingeniously implemented. Shirley Knight, James Caan and Robert Duvall each deliver strong and gripping performances, especially since these people are not very congenial in the conventional field. Some scenes (like Knight's first call from a pay phone home or her first night alone with Caan playing "Simon Says") are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola plays with reality and transforms the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks that we were initiated into. He lets scenes play, but the cut is pretty nimble and the movie can never be too heavy (there are at least two or three very playful moments). It's an intoxicating endeavor - so much so that the picture was shown at festivals almost five years later. Some may avoid Coppola's ill-fated distortion of events to underline the finale with bitter irony, but the power and dynamism behind the image almost erase his shortcomings. *** from ****
