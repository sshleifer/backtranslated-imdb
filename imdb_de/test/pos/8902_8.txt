I'm a loyal Asterix fan all my life and I have to say that "Asterix and the Vikings" is probably the best of all Asterix films. It has some very funny jokes and the animation is outstanding. As many people have hinted, it does not follow very closely the comic's conspiracy ("Asterix and the Normans"), but in many ways that's a good thing, because this book springs to mind as one that pokes a lot of fun The culture of the sixties, and much of it is very outdated today. <br /> <br /> What really rubbed me the wrong way is the way she put a Disney plot into the A Film, the Asterix and the Obelix. We have a misunderstood boy who does not fit, Justforkix. We have a young woman who does not fit because she wants to be equated with men, Abba. They meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because the boy is ashamed of being totally honest with girls, but in the end their love wins. This was the plot of so many Disney movies (and, fairly, in other studios) that it was not funny and the plot was twenty years ago. I mean, they even gave Justforkix a bizarre animal buddy. <br /> <br /> Not only did I find that derivative and clich√©, but it really distracted the story and made me dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks volumes about how great the rest of the movie was that I still treasure, despite the way the conspiracy was hijacked.
