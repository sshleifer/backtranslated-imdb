I'm a fan of Randolph Scott Western. While some of them are amazingly clich√©d (like most westerns of that era), his films raise the classic and almost classic status of the films. While this film is another example of true Western heroes being exploited after their death by Hollywood (Bat Masterson in this case), the film works well thanks to him and outstanding minor characters. One is the always strong drama of Robert Ryan - an outstanding actor who is unfortunately almost forgotten today. The other is the omnipresent Gabby Hayes, who has one of his best roles as a crispy and very colorful substitute. He's more fun here than in his many supporting roles for Roy Rogers and John Wayne - mainly because his role is better written and he has more to do. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty much the act of half the Western always made. There are some bad guys hiring a bunch of thugs to ruthlessly run over the locals, and it's up to a maker (Scott) to restore peace and kill the villains. However, how the plot is performed is much better than the average and that's why the movie is still fun. Just do not expect much innovation or uniqueness - unless you want to see what may be the best performance of Gabby Hayes.
