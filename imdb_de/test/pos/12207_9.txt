Surface, from the day on which the teaser was first shown in the summer of 2005, was a litter. On the one hand, the concept and plot seemed so high that it seemed to the passer-by that it would work better as a film (or more). It also felt like NBC's attempt at a lost killers. On the other hand, you may have noticed that the story was too expansive to tell in the one or two movies, and the fans of Lost seemed fascinated. <br /> <br /> After a (and possibly only) season on NBC, the show is on an indefinite break that could put them either in the vault or in the sci-fi system or a gap in NBC's lineup could fill in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond. His ratings were some of the better on the network (which does not say much), but the show was blown out of the air with no real official announcement of its future. <br /> <br /> So, is it worth it? Yes. <br /> <br /> Surface follows an ongoing story format, which is controlled by Plot with almost no filler episodes. Almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot, much like a movie. No filler episodes that will make you painful if you've missed an episode. But the double edge of the show made up for it. Big things seem to happen in every episode, but since it feels like a movie, you end each episode with the feeling that little has happened and you want more! However, this feature of the show shows how great it is. The cast is solid; The three main roles, including the beautiful Lake Bell as Laura Daughtery, showed a solid performance in each episode, each driven for their own reasons to find / study the creatures. The side cast, including Ian Anthony Dale and the short performance of Rade Serbedzija, complete the cast well. The story is slow to start (regret, it's not properly recorded until after 3-4 episodes of the short 15-episode season), but the second half of the season makes up for it. The visual effects are stunning (the jaw will fade when you see a top view of one of the creatures' creatures on a ship). Many of the show's problems can be resolved by purchasing the movie. Complete the first season and do not have to wait a week (or three) to see the next episode. <br /> <br /> If you missed the first season and are curious, go back and watch the episode. It's not Twin Peaks in terms of bizarre, but the high-concept character is designed with Lost and other similar shows, with a sense of action and adventure. Enjoy it.
