My ex-wife and I saw the trailer for this movie and loved it. We waited for it to come out, but when it did, it was not long in theaters. A few years later, I bought it on VHS and put it on DVD so I can keep it. <br /> <br /> I found it very moving. It's about real events in a real country. BURMA had such a bad name for the political repression it caused that they changed their name. <br /> <br /> I find women with very little make-up very sexy. Patricia Arquette is in this movie. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are only a short time. <br /> <br /> After she has come home to brutally murder her young son and husband, Laura (Arquette) is afraid of blood. A bad property for a doctor. Her sister (McDormand) persuades her to go to Burma. There she witnesses a peaceful demonstration and has stolen her passport. In a bold (or stupid) move, she asks a guide to show her some of the tourist trail. Her leader is hurt by soldiers, and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get him and herself to safety. <br /> <br /> Every time I look at it, it reminds me that in the United States we forget that to a peasant Under social rule, SOCIALISM, where at least the food is virtually guaranteed, looks damn good.
