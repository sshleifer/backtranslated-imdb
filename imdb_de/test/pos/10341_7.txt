This movie is still alive today thanks to Alan Ladd's presence. That's good in a way, because the movie has some interesting things to say, but bad in another, because anyone who watches the movie and expects the tough guy Ladd to go through his usual steps will be very disappointed. Without fanfare or introduction, Ladd is suddenly introduced to the third role. Although his role is key, it is small and likely to be lost in shuffle. There are many key roles in the ambivalent screenplay by former Newspaper Martin Mooney, which makes all political alliances and ruthlessly denigrates reform candidates. It is the lovely and extremely talented Joan Woodbury who combines the different aspects of the far-reaching history. In contrast to the usual Hollywood production, the plot runs in a series of jumps, similar to the films that were later released by the French "New Wave". However, this is easier to follow, especially if you know that the original title of the movie was Paper Bullets. Still, some of the narrative and character changes in the film are a bit disconcerting, especially in the role Jack LaRue played, who wisely chose to play the role oddly noncommittal. One of Jack's best acting jobs of all time, but probably nobody will notice, unfortunately!
