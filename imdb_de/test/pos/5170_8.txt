I just saw it on the Hallmark Channel. I was surprised to John Denver! This film was full of clichés, but that's to be expected (a Christmas movie made for Christmas - come on!). Acting is as good as any other 80's for the TV movie. The story is, as I said, predictable and clichéd, but still good. If you're looking for a Campy Christmas movie, it's guaranteed to scratch you. <br /> <br /> I was also pleased to learn that it was in Georgetown, Colorado. It is a real mountain town west of Denver. Very cool, as this is my home region. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of John Denver (I always thought he was crazy), but he was a decent actor. He is very good as the good old boy he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to look at him, then do it. I am sure that it will be back in 2007.
