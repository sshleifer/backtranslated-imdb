It's rare for a movie to encompass both the problem-solving process and a fantastically far-reaching moral dilemma AND is a pretty accurate historical film, but Fat Man and Little Boy take that trick out. <br /> <br /> It's the story of the Manhattan Project - World War II efforts to build the atomic bomb, told as a conflict between the two men who made it, General Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. The historical personalities are a great study in opposites: military vs. Civil, practical vs. Idealistic, emotional vs. scientifically, brute force vs. Consensus-based problem solving, immediacy vs. Long-term vision. A fictional character, played by John Cusack, is added as a kind of synthesis of the two historical figures to show humanity that the real humans are strangely escaping (and of course the compulsory love interest, played by Laura Dern). Those who are looking for a pure documentary could criticize the mistakes in melodrama (and occasionally casual with the facts, but that's Hollywood for you), but the purpose of fiction is to summarize and galvanize events into more general truths. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest visuals in the film is when Oppenheimer witnesses the first atomic explosion: this reaction is solely through his reaction and in view of the impressive visualizations of an atomic explosion, this is brave and completely effective. So you can in a single moment Describe the ambivalent effect on the human being who unleashes this power (the kind of thing lost in the typical Hollywood shoot version of the story.) The use of music is especially good in the last third of the movie. <br /> <br /> Quite accessible and highly recommended as a historical film as well as a drama of the highest order.
