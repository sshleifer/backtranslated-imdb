Like so many reviewers, my memories of this show are generally warm. In fact beloved memories are so popular that I recently bought the DVD box to revisit this happy and carefree phase of childhood, always fascinated by the ongoing search for Monkey, Pigsy and Sandy watched, Tripitaka and later Yu Lung, a horse / dragon / man (you must necessarily see it to understand) when the popular show aired on BBC 2 on Friday night, as I recall. <br /> <br /> Well, I am pleased to say that even after all these years and with more cynical (!) eyes seen with adult eyes, the show has lost none of its inimitable charm. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful entertainment, from the magical characters and their weird interactions with each other to the perhaps not so special effects (which actually increase the fun) and of course the enormously memorable opening title sequence The first season, which has passed the passage of time in no way diminished the shape or form of the enchanting charm of Monkey. <br /> <br /> As a monkey you would probably say yourself: 'Oi! You there! Get out there and grab some nostalgic fun. '
