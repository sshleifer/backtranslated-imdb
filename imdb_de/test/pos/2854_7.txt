This is followed by smaller spoilers, but nothing that you have not learned by reading the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Held together by a wonderful central performance by Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark but deceptively good-humored comedy <br /> <br /> The suffering and desperately unhappy waitress Betty, following the murder of her sloppy Witness husband is convinced that a figure on her favorite day is her longtime fiancé and sets out to find Kansas in Hollywood to find him. <br /> <br /> Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's state of mind, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic. Zellweger calls them lost innocents, not completely helpless, but tragically susceptible anyway. Crucially, she's never really a victim, and though she is undoubtedly terribly suffering, the motives of the characters who treat her badly are all understandable - even Greg Kinnear, the object of her deceived affections, may be a selfish, blinking, arrogant pig but he really thinks she's just a quirky wannabe actress with talent bags instead of an insane stalker. The vile end to which all the main protagonists land at the same time (in this case, Betty's house) at the same time. It's as old as the cinema itself, but it works pretty well here, even though the sound changes are unfortunate. Zellweger is supported by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman, both of whom work solidly and, above all, It's gratifying to see how Chris Rock was reluctant in his earlier scenes. Not nearly as cruel as one might expect, and not in common in all respects, Sister Betty - though far from being a laugh - is a solid entertainer who does something much more from the main actress.
