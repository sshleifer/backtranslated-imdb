Well, it's a good movie. However, one has to admit that Van Dames films have not been so great lately. On the other hand, if you're a hardcore Van Lady fan, you should watch this as battle scenes improve enormously. What I really liked is the beautiful music. I'm sure this will kill time if you're an action fan. Regarding Isaac Florentine, the director of Undisputed 2, I do not think he did a good job, as he did with Undisputed. I can not wait to see Van Dames movies in the cinemas one day before the DVD. Maybe one day :). <br /> <br /> In the end, it's worth it if you do not see other action films. This could be fun for your full and half hour.
