It's so refreshing to see such a movie with actual mood and personality, rather than just a few CGI comic gimmicks. This is a great horror parody that offers real chills in addition to some really great sets and performances. The laughter is subtle but plentiful. Since there is very little CGI, you do not have to shake the camera forcibly to hide the crappy effects. This makes the movie incredibly good compared to the other Camera-Man-Must-Sh-Sh% # @ ing-his-pants films of this genre that have emerged in the last decade, and much more enjoyable than the large-format, garbage released by Hollywood today. <br /> <br /> See it.
