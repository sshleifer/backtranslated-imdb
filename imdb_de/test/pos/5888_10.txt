In such a successful movie, it is difficult to pick out a factor. All departments work in perfect unity to create one of the most moving human dramas ever made on film. <br /> <br /> The production pays homage to the efforts of the authors, producers, cast and crew. To name but a few, Hugo Friedhofer's great score is a subliminal wonder, the subtle yet striking photography of Greg Toland, and the incredibly effective directorial work of William Wyler combined with an ideal cast for an American classic. <br /> <br /> The DVD format is a special experience. What a pleasure to see that "The Best Years of Our Life" are so beautifully preserved that generations can enjoy it.
