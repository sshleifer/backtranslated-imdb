Login to the imb to say what a captivating movie Love Love is and be totally confused. Seems to me that someone has messed up his titles. "Plastic demon baby" what? This was not a love life. A bit of luvy dovey for my taste, but a great, funny and original movie. Especially the end, which did not fall into the usual pit of stereotype that all Hollywood romantic movies crash and burn it. Nine out of ten.
