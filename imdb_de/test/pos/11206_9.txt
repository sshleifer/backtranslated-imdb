If you look at Distant, you know that you do not see a French movie. There is little sex and it is mostly elliptical. People do not talk so much here. There are a few lines here and there and a few important conversations. Just so you understand what's going on. Nor does it look American, there are no chases or shootings or acts of violence, unless you consider killing a mouse as a bloody act or the daily strain of getting bogged down by a muted disaster. Sometimes the relatively long-range medium-length photographs are reminiscent of contemplative Asian cinema. However, the director does not insist on the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers Taiwanese film, it is a Turkish film. I do not know what that means, I do not even know if that should mean something. <br /> <br /> The film has no real plot and yet these few lines, these somewhat long shots, and this often tempered tension gradually builds up the feeling that something is happening, the feeling of "conspiracy" for want of a better one Word that grows on you. At the end of the movie you may feel that you will miss these two cousins, who have many things in common, but are worlds apart.
