I remember that my family made it their mission to stay at home that night, in the Nichols (Mondays, Tuesdays, NBCs). It was an excellent vehicle for James Garner, very well written, great ensemble cast. His character is very similar to "Support Your Local" films: the retired player with a mysterious past settles in the city and experiences adventures every week. In fact, it seemed pretty obvious that it was the same character. It was just a charmer on a television program. A sleeper like "My World And Welcome To It," which was perhaps contemporary - I forget. I really wish these shows were available on DVD. It was just good tv. Maybe "Briscoe County Jr." come close, but only a mile.
