I have been an avid IMDB visitor for several years. This is the movie that finally forced me to write in a review. <br /> <br /> I accidentally caught this movie (the header scrolled by accident when I turned on a TV one morning). I enjoyed the movie for a lot of reasons that were well covered by other reviewers - the capriciousness, the forgotten history of the Czech pilots, the subtle charm of the minor characters, the fatalism of the main characters and the first person view during the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> But the element of "Dark Blue World" that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during the fight (and that's a good thing!). While the pilots flew in battle, they did not accompany music, no manipulative attitudes of concerned spouses / girlfriends were interwoven, each small air maneuver did not trigger a triple patriotic applause, and spectators were not asked to swallow the incredible pilot heroes of James Bond. Instead, the audience may feel the melancholy, fear and isolation of these individual pilots as they try to stay in the air during the fight. When comrades are shot down we are spared the whining howls and the typical (but pleasing to the public) revenge-based exploits. Instead, the other pilots watch the fate of their fellow travelers sadly and quietly - in fact, at this moment they still have to focus intensely on their own safety and goals. We only briefly experience the breathing of the pilot and the roar of the engines in the background, while we viewers witness as a friend squirming quietly to his death. And then we have to return to combat mode immediately and focus on survival. <br /> <br /> Too often, we are filled with the spoon with the emotions we are supposed to feel and we have no room for the imagination of the beholder. "Dark Blue World" retains a sparse attitude that captivates and involves the viewer, allowing us to invest in the film and fill the gaps and spaces with our own thoughts and feelings. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie, worth seeing.
