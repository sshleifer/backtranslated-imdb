This is one of the animation films from the Animatrix collection, one of nine - the only one in black and white and the only one with Trinity. Richly textured and beautifully rendered in every way, the animated version of Trinity definitely lives up to its title. If you are a fan of The Matrix, you must put this on your short list.
