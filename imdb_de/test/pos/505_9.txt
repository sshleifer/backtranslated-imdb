In the ever-growing comic adaptation film genre, Blade is by far one of the best-made and most faithful source material (overall). Given that the character has nearly 30 years of storytelling in the comics. As a writer in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula, the author debuted almost ALL characters and storylines from the history of comics. While changes were inevitably made, the intricacies of the film dampen any criticism. Do not let any of your friends say otherwise: Blade is a good movie. If it feels like a "comic booky" to you, Stanley Kubrick stinks out there because that's the way it is. Treat it, but do not discredit it.
