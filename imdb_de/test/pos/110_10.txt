Deepa Mehta's "Fire" is groundbreaking, courageous and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the plight of women from conservative upper middle-class Indian households. This is a movie you should not miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Doing outstanding things by undermining their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together they create amazing sound montages that represent the views of the world around Radha and Sita whenever they ask each other for support. This film is not about lesbianism, as many have branded it. Lesbianism is only part of the movie. It is unfortunate that most people tend to call film taboo instead of giving it a chance and seeing its true meaning.
