One of my favorite movies whenever it runs, though I admit it was missed once when it was on Foxtel last year. Despite the age of the film, it does not look like history, even though it's been done a thousand times, it still felt entertaining. There were one or two little niggles for me in the story, but I looked past them and just enjoyed the movie the way it was. <br /> <br /> All in all I give him 7/10
