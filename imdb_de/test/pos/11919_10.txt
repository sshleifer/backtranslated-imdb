Not only does this movie have a great title, it's just the biggest drama I've ever seen. The viewer is unmistakably involved in the film, in which five young men work together to overcome insurmountable contradictions. Sean Astin as Billy Tepper is brilliant and has great supporting roles on TERUSSELL, Wil Wheaton and Shawn Phelan, the guidance and guidance of Gosset's and Astin's characters make the movie so much better. Over time, the movie is gaining more and more importance and it is a disappointment that none of the young actors have made a name for themselves in the film industry after this wonderful movie.
