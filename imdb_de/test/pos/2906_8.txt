One morning I was on my way out when I checked something on the TV and came across this movie. I can not remember seeing that or hearing about it. What a fun and interesting sight. Well, my meeting was postponed because I could not leave this movie. It had some really interesting things in the story, and some funny things that people do not do in today's movie because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it. Acting was good for a 1954 film. Subtle and authentic acts of the characters watching me do what they would do next. That's why I saw it in the end. I do not know why they do not show it more often. I would rather watch this than some movies that play more than necessary. For history buffs, people who like historical films and those who are in film appraisal groups will like it. "The Egyptian" has a variety of flavors that deal with many things that are to be considered in human nature and that have not changed since their time. What does that say about us? Those who do not like movies that take time to unfold and tell a good story ... are not in the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not have time to rent it, if available, but if I have a chance to see it again, I would probably make a 10.
