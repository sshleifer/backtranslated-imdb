I admit I'm in awe of the sea and spent a few years in the Navy, so I'm a bit biased. I missed this documentary when it first came out, but several people advised me to buy it on DVD for Christmas (2002) and I got it! Part of the film is amazing and I have great respect for those who make this kind of documentary. Cruising 200-ton blue whales across the ocean is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines. I like the level of information and facts conveyed by the narrative. It is just right. I do not want to know how much knowledge the basics are. These things are enough for most people. The BBC has the talent to bring things to the right audience for the intended audience. <br /> <br /> A really great documentary, with "The World at War" for me, the DVD is of excellent quality. If I had a slight criticism, there would be some of the obviously added sound effects here and there. I think they are distracting some scenes. But well done for the BBC and Discovery.
