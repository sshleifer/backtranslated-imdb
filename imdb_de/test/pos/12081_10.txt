I saw this movie when it aired on television in February 1983. I was in the hospital and had just given birth to my first and only child. I will not tell you to what extent I was moved. Suffice it to say that the memory of the film stayed with me nearly 23 years later. I hope I can find a copy of this movie if it ever happened. This movie should be remembered by anyone who has ever seen it. But I have to admit that I like it a bit dark. In this way it will always be a little secret to me and those who have been touched by it. I have never seen Ms. Margaret play a better role. I have never seen her in a more convincing role either. I will always respect her just because she accepted such a nice part.
