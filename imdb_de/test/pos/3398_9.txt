In this commentary, the "Northern and Southern Book I" is dealt with, which refers to the period 1842-1861. <br /> <br /> The history of the 19th-century US is mainly identified by citizens of the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion, because this was the civil war which severely tested the Union. that was the Civil War, which made Americans realize how valuable it is to live in peace; It was finally this time that finally put an end to the shameful system of slavery. <br /> <br /> Since the birth of movies, there have been people who fit this time on the screen. D.W. Griffith made his memorable birth of a nation in the early 20th century. However, the most famous film about the North-South collision is still GONE WITH THE WIND (1938). Unfortunately, fewer people know the great television series based on John Jake's novel "North and South". It's the best TV series ever made, and the time you spend with it is really valuable. I recorded it in my video from Polish television many years ago and have since come back to it very often. Why? <br /> <br /> First, the entire story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families, the Maines of South Carolina and the Hazards of Pennsylvania, represent two completely different ways of life. Nevertheless, friendship connects them. However, what they are experiencing is the struggle that all human beings are engaged in: friendship that is attacked by the "truth" of "political correctness", love that is attacked by hatred of "legal spouses", gentleness by the strength of "social heroes" , Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and is quickly robbed. Someone who is interested in friends, but political fanatics get on the way and ruin a lot. After all, he is someone who can see the tragic future of his country, but he can do nothing against the inevitable fate of the South. His friend George Hazard is similar in most aspects, but sometimes he seems to have a stronger character. It is he who proves Orry, despite the tragedies, desperately needs to get up and live, since life is the most precious thing we have. Although representing two different lifestyles, their friendship seems to be stronger than prejudice, politics or conflict. Other characters are also very well developed. There are rogues like Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones who are really evil, but most people are ambiguous, as has always been the nature of humanity. Charles Maine is initially full of rebellion and prone to fighting. Later, however, he learns to be a true southern gentleman, for whom southern pride is not courageous words, but above all courageous deeds. Virgilia Hazard represents the most fanatical side of the abolitionist movement, which condemns slavery and punishes the owners of "black farms". Her marriage to Grady seems to be a symbol of equality, but also a symbol of saying "no" to the politics of the South. Two interesting characters are Orry's sisters, Brett and Ashton - sisters in whose veins the blood is completely opposite. Brett believes in her gentleness but also naivete in absolute loyalty. She marries Billy, even though he is a Northerner, because she really loves him. Brett is the representation of everything that is precious in every young woman. However, Ashton is a vampire, a tigress, a woman who does not hesitate to do the worst things. The clear picture of their worldview is a conversation about men and family ... an unforgettable moment and how universal! Most characters strive for their values ​​... but the war breaks out and they have to put aside a lot. <br /> <br /> Second, the performances ... someone said that not all people act naturally. I would not say that. I would say that all performers do a very good job in their roles, from the main characters portrayed by younger employees to guests made up of famous stars, including Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum, and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does a great job. I consider this role as one of his best. Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. Her part may cause too much suffering, but she manages to express all sorts of feelings really well. Kirstie Alley is very appealing and memorable as an abolitionist Virgilia Hazard. Phillip Casnoff is considered to be a terribly ambitious Elkanah Bent, as well as David Carradine as a monster, who disgusts Justin LaMotte. And unlike him, Jean Simmons must be mentioned, who is truly honored as Orry's mother, whose heart beats for the glories of family life and the unification of the union. <br /> <br /> Third, memorable moments of "North and South" leave an imperishable mark on your mind. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine? What charm, what gentleness there is in this scene! Or is it possible to skip the moment when Madeleine's father dies? I found it really powerful, there is a real drama in this moment, a drama of a woman left by someone who really loved her. I also liked the Churubusco sequence and George Hazard, who were worried about the life of his beloved friend Orry. Then his meetings with Constance are terrific. Virgilia's speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. And the last moment of the first part: Although the north and south separate, their friendship will never die. Orry and George symbolically clasp their hands together as the train moves on. There are just so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it's impossible to mention even half of them here. And these beautiful pieces by Bill Conti, taken in brilliant landscapes. The music in "North and South" is very touching and memorable. <br /> <br /> What should I say in the end? "North and South" is an absolute must on DVD, just an amazing television series about the victory of all that is precious in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute fidelity. 9.10
