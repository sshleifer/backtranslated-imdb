Cardiff, Wales. A bunch of 5 comrades are bored in this city deeply. There's Jip working in a clothing store. Coop, a carefree DJ. Nina, inseparable from her best friends Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they are just waiting for one thing: the weekend. At that time, they went to a nightclub and the sound of Tech No Music, they experienced various drugs, especially ecstasy. Then they usually continue the party to a friend. At the end of this really good time on Sunday are the following feelings: fatigue, melancholy, just the memory of a crazy night ... <br /> <br /> Surfing on the wave of the notorious success of "Trainspotting" (1996), this one Debut film, written and directed by Justin Kerrigan, brings and develops a new twist on hedonism. It means having as much fun as possible and knowing that you have a shorter time. As I've already written, the week is hell for the movie's 5 main characters, and the weekend is the only time they can break free and have a wild time without the pressure (and Jip talks about it in a sequence) The positive aspects of shooting: You are deaf, you feel no pressure, you are like an astronaut in orbit above the earth. Kerrigan's ruthless directorial style expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and the care of the five protagonists. Just to make the most of a hedonistic weekend, and to add a little something to the festive atmosphere in which his movie bathes, Kerrigan is not afraid in front of dreamlike sequences that represent the fantasy or embarrassment of his characters "Human Traffic" (1999) is then also served by a particularly resilient soundtrack. The amount? A perfect symbiosis between sound and music. Finally, this weekend allows the euphoria to temporarily stop The British cinema is a common image of popular social classes and has studied a lot. Despite the fact that a film (conscientious or unconscious) exploits the fame of another famous, it rarely matches the brilliance of its predecessor film. "Human Traffic" is in this state. At the level of narrative structure and the introduction of the characters, there is little inventiveness, and one can record a few useless digressions (Jip, who goes into the manager's office at the nightclub and tells him a cock-and-bull story) It is pointless for Kerrigan to overlook the dramatic sides in which the story might be involved, and his film can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia The dramatic connotations of this second pole are virtually unexplored.It's a shame! It could have conveyed the following message: Even in the happiest moments, there can be a terrible preparation that can flop it Coop has a fit of jealousy because Nina puts on a guy. <br /> <br /> It may not be the last big e Film of the nineties, as it is referred to on the DVD cover as "human" Traffic is to be understood as a good and haunting small film that communicates with the styles and fashions of the late twentieth century a will to fun without ulterior motives and efforts. An ideal movie to start a party or before going to a club.
