The Violent Men is a pretty good western who will surely benefit from his outstanding cast. Edward G. Robinson is the big rancher trying to squeeze out the smaller ranchers, of which Glenn is Ford. Ford is ready to sell to placate his fianc√© (May Wynn) until Robinson's ambitious brother (Brian Keith) kills one of Ford's hands. Then you know what happens next. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck, as Robinson's specializing in planning, is the role she specializes in. Dianne Foster plays her daughter, who admires Ford. The Violent Men is nothing more than a "B" platter with an "A" movie, but it's done very well.
