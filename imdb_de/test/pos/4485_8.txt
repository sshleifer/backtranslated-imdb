Strange, but wonderfully original movie. Really scary, scary and ridiculous to the same extent. The environment of a high red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the haunting action. The idea of ​​a secret, sealed room in a place like this is good enough, but when the naive pair of couples start tidying up the old bed that can be found in this room, the scene is set for classic showers. The cast is fantastic. Tanya Dempsey can really chew a scene after being undervalued in other Full Moon movies. Joe Estevez proves why Brother Martin Sheen is so much taller in Hollywood - his rolling eyes as the bed scene emerges are really funny. Charles Band has co-produced with Stuart Gordon and this is truly an extraordinary Full Moon / Darkwave release. Danny Draven also directed Hell Asylum with Dempsey.
