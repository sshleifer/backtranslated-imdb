At the end of my review of Cache, I wrote that I was fascinated with Haneke as a filmmaker. That made me get the DVD for La Pianiste, which I had just finished watching half an hour ago. <br /> <br /> It has all been expressed, here at IMDb and in many external reviews - The Cruelty Twisted Pathology, which would "create" a person like Huppert's Erika, who after years and years is still trying to kill her mother At the expense of everyone and everyone else in their lives, starting with themselves. It has supplanted everything that would free them from their self-imposed servitude, of course, their sexuality, which is literally imploded, to the point of their madness can not even grasp what a true love impulse would feel like. <br /> <br /> This is a graphic portrait of a serious emotional cripple who never found the strength to get out of his childish situation and become a functioning adult. I think this is a theme for all of us - we all strive for autonomy, but there are needs, so many contradictory needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. It's also about the contrast between what you fantasize about sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share your sexual fantasies with another person. Huppert's character gets what she asks for in the film, and it's hardly the emancipatory experience she imagined. <br /> <br /> Regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom: I really appreciated that this sequence put all sorts of erotic charges (for the viewer, I mean) because of the previous scene from which it was sucked the glass in the girl's bag. By the time she plays her "let-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy" scenario in the bathroom, we've already figured out she's dangerously disturbed, so it's not her turn, her little dominance to make unsuspecting fool with our arms. <br /> <br /> I think another incredible accomplishment of this movie is that I forgot about halfway that it was not in English and that I was reading subtitles. This has never happened in a foreign movie, and I have already seen a few. <br /> <br /> In this movie, as in Cache, the end is not all wrapped up in a nice little neat bow, but unlike Cache, we at least have a sense of finality, though we do not even know that exactly, whether Huppert's character lives or is dead. After experiencing La Pianiste, I am more than a little intrigued when it comes to Michael Haneke.
