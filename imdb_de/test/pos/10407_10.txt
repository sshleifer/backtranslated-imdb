This review contains some small but significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> <br /> I just looked at my copy of Noroi ... <br /> <br />. ..and it was great! This may sound cheesy, but I've forgotten several times during the movie that it's not really XD. The acting convinced, even if the acting of Masafumi Kobayashi (he plays himself, I think ...) sometimes looks a bit hokey. Marika Matsumoto (Yuka in Takashi Shimizu's groove) seemed to change the level of credibility throughout the movie: sometimes she is REALLY GOOD, and the next moment she is really cheesy (especially at the end of the exorcism and the subsequent reuse). > <br /> One character who was ridiculous at first was Mr. Hori, a man wrapped in tin foil, who believes that "ectoplasmic worms" would eat anyone. The end has some really scary scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot was very interesting and I was really wondering how it all went together. There are some things that are not really explained (like a mass suicide in a park in Tokyo.) And where the reincarnated Kagutaba boy came from), but everything else was fine. The end has GOT one of the most disturbing, if not the scariest sequences I've ever seen. <br /> <All in all, Noroi is a very important factor Spend 2 hours and the new R3 DVD from Hong Kong offers a great picture and sound (especially the English subtitles - Engrish free!) for a great J horror -Experience. I highly recommend it.
