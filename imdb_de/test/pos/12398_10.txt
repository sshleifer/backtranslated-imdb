I saw this movie on Showtime early in the morning. I looked at the beginning with an open eye, but instead of falling asleep, I was invested in this smart, snappy bittersweet movie. It was very credible and committed. I could have done without so much profanity (like any David Mamet movie I see), but I really enjoyed the experience. I know teenagers swear, but I do not have to hear it. Anyway, the story had some interesting surprises that I'm not going to reveal, but if you get a chance to see this movie on Showtime, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I do.
