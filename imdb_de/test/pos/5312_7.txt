The title comes from a change made by a juvenile detainee in a correctional facility on the front page of his government textbook entitled "The United States." he adds "of (his name)". <br /> <br /> Many characterizations in this film work well - the scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and Father Fitzgerald (Spacey), as well as Leland, Becky and Sister Julie (Michelle Williams), among many others. <br /> <br /> But the central thread of this film - the pivotal point where everything hangs - is the character and motives of Leland. He is a somewhat shy, passive, nice high school student who bravely introduces himself to Becky, who (as we find) visits an alternative school because of a drug problem in the past. In Becky's family, she has a sister, Julie, who has just graduated from high school and is preparing for college. Julie's friend, Julie's Age (and whose parents recently died) also lives with them. <br /> <br /> Leland lives with his mother; His father (Kevin Spacey) and his mother have long been divorced and his father is a famous writer. Leland is very attentive. The boy in "The Sixth Sense" saw dead people; Leland sees teenage lovers and recognizes that years later she will divorce her, that pain will follow the present happy experiences of many people. But for reasons that are never made explicit, his untimely gift seems to work a few times, for some people, some relationships and not for others. <br /> <br /> Parts of the movie feel a bit like a derived quilt - I did not recognize the bondage of "American Beauty," "The Sixth Sense," "The Graduate," and possibly some others. That would not be bad if only the character of Leland had worked. <br /> <br /> I think Gosling played Leland very well, but the script and the story have limits. Would an attentive, thoughtful young man ever be murderous? Also for altruistic reasons? Nothing in the movie indicates a reason. I am a retired therapist with a lot of experience in working with families and adolescents. While many of the reactions shown in the film work - this part, this essential element certainly does not matter. <br /> <br /> And there is at least one other element that in my experience does not fit the real life, though it's not that critical. The reason for the differences between the sisters Becky and Julie is never suggested, but that's okay. Once two siblings occupy different roles (one is the good girl, the other the disturbed), the roles themselves can move into more extreme positions. For the troubled, Becky, it's kind of "What do I have to do to be loved here - Give up being me and become Julie?" And the pressure to be an All-Good parent-pleasing child is no less great on Julie. So, why should she break up with her longtime friend, whom her parents obviously agreed to? Don Cheadle was a good teacher of Leland; Everyone else was good in their fields. 98% of the scenes were good. What was missing was the crucial difference in the understanding of human nature. <br /> <br /> Good action; faulty history and psychology; worth seeing; no total loss
