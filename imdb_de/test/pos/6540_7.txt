When this film is mentioned, the discussion usually begins and ends with the wonderful collection of cars and drawing scenes. Often overlooked are the sometimes eclectic characters who populate the film around the three central characters. <br/> <br /> A character It is striking that Rebel is played by the great Australian actor Max Cullen. Rebell is a blind drag racer who shuts down the hero and his group almost in the middle of the night, because he does not use any headlights. <br /> <br /> In the backstory, we discover the rebel builder of the street race car, and he and his wife appear to be locked up in a time warp of the fifties. Rebel plays a small but crucial role in teaching Mike, played by Terry Serio, the almost spiritual truth about street racing. It's not the speed, the response times that make up a great racer. It is the one who feels the best car that will become the greatest. <br /> <br /> This is best illustrated when Rebel Mike explains to Mike after a test drive: "They are all agonizing, only the style is missing" <br /> <br /> Graham Bond is another high profile actor who provides his talent as a criminal police officer trying to participate in the financial activities of the road race. The confrontation between Bond and Fox, played by Richard Moir, adds suspense to the story. Bond not only expects results, but also Fox, who drums the racing business. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, Fox shows a real manipulative and nasty side. At the height, however, he presents a sense of honor that makes the last few minutes of minutes into an extremely exciting and memorable ending. It's almost as if the film focuses on its true purpose, to show us the culture of street racing and not people's daily activities. <br /> <br /> One of the main complaints about the movie is the script. Although it's nothing exciting, I believe that the total lack of chemistry between the friend of Mikes, played by Deborah Conway, and his mechanic, played by Vangelis Mourikis, has more to do with the problem. Any scene where these two interactions should have been cut. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, a truly outstanding performance is offered by Kristoffer Greaves, who plays a deaf and crippled member of the Inner Circle of Fox. His background story is never explored. Was he injured in a race born this way? What value does Fox have for him to keep him? <br /> <br /> The reality of the movie is simple, it's about the road race and the culture behind it. When the cars are flying and action sequences are on the move, it is the only time that director John Clark and his author Barry Tomblin feel really comfortable with what they are doing exploring human relationships, moments of life that determine the drama, then This movie is not for you. If your pulse is racing on the streets of Sydney at the thought of a blown 57 Chev or the legendary GTO Phase 3, then you will not find much better than this movie
