Far more sparkling and less dramatic than the previous efforts of Gene Saks. Barefoot in the Park (67) and The Odd Couple (68), Cactus Flower is not a work of art, but rather compared to most of the tired 60s farts like The Apartment, How to Murder His Wife, Goodbye Charlie, A Guide to the Married, Divorce, American Style, Every Wednesday, Kiss Me Dumb, Boys Night Out, it's a masterpiece. Director Saks and writer I.A.L. Diamond has "opened" Abe Burrows' Broadway hit, and the film benefits from filming in New York City and the outstanding performances of Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is charming, looks great and has a flair for comedy. Hawn in her Oscar winner role has never been better or more appealing. Matthau is fine, though it's hard to believe that Hawn's character would be so enthusiastic about him. And in retrospect, Hawn's suicide attempt at the beginning of the film is uncharacteristic and unbelievable. Still, the movie has a plausible farce, and once it starts, it makes you laugh. Rick Lenz, Jack Weston, Eve Bruce and Vito Scotti offer good support. The movie is sympathetic and fun, and Hawn and Bergman are catching attention.
