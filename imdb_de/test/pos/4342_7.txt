The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is a long way from Paul Kersey's original film. If you remember the film of 1974, you will remember that Kersey was a "Conchie" during the Korean War and that after his first execution he was physically ill. Ten years later, Kersey seems to have learned the unarmed combat and dealing with antitank weapons in his spare time. But I will ignore it because DW3 is the best sequel. Cheated sacks are shot, burned alive, their teeth smashed and thrown to death by middle-aged housewives armed with swirling brushes. Yeah, I know the gang members are multi-ethnic and for that they deserve some recognition, but even if they are not racist, they are still killing scum that deserves everything they get from Kersey and the innocent citizens. Who needs Mayor Rudy if you have Paul Kersey, an antitank rocket, and a lot of retirees to reclaim the streets from the criminal crooks? Paul Kersey Greetings, sir
