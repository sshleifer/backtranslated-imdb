This is a movie that has all the basic elements of its genre. It makes you cry, it makes you laugh, it detests you, it makes you angry, etc. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the theme of the story is not about any illness or drug, what is the general trend Gay movies these days, but it focuses on social interactions between characters who could not be considered as high school elite. The game and the direction might be a bit more sophisticated, but on the other hand, it's kind of better because it really shows the distress of the characters they're experiencing. If this was intended, then this is a remarkable work and certainly a feat, especially for such a young director. <br /> <br /> It's actually a good story that gives you some insight into what it's like to be a fat girl and acknowledge it to yourself.
