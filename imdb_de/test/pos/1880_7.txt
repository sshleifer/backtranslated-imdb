(Some Corruptors) It took about 19 years for Bruce Campbell to bring his masterpiece "Man with the Screaming Brain" to the screen. But Campbell had to change his story by finding her for financial reasons in Sofia, Bulgaria, where he originally wanted her shot in Los Angeles, California. In the film, Burce Campbell plays US pharmaceutical tycoon Willian Cole, who travels to the former Communist Republic of Bulgaria with his corrupt wife Jackie, Antoinette Byron. Here William wants to help fund the almost nonexistent Bulgarian mass transit system. <br /> <br /> It is William's unfortunate misfortune to engage with Gypsy wife Tatoya, Tamara Gorski, and her ex-boyfriend Yegor, Valdimir Kolev, a former KGB taxi driver. The two, William & Yegor, will involuntarily shear their brains into Williams' skull because of William's jealousy and vindictiveness. <br /> <br /> After Tatoya has both murdered William and Yegor, their bodies will become the mad scientist Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, Stacy Keach, from his faithful assistant Pavel, Ted Raimi, to let their brains experiment. Dr. Ivanov has this theory that two heads are better than one. And now, with the material, William & Yegor, who finally got him Ivanov will finally prove it. What Dr. Unfortunately, Ivanov will find out that by merging the two heads or brains, their brainwaves overlap and not only cause malfunction, but can also turn against each other. William, with Yegor's right rag fused with his damaged brain, wants to find Tatoya and pay her for the damage she and Yegor have inflicted. Yegor for his part is stuck in Williams head, who has his likes and dislikes both in terms of food and drinks. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two heads in them fighting for control of Williams' body! <br /> <br /> Things get even worse when Jackie finds out that Tatoya murdered her husband William, who exposes her to danger, and Bravoda's high crime department calls Gypsy Town and ends up being murdered herself , From his assistant Pavel to Dr. Ivanov is determined to place Jackie's brain in an experimental robot that Pavel is working on. The surgery is a complete success, but the only downside is that Jackie has to charge her brain every few hours with her brain in the robot! Or like a real brain that lacks oxygen, it dies along with the robot's batteries. <br /> <br /> The combination of the 1930s screw comedy and horror film, with both William and Yegor turning the Bulgarian town of Bravoda upside down trying to find Tatoya and using her life for the sad state to pay for their existence, in which she brought them both. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** It's Dr. med. Ivanov, who actually saves the day by figuring out how to keep both brains from fighting and cooperating with each other! This happens through him instead of merging the brains. Dr. Ivanov keeps them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall between the two uncooperative gray matter spheres.
