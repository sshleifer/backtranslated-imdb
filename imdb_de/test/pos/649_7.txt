In August '81 there was a local buzz in movies, big hits like "Urban Cowboy", "Every Which Way But Loose", "Smokey and the Bandit" were the rage. For this reason, I suspect that the producers of this film chose "Honky Tonk Freeway" as their title, hoping that would help the film's box office earnings by attracting the same "Urban Cowboy" crowd. Instead, "Honky Tonk Freeway" bombarded the theaters and I suspect that this is partly due to being charged with a poorly chosen title. The same problem now strains it on video and that's too bad, because it's a pretty good movie and is ahead of its time in a comedy style. No matter what, probably everyone who remembers 1981 will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that this movie was bombed. But I think that would have been the same if it had not been played with a bad title. It's a movie ahead of its time. One could look at this film now and realize that it is clearly a father or * great-uncle) to the comedies made today. On his day, "Honky Tonk Freeway" was pretty full of allusions and a kind of openness about life that became popular in the comedy much later. While clearly a child of "Airplane", it is more mature and while it is certainly not a "knocked-up", it clearly points in that direction. The characters are "more comedic" because they are unobtrusive and do not believe that anything they do is anything but serious. The jokes depend on the selection of what to highlight, the camera views, and the way the view itself and its situation look. <br /> <br /> But more than that, "Honky Tonk Freeway" is a real-time capsule. A great review of the very early 80s. The people in this film are dressed and behave like the people of everyday life from 1981. It was clearly meant to reflect the times and to be a smart, comedic comment on everyday life around them. <br /> <br /> I do not know if my review will help you, but that's really good, sometimes somehow An excellent movie that pays off if you want to see how many faces that are known today than they do 30 years younger. Beverly D'Angelo is so young that it is hard to realize sometimes. So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was on the verge of Hollywood toast as her next film was Tootsie, which eventually made her a star. Howard Hessmann was probably the biggest "current" star of the day when this movie was shot. In 1981 Howard Hessmann was the star of the big TV series "WKRP in Cinncinatti". He played his main character, the mischievous night DJ. Daniel Stern was about to break open as a grown-up narrator voice of the lead-child character in the popular 80s sitcom "The Wonder Years" as a star. There are also some faces that are no longer with us today see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as an old couple on a journey. Jessica Tandy finally picked up her Oscar for "Driving Miss Daisy" ten years later. There is also the great Geraldine Page in one of her last film appearances. Although she had a brilliant career, she did not get her Oscar until four years later when she received "Trip to Bountiful" (1985), for which she had earned him rich. She died very soon after receiving this award. There are also many other faces in this movie, actors who are not big stars but did a lot of supportive work. Many of them are familiar, even if you can not imagine their name. <br /> <br /> This movie is a nice little distraction. A group of people with a multitude of problems that had arrived from different places for different reasons and all traveling in a vague Altman esk way towards Florida, and without them being aware of a Rendevoux in the small town of Ticlaw. Florida, overwhelmed by the effects of bypassing the recently built nearby interstate, which did not provide access to Ticlaw, effectively removing the city from the map. <br /> <br /> And that's the film too It's all about the fascination of the whole idea of ​​the intergovernmental system, which has just recently been "closed". It took a generation to build, from the congressional approval of 1960 for many years, as different parts were built and then put into operation. By 1980, most of the system was finally built and all interconnected and only for the first time was the promise of what the intergovernmental system would be to what is. And people were excited about it. In 1980, all were pretty much a "highway veteran" in the sense that they had used all the parts and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads because there were no red lights or stop signs, only on and away from the ramps, and that it went in places that were previously less accessible. Until 1980, everyone could travel comfortably and without anywhere except to eat and sleep and a bathroom. And that was all new at the time. <br /> <br /> The end is anti-climatic and not so satisfying, even if it's a spectacular moment. What makes it great is the journey, not the destination, that makes the Honky Tonk Freeway timeless, even though it's such a product of its time. Forget the title. Instead, let yourself be recalled.
