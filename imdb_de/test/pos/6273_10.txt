Expectacular the second part of the ator !! Quickly directed by JOE D'AMATO, specialist in all types of subtypes (subgenres) of exploitation, and reinterpreted by MILES O'KEEFFE. the budget of the film debug should be mocking or minimal. Although ATOR 2 is not a better movie that is not necessarily entertaining, ATOR 2 has something that makes it an entertainer. His introduction, which you support, tells us the origin of ATOR with pictures of the first part. The script is incredible, like every comic book by the brilliant ROY THOMAS. It has such fantastic elements in the world of SWORD and so FANTASY as invisible men, black men, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain interprets this brilliantly. In the end, this fight is very good. It lacks mas violence and blood, but this good. It never gets boring. It has everything missing at ATOR 1. Be charmed with me !! 4.5
