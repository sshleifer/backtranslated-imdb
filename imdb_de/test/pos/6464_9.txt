This is an excellent film that deals with racism in a delicate and balanced way. Great performances, but absolutely outstanding drama by Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> He lets this movie breathe and come alive. His portrayal of a man who fights against discrimination and violence is simply mind-boggling. His acting is powerful and tender at the same time. Truly worthy of an Oscar, Poitier had to wait many more years (because of his skin color) before the sheer brilliance of his acting was recognized by the Academy. Cassavetes also makes a great performance. withdrawn, restless and realistic as it has become his trademark. He and Poitier inimitably contrast the powers of cowardice, courage and human transformation through friendship. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun and at the same time deep in its depiction of racism in the US. The irony is that it somehow reflects the realities under which Poitier had to work.
