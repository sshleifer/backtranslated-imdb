I like both this version of DORIAN GRAY and the MGM version. Both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have a connection with Dorian (this is not in the original book), and that's my only complaint. I like Angela Lansbury especially as Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version, but Shane Briant as Dorian in the TV version looks much better (I think) and far more ruthless than Hurd Hatfield in the MGM version: Me think Briant is more like the Dorian of the novel. In the end, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even hints at Dorian's connection to men, just like Wylde, which was not possible in the MGM version).
