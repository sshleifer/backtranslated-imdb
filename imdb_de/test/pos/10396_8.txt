This is a special movie if you know the context. Antonioni had been crippled by a stroke in his eighties. Silent and half-paralyzed, his friends - who are by the way the best in the film world - arranged for him to "direct" one last major movie. The idea is that by mere consideration, he can create a story. So we have a movie about a director who conjures up stories through simple observation. And the (four) stories are about how the visual imagination defines love. <br /> <br /> The film is born by giving us the tools to realize them through our own imagination. The result is a pure film world: every person (except the director) is charming in his appearance or movement. Some of these women are ultra-sensual and exist in a dreamy, foggy world of sensual encounters. There are no nuances, no hint that something exists except what we see; No wish is at work except what we create. <br /> <br /> I do not know any other movie that so successfully manipulates our own visual desire that we create the world we see. He knows something about not touching. Nobody understands Van Morrison as visually as he does. Morrison's Celtic space music is based on exactly the same idea: the sensual touch that a physical touch brings. Antonioni's red-haired woman appears suitably as a shopkeeper and also directs a flickering work 'movie that is on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Teds rating - 3 of 4: Worth seeing.
