This is a very funny movie. There is a self-ironic, iconoclastic tone that is very appealing. The characters are interesting. The movie is going very well and holds your interest for the entire duration of 1 hour and 50 minutes. The film quality does not meet the highest Hollywood standards. The original film should, however, be made in the genre of a punk rock style. The documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the filmmakers is very detailed and easy to follow. The original filmmakers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the film. The interviews with the filmmakers and the actors have been summed up in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles of making the original film, the eventual failure of the original project, and the phoenix-like ascent from the ashes that evolved into this documentary. In my opinion, the documentary (A Texas Tale of Treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original movie (Waldos Hawiian Vacation) would have ever been. Two thumbs up for a good job.
