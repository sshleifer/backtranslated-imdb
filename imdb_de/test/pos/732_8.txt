Sweet, young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming idea of ​​the gorgeous redhead knockout Rosie Holotik) works in a remote rural sanatorium. Geraldine S. Masters (the distinguished Annabelle Weenick). Amongst the colorful assortment of colorful crazy patients are insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the voluptuous Betty Chandler), the cunning judge Oliver W. Cameron (a splendidly pounding Gene Ross), the paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by Hugh Feagin ), Giant Sam (the lovable William Bill McGhee) and the crazy old witch Mrs. Callingham (the most irritating Rhea MacAdams). These patients are dangerously encouraged to share their fantasies of Masters, which of course leads to a rash of brutal killings. Director S.F. Brownrigg, who works for a clever and appropriately reworked script by Tim Pope, does an outstanding job of creating and maintaining a suffocating, humid and brooding atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia. Robert Farrar's scary movie soundtrack, the dirty set design, some wild gruesome murders, Bruce B. Alcott's rough no-frills cinematography, many deliciously robust, scenery-screaming histrionics from a no-name cast (in particular, Ross is an absolute Eye Rolling Scream), and the truly shocking Surprise Bloodsleep conclusion adds even more to the infectious, seedy fun of this extravagant chunk of 70's 70's regional horror exploitation cinema.
