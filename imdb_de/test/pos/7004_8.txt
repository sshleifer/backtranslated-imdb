I have to say that I did not expect much to watch Pitch Black, but I got a lot back in terms of excitement and fun. It's a kind of movie where you can just sit back, relax and have a great time just entertaining. This is by no means a deep movie. Everything it offers is either recycled or demolished by other films like Alien, Predator or the like. But if I look at a rip off, I want her to be good, and this rip-off is great. <br /> <br /> It opens with a galaxy of stars. Some of the greatest films of all time open up with this kind of scene - "2001", "Star Wars", "Alien", "Predator". A ship cruises through space when the entire cryogenically frozen crew is awakened. The ship was hit by something. They crash with three suns on an unpleasant little planet. Everyone streams out of the ship when they realize that their prisoner transporter Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) has escaped captivity. They search the desert planet looking for it and eventually find it, but they have no way to get their ship to fly again. They search the planet for water and civilization, but it seems all of a sudden all of a sudden disappeared from the planet. <br /> <br /> Then they realize that every 22 years the planets set themselves up in a solar eclipse and in their entirety Planet becomes pitch black. There is also refuge from aliens living in the dark on the planet - what are the chances? You happen to be on Earth while the eclipse is happening - what are the odds? And Riddick has a rare talent - he can see in the dark - again, what are the chances? <br /> <br /> In this movie, there seems to be a lot of cohesion, but a movie like this one is not going to get Oscar's market for originality or credibility. It's there to entertain the audience - and with ease. Vin Diesel is a great gorilla of a man without acting talent. But I have to say, if there's anyone who fits in a dirty, murderous criminal, it's diesel. Listen, he mumbles, "He did not know who he was working on." Great stuff. <br /> <br /> The aliens in this film are a mixture of hammerhead sharks, those of "alien" and predators. They have long, horizontal heads like a hammerhead, the fast-moving aliens and the stealth of a Predator. I suspect David Twohy (director and writer of the film) did not expect the audience to believe that his creatures were really something that had never been seen before. At least I do not hope so. <br /> <br /> "Aliens Redux" might be a better name for this movie, but on the other hand it's better than the second and the third "Alien" movie together. At a time when the seemingly finished series are being revived - "Terminator 3", "Alien 5", "Predator 3", "Alien vs. Predator" - "Pitch Black" stands out as a whole new series. Two more sequels are planned. Let's just hope they will not get carried away. I can imagine that in twenty-five years: "Aliens vs. Predator vs. Pitch Black Aliens: * The Fight of the Year". The title "Fight of the Year" can be read with the upcoming movie "Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Leatherface vs. Norman Bates vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. Terminator vs. James Cameron vs. Barny the Dinosaur." <br /> <br /> 4/5.
