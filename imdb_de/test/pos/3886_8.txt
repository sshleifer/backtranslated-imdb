Garlin trumps himself as a scriptwriter in an indie production about a tall man (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with every woman he sees. The laughter comes almost every minute. It is a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man who is looking for love but is ready with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and make the movie really rich. <br /> <br /> Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her role as a receptionist and brings you right into the mood of the rest of the movie. Sara Silverman is great with some of the great stuff she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically great in her role. I just wish it was more of her in the movie because most of me agree. It is certainly refreshing to see her in a tight leather outfit. David Pasquesi was the distant buddy and the voice of reason. Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother, with whom he lives. There were numerous other cameos, all of which performed very well. <br /> <br /> At the premiere, Jeff mentioned that due to production issues he could not work with Bonnie anymore. Nevertheless, it is good if you want more. I think it's the same to keep some things ambiguous so that the audience can think something out to fill in the blanks. The literal title should point this out. Jeff said some of the basic characters were based on his previous relationships. That explains why they work so well. The real-life people are always unusually colorful and make great characters. He is quite different from what you might have expected after seeing Curb Your Enthusiasm and some of his other work. It's one of those exploding things where an actor takes some risks to do something he might always want to do, but could not do matter, setting the style of acting as the center of the story and the direction. It may be a new innovative hybrid of improv and indie filmmaking.
