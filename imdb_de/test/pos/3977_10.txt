Contrary to what many believe is a "anti-system" film. It is an excellent representation of the questionable "system" and how ridiculous it really is. The funny parts of the movie are actually funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who considers this film unrealistic simply denies the natural truths of life. And that's to learn what you enjoy. That's what college is about. <br /> <br /> I think a comment must contain at least 10 lines. I think I gave my opinion. So now I'll write a few lines as a filler. I hope you were entertained during this time. I encourage you to watch the movie. It's worth it as long as you follow him and immerse yourself in the movie.
