The man with the golden arm was one of the first films to focus on the tragedy of heroin addiction as the main theme (and in a sense the message). It's nowhere near a great movie, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's commitment to making it feel real and on the verge of melodrama and naturalism. What I like is that it's not so much a junkie (if you want to read the best issue of Naked Lunch, if you can stand it anyway, except the point), but the nature of the urban environment lives on Frankie Machine. He expects that after he has been released from prison, he will have to go out on the street, become a drummer in a band and legitimize him as a musician. But he has his "crippled" wife Zosch, who can not work and needs money and often complains, and then there is the old neighborhood. He can not help but see Louie (Darren McGavin), who is still playing card games in the back room and, yes, pushing drops. Like Mean Streets, it's hard to escape the minutiae if you do not go. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, Frankie Machine finds it hard not to try and operate in a natural way in this neighborhood. It's just that he can not escape the temptation of garbage (when he has booked against his friend for a false theft, he sees a junkie freaking out and shying away from the fear of going back to his clean self). And to personify Frankie is Sinatra, and I can not see anyone who could have played him, not even Brando's original choice. He fits into the neighborhood and seems to be a guy who should be one step ahead of the game. But Sinatra also has a flaw that he pulls out wonderfully, and when we see him walking into Molly's apartment "Cold Turkey" it's believable, even if it's not the kind of "my" generation of heroin would think (ie Trainspotting and certainly requiem for a dream). If you do not want anything else, you want to watch the movie to see what happens to Sinatra as that character. <br /> <br /> However, the shortcomings can be seen in some other performances, although this is a bit difficult. Eleanor Parker seems to do too much for a good part of the movie, she's fooling Frankie that she's really crippled when she can really go and fool him for some reason. But then it becomes clearer, if it goes on - it should be crazy and crazy with jealousy, and at this level it will be better. In the meantime, Kim Novak is good, if not out of praise, as a possible girl in the side, but more like the voice of reason in history. Then there's a Detective Bendar, which could be one of the most monotonous characters / performances ever. And also Sparrow, Frankie's nerdy friend and the characters of Louie and Schiefka, and all are played as you would expect (McGavin is actually better than OK). Preminger is not very good when it comes to Sinatra. And frankly, some scenes are flat. <br /> <br /> But the man with the Golden Arm fascinates a lot, and not just a part of the sociological interest. It works as a captivating drama and as a message to be conveyed without preaching or fighting. It's a real article, just not exceptional.
