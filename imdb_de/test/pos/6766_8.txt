This movie is a mixture of a dark comedy and a drama. It's about two men who worked in a butcher shop and wanted to build their own. When they had finally fulfilled this dream, they faced a new problem: There were no customers! One day, by accident, a man dies in the refrigerator room, and a new type of butcher shop begins? You start selling human meat and say to customers that it's just chicken? and her business is beginning to improve: Human Meat Sells Well! Oh! I forgot to say something? These guys are not normal! There is really something missing in her brain! <br /> <br /> The movie has some nice dark humor scenes, but in my opinion that's mostly a drama. One that shows us what is in the mind of a psychopath, what are his motives for what he does. I must confess I was a little surprised at the end of the movie, because I never thought they could do it without being discovered, but that's probably because I watch too many Hollywood movies. I mean, we always expect the punishment of the guys doing the "bad things" in Hollywood's cinema. There is always a morality that protects the "good values", although we all know that it does not happen so often in "real life". And I liked this movie mainly because it fits into a kind of cinema that is true, frontal, without false morality, and what "sees" what is behind the "conventional morality" on the other side? It just happens in independent cinema (especially in European)! <br /> <br /> In addition, there are excellent performances of Nikolaj Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen (especially the first) in the roles of the "disturbed guys"? <br /> <br /> Very nice Danish movie!
