Isabelle Huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or another generation. "La Pianiste" really confirms it. As if that was not enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. As you might imagine, these castings are worth the horror we go through. Isabelle and Annie play characters we've never seen on screen. A mother and a daughter, yes, but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes I could not even blink or breathe. Personally, I do not believe in the Director's intentions, I do not think that they (the intentions) go beyond the shocking anecdote and the end made me scream with frustration, but I was intrigued by the story written in the face of the story Sensational Huppert and the violence of Girardot's strength. I warmly recommend it to all movie lovers and collectors of big gigs like me can not afford to miss "La Pianiste".
