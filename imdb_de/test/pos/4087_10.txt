Like some people, I love Stingers! In Norway it was aired much later. This also means that we are in the 176th episode. (Yes, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and go on. I think I'll die the day we hit 192. Stitches could be the series (except for Gray's Anatomy) that I'm really looking at! The actors are incredible! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! I personally think that it is one of the best accesses we have! I know he's not known as SUPER, but she's really a great actress! Stingers lets me become a policeman! I LOVE IT! <br /> <br /> P.S: Do you know if you can buy the episodes?
