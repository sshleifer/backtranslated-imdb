I like Breillat's films, but this is the best I've ever seen to bring the warmth of animals into harmony with sexual intelligence. Anne Parillaud is electric and the script is amazing - especially considering it plays on the set of another movie by Breillat. You do not have to agree with her to get everything out of it. I had to think a lot about vulnerability and power. Imagine a male director with Jeanne's openness-not impossible, but a bit dazzling. The unannounced sexual undercurrents, which are always present when people come together to do something, are exposed to bright light here, but not to a cold light.
