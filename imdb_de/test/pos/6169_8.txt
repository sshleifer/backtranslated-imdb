As the most expensive film ever made in the Czech Republic, it automatically gives the impression that it is overrated and clich√©d (for fear of budget). However, with a budget of 8 million and half of the film in English, this was not a big, high-risk budget. <br /> <br /> What we have is a big epic story about the friendship of two people, the younger Karel and the older Frantisek. As pilots in the Czech Air Force, when the Germans invaded before World War II, they flee the country to England to join the RAF. Their friendship is strained by the love of the same woman. However, there is a friendly bond that goes beyond mere friendly togetherness. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country. Remember that they were not the winners. The defeated Germans were occupied only by the Russians. Funny, exciting, fascinating, beautiful, sad and enlightening, this movie is one of my favorite war movies. What I like most is how they make fun of the British and are remarkably affectionate, giving an amazing insight into the way the British military fought World War II. Forget the recent American efforts (Peal Harbor) This is the best WWII movie for a long time.
