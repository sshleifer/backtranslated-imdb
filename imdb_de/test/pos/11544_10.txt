The numbers do not lie, 109 people have voted for this film. This says a lot about the reputation of one of the most intuitive, insightful comedians of the late 20th century. And for those of you who know the work of Bill Hicks: If he was alive today, imagine what he would have to say about the boy president from his home state? That his short career is not recognized, is a sad situation, and this film or these two films explain why. First, see how his talent was evident from the beginning. Those who knew Bill Hicks always said he was not only funny, but also unique. The film also shows that the quality of its material was too demanding for many in the entertainment industry. His drinking also contributed to his career problems, but that's less obvious in this film. And then the second movie is a complete performance. If you have never seen or heard Bill Hicks, this is a wonderful introduction to the person and their dark but intelligent humor. Mostly due to the fact that the topics are now almost 14 years old and yet ironically up to date, it is underlined that many of the events took place under the first President Bush - first the biography and then the performance - makes you aware How talented this young man was, how quickly his life has passed and how the American media can sometimes act as a great homogenizer. Make sure that nothing is too provocative, nothing will be too interesting And the result? Well, as the man himself said, you sleep in America, your government is in control ........... During his lifetime, at least in the UK, this artist was recognized for his talent and was successful there. Eleven years after his death, 109 people at IMDb can comment on the film. After seeing both, I hope you understand why more people should hear Bill Hicks.
