Despite the New York backdrop and New York characters, "Summer in the City" is not an American movie, it's better than this one. Most unusual is the mixing of styles and genres. Director Niami's shows a skilful touch in the combination of comedy with tragedy, pathos with drama. <br /> <br /> The secret of Niami's success seems to be a Smorgasboard of great characters - everyone could have their own movie - and then fill them with beautifully-realized performances from one of the most wonderfully versatile performers you can find in the same Hardly find land, not to mention the movie, from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti to Robert Burke to Peter Stormare, much more than the bad guys he plays in Hollywood pictures. Even Sandra Bernhard is funny here! <br /> <br /> An added bonus, the cream on the big cake, is John Cale's soundtrack.
