Ahhh ... the 80s. 1982 reminds me of the really crazy time we were in America. Fresh from the 70s "Do What Feels Good", "The Last American Virgin" comes as Wolf in sheep's clothing as another "teenage sex comedy" from the glory days. Sure, there is sex, but I can not think of any other movie - OK, this and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" - which really did not take time between topless teen scenes - there was pretty good stuff here in the split. <br /> <br /> The film follows three hormonal friends. Gary (wants to lose his virginity), Rick (stud incarnate) and David (overweight, but not inexperienced) as they desperately try to make sure that Gary enters the world of masculinity. But on the way to the Kegger, a funny thing happens - Gary falls in love with Karen (pretty brunette who loves the bad guys) and apparently can not go through a sexual conquest that can make David and Rick possible. The only problem is that Rick and Karen get hot and heavy and Karen skips a period. It's Gary who's on her side to get her abortion, and it's Gary who's really worried. But with whom does Karen dance at the end of the film ... Rick. Subtract the "R" and add a "D" if necessary. <br /> <br /> What sets this movie apart from the '80s we're thinking of is that he's trying a real drama on God and not of the "my parents have just retracted the driveway diversity." And you know what? I bought it. <br /> <br /> It was not sloppy. It was not far-fetched. And when Gary sees Rick dance at the house party with Karen at the end of the movie, I actually felt sorry for the guy. Our teenage Romeo actually believed in unrequited love - and when his heart was broken in the end, that somehow touched me. <br /> <br /> So, aside from the T & A, there is a truly credible and compelling story here. Worthy of Oscar? Not a mile away, but I do not know that I drop it into the "Let's go" category. Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," they really tried to make a real movie here, dropping Hi-Jinx where he could.
