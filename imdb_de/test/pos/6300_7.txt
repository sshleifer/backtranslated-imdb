The movie is a really well made movie that looks great and is passionately directed. It can be said that every shot is considered and executed perfectly. For the lovers of cinema, this is above all a great watch that should above all appreciate the beauty and passion for the cinema. <br /> <br /> It's hard to subordinate this movie to a label. It's not really a drama, it's not really a thriller and not a comedy. It's more like a movie with its own style that does things in its own way. It does not necessarily follow the rules of cinema and offers many different elements from many different genres together. <br /> <br /> But just as the movie is its main character, the movie gets slow and boring in some places. The director's artistic style tries to hide the fact that the story is actually quite simple, and it's more like the film relies solely on the style and general atmosphere that the film created. It does not make the movie awful or anything, but it only prevents it from being an absolute must. Partly, the film also feels like it's trying to be too poetic, trying to make the pictures talk too much for themselves. It feels a bit over the top in some areas, though it still works great for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> It offers great camera work and some unique storytelling a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
