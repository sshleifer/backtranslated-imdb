This movie starts a bit slow and will run towards the end. This is not bad, it was done to illustrate the degression of the main character's character traits. So if you do not have tragedies, this is not your movie. It's the thought philosophy of this movie that's worth it. If you liked Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment," you'll probably like it just because of the comparisons. The intriguing question posed by the film is, "What is the reason why a well-known writer completely disregards his publicly valued ideas for another set?" The new ideas contrast with the status quo. If you are conservative, you will not like this movie. Among other philosophical questions, I have to admit that the film was also aesthetically pleasing. The grassy hills and beautiful scenery helped me overcome the slow start, and colorful icons were also used to represent the state of mind of the main characters. If that kind of thing does not impress you, skip it 7.
