I just saw it on the cable. I liked it. It kept my interest and the dramatic decisions were good. The old couple was very good and could be a bit scary. The cinematography is not great, but the shabby video also contributes to realism, so it's a compromise, you understand? At times, the girl beat the accent of New England too hard. The accent would come and go somehow. Still, I thought the movie was done well overall. The plot was strong and there was a dramatic tension because you felt it was a subtle mystery, even if things seemed banal. Good job for little money. Another good SUNY Purchase filmmaker. Keep it up.
