Jimmy Stewart brings to life the story of Charles Lindbergh as he tells almost the entire movie as he crosses the Atlantic. It works well with flashbacks about Lindebergh's life. The score by Franz Waxman is brilliant-cut and really gives the picture a heroic feeling. One of Stewart's best roles, and this movie can deliver again and again. Look for performances by Murray Hamilton (The Mayor in the JAWS movie) as Bud Gurney.Comes will be released on DVD 8-15-06 with the release of some of the other Stewarts classics. I consider Jimmy Stewart as the best actor in America and do not tire of seeing him in any movie I see. Look at this picture and you agree.
