Yes, I'm sentimental and yes, I love movies where kids are the better people. Although Klatret√∏sen has some logical or even plottheapte defects. These are more than compensated for by the great play of the children (Julia's first film role ever!) And the charm of a dogma film (this kind of cinematographic art has long been loved by dogma, since Herzog's heart of glass). Well, I cried for the last fifteen minutes, which had a higher tear factor than Bambi or Fly Away Home for me.
