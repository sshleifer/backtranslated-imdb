A ghastly no-brainer comedy in which the comedian Mark Blankfield depicts Jekyll as a sincere physician who is deeply involved in his research. Once he's snorted his experimental formula, he's turned into the landscape-consuming Hyde, causing endless trouble for everyone around him. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. It has a really crazy, crazy approach. It's full speed ahead with an outrageously stupid but undeniably funny joke after another. Funny lines and visual gags are available in abundance; Blankfield plays every role for everything it's worth. One highlight is that Hyde becomes a song. "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hyde" is quite catchy and even now I still hear it in my head. The highlight even goes so far as to fake old b & w horror movies. <br /> <br /> Also, the side cast is pretty lively, with Bess Armstrong as the fiancé fiancé, Krista Errickson as the spunky ivy, and Tim Thomerson as the extravagant fellow Knute Lanyon. I wish I could have achieved more with Thomerson's character because I'm a fan of the man, but it's always nice to see him in something. <br /> <br /> A wide selection of familiar faces in front of the camera: Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brocco, Liz Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensign, John Dennis Johnston, Art La Fleur, Lin Shaye and George Chakiris all in one Cameo like him. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that if you prefer a smart, exciting comedy, you should avoid it at all costs. But for those who enjoy a crazy, politically incorrect, enjoyably fun time, this could only do the trick. <br /> <br /> One of the best bits is saved for the last time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
