Biographical story from the life of Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly nonstop across the Atlantic in 1927 aboard his Airplane Spirit of St. Louis. <br /> <br /> While not one of the best films by director Billy Wilder, it has some impressive production values, especially for a movie made 50 years ago. The story is well told and the performances are good too, if not outstanding. <br /> <br /> A key limiting factor in storytelling is that Lindbergh flew alone and without a radio, which means he has no one to talk to. This required a few different narrative techniques such as internal monologues, talking to a housefly, and occasional conversations, especially when fatigue set in. Also, to avoid a longer sequence of the famous flight, he is interrupted flashbacks from his life and the methodical preparations for the flight. Charles Lindbergh was a great hero of his time, but his controversial beliefs would affect his legacy somewhat. Nevertheless, he would continue to work in the aviation sector and help as a civilian aircraft consultant in US efforts during World War II. Jimmy Stewart undoubtedly had the flying background to support his portrayal of Lindbergh. During the Second World War, he rose to the rank of colonel of the US Air Force and would achieve the rank of brigadier in the reserves after the war.
