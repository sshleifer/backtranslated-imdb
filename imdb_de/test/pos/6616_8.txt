I have seen this movie twice over cable now. The first time I saw it, it surprised me. The skaters I saw were the guys we tracked in the pages of the skateboarder magazine in the late 70's. These were the guys we copied and wanted to try skating. I'm glad that finally a film was made that describes exactly how everything came about. I am now almost 40 years old and think a pretty honest guy with all the problems of life. This movie brought me back very well. Back to the empty pools, the backyard halfpipes and the road drives to Cherry Hill, NJ. I guess, to really understand and appreciate this movie, you had to live it. Otherwise, it probably will not affect you like me. But for those of you (and you know who you are) who lived it, you know exactly what I'm talking about! Anyway, I do not care who you are, if you have the chance to see this movie ... do it! Thanks to the Z-Boys of Dogtown for the memories of my youth and to Stacy for this movie! WELL DONE!
