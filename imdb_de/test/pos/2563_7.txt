The trailer for this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that he missed most of the film, which is about a developing, though rather simple, relationship between Lazarus and Rae from which they try to recover their past pain with each other. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no wonder there's a lot of implicit sex. Basically, Black Snake Moan is a basic story of salvation and the healing power of helping another person. Maybe it's just me, but I think poor Lazarus should have focused his story on more. He is a hurting man after his wife left him, but we can never quite see how it helps him to help Rae solve her past pains. It's just an indication that this is the case - in essence, he plays the wizard who helps the young Rae overcome her curse with a big, old chain and some blues. <br /> <br /> I like the story, but I wish it was a bit more balanced and did not have to rely on the sensational. The minor characters were pretty decent, if simple, and I liked the music. The drama was good enough, though I can not be sure if the Rae character is completely believable. But maybe that's just my naivety. <br /> <br /> All in all, I liked the movie, but I was not forced to. Maybe I'm too critical, but the story seems a bit too practical to be completely credible, and although it all seemed very cool, I could never really buy it. The chain thing was a little too far-fetched for me. Yet, for those seeking dramatic redemption stories with a dash of blues, this can provide some entertainment. 10.7
