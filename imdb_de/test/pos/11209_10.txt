It's probably been a year since I saw Uzak, but it left strong memories of the two main characters, the exhausted photographer Mahmut and his naive cousin from the village of Yusuf. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie with very little dialogue and a pretty limited plot. This has obviously annoyed some viewers. But the film constructs such a painfully credible portrait of Mahmut and Yusuf that there are just as many emotional tensions as in the fastest thriller. <br /> <br /> Just to be clear, in this movie there is no padding - in the long-term breaks where no one there happens so much in the emotions of the characters (and in those who watch them), as you could bear. Go to it to watch it awake and attentive, and you'll be more captivated than stunned. Uzak sounds true in many ways and this sincerity is probably the greatest achievement. People do not struggle with events and problems, but also with each other. In fact, there is probably no point in the entire movie where the main characters (Mahmut, Yusuf, and Mahmut's ex-wife Nazan) are not against it. Much of it is true worldwide: Country cousin Yusufs may have deliberately naive expectation that a job on a ship will fall into his lap; Mahmut's urbanized cynicism and unwillingness to sympathize with Yusuf. <br /> <br /> Other truths are more specific to Turkey: Yusuf's lack of understanding that Mahmut could tolerate his clenched teeth; Yusuf wavers between macho ambition and wide-awkward awkwardness as he tries to meet a woman. Undoubtedly, Uzak is a pretty bleak movie, and one of Ceylan's strengths is not to beat us with the movie's themes he's exploring. At least for me, I totally believed in the behavior of his characters. All small failed attempts at connection and little cruelty sound so right. And yet, I did not go away with the message "The world is so", but got instead, "That's how we treat each other sometimes."
