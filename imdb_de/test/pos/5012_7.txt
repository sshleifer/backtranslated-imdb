The basis for this dynamic docudrama is the true story of one of the most extraordinary card players of all time. <br /> <br/> STUEY is a close, cohesive biopic of a real poker ace whose life is a one-way trip to the world Highway to Hell with a few detours. <br /> <br /> This dramatic feature is very different from other movies about poker.
