What we have here is a movie that is perfect for anyone who participates in the world of post-industrialism: those who sit in their privatized home, make money buying and selling senseless goods, and maintain a system that does nothing other than the preservation values ​​self. <br /> <br /> The beautiful filming (I appreciate fixes of the '35s and softboxes again and again) makes it an even more unusual place to travel. Both are pleasing to look at, but frightening to understand (maybe that's too dramatic, but it's too dramatic.) True). <br /> <br /> Andreas' journey through his hell is overwhelmingly tragic. His quest is honorable, commendable and valuable. The conclusion is necessary and we are not sure if he is feeling better. This is the perfect conclusion. <br /> <br /> Breve! Highly recommended for all those who look critically at their world and especially for those who do not (perhaps this will give one or two thoughts).
