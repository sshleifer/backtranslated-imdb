Whoever loves my children has changed my heart, it has cried me all the way, most of all I cried when the family had to say goodbye to the baby, I cried the most with it and every time a child was adopted I cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother. It was sad for her to lose her mother. I felt sorry for the epileptic child. I was glad that he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. For me, this boy was what I thought was special because he went to a home. I feel that I'm special because I'm in a world with Aspergers syndrome, and sometimes when I'm feeling bad sometimes cry. I really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10. A true story, very good. Another movie that would bring tears to my eyes would be Tuesday with Morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805).
