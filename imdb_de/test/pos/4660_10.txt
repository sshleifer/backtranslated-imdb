WEEE is still fun! As with most of my friends, we had watched this film at a young age at HBO and have been looking for a copy of it ever since. When they finally released it a couple of years ago, we had a Midnight Madness party ... and the movie went well. Sure, it's pure cheese, but it's still a lot of fun. If you have not seen MM at a young age, you may not appreciate the value today.
