Too bad the bad reviewer did not like this wonderful movie. What a sad life he has to lead! <br /> <br /> This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, but it's not dark or preaching like the movie "normal people". It's mostly funny, if technically not a comedy. <br /> <br /> The whole thing feels a bit like a fantasy, maybe Shakespear's "Midsummer Night's Dream". Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-offensive script that does not miss a beat. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing it every time this movie is over the cable. It's like reading a favorite book again.
