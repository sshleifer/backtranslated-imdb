After recently buying Universal's Marlene Dietrich DVD collection, I just wanted to see "Golden Earrings." The idea of ​​a 40-year-old Marlene Dietrich as a gypsy in a romantic war romanticism seemed unusual and implausible. I should not have worried. With all the professional talent put into these old movies, it's really hard to miss. The movie was a pleasure to see; It is a classic. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie was Dietrich, who does the gypsy role perfectly. The make-up, the lighting, the photography and their performance together make a truly amazing and unforgettable character. I had never seen Dietrich convincingly play a "good" woman - but she does it here! She played many heartless vamps in these great Sternberg movies, so it's refreshing to see her in a down to earth, laid-back role, playing an exotic but very human character with beautiful romance. The love story is believable, optimistic and the happy ending is extremely satisfying.
