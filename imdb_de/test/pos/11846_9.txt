I loved this movie. It's a lot of laughter. The acting is good and the writing is really sharp. I would rather watch a hundred films like this than repeat and repeat THREE LORD OF THE RINGS. <br /> <br /> It's a low-budget matter and seems to be turned on DV are great together Why do you have a minimum of ten lines? I am not a critic, just a patron. <br /> <br /> I doubt very much that Quentin Tarantino could write such a funny picture without filling it with self-satisfied violence. This movie should be seen on more than one screen. I laughed from beginning to end. >
