As a bit of garbage collector I stumbled over this little treasure. Action, romance, crooked cops, violence. It's all here and not a single one was pulled from the right. I was in love immediately. Then something strange happened the second time. I became addicted. I thought it was a movie that was to be rented only once. Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He did not have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. That is very commendable. It also shows that he made the film for himself. I do not know how many of you heard Rudy Ray's music, but if not, he has quite a few albums that go back to the fifties.
