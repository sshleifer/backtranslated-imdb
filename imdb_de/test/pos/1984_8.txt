WARNING: PLOT SPOILER <br /> <br /> David Cronenberg's ever-abnormal films are certainly an acquired taste. Fans of his previous films will probably like 'eXistenZ', but definitely not for the squeamish. All the usual elements are here. A skin case (hooked in the back), buckets of blood, a bone weapon, and a manic mechanic, just to name a few. The result is partly good, sometimes bad and sometimes just scary. But the film has undeniable originality. <br /> <br /> Despite overuse of ?? Madness proves a point - Virtual reality games can be dangerous for some people. In the film, a character shoots someone dead and claims that he is "annoying" (assuming he was still in the game). But the question remains whether this really happened or if it was an event in this breathtakingly lifelike game. eXistenZ leads to a conclusion that can be addressed in various ways. <br /> <br /> Despite some extras and gooks, it was simply your classic "It was all a dream?" or was it a turn? It's a clever surprise and answers a few questions, but to say that the entire movie has led to this moment is a bit disappointing. With only 97 minutes, it could have taken a little longer. In a peculiar way, the film raises moral questions, but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first major role for quite some time. But her character does not have enough features to make her jump off the screen or even give her a sympathetic character. Jude Law (equipped with a strange American accent) is good because your average Joe is sucked into this abnormal world. We see the movie from his perspective. <br /> <br /> 'eXistenZ' is anything but flawless, but it's certainly an unforgettable movie experience. There are tons of strange features that correspond to the similar styles of David Lynch (what next? - consumed by a question mark?!?!?!). It's definitely not for everyone, but worth it. My IMDb rating: 6.2 / 10.
