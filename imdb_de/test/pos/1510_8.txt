Un Gatto nel Cervello, or Nightmare Concert, as is more commonly known among English-speaking audiences, begins as horror film director Lucio Fulci (played by the man himself Lucio Fulci) goes for lunch after shooting a very bloody and violent scene However, he orders steak and has a terrible vision of cannibalism. The grotesque visions, hallucinations and dreams continue and affect his state of mind. Fulci decides to seek help and contact Professor Egon Schwarz (Dvid L. Thompson) for psychiatric help. Black claims that Fulci can not separate fantasy from reality, and agrees to help him. Black, however, has a more sinister ulterior motive, as a serial killer begins brutally killing prostitutes. Fulci believes he could be responsible. <br /> <br /> This Italian production was co-written and directed by Lucio Fulci, who also starred as a horror film director named Lucio Fulci in the film, which does not really feel like an effort, though Un Gatto nel Cervello I preferred it for that. The screenplay by Fulci, John Fitzsimmons, Giovanni Simonelli and Antonio Tentori is nothing more than a worn-out excuse to cut a lot of bloody footage from other Italian films together. I suppose it's good enough for its purpose. Seeing Fulci on the screen has a certain fascination if you are a fan of his or are familiar with his films. The end is very hectic, as if they run out of money, since there is only one policeman to tell Fulci that they killed the killer and that's it. Another thing about this end, when the two policemen put the white sheet over the dead murderer in the field and then left them there without further police rally. I mean, would the police in Italy leave a corpse in the middle of a field on its own? It moves at a good pace and if you like your gore then you need to see this. If you do not like Gore, then hate it with passion. It all depends on your attitude, so the choice is yours. <br /> <br /> Director Fulci was never the most artistically accomplished filmmaker and shows it here because his footage is bland and flat and looks like it was being filmed for TV. The footage from the other films (7 in total) does not do this. It fits in with the stuff Fulci shot, and it's obvious this was made up of different films. If you're looking for Gore, you've cracked the jackpot, splintering people with chainsaws, flinging them through meat mills, their faces melted, there are a few beheadings, there are some throat slits, one's body gets under a car under one Tongue crushed is torn out, someone has his throat squeezed when a wheelchair runs over it, there are a lot of stitches, someone has removed the belly with a hook, there is a rotten corpse with maggots, a hand is cut off, someone has his head beaten in & her eye falls out, a bloody death by a piano rope as it cuts through someone's throat, there are a lot of severed limbs, gallons of blood spurting around and a scene where some cats eat brains and there's more. Some of the special effects, however, are a bit spotty and look cheesy. <br /> <br /> With an alleged budget of around $ 100,000, it shows that this looks pretty cheap, but it has no visual style or artistic value. Why should you wish this, in turn, if you have a Nazi orgy sequence and can see a wall-to-wall gore? Acting in this movie is terrible, including Fulci. Un Gatto nel Cervello is a top movie if you are a gore-hound like me, but if you are looking for something that contains some more substance or even some substance then this is not for you. This is the kind of movie that separates people right in the middle. They will either love what he does or hate him.
