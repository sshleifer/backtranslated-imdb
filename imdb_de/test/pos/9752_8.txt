I found this movie instructive, entertaining and very moving. I was impressed when I learned to what extent Justice Arbor had contributed during her time in Kosovo. Wendy Crewson is heavily undervalued and it's good to see her in a Canadian production. Other easily recognizable stars are Leslie Hope (24) and John Corbett (Sex in the City.). <br /> <br /> Although the plot of this film may not be quite factual, it has made me want to learn more about the word of Arbor. A great movie for young women. <br /> <br /> I say the movie is a must.
