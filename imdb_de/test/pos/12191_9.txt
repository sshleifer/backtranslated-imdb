Although the film is not true to the original novels, but creates a modern gothic vampire vision. Someone tried to offend QotD by calling a 1.5 hour video clip. Actually it is a supplement. The ubiquitous gothic music combined with the music video-like recordings made the movie so moody - and "Queen of the Damned" is a mood-driven story. I understand the hard fans do not complain about the modifications of the story. The plot has been changed to be less confusing to viewers who do not know the novels. The number of characters has been reduced and I have no problem changing lestats or skipping Mekare's character. The biggest change - the romance of Lestat and Jesse - seemed to me a very nice asset. <br /> <br /> Actually, I believe that a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow and gloomy mood, which was perfect for New Orleans and Louis' anxiety in the 19th century, would not match Lestat's rebellion and his music. While the book may be slow, descriptive and combine multiple elements, it can convey it well, but the movie just can not do it without getting chaotic. "Vampire Lestat" and "Queen of the Damned" can be divided into at least three movies - the creators had to choose something. <br /> <br /> Some of the special effects, like flying or going out of the flames, were the only thing I really did not like in this movie. But Akasha's death was very nice. The cast was good, Stuard Townsend was particularly convincing as Lestat at the concert, but I preferred Banderas as Armand. I loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius. And of course, Aaliyah was perfect with her quasi-ancient Egyptian accent. <br /> <br /> So, if you're dealing with Gothic music and vampire dillemas of loneliness and eternity (and do not look at books as movie scenarios), "Queen of the Damned" is one of the few movies where vampires are more than bloodsucking monster. But please do not compare it to the "Interview" movie. It has a completely different style, just as different as Louis and Lestat. Personally, I find it exciting to first observe the existence of a vampire from Louis' view of "hunger for food" and then switch to a morale that has no morals left, but surprisingly open to a vampire, Lestat. <br /> <br /> I'm giving "Queen" 8 out of 10, as it had some technical flaws, but I decided to give 9 because it is underestimated by people who hate it, simply because it does not match their view of the books, which is clearly seen looking at the voice distribution.
