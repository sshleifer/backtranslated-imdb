Great music, great dancing, a sexy star (Swayze) and the actual sexual desire of a female figure (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters motivated mainly by lust, and it's a nice change. I also think that the film captures very well what it's like to be a teenager who deals with issues of teaching and suddenly comes across ideals to the reality. Of course it is juicy at the moment - it is after all a film musical - but all in all it is a real treat - a funny romance and also politically enlightened. This movie also has one of my favorite movie series, "I Wore the Watermelon."
