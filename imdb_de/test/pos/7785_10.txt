In my opinion, a film can best be judged by the number of "best scenes". There are probably at least 80-90 scenes throughout the movie that are likely to be rated "best" by anyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is a masterpiece. Period. I know many who called it before its time, probably because it was bombed at the box office. However, I think that every generation can relate to this film and has a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I am personally happy that Mahmood is also part of the movie. His role is not so "fleshy", but it's good to see he's part of the cast in the funniest Hindi movie ever made.
