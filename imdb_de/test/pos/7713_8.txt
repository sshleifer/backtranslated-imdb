The eighth and penultimate successor to the Animatrix is ​​the only one very similar to this one. This requires two of The Matrix's most important types of filmed entertainment inspirations and combines them incredibly well. This is the trilogy in this aspect, the tone, immensely faithful. The animation is a beautiful, breathtaking anime. The style that is omnipresent is Noir. The plot is appropriate, and storytelling is just as right as the music. The sound is generally fantastic and really helps to solidify mood and atmosphere as well as drawings and designs. The speech output is impeccable. This is one of only two where people play their roles in the movies as well, and both have Anne-Moss, who is the only one of them in that role. This is one of the best of the nine and also one of my personal favorites. That takes about ten minutes. The pace is perfect. It never slows down much, but it's not overwhelming either. The end could not have been more appropriate. This shares with Kid's Story a nine and a half minute game, and it's well done and informative. I highly recommend this to any fan of the universe and the two genres that make it up. 8.10
