A small city school teacher (Geena Davis) is beginning to realize that she has suffered from amnesia and was really a secret killer of the government! Soon there are men behind her and a small private detective (Samuel L. Jackson). <br /> <br /> It was action packed, with great special effects and really funny lineups (especially from Jackson)). Although sometimes the action gets a bit silly, who cares? Are not films thought of as a good time? <br /> <br /> Craig Bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. The movie itself was a really good time. Do not expect to think too much about it, because if you take it too seriously, the movie is not going to be fun, it's stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie does not deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name.
