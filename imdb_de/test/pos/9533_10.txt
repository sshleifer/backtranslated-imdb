Edith Nesbitt's best book has been adapted into a really great movie, I love it. The film itself has a wonderful cinematography and a fine realization of the theme. The end is enough to make you cry because it is so beautiful. Lionel has made some really great movies like the Amazing Mr Blunden, but this is his best movie as a director. The costumes were absolutely pretty, in keeping with the beauty of the landscape, and the sparkling and practical script helped. However, it is the quality of acting that holds this film together, as it is no less than incredible. Dinah Sheridan is appropriately sincere as a mother, a very important feature of the character, and Bernard Cribbins was hilarious as a perks. In fact, I preferred Perks on film because it's not so humorous in the book. The kids were perfect. Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett both gave spirited performances, but Jenny Agutter's charming portrayal of Bobbie impressed me the most. Another special mention is the beautiful music of Johnny Douglas, the theme music reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's Smile. Finally, a funny and moving masterpiece that is better than the book, I think. 10/10. Bethany Cox.
