I finally saw this on video after hearing about it for years. It's by no means a perfect movie, but it's strangely hypnotic - one of those rare special films that creates its own world. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** First the bad stuff. The scenes in Burkewaite's class are agonizing. Even if the topic is social studies, this guy is far too exaggerated. His speeches are so overworked that they are ridiculous. And no teachers I ever had would grill their students like that and say to those who protest, "Shut up!". These scenes are short, but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. And how the hell does Layne end up leaving the police station? And what happened to Samson's car after the first scene when he drove into town? He spends the rest of the movie with Layne or Feck. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Ahhh, Feck ... this guy is great. Dennis Hopper effortlessly steals the movie. "Check's in the mail", "I love company", "You're my friend" - every line is a classic. He gives Feck an internal logic that makes the story work. Incredible, he actually makes the audience feel compassion for this guy, especially when Samson talks about his future. <br /> <br /> In contrast, Crispin Glover is sometimes hard to take. Still, the scenes he drove around in the Beetle are perfect - kids with cars in high school always have something to do and buds to do it. The restrained attitude of Matt is a good foil for Layne - her friendship is credible. Glover's behaviors are a bit much, but he's consistently consistent. He pushes the action forward and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does - imagine this movie if Layne is a zombie like Matt or Samson - Snoozefest! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** What worries "River's Edge" is the fact that Samson is not really evil in the usual sense. He's a boring guy who's tired of being taken for granted - in other words, he's like thousands of other boring guys. After he kills Jamie, he begins to unravel, which creates tension as we wait to see him snap again. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Part of the appeal of this film is the way the action revolves around the teenagers and their point of view. The parents are weird relief - Clarissa's mother, Tony's father - or overwhelmed - Matt's mother. This underscores how children hold together for the attention no one else gives them. The story remains focused on relationships within the clique, emphasizing that the only adult they can connect with is Feck. "River's Edge" is a textbook on alienation. It conveys how awkward, mysterious and disturbing the youth is like no other movie.
