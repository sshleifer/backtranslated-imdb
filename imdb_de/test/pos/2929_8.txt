This was another great episode from the 11th season of South Park. <br /> <br /> Cartman fakes the Tourette Syndrome to say what he wants without causing trouble. He can swear by the other children in the school. Kyle tells the director that Cartman is pretending. But she does not believe it. Chris Hansen plans to visit Cartman at Dateline to speak live and uncensored on Tourette syndrome. But later, Cartman becomes so addicted that he can say what he wants, and later, by mistake, he begins to say embarrassing stuff. This was a funny episode about Cartman's Tourette syndrome. I recommend it to any South Park fan.
