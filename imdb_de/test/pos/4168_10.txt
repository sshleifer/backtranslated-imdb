The title of my summary pretty much covers my rating. <br /> <br /> For me, that's what Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was for someone who was 5 years older. As I missed this little pop culture wave, I hugged the toy line and the TV. Series that was Mighty Max with both arms. <br /> <br /> Want to know how I got it? I went as Mighty Max for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Thank god for the internet. Thanks to Demonoid, I saw this great show from my childhood for the first time in over a decade last week. <br /> <br /> I'm watching this right now, having just been recognized by Rob Paulson from Animaniacs, and I also love the celebrity humor in "Tar Wars". 4 minutes in, and they have already mentioned By NAME: Clint Eastwood, Governor Arnold, Dustin Hoffman, John Wayne and Ace Ventura. Hell's yes. <br /> <br /> Damn, it's not until I've written this here that I realize there's NO ROAD IN HELL. I can give this series less than a perfect score. All imperfections have been lost in the fog of time. <br /> <br /> This is my childhood. That's awesomeness. This is the powerful one.
