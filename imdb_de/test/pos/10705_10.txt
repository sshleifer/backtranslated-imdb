Producer Matt Mochary stumbled upon the theme of the film, Anderson Sa (leader of the AfroReggae music movement), while on a trip to the Hewlett Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. Mochary was so moved by Sas story that he called his friend, NYC filmmaker Jim Zimbalist, who quit his job and went to Mochary in Brazil to work on a documentary on Sa, the Rio favelas, and the culture of violence /> The first part of the film shows the culture of violence in Rios Favelas (Shantytowns, where the poor live) through police raids and attacks on residents. The material is graphic and shocking. <br /> <br /> The favelas' negativity springs from the charismatic Anderson Sa, who has overcome a potential drug trafficking career to launch the AfroReggae movement that combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture, reggae, ska and other elements to a fast, percussive style of music that has since spread to other parts of the world. You can not help but get carried away by the music, especially when you see the local kids get involved in Sas school, which he founded to keep kids away from drug gangs. The rest of the film follows Sas meteoric rise and his positivity changes many lives of children to seek a life beyond the drug race. SPOILER: Just as the filmmakers thought they were filming, there is an incredible, life-changing event that is believed to dissolve. The movie will then continue and you will be held in your seat until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is a response to "City of God" and a worthy one. The bleak situation presented in this film is refuted by a real example of how the inhabitants of the favela can overcome their plight and use their resources for constructive purposes. You can not help it and do not like it when Anderson Sa succeeds. <br /> <br /> This movie is terribly filmed, fast paced and quite exciting. After the overwhelming response from the audience at the SilverDocs screening last night, the film was due to be distributed in the US in the US and the dull soundtrack should also be released. Keep an eye on this superlative documentary - it's awesome!
