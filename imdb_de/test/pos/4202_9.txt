Very good movie from 1939, in which John Garfield plays another boxer, who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. The problem is that the murderer and the girl from Garfield, Ann Sheridan, are killed in a short but good performance while trying to escape the police. A criminal lawyer persuades Garfield to flee to New York with the Dead End Kids. They were sent there with a funding program to save them from further difficulties. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garfield finds a new love interest, but has to hide his identity like everyone thinks that he was not only the murderer, but was also the victim of the car accident. May Robson is fabulous as a granny-type who runs the place for stubborn youth. Claude Rains is also effective in the role of the detective suspecting that Garfield is still alive and following him in Arizona when a picture of him is taken. The movie is really about Garfield's relationship with the boys. While the ending is good, you want Garfield to return to New York to proclaim his innocence.
