I think FARSCAPE is the best scifi since Babylon 5 and is one of the best sci-fi TV series ever (ranked # 1 with Dr. Who, Blake's 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and the aforementioned B5). I think the characters and races of Farscape are much more interesting and inventive than the typical "human-with-birth marks" that can be found in many series. The effects are pretty good and the stories are captivating. Although I missed most of Season 2 and some of Season 1, I find the character development very well done.
