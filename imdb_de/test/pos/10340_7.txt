The plot of this movie is as stupid as a sack of hair. Jimmy Smit plays a character who may be upset by the ridiculousness of the story. He is evil and a woman thugs. It's a character as far removed from his NYPD and LA Law roles as you could possibly get. <br /> <br /> If you thought he had the looks and acting skills to play the really bad boy role, she is your present. <br /> <br /> But !!!!!! !! Mary Louis Parker wears black miniskirts and small black mini dresses throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> She has always had some of the best legs in the history of movies. Therefore, the film is worthwhile for this leg lover. <br /> <br /> I would buy the DVD for that reason only if it were available.
