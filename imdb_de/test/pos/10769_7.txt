Strangely enough, the Independent Film Channel showed this movie a week after showing KARATE BEAR FIGHTER - even though the Bear movie was the second in the trilogy and this movie was the first !!! What did they think? While all three films are said to be based on the life of this great Kyokushin Karate Master, you can not help believing that you need to beautify the story - especially in this first movie. Sure, the guy obviously fought and killed a bull and later a bear (in fact, he fought and killed MANY bulls during his career), but in this movie, which plays in the early 50s at the end of the movie, he's actually the hero Fights against 60 guys and kills many of them brutally. I just can not imagine that this really happened. So I checked a bit and found that many of the details are correct, but part of the movie is a bunk! Yes, he killed a self-defense man and yes, he followed the widow and her son and worked for her for a year - trying to get her to forgive him. But the end of the movie is great to watch, but hogwash. To see one of his opponents bang his head and all the other bloody details could not have happened, otherwise the Japanese government would have locked up Oyama to protect society! The movie is entertaining and the fights are excellent. There are no complaints about the act or actions. The only minor complaint is the camera work, which is a bit sloppy in some fight scenes. Despite this little complaint, this is a very enjoyable movie. In many ways, the wandering karate master theme is reminiscent of the Zatoichi movies - which is a lot of fun, but many of the exploits are really impossible. <br /> <br /> For information: There is an Englishman dubbed version of this movie titled "Champion of Death" and I have just seen it. It's not a bad sync and it was a mailbox (a big plus), but I prefer the subtitle version.
