Damien O'Donnell has a great track record, and in this film he treats a very delicate topic with sensitivity, but does not manage to lard the film. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie that is funny and sad bits and it lets you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know and take a look - FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent and Dublin plays a major role. This film will change the way you see people with disabilities and also provide you with a very entertaining night in the cinema. I can not wait for it to appear on DVD.
