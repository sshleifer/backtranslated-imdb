To be honest, I thought that this movie would be a Japanese drama. I was totally wrong This movie is based on the popular Japanese anime novel of the same name. It tells the story of a city cursed in English by Uzumaki or The Spiral. Gradually, the inhabitants of the city are slowly becoming dangerously and violently obsessed with spirals, and some of the residents actually become living things that have a kind of spiral like a snail. <br /> <br /> The film was a huge, random, sour trip that was distorted with romance and drama. A kind of twisted drama. What bothers this movie is the way some people are obsessed with The Spiral. For example: One of the fathers has a garage with house items that have spirals incorporated into them, a girl took her extremely long hair and teased an insanely huge, spiral-like style. A child slowly turned into a human slug, a man could twist his body into a spiral shape, a woman tried to cut her ear to get the cochlea inside her, and a teen ran over herself, turning him around Car tires could turn and a child stuffed himself into a washing machine so he could become a spiral. <br /> <br /> Another very disturbing aspect of this very well syndicated is the atmospheric tone and style in which this movie was filmed. The camera angles contribute to the psychotic and twisted story, so to a very good cinematography. The overall color of this picture gives a somewhat denied story. The color scheme is a mix of lime green, yellow and some orange, and the special effects on some spirals are superb. <br /> <br /> Like many Japanese films, this one has an undertone of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy. With all the spirals and strange events in the city, however, it's difficult to keep up with the relationship between the two teenagers. But in a way it's very irrelevant, more like a second-hand story that has nothing to do with the actual story of the spiral-obsessed city. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes very different and bizarre foreign films. It just has enough weirdness and madness, it touched me.
