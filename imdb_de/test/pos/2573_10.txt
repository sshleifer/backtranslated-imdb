This is the first movie I have given in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote it, that was the case. A $ 4 mil box is a shame. People do not know what this is about. If you value the blues or just use good music, that's just a reason to look at it. How many people knew Jackson could sing and damn good. They hear books and films that speculate that salvation is at stake. When you have seen this, you will never be able to forgive this trivial use of the word. Yes, it's coarse-grained, sexy, insidious, bizarre and real. Is not that the best reason to watch a movie? Those who get my meaning will not see this week anymore.
