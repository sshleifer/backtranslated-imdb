After seeing and loving this movie in Australia, I definitely wanted to get paws on a copy. I got a DVD on DVD, just to find out that it's a completely different process. <br /> <br /> The native Australain editing I saw is more snappy. The United Kingdom, and I suppose the Europeans spent much more on the narrator played by Jimmy's dead brother. And in truth, that and a few other points are not really useful, but the editing of Oz is just nimble and I think safer. <br /> <br /> I can not say why they felt that they needed to be developed for the overseas market. <br /> <br /> One that you choose. <br /> <br /> I went for both.
