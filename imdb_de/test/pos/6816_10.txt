For a first director, this is a really amazing little movie, though I have to admit that it's a bit hard to see and will probably offend the feelings of many who see it, as the movie definitely speaks in favor of assisted suicide. What I loved about the movie, however, was that I had no idea what this movie was about until the movie was more than half finished and I was addicted by then. I was very surprised at the introduction of the theme very professional style of the movie - with some of the best movies I've ever seen in a short film. In addition, this camera work was so well combined with music and images that the movie was just beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a controversial movie. I myself have problems with what I think about this debate, but the film has managed to make such a smart and intelligent statement that I really have to respect the team that made this film.
