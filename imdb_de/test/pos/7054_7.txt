I liked the movie for the most part, but I should have said that there was someone in the lead besides Bill Murray who would not have been so good. He brings in an energy that makes this movie a step higher than it would otherwise have been. Above all, I enjoyed the pranks that were drawn to one guidebook, and there are other funny things in this movie, like the Hot Dog Eating Contest. This film would also make the stage for summer camp movies with the competition at the end. Almost every camp movie has either this or the recalcitrant or distressed children's plot, or a combination of both. This series would also require a bit of a weird sound change as this and two are family-friendly movies, while part three and four are more adult-oriented, more like the old teen sex comedies of the time. It was the opposite of the Police Academy films that went from R to PG-13 to PG movies. This series goes from the opposite to R. Nevertheless, this first and only good series due to Bill Murray is worth a lot of giggling.
