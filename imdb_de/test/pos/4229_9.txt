I expected it to be just like the others, trying to be scary. Somewhere along the line, the authors must have realized this and have taken the film in a completely different direction, ignoring the other films in principle. This feels more like a different movie than after the fourth entry in the Child's Play series. The new idea works and makes it by far the best in the series.
