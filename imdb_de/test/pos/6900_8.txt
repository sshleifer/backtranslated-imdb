OK. Finally a horror movie that was done well. As soon as I heard the music, I knew that some effort was being made to accomplish what I consider an almost masterpiece of good old horror. Zombies, whores, liquor, grave painting and much more. A great cast, well played, well judged, well written - there was hardly a mistake. Even the American actors with Irish / English accents have really made it. I thought actor Larry Fessenden looked familiar. It was this missing tooth. Eventually, I realized that guy was starring in "Habit," a movie about vampires in NYC. I thought that he was outstanding in this role. Now I wonder if he is American or not. His accent was so convincing in "I Sell" that I thought he must have grown up on the Emerald Isle, not the US. Apparently he is a born and raised New Yorker. A great actor - really made the role in this movie his own. Nothing beats a horror movie shot in Europe in the early 19th century (like the old Hammer Flicks). I recommend anyone who wants to have a great time watching this well-built movie.
