This movie is a good example of why the Shaw Brothers are some of the best directors (probably the best in the Kung Fu category). The film is well thought out, the story is excellent and intriguing, and although the humor is not in your face, it is embedded in the characters' interactions. Once the story has built up and the characters assess the situation, the entire tower crashes into one of the best combat scenes (Tiger, Crane and Crab Hill are very present). There is even a scene that mocks the eighteenth-century Western social events and ends with clever and entertaining struggles. The movie ends with a sudden, cheesy moment, but if you're a fan of the Shaw Brothers, you'll understand that the cheese is just a topping and not the main course of the movie.
