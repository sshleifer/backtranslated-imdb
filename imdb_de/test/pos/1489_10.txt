Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No matter how many times you see the same thing, the show never becomes monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the biggest comedians in the world who does not even have to talk to make people laugh. His gestures, his expression and his face are so funny. The situations he encounters on the show are just funny and the way he deals with them is even greater. There's just no reason why this show should not get 10, because it's fabulous. It's something that would make even the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh. Some of my favorite episodes from the series are: 1) When Mr. Bean is staying in a hotel. 2) The scene in which he looks at the scary movie. In fact, all episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show. Mr.Bean can go to all heights to prove he is funny, including complete disempowerment in any of the episodes. The way he dealt with this situation was simply mind-blowing. 10 out of 10.
