Watchers is a fun movie, if not taken too seriously. The novel written by Dean R. Koontz is obviously much better, but the movie itself is entertaining in its own way. The film has many changes for the novel Watchers, the only difference is the main character Travis. In the book he was an adult and retired Delta Force soldier, while in the movie he is a teenager. The viewer has his good points, the film has some bloody scenes. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this movie, he's always doing a great job in all of his movies. The OXCOM costume looks kinda cheesy, but the camera shows the creature only at the end of the movie. The dog Einstien was impressive because he was well trained. <br /> <br /> The film sees two genetic experiments fleeing a lab, a dog and a monster. Both experiments are telepathically linked because the two animals are part of a military project. If the dog infiltrated an enemy base, the creature would attack and eliminate them. The dog finds a teenager called Travis, who brings him home and discovers that he is intelligent and he calls the dog Einstein. In the meantime, the OXCOM is running around, killing people and looking for their eyes. Two government agents are sent there to find the two experiments. The incident gets out of hand. Soon Travis learns that he is not sure because the OXCOM is attracted to the dog, and he will stop at nothing to kill him and everyone else in his own way. Travis and his mother rescue his girlfriend, who is being held by the two agents in the hospital. They hide in the forest, while the government agents and OXCOM are not far behind. Watchers is not a great adaptation of Dean R. Koontz's novel, but it's a rousing 80's horror movie, some fans of The Book may not want to see this because it's not true to the book, but fans of gaudy 80's horror movies might want it check.
