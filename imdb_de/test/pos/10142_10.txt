Excellent cast, plot, performances. Totally believable. I recognize the close group that exemplifies the Marine Corps. But this movie scared me. The marines let principles condemn. It seems that this film was based on real incidents. It shows how difficult it is to go against the device. Anne Heche was absolutely convinced. Sam Shepard's portrayal of a Gung Ho Marine was sobering. And as a lawyer, Eric Stoltz was so skillful that he balanced his loyalty to the corporation, as well as his loyalty to his client while he lay high on his rope. He knew what his real approach had to be. But he was torn apart by his immersion in the maritime tradition, his loyalty to the corps over everything else. I sat riveted to the TV. All in all, I give this one 9 out of 10 points.
