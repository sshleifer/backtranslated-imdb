This movie is a pleasure to see and should perform well on DVD and video. I suppose you really need to be Irish to appreciate some of the intricacies such as accents, slang, and the dress sense of some characters, but let me assure you that when Dylan Moran personifies "Barreler," the imitations are familiar to most people from Dublin because we have many characters in our beautiful city who look, act and talk like that! The sheer simple comedy and the ingenious Michael Caines genius alone are worth the money. In addition, the plot is great, the script is awesome and the dialogue is quick and catchy. A perfect light entertainment movie without the crazy humor of Jim Carrey.
