Someone asked why it was canceled. I'll tell you why "reality" makes money. The exhibit area was canceled so that it could be replaced with a "reality" show, this will be followed by NBC, and I and about half of my high school, in total, about 1,000 people have pledged to boycott NBC until they return this show. in my area (I do not know any other places), but they did a great thing with the sci-fi channel, where the sci-fi channel was the last week's episode at 7:00 am and then NBC's new episode of the week At 8:00, this was great because it gave you some insight into what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I learned that the show was canceled and they would just leave it on the church!
