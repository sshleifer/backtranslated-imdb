This was indeed an amazing adaptation. I missed the first episode, so unfortunately the connection between the characters and the smooth running of the story. But when I saw the second and then the third rate, I was just overwhelmed. I ordered the DVD less than a week later and could not wait until it came. I went out immediately and brought the book with me. From the moment I opened it, I was addicted and could not take it off. I decided to finish the whole book before dare to watch the DVD. I preferred the book because it got into the heads of the characters, you could fully understand where they came from and what role it had in the story. They did a lot of adaption, which was disappointing as the book is a masterpiece and I think they could have done a great job if they could have endured it for a long time. But considering that you can only fit into a 3-hour window, I think it was excellent. It followed the twisted main story brilliantly. And the actors who were inscribed as main characters were incredible! The love scene was just beautiful. It was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be. I was really excited about the book and the TV adaptation! I loved the two previous novels by Sarah Waters and found the adaptation of Tipping the Velvet very pleasant. But when I read and watched Fingersmith, I knew that none of her previous novels / adaptation could beat her. Sarah Waters has surpassed this time! I recommend you to look at this customization! If you do not do the Velvet tip for you, do not be put off. Fingersmith is a completely new ball game. It's a beautiful, but dark, twisted story about love, greed and betrayal ... <br /> <br /> A MUST SEE!
