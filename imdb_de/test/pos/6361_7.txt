Dan Ackroyd in his main stars as Johgn Burns, a mental asylum refugee who introduces himself as his own swindler to travel to La La Land and host a popular radio show while the regular host (Charle Grodin in his growling Primus) vacation makes. On the way there, Ackroyd meets Walter Matthau, a crazy comrade-in-arms, and the rest is sheer merriment. Ackroyd and Matthau play very well against each other. Donna Dixon, Ackroyd's impressive real-life wife, is on her way to further shrinking. The end feels a bit hectic and thoughtful, and that's the only thing that keeps me from giving my top rating to this film, a 8. A lost 80's gem.
