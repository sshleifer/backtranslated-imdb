Well, I notice that most people here call "YOUNG WARRIORS" waste or "as bad as it is weird" entertainment, but let me clarify it: it's actually a low-rent piece of quality when you're ready to watch such movies without a critical eye. In fact, it's much more entertaining and thought-provoking than the majority of the action movies of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The key is the theme of the movie. I'm always a fan of films that deal with the topic of vigilance, especially if they dive into the psyche of the characters involved. YOUNG WARRIORS may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first DEATH WISH movie (and yes, I think the first one had both elements), but it tries to be different from the normal Cannon movies. At this time, it's really unique. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple (do not worry, there will be no spoilers): A group of college students turns out to be different when one of their family members is attacked by a tough street gang. Students go out on the streets to fight the general street crime because they do not know who the responsible gang is. They eventually acquire heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and roam the night fully armed. However, these are not Schwarzenegger types; They are vulnerable, inexperienced novices who, almost every time they go out to clean the city (usually with their frat mascot dog in tow), make considerable mistakes. They eventually find out who the gang is and go after them, but until then you do not expect a standard climax where the good guys go away uninjured. <br /> <br /> One thing about the movie that struck me is weird but effective that the bulk of the first act does not indicate that we'll see action or violence later, as it frits like a goofy comic comedy that you saw on the Up All Night US (where I believe it was) actually showed in one place). The comedy set actually made me forget to forget that on the VHS case, a guy on a motorcycle had a machine gun on his back. Then, when the violence finally comes, it's neither funny nor cute ... it's shockingly disturbing. From that point on, the movie becomes a full-blooded, uncompromising action yarn that contains some startling shootings and bleeding. <br /> <br /> Acting, though nothing special, is far more passionate than I expected. James Van Patten, who plays the lead role, gives it all, and his performance is surprisingly good for this kind of movie. The rest of the cast is equally invested, including ever-reliable Ernest Borgnine as the hero's cop father. The cinematography is also above average and the action scenes are treated with a severity that I personally did not expect. I can understand why some people considered this movie worthless, as much of it is extremely dated, but these facets came to my mind. Van Patten's character studies animation, and his overt 80s style, seen in several scenes, is a psychedelic wet dream of a retro-movie lover. I am sure that most contemporary viewers would cite these moments as low points in the film, but I disagree. Also, the soundtrack of Joe Walsh - which sounds as if he could not have been recorded until 1983 - seemed particularly fitting and enjoyable, regardless of how "old" it looks today. <br /> <br /> YOUNG WARRIORS is one of my favorite action movies of the 80's and I recommend anyone who is interested in the genre to have a look. Unfortunately it was only released on VHS at the time of publication and is no longer shown on television today. On a nice DVD presentation I would go through my living room so hard that my ankles swell up. In the meantime, I implore you all to go on Ebay or Amazon and cough up the ten bucks or whatever for the old big-box band. It really is a remarkable base for an ambitious garbage cinema.
