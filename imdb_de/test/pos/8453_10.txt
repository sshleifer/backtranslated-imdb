Television broadcaster Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical comrade Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are in a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happened. The factory managers refuse, but Adams filmed everything. Wells and Adams are trying to send it, but the company that runs the facility prevents it. Plant manager Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) notes that there are serious problems and tests have been faked. He tries to make executives believe him - only they know it. Wells, Adams, and Godell are at risk for their entire lives. <br /> <br /> I saw this in 1979 in a movie theater. I was only 17 years old and it made me stupid. To make matters worse, the Three Mile Island accident happened around that time, making the movie even more realistic. Seeing it over 20 years later does not scare me, but it's still an excellent movie - it acts as a mystery, gripping drama, and exposure to the nuclear power industry. Fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as Wells - perfectly conveying the growing suspicion and horror of her character when she realizes that a nuclear disaster could happen. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He begins to believe in his business and the job, and begins to break away slowly as he begins to figure things out. He was rightly nominated for an Oscar. Douglas is good, but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by Lemmon and Fonda. <br /> <br /> A really great movie - one of the best of the 70s. Do not miss these!
