In the late sixties, director Sergio Corbucci produced four spaghetti westerns in a row - the classics THE MERCENARY, THE GREAT SILENCE, THE SPECIALISTS and COMPANEROS. Three of them, with the exception of THE SPECIALISTS, are constantly on the list of the top ten lists when judging spaghetti westerns. Until recently, I had seen only a very poor compilation with some English, some Italian and a blurry image, and it was almost incomprehensible. Now that I've seen a nice widescreen version with subtitles (but still in two languages), I can certainly include THE SPECIALISTS in this group of four classics. Johnny Halliday is very good as a charismatic Hud, a notorious hand with the gun, who returns to Blackstone to investigate the death of his brother, who was lynched by the citizens for losing their savings. It's a lush beauty that owns the bank, a Mexican bandit leader, El Diablo, who used to be friends with Hud, an honest sheriff who dreams of better days, and a small group of hippies. Well, it was the end of the sixties. and hippies were everywhere, even seemingly in our western countries. It is not a western desert that was filmed somewhere in the Alps, and is pretty to look at. There's a bit more nudity than I expect in a western, but that's not a bad thing. Sylvie Fennec is as beautiful as Sheba, who may be Hud's niece, or the girlfriend of a dead brother. That has never been clarified. This movie deserves to be seen, and once again we ask for a nice DVD with all the subtleties - I think THE SPECIALISTS would be as well-known as any of the other Westerns by Corbucci, and that is indeed a big compliment.
