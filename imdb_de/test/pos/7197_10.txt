I've read every adventure of Asterix and Obelix at least five times and I'm also a fan of "Les Nuls" and "Les Robins des Bois" and Jamel, so I've been expecting a lot from this movie ... and finally, being satisfied The first film adaptation of Asterix on the big screen (Astérix et Obélix contre César), which was not a real success except Laetitia Casta, this really captures the spirit of the comic (and we get the beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first film, the director tried to be realistic about the time in which the story was playing, and the whole ghost that made Asterix funny was deadly. In this case, all the clothes, the way of speaking and everything are identical to Goscinny and Uderzo's work ... more, it really stays with the original story, with the disadvantage that we know just about everything that will happen, but Alain Chabat Gave us a few surprises in the end. I really enjoyed this movie, and every time the first signs of boredom appear, Jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy. This movie is a great mix of all the humor I really like, and even if it mixes too much, I can not help but like it. So if you like Asterix and the humor of all these young talents who started in "Nulle part Ailleurs" (a French mix of today's evening show and SNL), then watch this movie.
