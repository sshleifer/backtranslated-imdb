Once again, I am amazed that Thomas Gibson did not reach the top of the pack earlier in his career. In this film, Gibson once again demonstrates his ability to capture a character regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing gay man of the late 20th century. Tender but not feminine, for fear of the principles of love, Gibson's character touches a variety of emotions. Commendable is also the performance of Cameron Bancroft. His desire to be the heterosexual conqueror as opposed to his best friend's "homosexual conquests" provides a momentum, in many ways unexpected, for the relationship. The chemistry of Bancroft and Gibson is evident in the first scene in which they perform together. There are many "panels" in this ceiling. From gay relationships to direct relationships; from heterosexual relationships to the study of lesbian love; This film travels through the broad spectrum of sexuality, centering on the story of a serial killer. I only regret that it took me 6 years to discover the movie! I look forward to seeing you again and recommending it to any fan of Bancroft, Gibson or Director Denys Arcand.
