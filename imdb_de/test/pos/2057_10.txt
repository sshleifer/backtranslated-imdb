I'm a happily married, 49-year-old woman who just LOVES this movie to death. Geena Davis' character is strong, smart and shit on it ........... .... I thought she did an excellent job (that's an understatement) in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not really big on action movies, but I thought it was sooooooooooo sexy and entertaining. <BR /> <br /> She's my alter ego ............. when she starts to assemble the assault rifle in the old hotel room ............ .. ....... I got chills ............... She acted as if she knew what she was doing ............ that's it one of my MAN favorite parts in this movie ........ <br /> <br /> I think she deserves an Oscar for her acting and body roll ........ <br /> <br /> I'm going to have 'CHARLY' tattooed on my back .............. I'm one of those girls who NEVER WILL BE A VICTIM ....... ..... .......... I'm like you ............... (shhhhhhhhhhhhhh secretly ........ and not so sexy?)
