1. watched 10/28/2007, 8 of 10 (Dir-Jesus Ponce): Simple, sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures that live without a roof over their heads in everyday life. The movie begins with the woman in the story (played by Isabel Ampudia) being released from prison, but we do not know where she was and how long she was there. She encounters the anti-hero of the story and her friend, played by Sebastian Haro, as he parks cars for the change. They band together under an old run-down building, with nothing but the warmth of each other and a small mattress in their possession. He's a drug addict who's just trying to make it from one fix to another, but he has a strange, obsessive pull on him as a person we finally accept. He also has some kind of sexually transmitted disease, so sex is out of the question for her, but this does not seem to be a problem for both of them. She loves this man as he is, without question and without having to change, which is a rare find everywhere. She earns her living by carrying a bucket and washing show-windows. They eat a pastry every day and consider it a feast. Isabel's character dreams of a normal life, but does not expect it to happen and does not expect her to fit that role, so do not think much of it. Both characters come from extremely broken houses and therefore the audience, despite their imperfection, has sympathy for them. Without giving up much of the story, Isabel's character will continue to exist, while the man becomes worse and worse in his drug addiction. There is a nice melodramatic conclusion to the story that makes it soaring to the masses, but overall it's a wonderful independent film about a relationship between alien tricks that will interest you until the very end.
