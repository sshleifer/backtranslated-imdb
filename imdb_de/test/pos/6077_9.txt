There have been some comments on the site that have focused on the film's prestige feel - and there are many talented people to watch: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas, to the great design and scoring, to the masterly direction. No wonder that Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance speech for "Evita" began at this year's Academy Awards. "Well, thank God," The English Patient "did not have any songs." The writing of Oscar winners takes me to Juliette Binoche, who performs a wonderful performance in a superb cast. It is gratifying to see that the dynamics that seem to influence the Best Actor award (often with a striking pyrotechnic aura) do not materialize in the female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's highly acclaimed Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in Howard's End has proven, one of the hardest things an actor can do is portray the "goodness" - and seriously sexy. Her performance in this great movie is beautiful.
