Bergman and comedy do not quite fit together. Some of his comedies are so good that you almost flinch. This movie has the weird moment - the last 30 seconds are the nadir, but on the whole this is a charming (rather than funny) piece that is thoroughly fun. Bergman drops some of his usual suspects who perform well. There's a great scene on the train between David, Marianne and an outrageous salesman who will be remembered. The wedding material is in part typical of the cynical Bergman, but Bergman is in a lighter rather than dark mood. <br /> <br /> This movie has its moments and is worth the 90 minutes. Not one of its classics and not the place to start if you want to go down Bergman.
