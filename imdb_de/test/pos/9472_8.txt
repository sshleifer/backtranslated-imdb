I saw this movie today (opened here yesterday) and was just thrilled. <br /> <br /> I saw a review saying something that the reviewer thought was just another teenage movie, but then he found it based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then tried to justify that he likes this movie on Shakespeare's grounds. I really believe that this is all overboard: The only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic idea of ​​a girl disguising herself as a man; (b) the comprehensive male and female humor that emerges from this attitude; and (c) some names (including Viola & Duke). Apart from these names, the thematic similarities (a & b) are really great themes for any screenplay, and the script of this film is no exception. Apart from that, however, this is a truly adorable and very contemporary / traditional teen movie. And that's an absolutely legitimate genre, even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... as if it alludes to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The film is bright, fast, emotional, stylized, funny ... full of youthful hormones and youthful humor and male / female humor, suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part of IMHO: Actually, just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is presented in all around appealing over-the-top fun. These stereotypes are relentlessly but lovingly parodied, with such complexity of invention that I'm still a bit confused ... but in that respect, it's not disappointing, it's not a movie, it's a kind of movie, fast and funny, and you laugh and moans and then goes over in the next split second. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is really wonderful like Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful duke; David Cross is an outstanding principal gold. All plays and characterizations were good and unerring. The cinematography was excellent. <br /> <br /> Wonderful entertainment from start to finish ... check it out!
