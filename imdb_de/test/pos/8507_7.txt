I saw 'NSNA' shortly after seeing all the Roger Moore movies and I have to say that it felt so good to see Connery again. He proves at all times that he is the only Bond. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is not a masterpiece, but it's worth to see it. The jokes sit here much better, the effects are funny and interesting, Connery is Connery and Brandauer is really a good villain. But Sydow is just wasted and the score is not often good and there are some scenes that seem pretty unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 7/10 \ 2.5 / 4 \ 3+ (1+ - 6-)
