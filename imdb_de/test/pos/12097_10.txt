I listen to Istanbul intentionally, my eyes closed: first a gentle breeze blows and the leaves on the trees sway gently; Out there, far away, the bells of the water carriers ring incessantly; I hear Istanbul on purpose, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I hear Istanbul on purpose, my eyes closed; Then suddenly birds fly by, flocks of birds, high up, with a sound and cry, While the nets are being pulled in the fishing grounds And the feet of a woman begin to babble in the water. I hear Istanbul on purpose, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I hear Istanbul on purpose, my eyes closed. The Grand Bazaar is calm and cool, A riot at the center of the market, mosque yards are full of pigeons. While hammers bang and clang in the docks, spring winds carry the smell of sweat; I hear Istanbul on purpose, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I hear Istanbul on purpose, my eyes closed; Still dizzy from the revelations of the past. A villa by the sea with dingy boathouses sleeps deeply and firmly. In the midst of the noise and the drone of the southern winds, I hear relaxed Istanbul with closed eyes. <br /> <br /> I hear Istanbul intentionally and eyes closed. A pretty girl passes the sidewalk: four letters, pipes and songs, rude remarks; Something falls from her hand. It's a rose, I think. I hear Istanbul on purpose, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I hear Istanbul on purpose, my eyes closed. A bird flutters around her skirt. On your forehead, is there sweat? Or not? I know. Are your lips wet? Or not? I know. A silver moon rises behind the pines: I can feel it all in the heartbeat. I listen to Istanbul intentionally, my eyes are closed. <br /> <br /> FOR YOU <br /> <br /> For you, my fellow human beings, everything is for you, nights are for you, days are for you; Daylight is for you, moonlight is for you; Leaves in the moonlight; Miracles and wisdom in leaves, myriad greens in daylight, yellow is for you and Rosa. The feel of the skin on the palm, Its warmth, Its softness, The comfort of reclining; For you are all greetings and the masts that grow in the harbor; Names of the Days, Names of the Months, Fresh Paint on Rowing Boats is the postman's feet for you, Potter's hands sweat on the foreheads, bullets being fired on the fronts; Tombs are for you and gravestones, prisons and handcuffs and death sentences are for you Everything is for you. <br /> <br /> SEA NOSTALGIA <br /> <br /> Ships sailing along my dreams, Over the roofs, Ships In a feast of colors, And poor self, year after year looking for the sea, staring and crying I. I remember my first sight of the world Through a clam shell I came across: The greenest water and the bluest sky And the rippest lumpfish ... My blood is still flowing salty, where the oysters slit my skin. What a great tempo immersion was our on the brightest foam on the high seas! Foam bears no malice, Like lips whose adultery is no shame to men. Ships sail along our dreams Over the rooftops, ships in a festival of colors, And poor me, yearning year out eagerly. <br /> <br /> - Orhan Veli <br /> <br /> I could not have said anything better than Orhal Veli Kanik about Istanbul. Everything I have about this movie is praise. A very nice and balanced introduction to a city and its music that connected Asia, Europe and Africa at one time.
