I have been a "big" fan of Rush since the "moving pictures" and this concert is simply an example for all who are a fan why Rush is so popular. They fully admitted that they had played their biggest concert so far, and despite the rain in a football arena, they still manage to perform excellently from start to finish. A real example of this is that during "yyz" the entire crowd sings in the classical way. They really play all the favorite songs of all with a really strong "lust" that rarely happens anymore. You get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts. The second DVD is a fascinating documentary of the band while in Brazil. It shows many backstage events and allows you to see them not just as musicians, but as real people in their everyday lives. This DVD gift set is a must for any Rush fan, young or old, and definitely a guardian of your DVD collection. There is even a CD of the concert for those who only want to hear the music. This DVD is worth it!
