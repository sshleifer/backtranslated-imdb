Ocean's 12 <br /> <br /> "If you steal fifty million dollars, they'll find you." (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, The Hard) <br /> <br /> This proverb certainly applies in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and his comrades have ripped him off, and now he wants everything back. The Ocean Gang needs a lot of money and fast, but can not work in the States, since Benedict has made it impossible for them. So she's heading to Europe for death sentences, braving the theft while trying to dodge Catherine Zeta Jones' Super Cop, an ancient blaze from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. <br /> <br /> In their first robbery in Amsterdam, they discover that the "Night Fox", a super-smooth thief with a legendary complex that has teased her. He challenges them with a challenge that allows them to completely write off their debts or land in a sort of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II type with buried vivid tones. Interesting? Oh well. Sluggish? Type of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Lots of <br /> <br /> Ocean and its gang of happy men are charismatic, if nothing else, and since this is a sequel and we are all old friends, we see a lot more "pallye" situations and conversations. Too many. Damon Linus is more nervous than before; The cousins ​​argue, as we knew. Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's heavy accent is as bad as ever (I really like Cheadle, but I can not stand it). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading each other's thoughts. However, what worked so well in the last movie was the lack of character development compared to the smoothness of the whole damn Op. And as much as these actors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this movie like a big square vortex into a tight 11-sided hole. She just does not fit and her chemistry with Pitt does not exist. <br /> <br /> However, the stars of this film for me were Vincent Cassel as Night Fox and Soderbergh's siting. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he was born in both. His night fox is arrogant, "terribly unconcerned with other people's lives" (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean Gang. Here I believe that the movie loses its way. Cassel and the European locations are too realistic a contrast to the American actors and the style of the first film. We want to be smooth, cheeky and quick-witted; not pithy, deliberate and intellectual. Here the movie does not work. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, you can not repeat the same formula twice on the letter, but if you go too far left or right, it usually does more harm than good in such a mainstream movie like this one.
