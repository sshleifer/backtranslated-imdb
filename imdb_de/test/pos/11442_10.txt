This movie probably made the most pleasant surprise I've ever seen. It was not a high-budget production, and his premise that middle-aged amateur jazz musicians receive unexpected professional involvement in a Catskills-like resort seems modest. What is not modest is the success of the film. This is a small slice-of-life movie that is consistently entertaining. Director Frank D. Gilroy also wrote the script and it's full of interesting subplots and unexpected twists. <br /> <br /> The actors are journeymen who do a solid job. The biggest revelation for me was Cleavon Little. He plays a professional musician who is hired for a sick band member. His posture immediately collides with the others. They see it as a chance for great fun and a one-time thing, but he sees it as his job and not particularly interesting. This leads to conflicts, but when the group gets into trouble, he steers them through. Little, who died too young, really showed me that he was a good actor with this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real sleeper like a movie fan always wants to discover. I recommend it with all my heart.
