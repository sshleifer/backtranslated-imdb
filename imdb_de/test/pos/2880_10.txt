The problem with other actors in the role of Dorian Gray is that they were either too old for the role (Hurd Hatfield, Helmut Berger, Josh Duhamel, David Gallagher, Ben Barnes) or that they could not penetrate the English aristocracy without stilting to become. Dorian is the eternal 19-year-old (or so), all the milky skin and honey locks as described by Wilde. So the challenge is to find an actor who has the maturity and reach for the part (ie, who can portray) naivety, mendacity, and manipulability), but at the same time as someone in his late teens. And Peter Firth pulls off everything in this outstanding British television adaptation. <br /> <br /> Gielgud as Henry Wotton, while much older than what Wilde intended to do, wonders with his scenes - wild aphorisms have never before sounded so natural and informal. Especially George Sanders in the 1945 version was rather weak in comparison (and his costume did not fit). Finally, Jeremy Bratt plays Basil as the most masculine yet gay trio, again a fitting interpretation. In general, the film contains enough gay subtext without making Dorian himself homosexual - he is all for all people and supposedly there is no drug or sexual perversion that he has not tried in the 18 years of history, but that makes him more narcissistic as a homosexual. He seems to have devastated both sexes equally, as he should according to the novel. Of course, the budget of this production was not very large, so everything feels a bit bold. Especially Dorian's encounter with Sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio look. The last shot of Dorian (a doll I suspect) in his white, toad-like make-up is funnier than convincing, and Basil's death scene is unintentionally funny. (As far as I remember, Basil should have been killed sitting at the table.) But all in all, this is a very worthy adaptation. I'm sure Wilde would have liked it. The only thing missing is the sensual side. Not so many sex scenes, but Wild Decadent World with fragrant flowers, luxurious cloths and gems is not really explored here, d. H. Aestheticism is completely absent. But like "me, Claudius," the superb spectacle makes it easy to forget these imperfections in production values.
