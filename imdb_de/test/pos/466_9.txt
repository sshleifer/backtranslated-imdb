This is a movie you have to see twice. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was really involved in the story. While much of the story takes place in a hotel room, you share the stories that Buddy (Nick Drake, Wonderful Allusion) and Daphne share in you from her room into the world. Through their conversations, you get a sense of the loneliness and pain that everyone feels. The soundtrack accompanies the film perfectly, dark, lo-fi and fascinating. When you watch the movie for the second time, you can pick up on any clues you missed the first time to reach one of the best finishes I've seen in a long time. I hope this movie will find a distributor for the DVD to make it more accessible. Great movie, you will not be disappointed.
