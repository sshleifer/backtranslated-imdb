Colonel Chabert is one of the best adaptations I've seen in the movies. It combines the realism of French cinema with outstanding characterization, from Deputy-lost Chabert to Fabrice Luchini's proud lawyer to Fanny Ardant's complex widow. The film has a marvelous dimension, as you would expect from a top cameraman like Yves Angelo. The characters keep this movie going and although it is a bit slow at the beginning, it picks up speed and is a good movie when it reaches the finish.
