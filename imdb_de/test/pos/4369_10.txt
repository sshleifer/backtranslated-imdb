I've just seen this sexy classic after many years, the penultimate film by Henry Cornelius, who died three years later at the age of just 45 (the same age that the film's male star, Larry Harvey, died) in 1973 ). Three future directors were in the crew: Jack Clayton (associate producer), Guy Green (cameraman) and Clive Donner (publisher). The film is based on the autobiographical story "Goodbye to Berlin" by the famous British author Christopher Isherwood, which was first turned into a piece by John van Druten, then turned into this film and then turned into a musical "Cabaret". and finally turned into a "cabaret", which caught the eye of the amazing Liza Minelli with her voice that can destroy a glass at a distance of a mile. Isherwood appears in the film under his own name. He was gay, but that was illegal at the time and allowed him to end up in jail, disguising his inclinations by saying he was a "confirmed bachelor." This is the key to his platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric, crazy, promiscuous, always cheerful and thoroughly unique personality he calls Sally Bowles. The portrait of Sally Bowles in this film is a young Julie Harris's tour-de-force that sweeps every scene into a magical and intriguing web of sparkling personal charm. What a vehicle for a charming actress! It is one of the great film screenings of the 1950s. Isherwood is played perfectly by young Lawrence Harvey, in a finely judged performance that never leaves the comedy, and even the moments of slapstick farce somehow remain "almost credible." Larry is so funny to portray a lame hypochondriac. What an irony in the face of the total lack of hypochondria that his courage and stoicism showed in the last year of his life when he died of stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaint. I knew him well in the last three years and he was a generous, warm and modest person. He admired his little girl Domino, who unfortunately is also tragically dead. This film was his best early performance, followed by his spectacular work in "Room at the Top" (1959), "Summer and Smoke" (1961) and "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962) Larry was often undervalued in his life, because he was too pretty, was often cast as a cadet, and glamor boys were not always accepted as good actors, but many of the best actresses played against him, and they had no doubt about his abilities, and he was in many of the most important films of his time If he had lived beyond middle age, he would have grown stronger and become a great old man on the screen One day he was sitting in his house in Hampstead, giving me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel He said he had always given me such delicious wine, what was that? "He proudly answered that it was a sancerre he found on the vineyard n selected and personally shipped France. Then he added extremely wistfully, "You know, I've waited four years for someone to comment and ask me what it is, and you're the first person to ever do that." What was important to him was that he tasted wine, and his glamorous friends had denied him that satisfaction. In this film, Anton Diffring as a serious young man gives a touching early performance (later he had to play far too many Nazi officers, poor guy), and the young Shelley Winters plays a rich German Jewish girl but effective in her usual loud noise it was not too difficult, since she was a loud Jewish girl herself anyway. This movie has such a zest for life that it's pure joy.
