Dolemite is one of the best movies with a pimp as a hero who breaks down the man and connects with the best women in the ghetto. Note that these women master karate and are fine foxy ladies. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - the final battle scene is pretty crazy as Dolemite rips the heart out of Willy Green. Make sure your copy is not rated. <br /> <br /> There's also a cast of innovative, brilliant characters like Hamburger Pimp, Reverend, Mayor, Queen Bee and others. The clothes are great and the sets are full of the 70s style. There are a few hiccups in production, such as boom-mikes that pop up inadvertently, but that adds to the charm and laughs. <br /> <br /> I would recommend to drink a 6-pack before and during the game and keep places and the man far away.
