The show itself essentially reflects the typical nature of the average youth; Celebrating and picking chicks is the usual weekend destination of the clubs. People frown because of the "perverted" idea of ​​collecting girls with technology and strategic characterizations, but to be honest, virtually every young man does it in the club. Overall, the show really appeals to the younger population, as we want to see the results of a "player" in the club, as the show offers a funny approach, which is made possible by the jury. <br /> <br /> 10/10; A cool, entertaining and exciting series that allows audiences to really interact. Good job boys.
