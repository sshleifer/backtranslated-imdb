Certain aspects of the Punishment Park are not perfect, especially some of the acting. However, I believe that this is probably the most important film of the "war on terror". I grew up with the hippies and in some ways still do it. It was only when the United States embarked on the path of unnecessary and fraudulent war in Iraq that I began to see the world through her eyes. I can feel what they must have felt. Although the film is a little outdated, viewing brings the uncomfortable feelings of our current situation to the surface. It is clear enough that Punishment Park at the beginning of the film is a concentration and death camp for all "unpatriotic" elements of American society. This is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society, but it is CREDIBLE. Sometimes I think the US could easily get into fascism. When I saw this movie, all I could think about was the fact that almost daily I hear similar feelings from people on both sides of the political spectrum. This film is a raw, concentrated distillation of the PRESENT political scene in America. I am both impressed and sad that something so relevant (and yes) was filmed more than 30 years ago. If you look at the movie more moderately and believe that this would not be possible, check out Guantanamo Bay, some of our "enemy fighters", the rumored CIA secret prisons and the many similar incidents in Greensboro, NC in 1979 (8th to 8th) full years after the creation of this film).
