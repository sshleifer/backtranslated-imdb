I saw the movie "Hoot" and immediately decided to comment it. The truth is that NATURE needs to be protected by us because we are the dominant species of this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do what they want, which is likely, but when they think more about the future, they think about themselves, they would do something useful! This movie is not just about kids, this movie shows us that kids are usually those who care more about it than adults. When I was twelve, I saw some water lilies, and I knew they were protected by law, and I did not dare to touch them without fear of the law, but I was afraid I might actually hurt them. Whatever was, the acting was great, the three main characters are well interpreted and we all need to learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in this movie !!! and enjoy!
