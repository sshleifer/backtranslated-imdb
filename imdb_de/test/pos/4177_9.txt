Head should have been a proud moment, not only for his stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature) or his director / co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also for his other co-writer (and his short cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most people seem to be avoiding it, and for outsiders, the film is at best seen as a curiosity. <br /> <br /> While the TV series is known to be based on the antics of the Beatles '' help! ', This film is also judged on the same principle. Far from the banal and painfully overrated Beatles films and even the dated Monkees TV series, Head has a deep layer. Here is an undercurrent of the man's darker nature, and that may sound like a bizarre statement about a manufactured pop band, shooting the use of certain subjects and images (beating women, laughing at cripples and live footage of a Viet Cong) POW up close ) give the film an advantage that many "serious" films would not dare. <br /> <br /> There are also fun moments ranging from James Bond parodies to 'Big Victor' and my personal favorite, Mickey Dolenz, among Arabian soldiers on horseback. (One of them turns to Mickey and hisses 'pssst!', Just for the 'pssst!', Which appear in subtitles!) The group knows their finished image in the movie ('I'm the fool, Mickey? I' I am always the fool, "asserts Tork (sums up his one-dimensional film roll of the series), meaning that her characters" play themselves "and do not act here" are more open and therefore less generic and irritating than in the series. This level of parody and self-confidence even assumes their fabulous origins, with more subtle counterparts to the Maharishi and unqualified confessions with a waitress who asks, "Well, if it's not God's gift to the eighth yearlings, pay Ringo Starr still Tribute? 'Also, listen to Tork whistle' Strawberry Fields Forever 'while you're in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Then of course there are the songs, six of them here, a bit more psychedelic than usual, which you e fanbase may have been alienating, and even a Frank Zappa cameo would not have drawn an adult audience to its charm at this point. Probably the best is the charming "As We Go Along," though the first one, Porpoise Song carved by Carol's porcelain ore - interestingly enough, speaks of the desire to live as time relentlessly deploys and death approaches. On the other hand, the chorus "The porpoise laughs" seems a direct sight of "I am the walrus". <br /> <br /> Constantly resourceful with direct references to the silent film and drug culture. Head's finest feature is perhaps the narrative structure. Not the only one? but the most important? Reason why it gets better with several considerations, the story goes to the left, right, forward, backward, circular and through multiple levels of reality. Essentially a series of sketches loosely connected together, the cohesion is streamlined through the Space-Time-Trick Plan, which holds together its internal logic through Flashback, Dream Sequence, Prison of Mind, and Remote Control Channel Changer. <br /> <With a perfect beginning and end, this smartly written, knowing film was not what The Monkees' youthful audience expected, and subsequently received a negative critical reception. These expectations have now vanished, and this is in urgent need of a serious reassessment.
