Empire of Passion starts deceptively - that is, if you immediately expect it to be a horror movie. It is like a reef on James M. Cains The postman always rings twice: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is mother of two children and a dutiful, hard-working wife of rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he's not there and she's home with the baby, the vivacious and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes over to bring Seki some goodies ... and a little bit more. They're going to sleep together soon, but after he's done something to her (say a "shave"), he knows he'll find out, and immediately suggests they kill Gisaburo. They drink him up, strangle him and then throw him into a well. Of course, this will come back to persecute her - but that is literally, at least for her (first the overly aroused Seki and then later the skeptical Toyoji), the gang switches to the "Kaidan", a Japanese ghost story. <Br /> <br /> This is a movie where the horror does not just come from "oh, ghost, ah", but from the total fear that comes with the characters. In a way, there is the mechanics of a film noir that is in continuous use, albeit only in a nineteenth-century Japanese village, as opposed to an American town or town (ie, the snooping policeman, the "evidence") possibly be found by another), get around, suspect, etc). It's convincing because Seiko was against the plan from the beginning, manipulated by the lusty but poorly prepared Toyoji, and her reactions to Gisaburo's repercussions are mind-boggling for her. Take the one closest to the seal: Gisaburo's ghost, pale blue face and mostly silent, cold stare, Seiko's movements to get into the rickshaw. She does it reluctantly and pushes her along a street she does not know, in the early hours before sunrise, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories wish the heavens that they could get this terribly atmospheric mood. <br /> <br /> While it turns into hysterical issues in the end, there is so much here that director Oshima is right to make this an unmistakable work. After missing a huge punch in the international film world with In the Realm of the Senses (which was ironically banned in his own country), he did something that he said made it even more daring. Maybe he was right. Empire of Passion has far less graphic sexual content than its predecessor (also with Tatsuya Fuji, a great physical actor with an immense reach), but his daring lie is to create a world of fear. One can believe in ghosts in this story, but one also has to believe how far these two seagull birds will settle down to their personal hells. The snooping detective or the gossiping citizens are the least worried. The fate of their own souls is at stake. <br /> <br /> And Oshima takes over, which in other hands could only be a juicy pulp (sadly it would not 'I wonder if an American remake was already in progress.) Craftsmen shot after a beautiful shot, with repetitions who worked their way into the mis-en scene (ie the shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking on that street, the camera in a dutch camera) angle, the world is tilted and surrounds it in a somber blue hue) as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after typing (ie Toyoji throws the leaves into the slot with one hand in slow motion or like Seiko's with one hand) naked body becomes visible after she's blinded). It is daring to connect at one level of the mind - not to be confused with the spiritual, even if it has something to do with it - life and death are inextricably linked. It is a classic waiting to be discovered.
