The End Of Suburbia (TEOS) is a very useful movie. It is also important and provocative. There seems to be no middle ground in the film or its main source of entertainment, anti-spyware master James Howard Kunstler. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of New Urbanism, my criticism of it is his small vision. In the case of New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe - another talking head - you finally hear what is obvious in and among the special TEOS out-takes ... Calthorpe does not understand peak oil. <br /> <br /> I have used this as a teaching tool in economics lessons to understand the importance of land as a factor of production - a fact that has long been adversely affected by neoclassical economics - and also as a tool to educate about: Peak Oil, our wastrel land use, global warming, our endangered food production, public transport our endangered future <br /> <br /> Move over South Park! .... Produced by Toronto Canadians for $ 25,000 and released in May 2004, this video sold over 24,000 copies by October 2005. A major DVD distributor has recently ordered nearly 400 more copies. <br /> <br /> The End Of Suburbia's revenue actually increased 1 1/2 years after its release and has also been available on one of the major online video services since September 2005. <br /> <br /> A sequel, Escape From Suburbia, is in progress with a possible release by August 2006.
