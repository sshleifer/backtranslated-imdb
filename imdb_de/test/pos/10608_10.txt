I've just finished Marigold, and I'd like to say that I found this DVD on the shelves of Blockbuster. While I was looking for something new and good to walk around, I noticed the photo of Ali Larter. <br /> <br /> After slobbering over Ali Larter, I picked up the cover and looked at the cover again. I thought the costumes were a little over the top. And then I saw the other Indians on the cover thinking that this was some sort of parody movie or something. <br /> <br /> When I flipped the synopsis section and saw Salman Khan, I hit a double. Salman Khan in an American movie starring Ali Larter on a DVD at Blockbuster? Since Salman Khan is synonymous with Hollywood films for Bollywood films like Mel Gibson, I had very high expectations for this film: It MUST be good! I am very pleased that Marigold is a phenomenal movie! It has far exceeded all my personal expectations! <br /> <br /> I think a movie like this one is, if you have a decent script, a talented, experienced, knowledgeable and goal-oriented director, two incredible actors the lead roles and just a very hard-working supporting cast and crew! Khan and Larter seem to have a really good chemistry together and both seem to shine on the big screen: they look really good together. The music numbers were not bad at all, which was surprising, considering how cheesy and long the music of Indian films is. And you'll be glad to know that Indian costumes are far from cheesy. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, the middle was really good, the scenes The climax was quite dramatic, but the end was just great! However, I have some complaints and complaints about the DVD. Although I loved the widescreen aspect ratio of the DVD, I did not like the fact that some other things were excluded from the DVD. For starters, there are no subtitles. Now English is my mother tongue, it is not a problem. However, when some Indian actors and actresses talked, it was (sometimes) difficult to understand what they said; Captioning would have helped. <br /> <br /> Another thing I would have appreciated on the DVD would be a blooper roll or a collection of outtakes. And last but not least, how about a menu function that would allow us to jump directly to the music numbers? Man, some of these songs were really good! On the other hand, I enjoyed watching the production of Marigold. <br /> <br /> I have much more to say about the greatness of this movie and how much I liked it, but I have neither time nor time to write further why I liked it so much. I hope Salman Khan produces more English films in addition to his Hindi films, and I certainly hope that this Hindi movie will not be Ali Larter's latest Bollywood movie. And I want to encourage the director to continue producing Bollywood film hybrids with Salman Khan, Ali Larter, and other well-known actors - make sure the scripts are original and good. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - that's just great love movie that your whole family can enjoy!
