In a word ... magical. And so incredibly real. Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable, that you just want his characters to succeed no matter what he does. And he plays Hari Om perfectly - from his absolutely perfect "Bollywood e-shtyle" to his awkward, shy nature with a first kiss. He is a really gifted actor, and I would not hesitate to see him in everything because he brings everything to life and gives it a soul. Camille Natta is absolutely beautiful. It took some time for me to get used to her - possibly because she plays the role of an ignorant but fascinating tourist. Her transition really became her and she got very involved in her role. Even the man you like to hate, her friend Benoit, was wonderful. Although you never really like him for the scum he plays, Jean-Marie Lamour is a perfect cadet. The script is so real. I have repeatedly turned to my friend throughout the film, saying, "That's what's happening in India, you've done it!" Very real, very raw. VERY bittersweet, but you will certainly fill the theater. The music of Nitin Sawhney is wonderful and fits in perfectly with the ever-changing moods. But Vijay Raaz ... I keep coming back to him - because he MAKES this movie. He is the hero, the most charming and disarming rickshaw driver you'll ever meet - he's magical. A lovely, real, sweet, incredibly talented actor I can not wait to succeed in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere else!
