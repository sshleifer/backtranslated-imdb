A great fun ... many good twists and turns! (And we were not even baked!) <br /> <br /> Did not know that this movie existed until he watched the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD ... (Strangely, he was with The City of Lost Children there and The Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen) <br /> <br /> The action keeps you amazed. <br /> <br /> The acting was great ... Hank Azaria shows his talent again, Bill Bob is Billy Bob ... (wecis?) <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look.
