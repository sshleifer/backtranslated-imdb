I think all the reviewers took this movie very well. I have seen it many, many times, but I still feel a sense of joy and warmth, just like the first time. My emotional reaction to this movie never seems to fade. The last scene brings me to tears, but also the scene between Perks and The Children on his birthday. And as for the friendly gentleman. This character is different. The generous provider and solver of problems. He knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. A perfect father to walk with, to make us feel safe. I do not know how the movie does that, but it touches deep inside something very English, which has long since disappeared from our daily experience, but we recognize and long for it immediately.
