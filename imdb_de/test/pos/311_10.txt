This film changed the art of filmmaking and told a complex story in a powerful new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy and offends a modern war with strange scenes full of Technicolor smoke. The film does not use music as a score, but as a practical part of the scene played by speakers, radios, and so on. Coppola uses a classic literary piece as inspiration, taking scenes and characters into a completely different environment. This is a difficult and courageous thing. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune and films him so that you can barely see his face. The sheer courage that such a movement requires is amazing and works wonderfully. This movie belongs to the top ten.
