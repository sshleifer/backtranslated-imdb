... that maybe one day people will wake up. People who can resist the urge to separate everything and who see the 60s as they were. People who can see that it was the individuals who made those times; not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The comparison of "Forrest Gump" is good. Both films look back on the 60s, but "Four Friends" is about people and not about cartoons. FF goes deep into what FG (pretty successful!) Tries to condense and tries to classify as nothing more than a backdrop. But while "Gump" dumps the 60's in a loft like old toys in a box, "Four Friends" picks up and hugs every toy, blurring the line between what you love and what you are. <br /> <br If you associate romance with shoe polish, you will hate this movie.
