Rules of Engagement is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It is well structured, well composed and offers excellent material to support the statements made. The best quality of the film is that it is not based on sympathy for the Dividian, but that it enlightens the audience to the crass governmental mistakes and lies that surround the entire situation. I have a sense of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger over the way the government handled and then hushed up a tragedy of this magnitude. The coverup really got me mad. It's one thing to make a mistake in one operation and to admit guilt, but another to look the American people in the eye and lie to them. I think it should not surprise me with the story of our beloved country that has witnessed the assassination of JFK, the Vietnam War and other significant events that smell so like a cover-up, that you have to stick your nose on every pass Washington DC The footage of an aircraft with special thermal sensor technology and the autopsies of some bodies clearly show that the FBI lies to the public. One of the things I want to look at when watching a documentary is that I usually only get one-to-one testimony. But this is undoubtedly one of the brilliant achievements of Rules of Engagement. It concludes its evidence so that even if you received statements from the FBI, how could you really believe them? I still remember the time when the media had presented the Dividians as this crazy group of cult rebels with those of David Koresh, the self-proclaimed, born-again Jesus Christ, as their leader. None of this was really factual, but rather a story that consisted of individual parts of facts. They have simply campaigned for their rights as American citizens to carry their weapons and practice their religion. If you were looking for the ATF, does the site attack the building with a unit of men armed with rifles and bulletproof suits finding the way to do it? If you are the FBI, why should you engage in psychological warfare and offer little in the actual trial to resolve the situation? Why do you pour gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children? Why open large holes in the composite structure when you know the possibility of a fire? Why is it lying when no weapons are fired when this can be clearly shown on video? Unless. Unless you wanted to see the situation end the way it was. The scene at the end, when the flag of the Dividian Star of David was blown from the flagpole into the fire and the ATF's were pulled up shortly thereafter, was an emotional climate scene that shook my head in disgust and made my stomach spin uncontrollably. The filmmaker William Gazecki deserves one of my highest congratulations. It's a lot of courage to shoot a movie like this, and I'm sure there were many repercussions from the government on it. Because of people like him, the public can be shown real truth instead of crap filtered through a medium that presents information that can hardly be considered genuine. When I think of how I felt about dividends back then, because David Koresh was in the media and how I felt when I saw this movie, that's really amazing. It reminds me of the lineage from the Bible of a man who was healed by Jesus and asked by the elders about how it happened "before I was blind, but now I can see," he told them over and over again. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You may have to search for it, but it's really something special.
