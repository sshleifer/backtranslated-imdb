I saw the original rough screen four times at Gencon a few years ago. I was very happy, my daughter is in the movie. <br /> <br /> I stood in the back of the room and watched the much younger fans sit on the edge of the seats and absolutely silent were missing a line. The standing ovation after that was like watching the fans when the US hockey team defeated the Russians at the Montreal Olympics. <br /> <br /> I love excellent comedy and visual gags. Taxi, Barney Miller, Cheers, Frasier and Married with Chilren are my favorite comedy shows of all time. Less shows I will not even look at. <br /> <br /> This movie will do for gamers what Animal House did for the college frat days, what Dodge Ball did for weird sports. Forget the lack of a mega-budget for production. This is pure art, so good. <br /> <br /> I could not be happier for the entire cast and production company.
