*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I loved the set-up and laughed throughout the movie. The acting was great. My favorite piece was how Howard (Kevin Kline) tries to be a "male man". The fianc√© and his parents did an excellent job as a side occupation. Warning about the spoiler: The acceptance of his conservative family and the attempts to be polite were heartwarming and believable. My only problem at the end was the fact that Howard was actually gay. The film is set up as "Be who you want to be", but the movie actually does the opposite. Howard's logic behind his "discovery" is the fact that he loves Barbra Streisand's films and loves to dance to music. His manners and tastes seem to be gay, and only when he is made aware does he realize it. Instead of releasing Howard, he clears it. Oh, he likes to dance to music, then he has to be gay. His confession at the wedding felt like he was turning to society's wishes. In the end, the film becomes a film with gay rights, which was not the original course. It's almost bland with the rest. I think the movie would have been better if Howard had not been clear. It would have been truer for the message.
