No madness, but a good movie that can be seen once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act. his writing was damn good. Great side cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as a private extortionist. <br /> <br /> The film's greatest strength is the work of Macy, which reminds us of his role as Jerry Lundergaard of Fargo. He has numerous scenes in which he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulative and fraudulent character. It's fun to see how he is a weasel, and I was glad he was fine. *** of four.
