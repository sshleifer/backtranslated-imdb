"Curse of the Monkey Island" is a treasure; In my opinion, the series as a whole was the holy grail of the adventure game, not to mention LucasArts. <br /> <br /> But returning to "Curse", which is so nice about CMI, is that it's not afraid to be yourself. Although it deviates from the first two, but remains true to the Ron Gilbert productions (if only one could say the same about the fourth episode of the series!). The language work is impeccable, Dominic Armato plays our favorite protagonist Guybrush Threepwood. The animation is very different from the classic pixelated characters, but it is beautiful. It is really beautiful. And the music is fantastic! It's never annoying and you never have the urge to turn it off. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of romance, the romantic scenes and motifs are by no means overwhelming. They also have the rare ability to look sweet and not cheesy. That says a lot about a girl who routinely fell asleep while chick moves. <br /> <br /> Then of course is the classic MI element of humor. CMI is very adept at delivering dead lines, absolutely absurd humor and fun. Gary Coleman is an emerging young entrepreneur, and events in the world are discretely tackled without getting out of the game. <br /> <br /> It's not fair to compare CMI with MI and MI2 because it really is in a separate area. Personally, I can never find a favorite among the 3 because they are all very different. However, if you want to have a good chat with the flair of the classic series, I insist that you give this game a shot. You will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, no doubt. <br /> <br /> - Emily N
