Bwana Devil is said to be the first large studio to be shot in full length in the 3D process. Allegedly, producer Oboler went to Africa to shoot another film, but after hearing the story of two man-eating lions terrorizing railroaders, he opted for the film. It's also a good story, almost like a Hemmingway; Fear, salvation, the great white hunter and everything. It's storytelling that seems to stretch out as if filming in the new process was too hard for the crew. The action scenes are stiff, almost too staged. However, these technical problems appear small given the dramatic conclusion of the film.
