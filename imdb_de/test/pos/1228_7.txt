I am not here to tell you that "Armored" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. Nope. Referenced directors are more like Don Siegel ("Charlie Varrick") and Walter Hill ("The Warriors"). These two helmets did not fool around with sweets like women in their films. There are no skirts to apply. They involuntarily made guy films. Rifles, many rifles. Men met violent death with a jerk of his chin. Her films were like a juice for the head. You want a friend? Get a dog. <br /> <br /> "Armored" is such a guy movie. Dueled armored trucks? Bloody gunshot wounds? Explode money? If that does not excite the lizard part of your brain, then stay away. <br /> <br /> At 88 minutes, "Armored" is everything you need without fat. We meet six security officers driving armored trucks, three per truck. The six, led by Matt Dillon, are planning a fake hijack with two trucks. One day, their mission is to save $ 42 million from the Federal Reserve (I think). The idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse, stow the money and then stage a hijack. Sure, the cops will guess, but if they stick together, they'll get through. <br/> <br /> Trouble is, one of the six, played by Columbus Short, is a holdout. At the start. But he faces the eviction. And he is the guardian for his kinky younger brother. He needs bad money. <br /> <br /> Matt Dillon Cajoles, asks, persuades the holdout. No blood on the hands. A clean break. Everything good, not bad. You will be forever rich. Blue sky smiles at you ... <br /> <br /> Right. <br /> <br /> Of course everything goes to hell. It's one damn thing after another and the stakes continue to rise. And almost everything happens claustrophobic in a deserted warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. In fact, the film tries to project a background of industrial urban decay. I like industrial decay in the industry. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Matt Dillon, who plays the best bad dog. He goes from charming about disappointed to frustrated about outrageous to totally insane in the course of the movie. I love this guy. <br /> <br /> Thanks to John Murphy's threatening, throbbing, bubbly and totally sinister electronic soundtrack, recognition is also a credit. I suspect he heard some Tangerine Dream records. <br /> <br /> It is also surprising that it is a PG-13 film. I caught one? on! ?? F bomb in this entire movie about violent robbers. In a way, I like that. Take the kids with you. <br /> <br /> The director is Nimrod Antal, a Hungarian who made a fine noir set on the Budapest subway called "Kontroll". Screenwriter is an out-of-nowhere guy named James V. Simpson. Many of the people in this film are just beginning. I'm willing to bet that the appreciation of this film will increase over time and these filmmakers will move forward in their careers.
