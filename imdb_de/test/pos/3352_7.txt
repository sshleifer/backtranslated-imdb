Alice enters a world full of wonders ... but not the miracle one remembers as a child. The Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the Queen, and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body - and other people's bodies - that could be wonderful. A story of love and lust that you have never seen before. Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I have to say that for the 70s this is the most attractive adult actress of her time. I think this is her only movie before she goes into mainstream work, but it was pretty much the best she could choose (my love for everything Alice is is no secret). Even better than "Fairy Tales" (that's not really pornography, so much). <br /> <br /> The songs are kitschy, but they fit the theme of the movie. A song: "What does a girl like you do on a knight like this?" was pretty funny, and the others had similar topics. The end-to-end process was well written and fit very well into the world of Alice. The logic and the humor were definitely taken into account. <br /> <br /> What more can you say about a movie like this? All I know is that for people accustomed to adult films that are just a 30-second introduction to sex, they'll overload you with action and music. Personally, however, I think this movie is special, and I hope it receives a nice DVD release of remnants and special features (if at all possible). I can see that this is a cult movie.
