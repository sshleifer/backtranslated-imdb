How would you feel if you only had a few more weeks to live? This film will help you through the eyes of a man who is confronted with this situation. It is told with sympathy and without too much feeling. Some may find it slow - but I think that adds to the realism of the film. Some may consider it a love story, but I think that's secondary when he sees his last days through his eyes. The love of his life belongs to the end of his life and gives him more effect. Unobtrusive and gentle, the film rolls the story like life. Without clich√©s and unexpected events against the background of getting through. If you like your movies gently emotionally realistic, this may be for you.
