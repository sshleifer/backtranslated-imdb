Forgive the * really * lame gameplay scene, the cardboard background and the studio-like stadium. For this part, I would have had to give the movie 5 instead of 7, but read on ... <br /> <br /> From the premise to the plot, there are many similarities with "The Replacements". Some say that this movie "demolishes" The Replacements, while others say that this script has written before. <br /> <br /> Both films require a kind of "lifting of disbelief" in the basic premise, and this is particularly difficult for "Second String" as they have an NFL licensing team and the entire story is over for some people too lame, not to mention in "Second String". Bill has to overcome big marks again and again. The limit budget for shooting the game scene makes this even look bad. <br /> <br /> In "Replacements," the premise and the league are fictional, but you know it happens in real life. I think it's easier to accept fictional stories and scenarios with real events ("Oh yeah, that happens before!") Real scenario scenario with fictional scenario ("There's no way Bill can win a Superbowl!"; Some scenes were actually similar in pre-season games of Raven games, real stadium, real audiences, and some NFL hits. But let's say both movies came out the same day, and we're clearing out the budget factor (So ​​forget about the gameplay action scene): Overall, I do not like "Second String" versus "Replacements" that much, but I like that more. <br /> <br /> It has a "relatively better" character development In "Replacement," the Keanu character is "out of sync with the world," and maybe he just cares to get a girl? In Second String, you'll see the QB struggle to get the job back and sit down Coach in the past Or the Fummel problem. Of course, this "holding the ball all day" solution is not new, but we see progress in the correction. <br /> <br /> How about these trick games? I think it is "relatively realistic" as a "substitute". The "Dan Marino" likes fake knee-pass, flea flares, wild cat full of backs, all real, only sometimes it looks a bit too easy. But for me, it's better to catch "Replacement" in the middle and rush for 50 yards, or look too simple like a 60 yard field goal. Oh, by the way, I'm glad they did not force the TE kicker to do his shot ... Of course, if you rate this movie objectively across all other football movies, this could easily be 5 out of 10 movies. But some say this is the worse football movie? Try "The Comebacks".
