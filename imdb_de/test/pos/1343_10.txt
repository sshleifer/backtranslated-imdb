One of the most beautiful memories of my childhood. Should be on DVD. It captures everything we grew up with in the seventies - tranquility, serenity, floral power, and great acoustic music. The two hosts, Carol and Paula, were the definitive peacenik hippies with long hair, blouses and farm pants (they looked like Katherine Ross (aka "The Graduate") and Ali McGraw (ala "Love Story").) br /> <br /> They made us happy with jokes from the "chucklepatch" daisy, taught us nice ways to talk with the quirky garden croaker, and talked with music from their guitar. They were the best, and Carol was also the original Sandy in the original production of "Grease" (cool). <br /> <br /> This show should be in a time capsule, including "The Yellow Submarine", "Arrow to the Sun" and Marlo Thomas, "Being Free ... You and Me. "Also" sunshine "and" the point ". <br /> <br /> And last but not least, this motto song: "See you soon, see you soon, hope you had a good, good time, ah ha, I'm glad we'll say a good morning to you I hope we meet again ya, See you, I'm glad you could stay awhile, ah ha, I hope we'll meet again, see you, see you.
