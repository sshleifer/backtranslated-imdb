This excellent music movie in beautiful technicolor is so wonderful that every Irish descent is proud. Full of the joy and celebration of all Irish things, a fine cast, with brilliant settings and great theatrical stagings, lovely Irish music and the Irish tenor voice of star Dennis Morgan, is the Irish's luck to have such a wonderful feeling movie over and over to enjoy again! Not just for St. Patty's Day, but for the whole year. <br /> <br /> One of the jewels that Jack L. Warner produced during his heyday as a studio boss in Burbank in the 1940s /> Shame on Warner Brothers who did not take this beautiful picture on home videos and -DVDs have!
