A rare tedious Kinski role as Crazy Johnny sex madman wanted in San Francisco. Kinski's character is obsessed with raping women, an old-world sexual predator that has nothing but steal, rape and kill. This film may be a big disappointment to many western spaghetti fans, but not to many Klaus Kisnki fans. Overall, there were two things, a great performance by Klaus Kinski and great music by Stelvio Cipriani. <br /> <br /> Another story that took much more work to be effective, but still fun to see! <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have this movie redone in the future. Because most old films are made new nowadays.
