What a mistake has been dismissed for stilted dialogue and / or as an archetypal characterization shows exactly how people spoke, lived and were pre-World War II, let alone "The Big Trail" in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie took my breath away when I first saw it years ago. Reading the boards here helped me understand why the box office was missing and why moviegoers could benefit from Wayne in B Westerns for another ten years. Wayne was in my opinion better in "The Big Trail" and B's years than most of his stars after 1939, with Ford's incredible cavalry trilogy "True Grit" and "The Shootist" being exceptions. <br /> <What a shame the cinemas here missed the boat in 1930. Had we met this movie, we might have enjoyed more movies with more realism and less hokum. In my opinion, this is not only one of the most beautiful westerns ever filmed with precise dialogues and accurate character realization, but also the finest portrayals of a passage of any kind ever made on film. <br /> <br /> It still takes my breath away. Especially the dialogue and the exact characterization of types that just do not exist anymore. Some celebrate the surface homogenization of our culture, which actually hides the greatest cultural humiliation (in "people like us" and "people like them") and political divisions (corporatists vs. main streetists) in US history, but for me, "The Big Trail "represents a time when our surface differences were more obvious, but among them, most wanted to find out the nation's failures, and most wanted to build a great culture and a great nation. <br /> "The Big Trail" is an epic of the melting pot that moves towards American Dream. Certainly the best movie on this path that I have ever seen. the theme ever filmed.
