As a lifelong fan of Kung Fu movies, I have to say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. Of course, the plot is nothing special, but man entertains it. Like most movies of the genre. This movie is full of action and does not thrill its viewers. It's so damned funny to see that I have a smile on my face all the time. This will also affect future films like Kill Bill. (Many of Kill Bill's sound effects come from this movie, for example.) This is essential to all well-known Kung Fu audiences. Form open to close This movie is full of battles that really are among the better ones I have seen in this genre. There are few kung fu films that match the magic and entertainment of this film. So if you are looking for a great Kung Fu movie, be sure to check it out.
