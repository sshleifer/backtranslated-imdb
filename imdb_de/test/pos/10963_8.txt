In the credits of "Shadows", after reading "directed by John Cassavetes", there are some white letters on the screen: "The movie you just saw is improvised," it says. I always follow the fact that words in movies are so important since filmmakers use them, because basically there is no movie without script and many other reasons. Cassavetes pursued the same goal, and he believed in the freedom of words; "Shadow" is the perfect example. It is a movie without real main characters and without real main lines. It's mostly people in different situations who talk. Yes, some of the situations are related, but Cassavetes seems to be always in a hurry to speak when the characters are moving somewhere or fleeing from someone and not speaking. <br /> <br /> The bill is everything in this movie. For example, there is a brilliant score full of jazz influences and many fantastic solos, and there's a character who says he's a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (Ben, all the characters' names are the same as the actors). However, we never see him playing the trumpet or jamming with a band; He does not even talk about music and only wanders through the city with his friends. They talk a lot and everything that comes to their minds; They go from the intelligence of each to the funny analysis of a sculpture. <br /> <br /> "Shadow" is funny in parts like the above in its intellectual references, as these friends are not cultivated. However, the only important female character of the film (Lelia) wants to be intellectual. But here, too, she has a very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, a book she's trying to write, and how she's dealing with reality. but nothing to do with being intellectual. At the same party, a woman actually makes an intellectual statement full of complexity and asks a man next to her, "Do you agree?". "Yes," he says, but you can say he does not know what she's talking about. Another character, a singer (Hugh), occasionally speaks about his glory days and we see him perform only once; but there are no indications of the music industry. At the heart of Cassavetes is the relationship of the singer to his manager (Rupert), where chats are mostly about trivial rather than 'musical' conversation. Therefore, the trumpeter's important deal in Shadow is the time he spends with his friends. The intellectual wannabe girl is her way of dealing with romantic relationships (one of the film's strengths), and the singer is the link to his manager. Appearances Is easy. Cassavetes needed people who could master the improvisation without it being important to them if they were really good. I think some of them are not, but they certainly know how to improvise in a scene, and you realize how well they do it. "Shadow" is not about actors; it's about making a kind of cinema based on the magic of conversation; and there you could say that performances mean something. That's why the camera in every conversation is like a stalker, constantly watching the eyes of every character and constantly searching for the expressions that come with natural language. There is a scene where the trumpeter and his friends are trying to find girls. They are three, so everyone sits next to a girl (the girls are three and two) at three different tables. They all speak at the same time, and the camera shoots through the table, and sometimes the friends look at each other while they say whatever they say. It is natural.
