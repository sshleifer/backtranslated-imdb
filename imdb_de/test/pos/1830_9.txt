This movie is cute - not reassuring, just warm and friendly. I found it only slightly funny, and the premise * is unlikely [...] unlikely, but the characters are so charming (especially Minnie Driver's) that from the start they had my full attention and soon my affection Bonnie Hunt has one in her directorial debut great job and also while writing. I highly recommend this movie and will see it again, I'm sure.
