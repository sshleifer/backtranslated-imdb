This movie is called "Junior Pilot" on IMDb but "Final Approach" on Netflix. Imagine that! The film is a joy for both young and adult audiences who can break their maturity long enough to see this movie through the eyes of their own youth. For the adult, the story is quite predictable and perhaps banal and melodramatic; The story may seem new and creative to young people who have not seen or read many films or books with such an act. In any case, the creators of the film, especially the film, must be endorsed by director James Becket and cinematographer Denis Maloney, who made this entertaining and visually most interesting film. The cuts to the young protagonist Ricky's fantasy thoughts are both funny and wonderful filmed. The young actors consistently give credible performances that are seemingly quite involved in their roles - as stupid as many scenes. Jordan Garrett plays the protagonist "Ricky" quite well with excellent camera presence. Jeffrey Tedmori creates a wonderfully soft and empathetic "Shashi" that thrives on all the ridiculous things on hot sauce. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley also give solid performances. <br /> <br /> As typical of his always good acting, Larry Miller creates a solid parental figure around which the child-oriented, partly fantastic world revolves. Compared to his father figure, the adult's other big roles seem to be superficial and one-dimensional, deliberate and rather humorous, to be sure. Of course, it is quite entertaining, perhaps repeated for the target group of teens, but also for at least one adult viewing that retain the ability to make such a movie out of their own to look at youthful perspective once.
