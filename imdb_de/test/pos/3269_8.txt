The inspiration for this film was the fact that American gangsters are well dressed, but the Australians, if you kill a man as soon as you look at the blower, then you can dress as bad as you want and people will do not criticize. <br /> <br /> Jimmy is a fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes a bouncer, and is offered by Pando, the local gangster boss on the cross (ie, Australia's notorious Kings Cross District, not the Cross of London.) Many British backpackers find It's the hard way. <br /> <br /> Because of feelings of love he stuffs a job, loses a lot of money and has to bring it to Pando before Pando and his sisters can kill him <br /> <br /> Much darker Humor, interesting action, revelations about the underside of Australia and human nature, it's all about the Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian criminals (compared to American and British). <br /> <br /> A problem is that each of the elements of the story does not have enough content and content depth, but it is a wide-stroke painting covering many areas not previously covered, so it pays off as a whole package <br /> <br /> Combine it with "Chopper" and "Dirty Deeds", your Aussie Crime Fest or "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Miller's Crossing" for an International who does not reach the criminal gang feast. <br /> <br /> Bryan Brown is by the way a great actor made a huge number of really bad movies. Here is one of his great movies.
