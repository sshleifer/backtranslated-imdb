I have always loved "Gone With The Wind" and have seen it many times. The end, however, not only made me "hanging", but depressed with a hopeless feeling. Finally, in Scarlett, Ripley brought us to a very plausible and satisfying end ("beginning") of the original story. <br /> <br /> It follows that someday someone of Scarlett's apparent intelligence (as originally written) would eventually grow up doing so. Although I, like most people, fell in love with Scarlett in GWTW, I'm sick of annoying her inflexible infatuation with despair, and I was disappointed that Mitchell had not shown that Scarlett was using that obvious intelligence to even to grow emotionally. Luckily someone finally did it. (Is not that nagging immaturity that contradicts her beauty and intelligence, which is why Rhett finally gave her up?) I think Ripley described this overdue process perfectly, and Whalley-Kilmer did an excellent job. Joanne WK has all the fire, the exuberance and the intelligent sparkle like Vivian Leigh, and she is at least that way, if not more beautiful. <br /> <br /> There was, there is and will only ever be a clark gable. But if I had to pick an actor out of the thousands I showed him in his biography, it would definitely be Timothy Dalton. Dalton has the same elegant charm as Gable, which is essential to Rhett's character. I can not imagine anyone who could come closer. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, both Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were superbly cast and the only actors Scarlett and Rhett could have played. I think their performances did not just do justice to the deceased actors, but also to the spirit of their characters. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the whole cast. Julie Harris was her usual sexy presence, and Jean Smart was a lovely kick! Even Ashley's character was well played by Stephen Collins, and the development of his relationship with Scarlett was completely credible. <br /> <br /> The story was a little confused in Ireland but so is life and I still found it entertaining. <br /> <br /> All in all, I really enjoyed the fruits of Ripley's imagination. I wish I had written it! <br /> <br />
