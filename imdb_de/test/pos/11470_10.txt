I loved this movie, I loved the plot, I loved the shoot-out scenes, except a few, they were not needed and I enjoyed Ma's character as well, she was a rider I liked. I have to say that the actors in this gangster movie were well chosen because some actors sometimes do not fit into the role. I hate to say it, but I hated the end. I felt like it should have gone in a different direction. It would have been better with a little more detail, it's based on a true story, but so many facts were left out, but apart from that it was good. If you enjoy films about the past gangsters, you will enjoy this movie.
