This review contains MILD SPOILERS, but not enough to ruin the story ... <br /> <br /> Recently, Nihon Chinbotsu (Sinking of Japan or Japan Sinks, depending on where you live) watched a remake of the 1970s Films of the same name, which itself is based on Sakyo Komatsu's bestseller. This film is a jewel of Japanese film production. It seems that Japan is sinking west due to a subduction of a tectonic plate. The Americans predict that this will happen over a 40-year period. According to Dr. Tadokoro (a seemingly "crazy" scientist) this will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government is not so confident, but it is creating a disaster relief evacuation plan and forming a new D1 team to deal with the crisis. On a trip to China to negotiate evacuation plans, the Japanese prime minister was killed and the cabinet panicked. The D1 team has to take care of most of the affairs and is led by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management, Saoro Takamori (ex-wife of Dr. Tadokoro). Instead, she turns to Dr. Tadokoro for advice, and he plans to astronomically blow huge holes under Japan to prevent the process of destruction. Japan would soon have to negotiate with different countries and persuade them to accept Japanese refugees It soon seems that many countries are reluctant to accept more because of the sudden influx of Japanese in their country and the ensuing chaos. (If this ever happens, touch wood, then I hope Ito Misaki is safe ... she can always stay with me ... hee hee). The evacuation scenes are really well done, showing the devastation, suffering and desperation that civilians face in such catastrophic times. And the many faces of people appear, arrogance, selfishness, bribery, valor, cowardice ... <br /> <br /> This is a really well made movie. The storytelling is solid, with a gripping storyline and wonderful plays. Dr. Tadokoro (played by Toyokawa Etsushi) was really very successful, representing a divorced and often crazy scientist kicking that stuff. His frustration and worries were very clear and that's really good. Reiko (played by Shibasaki Kou) was also pretty well played and has the most memorable line in the entire movie (look at it to find out), and I think she has a nice acting voice. She plays the love interest of Toshio Onodera (played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of SMAP). Oh, I almost forgot ... she really has very long hair ~ And there is also a subtle but background love story that is well written and if there is something the Japanese do really well, then it's love stories. .. <br /> <br /> One thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations to the events, and if you're interested in geography, you have a really good time (I know that I ... hehe). I can see that they have done everything they can to make the theory of this film credible, and the first graphical representations and explanations have been done pretty well (though you must excuse the famous "Engrish" of the Japanese. <br /> <br / > OK, now for the effects (it's just the effects, is not it?) After watching the movie in pure awe, I have to say that this movie has special effects that are similar to Hollywood (or even more better ...) The volcanic eruptions ... the massive earthquakes ... the destruction ... the tsunamis ... the explosions ... all great .. The opening scene is so cool that the first earthquake surprised you, the mountains are falling, the destruction It's a miracle to see Mount Fuji hotter ... then you see Shibuya fall to the ground ... it's so sad !!! one of the best scene n was the huge tsunami scene where bailouts fail and people are nowhere to run and have no hope to ... the final scene also deserves a mention ... wonderful stuff. If you like effects, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... Every good movie has a great song. The really addictive "Keep Holding U" sung by the super sweet and charming SunMin is a duet with Kubota, and it's just gorgeous. I think it suits the movie very well and it shows that no matter what disasters strike us, our love and strength would hold us. The catastrophic scenes are treated with orchestral music and occasional silence (a Japanese specialty) and really make the destruction on the screen a mess. Oh, and did I mention it's a really, really, very wide screen? Okla, have repeatedly talked about this movie. Yes, I loved it and I hoped to see it again ... It has some storylines, but it's all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie. Not perfect, but really well done. I would give a 9 out of 10 points. I am happy to say that the most expensive film in Japanese history is also one of the best. If you have not seen it, you should really do it today ... it's a must!
