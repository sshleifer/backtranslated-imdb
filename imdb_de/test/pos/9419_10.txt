A brilliant Sherlock Holmes adventure with the brilliant Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Despite many other actors who have brilliantly played with Holmes and Watson and did a great job, Rathbone and Bruce will always be the best two. Holmes brings a Professor Tobell from Switzerland to London. Tobell is wanted by the Nazis. He has a bomb sight that could win World War II. His bomb site was divided into four parts, each of which was hidden in books. Tobell agrees to hand over his bomb camp to the British government. Tobell goes to his girlfriend's house the night he arrives. He has drawn some figures of men, if Tobell should disappear, the lady should hand over the drawings to Holmes. On his journey home, he is attacked, but a police officer stops and the attacker runs away. Tobell is glad that the British government is using his bomb camp, but she does not want to, Tobell wants to take care of it. The bomb site is divided into four parts, each part without the other is completely unusable. He gives each of his scientists a part of this bombing. Then Holmes's biggest fear happens, Tobell disappears. Holmes visits the young lady Tobell with the night when he was attacked. She tells him about the drawings. The drawings were stolen. She says that only one man came during the time Tobell went to repair the lightbulb. The man she describes is Professor Moriarty. He works for the Nazis. As he has the drawings, Holmes is done. But he finds the writing pad he uses and uses Science to find out what Tobell has drawn by looking at the next page of the block. He sees the code. He sees the name of four scientists. The first three work on the code, but he can not work out the fourth. The three scientists he found out were murdered and the bomb camp was confiscated. Holmes can not work out the fourth scientist, nor Moriarty. Disguised as a sailor, Holmes manages to get into Moriarty's office. Moriarty immediately sees that it is Holmes, puts him in a box and lets him throw into the sea. But Watson and Lestrade insist they search the box and find Holmes in it. It is now obvious that Moriarty is at large. Holmes manages to work out the fourth code, a Frederick Hoffner. Holmes goes straight to his house and brings Hoffner and the crucial fourth part to safety. Now Holmes Moriarty has to be charged with collaborating with the Nazis. He pretends to be Hoffner. Moriarty prepares the fourth code and gets two men to pick Hoffner. They bring him back and he sees Moriarty face to face. Meanwhile, Tobell is not doing well, he was tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. Moriarty got it now with Holmes, he got it and his death has to be a long one for Holmes. The idea is to take him to his hospital, put a needle in his vein, and watch him die drop by drop. Watson runs in and saves the day. Moriarty escapes, but Holmes was just careless enough to let Moriarty's door open. Moriarty crashes 60 feet deep. <br /> <br /> So, Moriarty is dead. No, he's making his last appearance in the movie "The Woman in Green," but in "Green," he's definitely dead, a suicide, jumping off his roof. It was Moriarty's second of three appearances in the Rathbone series, in which he was played by another actor. His first appearance in "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" was played by George Zucco. His second in this film was he played by Lionell Atwill and Henry Daniels in his last engagement in "The Woman in Green". Universal's first three Holmes films were sent to war as Holmes triumphed over the Nazis. 'The Voice of Terror' was the first, then this movie and then 'Sherlock Holmes In Washington'. Then it went back to the Victorian era with solid ties to Edwardian and Georgian (George the fifth and sixth). This film had a close connection to the Sherlock Holmes short story "The Dancing Men", which can be found in "The Return of Sherlock Holmes". A great movie, though obvious propaganda, it was a brilliant Holmes trip.
