Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny and entertaining show. You should not take the whole show seriously, but if you want to have fun, this is your TV show. Being manufactured by the manufacturers of Xena is a quality guarantee, and Cleopatra 2525 is not significantly different from Xena. The female warrior formula is taken to the future where it does not have to fight against warriors or gods, but dangerous robots that dwell in the surface and humans are forced to live underground. During Cleopatra's two seasons, they develop an interesting and fun underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They are all different, but as a team they work really well. The three main actresses were previously seen in Xena, as most of the regular / guest actors (there are also some familiar faces of Hercules or both shows). I especially liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from her previous roles. So if you liked Xena and Hercules, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. If you do not know them, give it a try: I am sure you will enjoy it.
