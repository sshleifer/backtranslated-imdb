The skeleton of the story is that the main character must win a high-stakes public kung-fu tournament. The flesh of history consists of many struggles, a triangle of love, treachery, rivalries and revenge. <br /> <br /> This story has a lot to offer. The main character is very sympathetic as a well balanced, meek and very tough country boy. A good against a bad movie is only as good as the villains and the main villains are tough and smart, not to mention ugly, sneaky and tricky The main character imagines herself and the protagonist running towards each other on a flowery field hug when they meet. I thought I was watching The Sound of Music for a second and almost lost hope for the movie. Fortunately, the movie quickly recovered with a fight scene.
