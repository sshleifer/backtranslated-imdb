After receiving a copy of the Bostocks Cup, I must confess that it is not as funny as I originally thought !! IT IS BETTER!!!!! Charlie Williams ... devoured your heart. Game fixation ???? Never! Tilt at 45%? Ronnie and Reggie Kay? George Best? The bus driver who thinks Pontefract is in South Wales (It's All That Ponty That And Ponty That) Bertie Masson's (Tim Healey) Luck Cup Hat !! (not that he has gimmicks) Sugar Plum Fairy ????? Confused???? Take a look at it again. The innovative use of real footage on Bostock players was great and the manufacturer should be proud to give us a MASTERPIECE. Come on ITV, do the fans and yourself a favor - show it again !!! Please>
