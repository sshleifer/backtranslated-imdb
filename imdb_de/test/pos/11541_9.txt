I'll make that clear as possible for those of you who do not know Bill Hicks's legacy. He was simply the biggest stand-up comedian in the world, in my opinion certainly the biggest one ever to live (his stand-up idol is the great Richard Pryor, whose struggles were parallel to addiction). His death in 1994 was barely noticed in the popular media, just weeks after Kurt Cobain committed suicide. His tragic death at such a young age overshadows any feeling of injustice that he was, of course, criminally ignored during his life. But the rough truth is clear as the day: no one has requested his coat. There is no stand-up comedian who lives on almost the ability and the invention. <br /> <br /> The observation is made in the attached Homage to It's Just a Ride, which assumes that stand-up comedians often view the job as a step forward for richer pursuits - lame movies and movies morally driven sitcoms that occupy the life of an unimaginative audience but never enrich it. It's all Bill Hicks talked about. His preaching has always been an outcry for people who think for themselves, question authority and come together to form a race. <br /> <br /> His appeal is growing every year since his death. His star will shine for a long time after so many smaller lights are blown out. Once you have met his brilliant, intelligent, but ultimately compassionate result, you will be enriched and rewarded. The man himself liked to quote Dylan, "To live outside the law, you have to be honest," he said, "Bill Hicks was honest, and he was the funniest of them all.
