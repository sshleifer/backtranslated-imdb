The film begins with a crazy old Broadway producer (exceptionally well played by veteran-character actor Richard Carle), who is driven by a man who hopes to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a heavy storm, and the car gets stuck in the mud, so they have to find a place to spend the night. Fortunately, there is a villa nearby, although it does seem strange that people know the writer and he says he did not know that this was the home of a man he knew (and despised). Although this may seem like bad and constructed writing, it is not ... because all of this is part of a clever trick of the writer to have a group of actors in the house doing his act. Halfway through the ruse, however, the producer and his brutalized assistant find out that the murder mystery that takes place in the apartment is a fake, and considers the whole thing pretty weird. But what no one notices is that an escaped madman is laid back and he will just enter this little plot - for wonderful curves and twists. If it looks as if there is a real murder, the actors are really scared, while Carle and his buddy are convinced that this is all a joke. While I have explained some of the details of the plot, there are many other aspects of the movie that you need to figure out for yourself - and it's safe to entertain and guess. <br /> <br /> Considering that this is the case A B-movie in the public domain, I had NO high hopes for this little movie. However, I was thrilled to find that the movie was a much better movie than the average - with a very interesting and novel twist on the old clich√© conspiracy over a dark and stormy night in a mansion. In addition, the dialogue of the film was very good, but the dialogue was even better - with a lot of sparkling joke and a pleasant, carefree pace. Full of pleasant surprises and worth your time.
