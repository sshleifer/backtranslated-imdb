I saw this movie when I was still living in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood and I told her how much I liked watching her in this movie. She sent me a signed photo. This movie was filmed by Jacques Tourneur and starring alongside Jean Peters. There are also Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget and Herbert Marshall. It was released in color in 1951 and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. She also starred in "Viva Zapata" with Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, who won an Oscar for the role of Zapata's brother (Marlon Brando played as Zapata) (1952). She also starred in "Captain from Castile" (1947) with Tyron Power. Since then I've been trying to find a place where it's available, but so far I have not been successful. Does anyone have any suggestions on where to find and buy this movie? If this comment contains spoilers, I do not know anything about it.
