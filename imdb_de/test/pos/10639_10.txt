Some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the stairs in the sequence "Odessa Staircase". These men are not Cossacks but regular army troops. <br /> <br /> The Cossacks arrive a little later at the scene, and they are the men on horses smashing their heads at the crowd. For experts in Russian history: Correct me if I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> But there are a few lines in the movie that nobody seems to have commented on. After the Potemkin takeover, someone in the crowd on the shore says, "Kill the Jews!" This is only a few seconds on the screen, but it is there. How cruelly typical of history, not only in Russia, but also in so many other countries, that they blame the Jews immediately, carelessly and instinctively for all domestic problems! <br /> <br /> Perhaps other parts of the film are historically not factual, but the outcry against the Jews is all too real. Comments, anyone? <br /> <br /> Why can speakers of English not learn to pronounce the name as "Potyomkin" instead of "Potemkin"? There is a need in Russian to distinguish between the two possible pronunciations of "e": either as "ye" or as "yo". Sometimes two points are used to distinguish these two pronunciations, but usually the difference simply needs to be saved.
