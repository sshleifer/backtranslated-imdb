I am selling the dead to convicted grave robber Arthur Blake. Blake's friend and fellow grave Willie Grimes has just been executed and Blake will follow suit the next morning. As he sits in his cell waiting for his execution, a priest named Father Duffy comes in and asks him if he will tell all he has seen as a grave robber. Then he goes on to give Father Duffy a quasi-biography of his more interesting exploits. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story consists of several events that are only chronologically linked. This prevents the viewer from getting bored, but the events become less significant, as you can easily add or remove many scenes without realizing it. Although it was flawed, I found that overall this method contributed to the fun love of the movie and made it very entertaining. Most of the different stories are good, especially the alien, the murphy's and the vampire, but others were not that great. <br /> <br /> The acting is not great, but I did not find it bad point. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance, as he was serious when it mattered, and he also got on very well with the comedic parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> The characters were not very profound, but they were all interesting. I also enjoyed how some of the bad guys were made in an exaggerated, almost comic way. The part with the background story of the Murphys and their gang is invaluable. <br/> <br /> Overall, I Sell the Dead combines horror, comedy and sci-fi into a mix of fun and excitement. It's one of the more interesting and original films I've seen for some time, and it's unfortunate that independent films like this one are no longer respected.
