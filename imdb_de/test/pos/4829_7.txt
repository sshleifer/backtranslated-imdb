"Wicked Little Things" really separates from other zombie movies. First, all the zombies in the movie do not break right in front of you and tear your meat apart with your bare hands. They kill you with either a pickaxe or a shovel and eat at Wards. Second, they can not die. In most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but they just will not die. Third, this is the main reason why this movie separates itself, all zombies are children. How did they exactly die to become zombies? They worked in a coal mine when suddenly everyone died in a collapse. Now they are walking in the woods with their pickaxes and shovels, waiting for someone to come around and kill and eat them. Oh, they're coming out tonight. Yes, only at night. That makes the movie even more fun than if it came out in the morning. Despite all the violent and bloody tricks in this movie, 'Wicked Little Things' is a great choice if you are looking for a movie about zombie children. Do not expect anything great such as "Dawn of the Dead" or "Land of the Dead", but expect a lot of gore and violence to make this movie a real zombie fan. Give Scout Taylor-Compton a big hit by Rob Zombie's "Halloween" Hand to do a great job, as she did in "Halloween". She really has to play in other horror movies.
