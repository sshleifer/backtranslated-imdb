An extremely gentle retelling of the Shakespeare game (and much more open than Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a great pleasure, and Gena Rowlands shares the limelight. His role in the Prospero role is well suited to the kind of harsh omniscient expression he brings to the story. This is particularly evident in a scene in which he provoked a storm when he spotted his strange wife and lover in a speedboat (accompanied by the soundtrack of a suitable selection of Stomu Yamashta's "Go"). This is just one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy blurs and the viewer feels that magic is more possible than one might think. Add to that an outstanding performance by Raul Julia and a good work by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald. The movie becomes a nice little treat that fills the space behind your eyes.
