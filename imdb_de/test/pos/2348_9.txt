I liked this movie, the second Naruto movie. I enjoyed them a bit better in the snow, though I found the story a little disconnected here because I was not sure where certain things should happen or when. Like the first movie, this movie has an hour and a half of running time, lots of time for a nice, well-developed movie with some really cool fights. The story begins with Ninja from the village, hiding in the sand fighting with unknown assailants. Then Naruto, Sakura and Shikumaru go on a hunt for a ferret, which they think will be an easy task. They soon learn something different as they are also attacked, and Naruto is separated from his friends after fighting with a strange young warrior dressed in armor. Both are injured and taken in by a caravan, and shortly thereafter Naruto is invited to join this strange organization, which wants to create a utopia. Of course, not everything is as it seems, and there are many struggles. My favorite was the one in which Garaa fights against this strange woman who takes him very easily, which is a very big mistake. The final fight is also pretty good with Naruto and this strange man, who is a better villain than any of the others in the previous movie.
