Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of adultery and its consequences. They can be devastating for the partners and even more for a minor child who in this case is played by Justin Henry. What I think of Kramer vs. Kramer really liked, is his greatest strength as a film So the parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides of their being. Although the film is in Hoffman's direction and more inclined to his relationship with his son, he is neither portrayed as a saint nor is Streep a completely black villain. Hoffman is a career-oriented man in the ad game. He almost ignored the dreams and desires of his wife. Still, it's a big shock to him when Streep says love is gone and she wants to get out. She also wants to be a mother, at least for a while. Hoffman and Henry are doing the best they can. The pressure to be both parents causes Hoffman to lose his job, and he has to pay lower wages in another agency. At this time Streep decides after more than a year that she wants custody. Both parents make compelling witnesses and give their case nicely, but in these situations the tie is always broken in favor of the mother. <br /> Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first of two Oscars for this film, they in the category "Supporting Actress". I am not sure how these things are decided. Streep has less screen time than Hoffman, if that's the deciding factor. The film focuses on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he's involved in the blame for the marriage failure. As far as Meryl is concerned, choosing her hobbies as many women do to reconcile careers and motherhood is her choice. The conflict in their psyche is visible to everyone on the screen. Dustin Hoffman won this Oscar partly for the same reason that Spencer Tracy got his first commission by completing the impossible task of inactivity. A scene stealing a kid steals the movie. Children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors, and Henry is great because he passes by as a real kid, not a Hollywood kid. I wonder if Hoffman saw Captains Courageous and how Spencer Tracy dealt with Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have been much worse in performance than Spencer Tracy. Kramer vs. Kramer also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is a smart and captivating drama about adults falling out of love and trying to be as good as possible with themselves and their child. Do not miss it if ever aired.
