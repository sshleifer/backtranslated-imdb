It is the story of three brothers who contract in the midst of distress and loss and learn that the most important things in life are family, love, trust and forgiveness. The entire cast creates a strong performance despite some lousy one-liners. A great movie for fans of lifelike issues in credible families. Also worth a look for fans of Dermot Mulroney or Sean Astin. Both do an amazing job and often bring tears. Take my word for it and rent it today!
