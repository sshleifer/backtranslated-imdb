I saw pp the other day. I have to say, I was very impressed by how real the movie was. It felt very much like a documentary. I also think that the film offered realistic possibilities. In the film, the war in Vietnam escalates to the point where China is involved. What if that happened? I think the scenarios are similar to those in the movie. We've had camps in this country before ... and still do ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for everyone ... especially radicals ... <br /> <br /> I always have said I was in the position these kids were in, that I would just drop my ass. I love America and its big wars (wink wink)
