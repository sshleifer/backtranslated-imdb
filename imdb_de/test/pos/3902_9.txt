In collaboration with William H. Macy, Donald E. Westlake wrote the best and hardest to find novel "A Travesty". * Very * true to the story, movie star Macy is an unfortunate man who goes too far in the head after trying to cover up an accidental death. Costars Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good supporting roles. The strength of the film lies in the complicated twist-after-twist story and acting, especially by Macy, who routinely and happily breaks through the 4th wall and comes with her every time. A good story with a lot of dark humor that got me so involved that I've seen her three times a week since she came out. Prepare to control your critical abilities and give a loud, non-partisan "Wheeeeee!" Out.
