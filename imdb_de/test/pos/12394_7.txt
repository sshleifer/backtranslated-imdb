I blow hot and cold over Carn√©. He can really be a mystery to me. I think his inspiration may have left him earlier than other directors of his generation. Certainly a man who matured in the thirties with the Popular Front seems uneasy in France in the 1950s, with his rampant commercialism and strong American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and that shows. The party scenes take much longer than they should, as if trying to gain time for the anemic scenario. The character of Roland Lesaffre - he plays the older brother of Pascale Petit - seems only to exist to assure the director that his old ideas are still solid. <br /> <br /> At two hours, this picture is way too long. Let me still praise Pascale Petit for their performance. She was a natural, who should have challenged Brigitte Bardot for the supremacy of sexpots, but she somehow got lost. Andrea Parisy is also great as a girl who gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and legitimize her baby (yes, in the fifties they still thought so). Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor to convincingly play an anarchist: He's great here because he saves a cat from dying, and then realizes he can not stand a cat. Jacques Charrier reminds me only of how mediocre he was as an actor, with that constant little smile and empty eyes.
