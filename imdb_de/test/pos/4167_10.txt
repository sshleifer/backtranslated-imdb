A surprisingly big cartoon in the same league as Batman: TAS and its kind. I enjoyed it very much in my youth, and I've seen it all again recently, great voice with Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche. The only thing I had was that Rob Paulson's voice for the title character was a bit too old, but that was not a big deal, since the stories were great and the fact that the whole thing has a great end to the time loop. Some people say it's a cop-out, but I found it refreshing compared to many series where things just get stuck. Hopefully one day they released this series on DVD, unfortunately it came out at a time when there was no DVD and the cartoon probably only served to sell a particular toy that I never found appealing despite the entertaining cartoon.
