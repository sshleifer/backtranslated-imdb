This was one of the first color films that I saw as a kid in the cinema. It's good to remember that. The girl, Liz Taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, played along with the tiny and excellent actor Mickey Rooney. The content of the movie plot is good for all ages, goodwill and behavior. The good ethics of Velvet's parents, especially their mother, is something to consider. Our generations should be well educated and this film can help. Velvet loves the horses and runs with them, and Mi Taylor (Rooney) brought them to an international horse race in England, where in the end the young Velvet won, but was disqualified because of his wife.
