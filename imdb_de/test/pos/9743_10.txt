As mentioned in one of my great reviews, FLASH GORDON's Universal Pictures trilogy should not be assigned to the other series. Because the three of them have indeed created a kind of celluloid electronic mythology for a powerful, war-like world of the twentieth century. They are alone in the minds of many people as THE example of what a cliff hanger was. <br /> <br /> We can remember seeing Buster Crabbhe as guest on the nightly NBC talk show TOMORROW hosted by Tom Snyder. That was about 1979-80. During the interview, Mr. Crabbe was asked about his personal fitness habits. He reckoned with strength training and swimming, coupled with healthy eating habits - including vitamin and protein supplementation. (And if you believe it, he smoked several cigarettes!) When asked about his career, Mr. Snyder naturally asked the subject of his portrayal (and strong identification with) the character of Flash. Buster said he had read and enjoyed the feature in his original medium, a comic strip owned by Hearst's King Features Syndicate. He said that he had thought that it would not work as soon as it was transferred to the screen! Luckily he was wrong. <br /> <br /> The first series was a very good adaptation of the original continuity of the Sunday Color Comics. The world is nearing its end due to the imminent collision with Planet Mongo. It is the task of the independent worker Zarkov to shoot at the wild planet to change his course. He asks Flash and Miss Dale Arden, new paratroopers who landed on the plane from Zarkov. The series is thrilled and creates the feeling that always other dangers lurk just outside the film frame. The costumes and d√©cor are varied, from Romanesque to oriental to Art Deco. It is easy to assume that this is due to the modesty of Universal, but this was once again thanks to the creator, the cartoonist Alex Raymond (the old stripes, as they are reprinted in many collections). The rockets were previously used in JUST IMAGINE! (Fox 1930), a sci-fi musical comedy. The other scientific laboratory equipment was provided by the Universal Props Department. They were the top Hollywood company that operates horror and sci-fi. The cast is represented by Jean Rogers (Dale Arden) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura) fighting for a bad girl in a good girl for Flash. Charles Middleton portrays Emperor Ming in a kind of overly melodramatic villain but lets it work. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) is weakened by the madness he suffered during newspaper appearances. (By the way, do you ever wonder how Zar-Kov has a brogue?) Richard Alexander makes a fine, powerfully built Prince Barin who is always helpful and so noble. <br /> <br /> Comic actor Jack "Tiny" Lipson is the surprise cast, who stole scene after scene like an ugly guy, Henry VIII became like a criminal, King Vultan, the ruler of the Hawkmen. Among the others, Jim Pierce is most notable as Prince Thun of the Lion Men. Pierce had portrayed Tarzan in a movie like Crabbe - later he married Tarzan Creator, daughter of Edgar Rice Bourroughs, Joan. FLASH GORDON and the two sequels, FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS (1938) and FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE (1940) have been a staple food for young people for generations, first in movie houses, then in television. Like good wine, they have improved with age. <br /> <br /> We are all so happy that Mr. Crabbe was wrong.
