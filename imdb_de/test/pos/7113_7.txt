This is a pretty entertaining B-strip in the Universal Horror series featuring Dracula, the Wolfman and Frankenstein's monster. The plot revolves around Dracula (John Carradine) and Larry Talbot, the Wolfman (Lon Chaney Jr.), who visits a revolutionary doctor separately. They both ask him if they can be cured, and the doctor tries to find a way for everyone. Under the doctor's castle, they find Frankenstein's monsters buried in the mud (apparently a reference to the previous Frankenstein series movie). <br /> <br /> If things went as planned, the movie would have been incredibly boring. Instead, Dracula can not suppress his appetite, and the doctor eventually becomes infected with vampirism through a blood transfusion. As a half-vampire, the doctor goes insane and awakens Frankenstein's monster. As with all Universal horror series, the end is completely unsatisfactory. A beautiful woman with a hunchback, one of the assistant's assistants, has a particularly cruel end. Besides, you just have to regret Frankenstein's monster in this movie - he's awake for about two minutes, killing a cop and then another building (what's that, the fifth now?) Collapses over him and is consumed by him Flames It's too Regrettable that the great character created in The Wolf Man (1941), Larry Talbot, is really reduced here. People underestimate this movie and Chaney's performance in it. Here he would be rightly criticized as wooden. All in all, it's a pretty funny movie with 68 minutes. A nice waste of time. 10.7.
