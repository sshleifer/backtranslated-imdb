First, there is a crime story: "légitime défense" by the Belgian Stanislas André Steeman, whose "lassassin habite au 21" Clouzot had gone on the screen in 1942, with Pierre Fresnay and the same actress Suzy Delair Clouzots adaptation for both films. The 1942 film was excellent, but the detective story page was retained, so why complain? As for "Quai des orfèvres", Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career. After leading "le corbeau" and being blacklisted, he had much more to say than a simple whodunit. Stememan was essentially complaining about the poor detective's demise, which of course I'm not going to betray psychology, and he did not care about the puzzle à la Agatha Christie. Thus, he becomes the real predecessor of CLaude Chabrol, who was always closer to him than Alfred Hitchcock, whom he greatly admires. Suzy Delair has a great screen presence, and you'll love the song that she really sings (she was also a singer) "avec son tralala". Bernard Blier always saves gestures and words and he really manages. Two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing: the first, Dora, the photographer: she photographs female models, and Clouzot reveals to us through subtle touch that she is a lesbian. Of course, the word is never pronounced (how could it be?) In 1947?) The police chief (fabled Louis Jouvet) says to her: "You and I, we have no luck with women." The portrait of this policeman is very detailed: we learn a lot about him, not necessarily linked to the Delair / Blier plot: he is a widower, with a son he loves, and who runs into trouble with the school, especially in geometry , This is how we get to know all the characters in detail. One of the most important manifestations of French post-war cinema.
