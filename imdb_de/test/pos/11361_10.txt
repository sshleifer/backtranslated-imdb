I've been trying to track The Age of Kings for many, many years. My theater life was filled with the actors of this series. At that time in 1960, I could not understand everything because I worked in the theater myself and did a lot of night work. Now retired, I'm LONG to have this and keep it to myself. Please, please, it can not be released on DVD, I would not mind what it costs. I see that there are others who feel the same. What can we do to achieve this? Something as big as this should not be forgotten. I have to write two more lines. OK, I can do that by saying that I want this series more than anything else in the world. Just to be able to see some of the best actors of our time playing the beautiful words of our wonderful Shakespeare. Is not this enough? An uzmen
