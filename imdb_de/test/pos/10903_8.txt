IN & OUT is a very funny movie in my opinion. I thought Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong to say that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. The part that I liked the most was Howard's bachelor party. That was because they joked about many things, including Barbra Streisand's films. I also thought that Emily (Joan Cusack) looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that Howard looked good in his tuxedo. My favorite quote from IN & OUT is: "Are all gay? Is this the" THE TWILIGHT ZONE "?" That was really funny! The only character I could not stand was Sonya (Shalom Harlow). This was because she was very conceited and snobby. Finally, I recommend this movie to all Kevin Kline fans who have not seen him yet. Be ready to laugh hard and have a good time when you see it.
