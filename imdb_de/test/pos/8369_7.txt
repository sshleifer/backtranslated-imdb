This is not the best movie you have ever seen, but it is still very refreshing. Of course it has shortcomings, it has modest moments and at the same time it differs from all the things you are used to and is funny, in a way that only the French can give you. You may recognize Amelie a little when you see the opening. I give him 7 out of 10 points, but I still recommend it if you have the usual boredom that you can borrow in the video library.
