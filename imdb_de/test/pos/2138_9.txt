When it opened, "Heaven's Gate" was more of a cultural phenomenon than a movie to its detriment. At a time when concerns about excessive budgets and the arrogance of directors were growing, this was a comfortable target as the youngest "Auteur" was way above budget to beat Hollywood, who had not yet found the right path the doubts of critics and industry alike. At the time, someone had pointed out that nobody would jump on Warren Beatty's even more expensive and dark "Reds" because Beatty was "one of us", while Michael Cimino had not reached that status. But "Heaven's Gate" was also affected by the cultural change that was taking place at that time, the political movement to the right and towards undoubted patriotism and the anchoring of the myth of the West (and the West) , A few years ago, Cimino's demythologization of the border seemed timely, fresh, and a necessary corrective. But in 1980, following the Reagan revolution, it was considered almost un-American. <br /> <br /> What a pity, because the film, seen over several decades, is considered a fascinating and thought-provoking look at that particular time and place as a world where life, according to Hobbes, is "evil, brutal and short "was. Kristofferson plays James Averill, a high-level senior, who is looking for adventures sheriff in Wyoming, where he must lead a resistance of the settlers and squatters against an attack by a mercenary death squad of wealthy landowners, including Averill's lifelong best friend. In an innocent time, Averill and his "army" of poor peasants would triumph. This, however, is anything but a traditional Western, and when the US cavalry enters the fight here, it is not on the side of the "good guys." <br /> <br /> Like "The Deer Hunter" or Cimino The previous movie "Heaven's Gate" spends a lot of time building up the details of the lives of its leaders and giving the film a temporary tempo, yet it's an enthralling one Conclusion leads. With excellent acting, a fine score, and the visual texture that makes you believe you see the "Old West" with new eyes, "Heaven's Gate" is a film that rewards repeated reflections. I only wish that MGM would release a new DVD with improved transmission and a commentary from Cimino. However, the current version is satisfactory enough to show audiences what critics may have blinded in 1980 to the film's cultural subtexts that "Heaven's Gate" is a great movie.
