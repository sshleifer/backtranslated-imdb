then you will be a big fan of this movie. It's almost the same basic concept, a nice mix of music, soul and drama. I admit, I was a bit worried when I saw this movie, I just saw previews of a white trash girl chained to a cooler, but I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I have Hustle & Flow I thought I would give him a chance. <br /> <br /> I am very glad that I did it. It turned out that it was not just the superficial story of a southern nymphomaniac imprisoned by a 60-year-old black man. The story had a heart and was very influential. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer blended his style of Hustle & Flow into this film, but took a new spin and used the blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as the performance scenes are concerned. He also has very interesting flashback scenes and gives you a crazy feeling in some of the more controversial scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like Hustle & Flow, you will love this movie, and if you like it. If you are a blues fan you should definitely see this. I give him 9 out of 10, very interesting movie, and he is extremely undervalued. what a shame. <br /> <br /> Get out and borrow this movie.
