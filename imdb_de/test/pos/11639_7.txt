MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE may not be the most laughing movie, but it's one of Charley Chase's most satisfying comedies, twenty minutes of clever gaze, beautifully choreographed body comedy, and amusing joker (of course, rendered over the title card) all based on one crazy and incredibly implausible premise. As we said above, this is "a story of homely people - a woman with a face that would stop a clock - and her husband with a face she would start again". Soon we meet Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who has a huge nose. However, there is no sense in discussing plausibility if our plot depends on such a seemingly unbelievable series of inter-related coincidences: first, that Charley would correct his overbite on the day his wife pinned his nose; second, that each spouse would stick to their own cosmetic surgery is an insider's tip over the other, and thirdly, that Charley and Vivien would not recognize each other when they joined each other in public. Sounds like some stretch, right? Multiple routes are more like that. Of course we are here in the world of farce and just have to roll with the stupid plot turns as long as you can relax and forget the plausibility, you'll probably enjoy these shorts. <br /> <br /> MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE begins with a leisurely start as the various complications of the story are noted. As soon as Charley and Vivien have "met" and made an appointment, they arrange to have a party at the home of Charley's dentist. They hurry home excitedly, enter separately and are initially unaware of the other's presence. (Mr. & Mrs. Moose, by the way, seem to be quite wealthy as they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel.) It follows a beautifully timed sequence reminiscent of Buster Keaton's THE NAVIGATOR, in which husband and wife move about the hotel house without ever meeting in person. And once they arrive at the party, the comedy starts right when Charley is forced to dance with Gawky Wallflower Gale Henry. Henry, a self-confident player who has starred in many short comedies from 1914, is funny as a dance partner who gives her dance great strength but little grace. There is also an elegant cinematic touch throughout this sequence when the camera points down to show only the shoes of Charley, Gale, Vivien and Vivien's dance partners. Still, we can watch closely what happens between the principles by watching their feet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Charley and Vivien are plundering the party they're attending, and from there, the complications accumulate when they manage to escape the police and return home. When Charley realizes that his newlywed wife was trying to connect with another man, he ends everyone's lesson. , , Of course, he forgot that he was trying the same. The last few minutes of this film feature some of Chase's funniest body comedies, which are provided with a good gag for the punchline. MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm glow and is one of the most amusing comedies produced by Charly Chase.
