Of all the parodies of Star Wars I've seen, this is probably the funniest. Not because of the premise, Star Wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships, but because of its bad behavior. This is intentionally exaggerated and makes it funny, and since everyone knows that it is intentionally exaggerated, nobody complains. The special effects were deliberately as terrible as possible. They include a toaster on a visible string that shoots toast and a whisk on a string. This short is fun for any fan of Star Wars (which I'm not) or for anyone who has 15 minutes to kill. Great short !! <br /> <br /> My rating: *** from ****. 13 min. Not rated.
