Non-political musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) have been married for seven years and live on a small farm on a remote island to escape a civil war on the continent. They provide Lingenberry for a few customers to raise some money and buy supplies. They love each other and Eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby, but the reluctant Jan, who is a weak and sensitive man, does not want to have children. When the rebels arrive on the island, their peaceful and peaceful lives become hell and they get into the midst of the accusations from both sides. When Colonel Jacobi (Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand) stalks Eva, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and the love and affection they feel for each other changes into hate and indifference. <br /> <br /> "Shame" is an anti-war A film by master Ingmar Bergman focuses on the eyes of some artists who are apolitical and do not hear news, but when the war arrives in their country, their love, friendship becomes and destroys affection from the useless soldiers. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow have as always first-class performances and I can not remember seeing the breast of Liv Ullmann in another movie. The process of brutalization of the Pacific and sensitive Jan Rosenberg by the war is impressive and the grim, open conclusion pessimistic and appropriate to the dramatic story. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vergonha" ("shame")
