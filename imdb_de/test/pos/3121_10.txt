This little John Ford Western without "stars," but a bunch of character actors, is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like atmosphere as it goes west of a Mormon party. It could be the most authentic of all Ford films (it's comparable to "The Sun Shines Bright," with which he made a few years later). <br /> <br /> There is some kind of conspiracy (a group of bank robbers will eventually join the train), but the dramatic climax of the film is almost coincidental. Ford Corporation's great performances (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr., Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.) make a major contribution to the authenticity of the film, while the next film, which comes close to a full-bodied star performance, is Joanne Dru's Denver , Dru was a much finer actress than she ever received the honor of, as were Bond and Johnson, who were eventually awarded the Oscar for his work on The Last Picture Show. As he himself said: "There could not have been a better guy". Add Bert Glennon's great location photography and you have a real piece of Americana that could have anything from anyone but Ford. This is a movie that really honors America's pioneers and is full of feelings and feelings.
