In talk shows, Larry King Live is not bad, and as he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show that needs to be turned on from time to time, but not compulsorily. If Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president, or other significant guests sit opposite him, it's not so bad. At other times, he often hosts guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal, which provides absolutely no intelligent information for the country and feeds a largely uneducated audience that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars. During the OJ Simpson process, every other guest on the show seemed to be connected to the case. But is that really journalism? Or the National Enquirer in the subway? Sometimes it's a bit like trash television - Jerry Springer in an interview with calls instead of a live audience. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Kings Show is definitely much better than Bill O'Reilly, whose show is nothing more than a Rush Limbaugh legal platform. That said, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but unfortunately he's not a great interviewer. King is not always as if he fully understands when intellectual material is presented, especially when it is made by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. It always seems as though the minute when King can not fully deal with the upcoming problem is the case. Then he turns to the phone calls and hopes someone in the country has a better question than he. He may interview someone like David Gergen but may not have read any of his books. Similar to the movie producer, who never disturbs the script. <br /> <br /> If it's a celebrity of entertainment, no problem. He can come as if he were thoroughly knowledgeable, since the material is not that substantial anyway. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly a science of rocketry. And I notice that he usually saw the star's latest movie. Watching a movie takes much less time and thought than reading a book. But when it comes to John Dean or Bob Woodward, King comes over a bit like he did not quite finish his homework. So on the phones. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for really in-depth interviews, NPR's Terry Gross is probably the best interviewer in the United States. She reads and / or researches in advance all that has been written by or about her guests and has knowledge of these areas. I do not see that King does it all. Granted, he probably has a 1000 times larger audience than Terry Gross, which may say more about the American audience than King. In short, Larry is better than Bill, but not as good as Terry.
