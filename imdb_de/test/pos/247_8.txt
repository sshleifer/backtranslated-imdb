This is a very comfortable, fluffy, glamorous 40s musical. "Cover Girl" made Rita Hayworth (formerly the dark-haired Latin-Senorita Margarita Cansino) a real American star. It confirmed Gene Kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It embodies the lushness and color of the musical genre. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth is great as a Rusty Parker - it's her image, and her presence is always in the foreground. Her vocals are synchronized, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she connects very well with Kelly. I think Rita was underestimated as an actress - she plays every scene superbly here. Gene has choreographed the dance sequences (he basically had almost creative freedom here), and his dance number "alter ego" is amazing. Such artistry. The outstanding tunes are "Make Way For Tomorrow", "Put me to the test" and of course "Long Ago and Far Away". The plot is pretty thin, but she has a moral. It's about the dangers of fast fame and fast money, and how any luck with these factors will ultimately be doomed to failure. This will cheer you up, get you on your feet and make you laugh. <br /> <br /> That is, 'Cover Girl' is not the best musical ever produced - it has a number of mistakes to make. You can say that Phil Silvers goes a bit far. His character gets boring pretty fast. However, I was impressed with his dancing skills and how he could keep up with Gene and Rita. Another big problem is that too many songs just are not that great. The 'Cover Girl' number looks fantastic, but I'm not a fan of the lyrics or the vocals. "Poor Tom" is a big downside. I think it's one of the worst numbers I've ever heard in a 40s-50s musical. It stinks. The grandmother's negotiation is ridiculous. But that's just my opinion. Others may like these elements. <br /> <br /> But apart from the mistakes, it is a very, very good movie, much better than most of the products that are produced today. The dancing and singing is great, the production values ​​are excellent and the mood is contagious. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
