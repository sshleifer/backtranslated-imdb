This movie is about a lot of outsiders assigned to a task that is expected to miserably fail. The outsiders gather to complete their mission successfully. <br /> <br /> Hilarity is born. <br /> <br /> As with the "Police Academy" films, the humor comes from the crazy characters on the boat. I thought it would be a captivating movie, and I'll stop watching him whenever he's on TV. No, it will not make you think about your relative role in the cosmos, or inspire you to do great things for the service of humanity, but it's fun enough for 90 minutes to talk. Besides, Lauren Holly looks hot in a navy uniform.
