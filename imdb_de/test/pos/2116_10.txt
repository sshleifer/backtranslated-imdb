Anyone interested in Texas must have this DVD. It's just a good movie about real Texas with great scenes. It took a few Texans to get it right. Hollywood would never have got it. There are so many subtle things that Tubb put into the movie and maybe did not even think about it, but that's what the show does. <br /> <br /> Guest cameos are not seen as cameos at all. Each star fits perfectly and does not detract from the movie. Many of the guest spots merge so perfectly that when the credits roll, you return through the movie to find the character. Strait's role is dead, it could not have been better in real life. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film is fundamentally different from the first one, it gets a bit "hokey", but that's fine. Somehow the action works. The "hokey" stuff is like a special after school, but it looks believable and natural. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of anyone using the Sonny Pruitt line except locals I grew up with. That was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Definitely a collector's item, topping Pure Country, Sugarland Express, Jr. Bonner, Texasville, The Last Picture Show, Giant and of course Hud. <br /> <br /> Gig'em Aggies '86
