Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie. I liked it even better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt. All the key players in the series were present: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius, and half a dozen more (though most of them in the cameo). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main actors (and Jesse of Talamasca). Despite other reviews, I think that this movie and the music were faithful to Anne Rice's portrayal and ethos, at least the way I perceive it. Aailiyah was quite good as Akasha, in some places convincing (her first appearance and mini-dance scene). The movie did not cover the breadth of the book series, but I thought it would be a nice addition. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of this series, mainly because of the style, sensitivities and treatments of Anne Rice. And I found this film a faithful and often outstanding depiction of the author's vision.
