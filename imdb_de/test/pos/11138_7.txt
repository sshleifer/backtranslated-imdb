I was surprised to see this on TV on Friday, and I enjoyed it. Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and the numerous references to everything that can be called "cyberpunk", this was a funny movie. I enjoyed the story that reminded me of a book I read ("Earth", David Brin) and was fun on TV. Bobbie looks great, but I also enjoyed her performance as Kam because she was different from everyone else. But the best part about this movie was the atmosphere that Gibson, Sterling and others have described in books. It was just fun watching it on TV.
