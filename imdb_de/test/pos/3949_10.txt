Scarlet Mantle like most of the Revolution Flicks was not well received, but is almost perfect in the art of filmmaking. a magnificent character study of john andre, the heroic redcoat, feared by both friend and foe for courage, scarlettcoats examines the duality of the covert agent as a fake traitor with others and undertakes a high penetration of british intelligence but defends others in others courtmartial ... the film shows the spy's moral ambiguity <br /> <br /> how much of the spy's world really is, what reality he belongs to the reality of being misunderstanding or the reality that the cover story creates. Andres captive and trial is a success for bolton in his mission beyond what Wahington would have ever requested, the mission was only to identify the traitor Bolton has also defeated enemy intelligence, but Bolton mourns the death of the man he sent has to destroy. Ann Francis plays an American character who agrees with the United States British, but ready to engage her in a joke war. <br /> <br /> a movie that is worth a visit again
