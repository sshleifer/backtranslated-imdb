It started weird, the middle was weird and the end was weird, but I really liked it. A modern version of Homer's Odyessy, but that's really irrelevant. Interesting story and casting. Clooney was great and I welcome him for taking on such an advertising role. Many surprise stars - why is not Holly Hunter present? Do something different tonight and watch this totally different and unexpected movie.
