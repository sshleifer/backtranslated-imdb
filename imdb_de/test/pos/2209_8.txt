At first I did not think Lauren Ambrose's performance was anything but flaky, but as her character evolved, it became more meaningful. Amy Madigan seemed to be short on her role and did not really tie her daughter's pieces together, though it was obvious her character had nothing to do with the character played by Lauren Ambrose. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd is a hit as usual and took his role away to promote the storyline. His character development made the audience wonder why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been reached with <br /> <br /> more direct. <br/> <br /> The overwhelming glue of this somewhat vague story was played by Taylor Roberts. Her comprehensive account of a simple character held the film together. In this pivotal role, Taylor was able to foster a realistic family relationship between characters while acting as an antagonist to all other relationships in the film.
