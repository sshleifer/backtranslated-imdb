Serial killer Carl Stargher kidnapped and murdered young women by drowning them in a water-filled cell. He is arrested by the FBI, but is in a coma awaiting his youngest kidnapping victim in a cell filled with water over time. Look at the above premise and you will see that there is a very good thing there, seen a lot before you look at it. The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he changes an old, old chestnut plot into something completely different than you expect. When I mention that the plot is a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter Stargher's mind, he completes another movie. This would not be enough to make THE CELL another thriller class director Tarsem Singh created a visually striking surreal thriller. Paul Laufer's cinematography, in which basic opaque colors are in the foreground, is breathtaking, but Singh does not stop it. Things like the costume design, where Stargher roams in opulent costumes in his idiosyncratic universe, has a visual impact that makes this much more a barrel of the mill thriller <br /> <br /> which keeps THE CELL from becoming a classic movie However, it is becoming more and more aware that the entire film is about the visuals and not about a natural narrative. We see a third sign, an FBI man enters Stargher's domain, but this seems to be more of an invented act just to introduce the audience to more breathtaking but very disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that this is a rather disturbing thriller with an atmosphere that is very depressing and that prevents the film from being pleasant then involved. A scene in which an FBI agent tells a case in which a pedophile defeats a rap to later dispose of the victim's heart will fill your heart with so much despair that you could reach for the shutdown button. You'll probably have to watch a tremendous number of thrillers until you see another as confusing as this one
