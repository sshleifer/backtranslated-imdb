This film, directed by George Fitzmaurice, who has made so many great films, is in line with his excellent standard. It's crisp, witty, with some wonderful lines and has the inimitable Ronald Colman in the romantic lead role. Colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy English colleague. He is financially irresponsible (for example, £ 15 of his last £ 20 in the world for a cute little terrier he calls George) but open, wildly generous, despicable for lucre, politely disrespectful and hopelessly sentimental. He is so exciting that all women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star of the music halls, and therefore in 1930 a resident of the peninsula, she played with her typical slim, narrow-eyed silky of youthful Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a great user of close-ups, and the men of the day had their faces half hidden anyway with those awful, clinging hats, so we do not get as much insight into the faces of the two heroines as we would like. The director seems to be more interested in the charming Colman anyway. The romantic female lead is the young and fresh looking Loretta Young, who had not yet become the Proto-Julie Andrews, as we generally know her, but was still a blushing girl, radiating all the sweetness of a rose garden and cheerful and heartfelt laughed all the time. It is obvious that a figure with her great humor was needed for the snob-busting anarchism of Colman's refreshing aristocratic figure. The plot hardly plays a role, as so often in these light and amusing films. It's simply fun.
