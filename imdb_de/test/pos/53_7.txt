This movie was very good, not great, but very good. It is based on a one-man game by Ruben Santiago Hudson. Yes, he played the most roles. On the paper it looks like a stuntcasting. Yeah, let's summarize all the blacks in Hollywood and put it in a movie. Halle Berry even produced it. The only name I did not see was Oprahs, thank God, because he probably ended up like a Hallmark movie. Instead, this movie was not a sentimental mess. It was moving, but not wrong. The characters came and went with the exception of her husband Pauline and the writer in question. The film revolved around the universe of Nanny, Mrs. Bill Crosby, and how she raised the writer and took in people. Well, when New Yorkers got completely out of hand, he said she had ill and old people taken in, and then we see her go to a psychiatric ward to pick up a man. I think it looks like the sister has a Medicare scam. Get jobs and take the Medicare / Caid checks. But no, she explains Lou Gosset, she only wants $ 25 a week and did not want the money in advance. I think this part was put into the movie only for New Yorkers who are disturbed for us, so we know that it does not cheat the poor people. (G) It was written by a New Yorker, so he knows the deal (g) .. She looks almost like an angel and through the eyes of a little boy I see why. She is married to a new man, 17 years younger and concentrating on her. Terrence Howard was born to play these types of parts. He was good, but I would like to see him playing something different. Markerson, who plays nanny, is also very good. But for some reason, the person standing out to me was a minor role played by Jeffery Wright. Where is this man Oscar? He's already won an Emmy and a Tony. He was in Shaft and stole the movie. I did not even know who he was in this movie. He is a chameleon, never the same. I have never seen him This was a 5 minute roll and he made me laugh and cry at the same time. I rewound the scene a few times ... once, because I did not know who he was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I saw her in roles of mostly lousy stuff. But she is so good here. I actually know people who behave exactly like them. So it was very real to me that Macy Gray, who had one of the bigger parts, was also very good. I was very happy that they did not kill Nanny. I thought she was a moron at the beginning of the movie. BUT she could go home and start her old routine of caring for people. There are women like these in most of our lives. People we know or even lived with. I thank God for them, I do not know how they do it all the time. I have a friend who lost two children and went through a lot. But when I selfishly regret myself, I call her and she always puts me in a good mood. This movie is a tribute to all these people. I just wish they would tell us what happened to some characters like the one armed man, Pauline's friend, played by one of my favorite actors in HBO's The Wire, Omar, Rosie PÃ©rez's character and Richard, the Lesbian and Delroy Lindos Armmann, he was fascinating in another small role.
