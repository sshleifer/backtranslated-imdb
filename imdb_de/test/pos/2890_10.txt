Rush in Rio is just an amazing DVD. This concert is one of the highlights of Rush's history and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever before. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to actually be in this concert, and not only that. I was in the front row and grabbed the gate that separated the audience from the stage !! It's the first and only time I have seen a rush concert live and it was a dream for me. I can not describe words to accurately describe this experience, but I can tell you that this is one of the highlights of my life. But the sound you hear is real, just as he was in concert. It is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time I see it, I experience that beautiful moment again. Many artists record live shows and then make many optimizations, so the end product is far from what the actual concert really was. Surely you can get a very refined and polished sound this way, but you do not get the real thing. This is not the case with Rush in Rio, that's the real deal !! I admit that I like these fantastic-sounding concert DVDs, I love music and the sound is a very important aspect, but it's refreshing to hear such an honest concert. You hear Rush the way you listen to a live performance, no tricks, no changes. This is a real live concert DVD. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Rush in Rio, the setlist is fantastic and the performances of Geddy, Alex and Neil are amazing. Not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love Rush and sing along to every song, even YYZ, which is an instrumental !! I actually see singing twice; In Tom Sawyer I sing "always hopeful and yet dissatisfied" and in Earthshine I sing "just thinking". It's only a few seconds, but I just could not believe my eyes when I saw myself in a hurry DVD !! Brilliant!! I hope you enjoy this great concert of the biggest band in the world.
