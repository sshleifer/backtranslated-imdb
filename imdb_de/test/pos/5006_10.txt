I am appalled and appalled that the network canceled the talk show with Spike Feresten. What's wrong with the Fox Television Network ?, cancel talk show with Spike Feresten and replace it with Wanda Sikes? For those in the network with a short attention span, Wanda At Large was canceled because the public was tired of their evil insults that would scare the audience. it is evil and repulsive. <br /> <br /> Apparently the Fox Television Network has rewarded Wanda Sikes for making her own important appearance before President Barak Obama. There is no doubt that Wanda's recent mood in front of the United States President is not funny, and the audience's laughter was only to patronize and delight Barak Obama. <br /> <br /> Talk show with Spike Feresten has a real sense of humor and has never intentionally or recklessly insulted a guest or artist. Spike's well-rounded personality was always cheerful, fun for life and for himself. And his filmed pieces during the first two seasons with AFTRA actress Mary Mae Atwill, as the Mae West of the 21st century was absolutely hysterical with Spike Feresten's sketch: Spouse and last season's James Kyson Lee episode, in which Spike talks to Erica over the internet on the show. <br /> <br /> Despite the budget constraints of the Complex Field Panel network and the second-season WGA strikes, Spike Feresten did not abandon his sense of humor or integrity. Talk show with Spike Feresten always had up-and-coming talents, and his Comedy for Stoners parodies of Nanny 911 and Idiot Paparazzi were considered innovative and had an outstanding production value. <br /> <br /> On a professional level, Spike Feresten was the best executive producer, and set producer, Brett Webster, and his fabulous production teams were one of the best production teams I've worked on in my AFTRA career. It would be really great stupid and sad to cancel talk show with Spike Feresten. Unfortunately, the success of Comedy Central or another network could be considered. From a financial point of view, this would be a valuable loss of revenue for FOX Television Saturday Fox Fox audience, supporters of the Talk Show with Spike Feresten, including all cast and crew. We ask the network to maintain the Talk Show with Spike Feresten franchise and give the crew the second chance to become a successful Fox show.
