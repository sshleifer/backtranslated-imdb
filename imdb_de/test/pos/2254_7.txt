The film "Everything is Illuminated" was written by the first author and director Liev Schreiber, who adapted Jonathan Safran FÃ¶rer's first novel. The book was ambitious and spacious, its magical-realistic elements and its vivid use of language seemingly impossible to portray on screen. The film tries less wise. The end result is not as wild as the novel, but it is still a successful film about a foreign Eastern European road trip or, as one of the characters suggests, "a very rigid search". <br /> <br This character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian who loves American pop culture but does not understand the English language. His grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a tour company that serves American Jews, persuades him to serve as a translator for Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan examines his family history and deliberately tries to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. During the search, more than one family secret is revealed. <br /> <br /> The film Jonathan (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a semi-kleptomaniac spinner who steals his grandmother's prosthesis to complement her collection of "Family Things". Wood's quiet, wide-open, honest way works very well in this role. Hutz makes an impressive debut as the laid-back, laid-back Alex. His malapropisms are hilarious, but he can also reduce the growing self-confidence of the figure. The dog Mikki is very funny as the crazy Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. and one of the few movie dogs I've ever seen that is not exactly cute and precocious. <br /> <br /> "Everything Is Lit Up" After all, the Holocaust is on a human level, calling us to remember it not as a general event, but as a million specific little tragedies. It is reminiscent of a European film and reflects the effects of past events on young people like Jonathan and Alex. "Everything is Illuminated" is a great work for a newcomer with its original perspective, strong performances and some striking visuals, and hopefully Schreiber will continue to make films.
