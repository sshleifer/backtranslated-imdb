Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a small story that speaks of respect for the sea, respect for young and old people and respect for cultural differences. It's a new story about a little goldfish who wants to be a girl instead of retelling Disney's little mermaid. Miyazaki has animated by hand a quirky, magical movie for young and old. The film begins with a slow-wave blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish and countless fancy goldfish with childlike faces. No narration is needed, the movement of the creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi explain the beginning. Ponyo was released in Japan last summer and won the award of the Japanese Academy of Best Animated Film and Best Score (Jezebel.com). The imaginative little goldfish Brunhild leaves his sea on a jellyfish. When she has reached the surface, she is trapped in a fishing net with other fish, garbage and mud. She is driven into a glass rolled ashore where five-year-old Sosuke (voice of Frankie Jonas) picks it up. He cuts his hand as he opens the glass to free the little goldfish. Brunhild tastes his blood, which heals Sosukes cut and sets his transformation into a human being and at the same time brings the nature out of balance. Sosuke puts the little goldfish in a green bucket and calls it Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), which means soft and jelly-like. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Fey), lets him take Ponyo to school, which is right next to the nursing home where she works. Lisa's crazy drive along the scenic winding road, past a dry dock, through the bustling fishing village and a tree-lined street to the nursing home, is representative of Miyazaki's wonderful procession and perfectly illustrates her parents' hectic morning. Miyazaki has created another strong, independent, female character in Lisa. She made her a loving, sensible, modern mother for Sosuke and Ponyo. Lisa's phone conversation with the man who is not coming home, Kiochi (Matt Damon), because the ship he has to perform as a captain again is a typical reaction of the wife. Later that evening, Sosuke intervenes with a signal lamp to talk to his father as the ship drives past the cliff where her house stands. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochi's apology, jumps up and signals "bug-off, bug-off, bug-off," it's a funny scene. As Sosuke takes the signal lamp and says to his father: "Good luck, love you", Lisa hugs him and tells him that he has a good heart. This is a very moving scene. <br /> <br /> My personal favorites These are Miyazaki's elderly women wheelchairs in wheelchairs, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their exchange about Sosuke's little goldfish is wonderful, reminiscent of the dispute between the Witch of Waste (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they trudge a long flight of stairs in Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo's enchanting sea godfather Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), who resembles the magician Howl, arrives to take Ponyo home to her home. Fujimoto tries to balance nature with one of his elixirs, but the little magical ponyo escapes another elixir causing a tsunami. This redheaded little girl runs on the backs of giant dolphins to get to Sosuke, reminding the audience of the stubborn, adventurous little mei in My Neighbor Totoro. Ponyo is as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo has done, he calls for Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett), the goddess of the ocean, to help with the situation. This wise, soothing goddess arrives in a blue, flowing robe that never ends. She has a private conversation with Lisa, where she talks about the future of small children. This helps the audience to understand the relationship between Sosuke and Ponyo, who is not the lover but the sibling. The quiet, simple end of life is typical of Miyazaki films, leaving the audience full of hope.
