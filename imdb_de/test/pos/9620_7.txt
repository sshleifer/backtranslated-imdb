Hong Kong-based filmmaker Chang Chang Ho, born in 1972, a martial-arts epic "Five Fingers of Death," is considered by many experts and kung-fu film fanatics to be the martial arts film that started it all. <br /> <br /> Released in 1972, it was the second phase of the three-step process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts films in the West - "Billy Jack" (1971) with its famed Hapkido showdown in the park was released a year earlier and Bruce Lee starred two years later in "Enter the Dragon" (1973), cementing the place of martial arts films in Western cinema. <br /> <br /> But what's all the scramble for "Five" Fingers of Death? "The film, with its horrible syncs, explosive (albeit highly unlikely) action sequences and technical flaws and all, has an action, though a very thin one, Chih-Hao (the late Lo Lieh) is a young and dedicated student of the Chinese gong-fu, who was chosen to represent his school at an upcoming martial arts tournament, and his teacher offers to participate in the "Iron Fist's style of training himself, a style so deadly that he could very easily kill a man with one hit. <br /> <br /> Also, Chih-Hao's arrival at the school is violent Conflict with a competing school, their students, and a trio of murderous heavy hitter from Japan together. Before you know it, Chih-Hao faces a major setback and his ability to join his beloved school in the upcoming tournament represent. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that "Five Fingers of Death" is actually the movie that started it all. Another viewer mentioned that over the next three decades, "Five Fingers of Death" has helped set many standards in martial arts films - in Asian, European and North American martial arts films. These include the dedicated student, the study of patience and perseverance, conflicts between rival schools, the intense ethnic hostility between Chinese and Japanese, and learning a system of struggle for this good old-fashioned theme for action films: Revenge. "Five Fingers of Death" would also have a major impact on the "Kill Bill" films by American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino (Tarantino borrowed this project, among other things, very generous, just so you know). <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, considering that this is a martial arts film from the early 70s, of which Lo Lieh is the best. As an atypical martial arts student, his performance is groundbreaking, though you would not really know it at first glance because this particular character arc has been so often put to death over the years. In his acting he is quite humble, he does everything he can to stand against his enemies and not fight them in anger or bow to their degree of stupidity or arrogance. Even if he suffers his great setback, your heart sinks a bit because it is so brutal, and you wonder if he will recover enough to realize his lifelong ambition. <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers of Death" is a classic in every way. It is by no means perfect and the spectators would be crazy to expect something on the caliber of the "sponsor" of martial arts films. What it offers you is the ultimate example of eastern melee strikes from before the Eastern Cinema played an important role in the West. <br /> <br /> 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS: "Enter the Dragon" Bolo Yeung also appears as a Mongolian street fighter at the beginning of the film.
