The Lone Ranger & Tonto wanted to bring a gang of covert robbers to justice who killed three Indians for a seemingly apparent reason. This is until the Lone Ranger finds out from a conversation with the Indian chief Tomache. Man possessed a medallion. The five medallions Tomache presents as gifts to his friends, which we will later learn when combined, will give the thought leader behind the hooded hunters a ticket to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the two remaining persons in possession of the medallions before the undercover robbers get hold of them? Is there really a lost city of gold somewhere in your home country? <br /> <br /> When I saw this, I always knew what would happen before, and everything seemed to be really familiar to me, until I finally realized that I had just seen this movie when I was a little Child was ... and suddenly the memories flooded back and I remembered that as a kid I had enjoyed a pretty fun time with a number of my friends. As an adult, though, the plot is reasonably predictable, but you know that, even though it's not in the same league as the 1956 movie, and it's still fun to watch. Clayton Moore is perfect as a Lone Ranger and Jay Silverwheels as Tonto steals a lot of the movie as he's probably in more action scenes than the Lone Ranger. There are some very familiar faces, including Douglas Kennedy as Ross Brady, leader of the Hooded Raiders gang, Charles Watts as bigoted sheriff, and Ralph Moody as friendly clerk.
