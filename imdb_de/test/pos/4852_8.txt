This is a movie about a man everyone thinks is Jewish. This is a movie about Lawrence Newman, who lived in Brooklyn in the 1940s at the time of World War II. And only because he looks like one. And he lives in a very anti-Semitic area. Some people start treating him like dirt. They make this judgment of being Jewish, even by Larry's new wife, Gertrude Hart. That makes her life unbearable. Neal Slavin's Focus (2001) is a pretty good look at anti-Semitism. This is a problem that will not disappear. The film is based on Athur Miller's novel I, I admit, I did not read the movie is really good, so I'm sure the book would be good too. The actors do a good job. William H.Macy is always good, and his work as Larry Newman is brilliant. Laura Dern is Gert Hart and she is great. Meat loaf is almost scary like the neighbor who wants to keep the Jews out by any means necessary. David Paymer's character as a Jewish shopkeeper Mr. Finkelstein is the most likeable in the movie. Paymer is the perfect choice for the role. One of the greatest scenes is over when Mr. Winkelstein and Newman fight baseball bats against these Nazi people. Evil. The Christian and the Jew.
