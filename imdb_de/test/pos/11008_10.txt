Yes!!!! Fassbinder and Ballhaus are at the top of their game in 1973! It's about the same topic, but in my opinion it's a much better movie than THE MATRIX (1999), at least it was 200 times cheaper! Very nice camera work by Michael Ballhaus and the wonderful "Albatross" by Fleetwood Mac at the end. Fassbinder creates a very atmospheric sound for the entire film. It's a shame that this movie was never released on DVD. Well, after 37 years, they finally came to the conclusion that this TV movie is not only one of the best Fassbinder films (though there are many best Fassbinder films), it's an excellent example of a science-fiction movie , made without much money. Buy it!! Take a look at it !!
