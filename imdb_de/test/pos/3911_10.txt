I loved this movie !! I was waiting for this movie so I could see it. I saw the opening night and was thrilled. Some people told me that this movie was not good and would stay away, but I loved it. The performers were great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first movie. Everyone makes it difficult for her to be great and she did not even have that much of a role. The set was great, made from all wax and how it was made. The two brothers did a great job and the feeling of death was great. The killers were really scary and I wanted to close my eyes and not look at them. I can not wait for this movie to appear on video so I can see it again and again. If you like Hororr movies and you will not regret it, I loved this movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10 IT ROCKS !!!
