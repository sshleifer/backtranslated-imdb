Little did I know about this movie when I entered the theater to see a show. I learned from the ads that it was a thriller. <br /> <br /> What we have is like "compulsion" meets "Matlock". Two teenagers decide to commit a perfect murder. A victim is chosen at random and executed carefully so that no traces of the actual murderer are found. Then a series of false leads are planted, indicating an innocent bystander. (Innocent of the murder anyway) <br /> <br /> Enter Sondra Bullock as Investigator. (IMDB says she's an FBI, but I do not remember her, I thought she was a regular cop.) She's frustrated with the inconsistency of the killer's profile ("The profile does not fit the profile!") the power and influence of the father of one of the boys. <br /> <br /> She also has her own demons who play a major role in her decision to become a police officer. However, this is the only sign that is really more than one-dimensional. Everyone else is pretty flat. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, there's really no big thrill. It's mostly a cat-and-mouse game like an episode of "Matlock" (which she looks at sometime in the movie). The joke is that two are involved in killing. Who is the true murderer, Justin or Richard? It costs you eight dollars to find out.
