I am surprised that so far the only comment on this TV is mine. Film ... As far as I know, the series itself has a large following, critics and real people alike, they have praised a person. Anyway, let me tell you that if you're a fan of tough police drama like me, you like The Lost Child. Tennison, the heroine of the entire "Prime Suspect" series, is battling with male police forces who, through hard work, stubbornness, and pure political talent, have come to their current, comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy throughout the series. She is basically an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and is certainly not a man-hater. Unfortunately, her relationships are affected by the bad hours her career demands, and she never got married. If she sees herself pregnant because of her recent affair, she faces the decision to become a mother and endangers her entire police mission. Not to mention future advancement or abortion - what she chooses. This abortion is never very important in the ensuing drama - it's done very skilfully in less than a few minutes of screentime, a marvel of scripting and editing efficiency - but it's always a counterpoint to Tennison's desperate efforts to find another. " lost child "- a kidnapping victim - before it's too late. The story takes many twists and turns before the end of the surprise, and you're equally fascinated by the storyline and the characters (though I found the many baddies a bit oversubscribed), the police, and especially Tennison himself, are not always competent and not sympathetic, what numbers in view of the unpleasant work they have to do in the shady underworld in which this series is accustomed. Mirren herself has said that she will not make no more movies in the series, but excellently, since she has always been in the role of Tennison, the series itself is "actor-proof," as well as another addiction to "Dick Wolfs American "Law & Order" - whoever appears in it, anyone could go on forever - what is my passionate hope.
