Gregory Peck and Gig Young fight for the same girl and after Peck Young has sent on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. When he feels guilty, Peck does an almost impossible job of defending a fortress in which they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses soldiers for this mission, whom he considers to be the scum of the earth, and the actors who play these soldiers, such as Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., and Neville Brand, are excellent. The script comes from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren, a specialist in Western, as an author, director and producer. The idea of ​​using these types of men as heroes inspired many films that came out later, including "The Dirty Dozen" from 1967.
