Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite opera aria. You do not have to be an opera lover to watch this movie. (Although, if you hate the opera, you will of course have a bad time with it!) <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that the segments range from brilliant to fair. Most of the excitement seems to be about Godard's contribution. Whether you think he is brilliant or overbearing, his segment will not change your mind. <br /> <br /> others are more like a montage of connected pictures. <br /> <br /> None of the pieces is longer than 10 minutes. If you are not satisfied with the screen, wait for the next segment and think about how much culture you are absorbing. <br /> <br /> Keep your eyes peeled for Buck Henry, Beverly D Angelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Brig. Fonda, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt. (The Buck Henry segment alone is worth the price.) <br /> <br />
