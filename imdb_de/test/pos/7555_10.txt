A wonderful movie about people. I saw Four Friends for the first time when it was originally shown in cinemas, and I've seen it a lot since then. If I do not watch it on TV, I meet with friends and lend it. The people I've seen this movie with always find it very enjoyable. It deals with friends from childhood to adulthood, in the 50s and 60s. It is very funny and touching, it is about first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics - the whole 60s. It can also be pretty dramatic. If you enjoy watching movies about people, this is definitely worth the time.
