I have just seen The Big Trail for the first time at the Vienna Film Museum. I was immediately impressed by the visual quality of the images and the unusual format as well as the richly detailed history. Who has ever seen such a documentary with John Wayne in the West? And there is so much time, you can actually look around the screen, there is so much to see! One is always grateful that the scenes are often static, because every single recording is so well composed and you want to record it. Even the acting is good and fits well. The long running time of the picture is wonderful, you do not want to miss a minute of it!
