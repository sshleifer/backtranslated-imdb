The Hawk and the Snowman is the true story of two wealthy L.A. children who become spies for the Soviet Union. One, played by Penn, is already a drug smuggler up to his eyeballs in trouble. The other, played by Hutton, lands in an aerospace company, where he operates a top-secret cable system. There he learns about the dirty tricks of the CIA on foreigners who do not like America. Do not forget that the film plays in the early 70s, the time of Vietnam and Watergate. Terrified by what he has learned, the Hutton character decides to betray his country and convinces his buddy to join him. None of them is in the mind for long, it does not take long until they are over their heads with no way out. <br /> <br /> This is not a thriller and rather slow. If this is not a problem for you, the rent is well worth it.
