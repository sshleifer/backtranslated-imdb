The best years of our lives are often compared to a wonderful life. They should never be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious commentary on a war that has claimed millions of lives. It's hard to know what value individual life can have. (How many people know that one out of 22 people perished violently in the last century? What statistics do we have to live with?) Our sense of war has also changed in 60 years. We have gradually moved away from the assumption that war is the right one if the enemy is the right one to believe that no war is fully justified, especially those that have been waged lately. I was a lifelong pacifist. I am against every war. Not so long ago I tested this position. It happened when I was in the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship needed a crew 3 or 4 times the size of the community in which I live. It is a powerful experience to move on their decks. She had seen a lot of action. Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist, and it was not bought cheaply. <br /> <br /> I can not see the best years of our lives without thinking of things like the Lexington. <br /> <br /> Each of the three veterans paid their contributions. And they also paid mine. <br /> <br /> None of them came any easier than anyone else. The Navy, the Air Force, and the Army paid in equal proportions, albeit in different ways. Everyone had problems with the war. And everyone had to work terribly hard to overcome these difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian environment than dealing with warfare, because everyone had to do it alone. Everyone could understand and sympathize with the other's problem: in the end, nobody could help. <br /> <br /> The moving part of the movie (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is the following, if one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry commanded Herald to marry the girl. Do not hesitate, do it tomorrow. It's hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he was a football hero and sports star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens. <br /> <br /> The other is when Al Derry instructs to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Improve your relationship with your wife? Standard fair for 30s / 40s films. Derry did not argue about the point: he felt that he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the movie comes out when we consider that the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real feelings of real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings, feelings and honor. I sometimes believe that we believe that these values ​​do not exist. That's probably why people watching this movie have problems. <br /> <br /> Al is not free from advice he does not want to have. Every time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied up in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that can not be judged by the standards of the crew: they must be judged by huge intangible values, and only someone who is tested by the severity of life would understand what these intangible goods are Up to a scene in the end, where all the planes that have fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded, and soon to be recycled: their function, their worth, and their pride as transparent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency he does make him fit in his head for the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> I have given The Best Years of Our Lives 10 and there are only a few films that I feel so about. This is not a movie for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged that we rely on something as private as the life of these wonderful people. We should be careful that we do not abuse this privilege.
