When I went to the cinema, I did not expect much. I did not know anything about this movie, but it was the only movie I could see because I was in a small town back then. So I saw this movie and was fascinated! "La stelle che non c'Ã¨" is a journey through the new industrial China and shows it honestly! You mostly see the ugly areas of China and you see what really happens with this new industrialization. The main characters are sad, but hopefully people. He is the naive Italian who can not believe what he sees. She is a translator from China who misses her son. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny, but poetic every time! A wonderful movie with wonderful actors! So only one star is missing!
