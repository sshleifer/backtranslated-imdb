This is not so much a review of A Tale Of Two Sisters, it is a discussion of some minor action details. I recommend you NOT to read this review if you have not seen the movie as this is absolutely the case, ruining a few surprises for you. <br /> <br /> In a sense, A Tale Of Two Sisters is anything but original, at least purely superficial - some of his iconographies come directly from Ring or Dark Water The plot itself (especially what Brendt sponsors as "Rubber Reality "Section of the narrative") reminiscent of films like Fight Club (main character interacts with someone created in their mind), Mulholland Drive (character creates alternative reality in a psychogenic fugue). and other minor aspects of Lost Highway, Jacob's Ladder and basically any movie under the sun that deals with mental illness, plus Amenabar's movies (The Others, Abre Los Ojos), Memento (especially in terms of the agonizing nature of memory) et al. Fortunately, all these similarities do not negatively affect the emotional impact of the movie, and I personally found A Tale Of Two Sisters to be a highly moving and rewarding experience. Many people have commented on the "confusing" nature of the film narrative, but I personally found the plot pretty self-explanatory, even though it is sometimes not sequentially portrayed. The narrative becomes confusing for some only, as the story in the middle of the last third changes from a purely subjective attitude (ie, Soo-Mi 'distorted perception of reality) to an objective one, with a flashback explaining the origins of Soo at the end Nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. Shifting the emphasis will surprise some people, but structurally, I recalled the already mentioned Mulholland Drive (though we are not dealing with the perception of a character's reality about a dream, but with his own schizophrenic tendencies - whatever) turn me to another Lynch movie (Lost Highway). To be honest, I do not really regard A Tale Of Two Sisters as a horror movie, but rather a tragic story about the collapse of a family and an honest look at a character's mental illness (and I hurry to add those fans.) The Psychoanalytic Cinema will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the cinematography in A Tale Of Two Sisters is unbelievable and visually this is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen on this page of Wong's Kar Wai's 2046. The performances are invariably fantastic, and me expect more of the four main actors to be seen in the future. Not to mention the music, but then East Asian films without a big soundtrack seem to be few. <br /> <br /> It is very likely that some people will appreciate the finer artistic aspects of A Tale Of Two Sisters, simply rejecting it as "another Asian horror movie," dedicated to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytic approach unaware. But then everyone for themselves. If you can ignore some of the platinum aspects of the movie, just take it for what it cares about, d. H. an extremely tragic, heartbreaking story, then I see no reason not to recommend her.
