This was one of my favorites as a kid. My family had the 8-track soundtrack !! It took years (until I was in my 20s) until we recorded a video of the movie (my dad took it from HBO or something). Every summer when we go to the beach (my mother, my brother, my sister and me), we lay on the beach and sang all the songs from this movie !!! I loved it !!!
