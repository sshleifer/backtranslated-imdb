An interesting couple of stories, this little film manages to bring together seemingly different characters and storylines in the context of World War II, and manages to connect them together without losing the audience. I was impressed by the depth shown by the different characters, and also how much I felt that I understood them and their motivations, even though the time spent developing each character was very limited. The outstanding acting skills of the people involved in this picture are easy to recognize. An entertaining, stylized film featuring a series of comic moments and a series of more head shaking events. <br /> <br /> 7/10
