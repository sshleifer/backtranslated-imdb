I saw this movie a few days ago at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas. Punk! Everyone and everything that has to do with the film contributed to the punkness of the film. The music, of course. But the movie itself has captured the entire punk genre. Even a grandmother and a teacher (I) can appreciate artists who can realize their ideas (well, reality, film). This film takes a handful of choppy young filmmakers and clearly and skilfully shows the "why" of their fear that he did not get the go-ahead at the conclusion of the Waldo movie. The (relatively) happy girl gave a good comic relief, a nice relief from the constant (but understandable) rag on the guy who had failed her. But I have to love Stu. And look at the credits - they are the icing!
