Whenever Hayao Miyazaki does the "Tri-Fecta" (writing, directing and animating a movie), he makes a classic for eternity. He did it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo. <br /> <br /> The story is about a fish led by her father, a bitter ex-human wizard, along with her younger sisters on a very tight leash called Fujimoto. The fish escapes from his father and rides a jellyfish ashore, where she is detained in an excavating operation and put in a bottle. This underwater sequence must be one of the most lavishly drawn animation scenes ever undertaken, and is one reason to explore theatrical release. Miyazaki, who is not afraid of a busy scene, has outdone himself. There were literally hundreds of solitary marine creatures of all sizes, all moving at the same time. <br /> <br /> When the fish of the dredging operation escapes while still in the bottle, a five-year-old boy named Sousuke discovers her in the water and can break the bottle, saving her. Since she is the result of her father's magic, she is able to do magic herself - and her father is actively trying to get her back. The boy calls the fish Ponyo. Just when Sousuke learns that Ponyo can talk, her father successfully returns her to captivity. After a war of will with her father, Ponyo can escape again with the ability to transform himself into a human being. She meets Sousuke again in a storm and the story continues in many interesting ways. There is a cuteness factor in this film that surpasses that of Tonari no Totoro and surpasses it. Joe Hisaishi once again provided excellent musical support. <br /> <br /> The story itself, like Miyazaki's films in general, is simple and should appeal to a broad audience. Although I have not seen enough to be sure, the film does not seem to be one that will keep the scholars in long discussions as Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi did. Nevertheless, this is the ultimate feel-good entertainment movie. I rated the movie ten out of ten.
