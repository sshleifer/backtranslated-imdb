HLOTS was an outstanding series, which NYPD Blue will never be. On HLOTS the actions are real, the dialogue is real, the relationships are real. With HLOTS as a film that binds all loose ends together, it was good to have the whole gang back together, even though some who have died appear on the show week after week. Murder, life on the street, network drama in its best !!!! 5 STARS!!!! Thumbs up and so on. Thank you NBC for the finally we did not get it!
