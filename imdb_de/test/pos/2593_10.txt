In one of the many bugs Bunny Daffy Duck cartoons Elmer Fudd goes hunting and Daffy tries to get him to shoot bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has its own agenda. In addition, "Rabbit Seasoning" uses the word order and pronouns in interesting ways (warning: it could only jumble your speech in a funny and regal way). <br /> <br /> I believe that my favorite aspect of this cartoon is probably the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems to have been ventured for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they make it perfect, as always. All in all, this only shows what genius people were behind these cartoons.
