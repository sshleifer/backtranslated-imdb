I finally got my DVD today, watched it, and I'm happy to announce that it's the original version of the movie. As you may have read in previous reviews of "Rich and Famous", that the TV-edited version of the movie somehow came on VHS in the late 90s, WB has now corrected the bug and released it on a DVD completely airplane toilet scene, Matt Lattanzis nude Butt, and the scene in the hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C ** t! It's all there and looks better than ever! A clear digital transfer, widescreen and special features, including the original movie trailer and a 1981 feature called "On Location with Rich and Famous" featuring interviews with cast members and directors. If you love this movie like me, you will not be disappointed with the purchase of this DVD. Nice to finally have this on DVD? The wait is worth it! Thank you, Warner Bros!
