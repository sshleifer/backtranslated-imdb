This is a really cute movie. I had a huge sleepover (girls 10-11) and they absolutely loved this movie. You have looked at it twice! Do not be fooled by the rating. You must be at least 13 years old to rate a movie on IMDb, which will turn off the movie's audience. If you have a girl (or a boy) between 7 and 13, I guarantee that you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> A kind of gender reversal "Notting Hill" in high school. Aaron Carter plays a famous pop star who fails his private lessons. His mother sends him to a "normal" high school with the ultimatum "High School or No Summer Tour". Following the advice of his manager (formerly pop star David Cassidy), he makes friends with the smartest girl in the school (Alana Austin) with the plans to cheat on her. Look for the humorous and revealing Janitor (another former pop star Lief Garrett).
