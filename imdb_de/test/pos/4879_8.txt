For those who have problems with cheeky, crazy or annoying children, this is an essential program. It's just the best behavioral documentation program, not just for tips, but also for the transformations. The very attractive Jo Frost is a super-nanny, with fifteen years of experience in the field of nannies, she now has a program in which she shows a family in which the children behave very, very badly. Frost is the nanny who does not let the children win. In each episode, there are young children who are crazy and very, very naughty. Throwing things, constantly cursing, relatives and parents meet and many other terrible experiences. But every episode at the end of the show turns the kids from parents (with the help of Frost) from little monsters to lovable kids. It's just wonderful when the transformations are successful. Jo Frost is a superb supernanny. It has been nominated for the National Television Award for the Most Popular Factual Program (twice). It was number 15 of the 100 biggest TV treats in 2004. Very good!
