I love this movie. It focuses on both aspects: reality and imagination. Reality, because hey, we all wanted a date from this popular guy Billy. and some of us have not been kissed, right? Be honest! <br /> <br /> Another real problem is because of the pain that people get from teasing. and whoa, high school life. remember it? The fantasy is to find your true love when you're 25 and you're still in high school. not really imaginative, but close enough! <br /> <br /> although some parts are unbelievable, it was a great movie. There are no other words to describe this incredible work. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did a wonderfully wonderful job, as did the funny David Arquette. The people who worked in the movie are all wonderful. did not I repeat that? <br /> <br /> Never Been Kissed is one of the movies that future generations should see. It shows the reality and some problems for people like you and me.
