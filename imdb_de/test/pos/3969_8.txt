Accepted is a teenage band from 2006, in which the guy from the ads for Mac and PC plays. The film is about Bartelby .B. Gaines is a guy who has rejected all the colleges he applied for. He decides to start his own college and invites all other people who did not make it. The problem is that hundreds of people sign up at their school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $ 5.00 on a sale, and I've always seen it since. Overall, this movie is a must for fans of all comedies, as it is funny, funny and just a good movie. I rate this movie with 78% very fair. GO ACCEPT, MAKE A PLAYER, BUT MAKE SURE IT CAN NOT TAKE.
