First of all, I have seen something very worthy in this film despite the bad rating on this site and I will defend it. And no, I'm not affiliated with the crew in any way ... <br /> <br /> I just happened upon the DVD of The Wind and had the strong feeling that it would not be like the video packaging described. So I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised by this strange, completely different drama. I assume that marketing and aggregating DVDs was the work of MTI Home Video to start a rental or a sale (the line "love comes in many forms" has been changed to "terror comes in many forms"). Sure, the rental and sale of smaller films are highly dependent on attracting a person's attention, especially if they've never heard of the movie before (a similar case happened with the movie THE ITEM). This is probably what works against this release, as horror fans read the description of an "old wind" that brings with it the "omen of the apocalypse." It's easy to believe that this movie is about it, and will make some college students in history crazy wilder who make a killer. At the time of submitting this review, this is most likely the reason for the lower IMDb rating. I can understand the people who are upset and thinking that they were deceived by this summary, seeing the apocalyptic intro, but then experiencing a dark drama. I can forgive the choice of marketing as I enjoyed The Wind and thought it would be a refreshing change from the big Hollywood offerings /> The "wind" in this movie is basically just a metaphor for the company, and it is the story of four friends making some bad choices and how their lives quickly become a desperate self-preservation. Having gone too far to teach one's own lesson leads to death and everyone tries to save their own reputation. Manipulation between them becomes the norm, and in the end we see how self-preservation becomes their main motive for good judgment. Basically civilized too wild. This is very clear when one realizes that the use of a knife, twigs as clubs, fists and kicks are instruments of violence instead of guns. These characters, in a sense, do all the wrong things for the right reason, just to stay up to date as they've already gone too far. While there are many implicit violent images, it is interesting to see that there are no swear words and nudity. <br /> <br /> What works for The Wind are the "unknown" actors. Originally meant to be bigger stars, but I think it's better to have less known, capable actors. That way, you can go down in history without occasionally thinking, "oh, this is Tom Cruise," rather than a really tormented person dealing with an extraordinary situation. Even unusual conversations (like between Mic and Billy in a field and Mic facing Claire in her bedroom) feel good and feel natural in the strange universe of Fairview ... with cozy houses, a forest and wide fields. I always thought of the tranquil landscapes that hide dark secrets in The Reflecting Skin, which mentions director Michael Mongillo as inspiration in his commentary. <br /> <br /> The Wind manages to convey messages without being hard-pressed. <br /> <br /> If you look closely, you will see many symbols and dialogues that other directors would only do to beat you over the head. I even understood the infamous "kiss scene" between Claire, John and Billy in the context of the story, without being surprised that it happened. I'm still amazed that some people (mostly people) kissing two men kissing in a scene would obviously NOT have a problem if the scene kissed two girls instead. Here everything is handled nicely and additional sightseeing will make things clearer without you moaning and saying, "Oh man, how did I miss that ..." Things are beginning to go down and I appreciated that. Or you could watch the DVD Listen to the commentary for more information. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have "understood" the intentions of this film, The Wind is a breath of fresh air (no pun intended). at a time when most films are made to simply make money and be heard when they beat other films out of their "box office competition" when they are mentioned on Entertainment Tonight or CNN. Years later, it's always so The great little discoveries like The Wind that come to my mind are not machined, star-driven blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Pass the marketing trick of MTI Home Video. I recommend it to friends who are looking for unusual films like this.
