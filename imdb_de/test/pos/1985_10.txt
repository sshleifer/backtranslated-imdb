So let's start!))) <br /> <br /> The film itself is as original as Cronenberg's films would normally appear. <br /> <br /> My intention to see was certainly JJL, one of my favorite actresses. She is as pretty as ever, this sweetie! <br /> <br /> I would not say that it was my favorite movie of hers. Nevertheless, it is very interesting and entertaining to follow. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is not particularly impressive, but it's not a kind of Miscast star array. ;) <br /> <br /> With confidence recommend!))))
