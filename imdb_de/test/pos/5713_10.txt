John Leguizamo's one-man show is both funnier and more interesting than most of the movies you see. A number of devices, such as slide projectors, are used to enhance the story, but this is essentially a good old-fashioned performance art. In particular, take a look at his funny depiction of "I Will Survive". *Highly recommended.
