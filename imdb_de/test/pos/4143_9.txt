I was fortunate to be special in this movie when I was about 13 years old. My acting class at middle school was invited to participate. It was a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played the music live all day! As a musician, I appreciate the untiring work and dedication that these guys bring to their roles. You must have played these songs 20 times. It is very difficult to maintain consistency and energy under these conditions. This is evident during a close-up shot of "That's the Day", but luckily the unsuspecting audience would probably not have noticed it. <br /> <br /> Walking Around All Day Getting The day of school and the return transport in time were an incredible thrill. I also had my first "date" in the movie. I had to bring a girl to checkout. Woo hoo! Even with an outdated haircut and hot lights that melt the Vaseline in my hair, it was still worth it. Fun stuff. <br /> <br /> The film is first class and overall very satisfactory. Busey is delivering his best role so far, and the minority is outstanding. I am glad to have participated in a great movie of the day. Thinking I might have been in Corvette Summer or something. Not. <br /> <br /> A funny ironic ending is that years later I was in a video shop in Malibu and saw the movie the week it was released on video. Gary Busey came in and stood next to me. I showed him the cover and babbled about how great he was and how I was an extra and so on. Pretty funny, but very cool, which is worth it.
