I also have to apologize for a biased opinion because I contributed to the soundtrack. Still, I got my copy, leaned back and enjoyed the rolling cast of characters perhaps more colorful than the characters they created in this story from a Shanghai film sequence. For those who feel that George Bush is a "credible Texan," you need not go further than this movie to destroy the image of Texas full of truck drivers and one-dimensional rednecks. The cast includes some of the smartest, most peculiar and humorous people you'll find anywhere while sharing their tales of torment, bliss and disappointment in terms of a great movie set, no budget, guerrilla style (ie "punk rock style"). ) Every person helps with the definition). <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary made with passion and courage and all the poison you need to get to the other side of the industry and Doublespeak you're dealing with (note authors, painters, musicians and other filmmakers). It listens to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music, as the term "D.I.Y." was the standard, a time when courage, passion and commitment counted for much more than technology, style or precious calculations. Not that there is not much technique or style to it ... the tone of the documentation is very refreshing. The cuts provide as much drama as the dialogue in it. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​making a documentary from the sad demise of the cast, the crew and the director is brilliant, all of Texas and absolutely punk rock. Literally.
