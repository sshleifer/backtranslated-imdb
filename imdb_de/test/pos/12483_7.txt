This movie is so lovingly made that you want to be there forever. The flics are straight but not without malice, the goods are transparent and malefactors are hardly there. Even the "cabaret" is so na√Øve that you will dream of nostalgia compared to anything that is available on television. Blier is fine, albeit one-sided. Louis Jouvet is perfect, you can not have better copper. He has the best line: "My father has cleaned the dirt of other people, and I do the same". Susy Delair is unbearable, but I think part of it is the songs, the wardrobe and the hairstyle. Simone Renant, on the other hand, makes a great femme fatale, albeit a little quiet. I did not know that she could be a lesbian, as IMDb users dbdumonteil and others rightly suggest.
