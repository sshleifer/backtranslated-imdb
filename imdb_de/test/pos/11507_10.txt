This film by Friðrik Þór, director of Children of Nature, is powerful. It has great music by Sigurrós and good acting. It shows how sad madness can be as a disease. There are many good jokes, but the humor is dark. If that's not a problem, you should watch this movie. Note that this is not a comedy but a drama.
