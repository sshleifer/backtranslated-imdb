Sometimes it's hard to define what distinguishes a successful, adorable comedy from one that falls flat. In this case, the fictitious conspiracy over a spoiled rich girl planning to get her nieces away from the "bohemian" of Greenwich Village raising her to suicidal herself is promising. And nothing in the filmography of director Leigh Jason suggests that he was an overlooked great talent. And yet, he must be responsible for creating a relaxed, happy atmosphere on the set, which was faithfully recorded in the film. <br /> <br /> He also had the good sense to fill this movie properly. The only small mistake is Miriam Hopkins in a part for which Ginger Rogers would have been perfect. Hopkins is efficient but brittle, lacks the warmth and sexiness Rogers would have had. She is further hampered by a pair of bizarrely long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. But a very young and very handsome Ray Milland could not be any better in a boisterous, uninhibited comic performance of great charm. <br /> <br /> And better than that, especially for the residents of New York City, is the description of Hollywood Greenwich Village in 1937. Though fully synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer. Art Director Van Nest Polglase created a lovable jumble of mews apartments and ramshackle backyards that are the perfect backdrop for the collection of artists, strays, smart aleks and wannabe's. Best in the cast is Guinn Williams, who adds sweetness and light to his role as an award-winning sculptor, suggesting the village's self-discovery and fluidity (sexual and otherwise). Even more refreshing are Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby, who play the little girls. Simple, intelligent and full of humor, these girls look like real people and are nothing compared to the professional children's actors of the time. <br /> <br /> Of particular interest are some memorable comic set pieces: Ray Millands A vacuum cleaner demonstration for a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than one would expect (the baby and his contortions are wonderful 'found' moments) and a wrong domestic 'game' in a department store window degenerating to a free space - everything is fun too. The movie slowly slips down with a straight face review process and never gets back on track as the action moves on Long Island, but this movie is still worth a look.
