My wife and I saw this wonderful movie tonight because we'll see Russian dolls tomorrow. The first one can be seen before the second one. <br /> <br /> We both loved the Spaniah apartment and will enjoy following some of the characters through the early years of their lives - now in St. Pertersburg, Russia. We both easily identified with the rough frame of the story because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the script was not completely alien to our early lives. Our lives have been significantly different, but like in this film, when you throw together young people who share the same circles of life as all the people in the developed world, they will experience the same life situations. <br /> <br /> The collection of people and the personal difficulties they faced were universal and therein lies the beauty of this film, and probably its order, which I will see tomorrow. As I wrote, we are both familiar with the characters and these situations, so we can enjoy living their lives for a while. This must be one of the great strengths of the movie. Allows the viewer to experience vicariously the emotional upheavals of the persons involved while remaining aloof. The viewer can giggle through this distance and think, "I did not do anything stupid" or "I would not have avoided that trap". Maybe that's why we go to the cinema.
