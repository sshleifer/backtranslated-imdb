"THE KING OF THE QUEEN" is in my opinion a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still like it very much. That's why I find it hard to say which episode is my favorite show. Still, I have to say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before I summarize, I would like to say that everyone always performs well, that the production design is spectacular, that the costumes are well designed and the writing is always very strong. To summarize, if the show persists in the Syndication after CBS's exit, it is strongly recommended, just in case it blows out forever.
