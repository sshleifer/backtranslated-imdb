Death in Venice is a movie that I have to see once every ten years. It's always different because I'm always in a different phase of my life. <br /> <br /> The film is about art, beauty, longing and death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others are annoying to watch, especially if you've seen them before. I do not want to miss a single frame though. The music is repetitive, the main theme of the Adagietto from Mahler's fifth is used again and again. I do not want to miss a single note though. When the last picture fades, the last note dies, I am completely exhausted. <br /> <br /> This movie is a monument to filming. As with most really good movies, the crowd should stay away from it on Saturday night. And that's just the best movie ever.
