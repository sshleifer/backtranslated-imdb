What can I say? The little kid inside has always had a great affection for the following ... giant robots, giant monsters and a cackling, megalomaniac chief villain, and this movie delivers on all counts. As an adult, it's easy to point out the many shortcomings in this film, and to say, hey, it's really just a series of episodes that come from a children's television series that strung together. Despite all this, I find the end very moving and the content in nature surprisingly adult. Huge fun, if a bit nonsensical.
