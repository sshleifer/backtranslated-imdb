Kite Runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books I have read in the recent past. i may have had very high expectations of the movie, but still the movie was good, the whole setting seemed realistic. nothing was made fancy. The dialogues were not very attractive or powerful, they were just right. The movie was not a bad experience at all, especially in the last 15 minutes, when it really got emotional and even the toughest man would probably cry. But my imagination was much better than the movie ... I cried while reading the novel more than watching the movie But overall a good movie for anyone who is not a reader. But the readers - the novel would be a better experience. So if you want to see the movie at all, first read the novel and then compare it to the movie.
