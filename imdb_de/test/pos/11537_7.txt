This is a case where the script plays with the audience in ways that only serve to extend that story to 90 minutes. The story begins in 1969, when a young girl named Faith (Cameron Diaz) travels to Europe with her boyfriend Wolf (Christopher Eccleston) but dies under mysterious circumstances. In 1976, Faith's sister Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) decides to travel to Europe and find out what happened to her sister. In France she is looking for Wolf, who has stayed there, and wants him to help her to follow the steps her sister has taken and to answer some questions. He hesitates, but decides to travel with her. Along the way, he fills in the gaps in the incident and tells Phoebe that Faith has joined the Red Army, an extremist group involved in terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf enter into a romance and this complicates the trip to Portugal, where Faith died. There are some things that go wrong with this movie, and everything has to do with the script. First, the romance between Wolf and Phoebe is wrong and does not matter to the story. It rings completely wrong and acts forcibly. It seems strange that Wolf would make a romance with the sister of his deceased friend. Second, Wolf knows exactly what happened to Faith, but only lets out small amounts of information every 15 minutes. Wolf looks at Phoebe every fifteen minutes and says, "There's something I did not tell you!" Dear, thank you Wolf! If Wolf spoke to Phoebe for the first time, the movie would be finished in about 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me was that I do not think that movie rebuilt the 1960s. Diaz wears hippie clothes, but time did not ring. I enjoyed a few things like the authentic locations where the movie was shot. It's a very good looking movie and the scenery is beautiful. The performances are all good, especially by Brewster and Diaz. Apart from "The Fast and the Furious" I had never really seen Brewster. After seeing her appearance in this movie, I was very impressed. She is very good here and I hope that better roles come. The script is narrated in a very original way, and the movie never seems believable.
