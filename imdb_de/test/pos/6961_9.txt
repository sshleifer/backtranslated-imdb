If there is a theme in this film, people can deal with the need with good imagination. This family is poor, her father works in the cemetery, and her mother works in two shifts, and Peter gets busy and frustrated for a variety of reasons, often confused with a girl. He's just starting to approach the age of 10 or 11, when your perceptions change, and he thinks your appearance is starting to gain in importance. The background of this story is the 1967 World's Fair and the centenary of Canada. The biggest moments of the movie come during the different fantasy sequences where we see how they handle it. Watch the movie, and if you've ever had a childhood friend you've dreamed of and then lost for some reason, you'll really enjoy this movie. Maybe children like this movie, but only adults will really appreciate it, including references to Bolsheviks and what parents do for their children.
