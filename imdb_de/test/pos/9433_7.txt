Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a slew of Sherlock Holmes reports, but the famous detective's popularity assured that both print and film sequels would go far beyond the author's works. In "Sherlock Holmes and the." Secret Weapon: "Holmes, Basil Rathbone, patriotically serves British intelligence to secure the much-needed bombing of a Swiss scientist from 1942, and I wonder if the producers and writers have realized how vital that is Bombardier secrets were (the American bomb from the north was guarded almost as diligently as the new radars that would alter the course of World War II) Holmes and his faithful, but as expected limping companion, Dr. Watson, Nigel Bruce, are fighting Dr. Moriarty, Lionel Atwill: As evil as Moriarty has always been, it's a shock to see that he signed with Hitler, does not the man have a decency of decency? I do not think so, but Atwill is deliciously evil. <br /> <br The story is pretty quick as Holmes and Watson are looking for stolen bomb components before they can be delivered to a submarine his usual polite self and several Holmsian disguises are well executed. <br /> <br /> This and other Holmes stories from the 1940s are now available on DVD, and oldies.com has released a very nice 4-disc set in a DVD wooden box: This movie comes along with a bonus -CD of an interview with the old Doyle included. The set costs about $ 26 in major DVD and CD stores, but I found this and other sets from oldies.com in a warehouse club for $ 14.98. The transfers are very good. <br /> <br /> Very nice and relaxed night vision. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
