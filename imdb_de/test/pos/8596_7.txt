I've never read a novel by Jacqueline Susann, but I've also seen Valley of the Dolls based on another of her books. In both cases, I thought the movie was probably better than the book and would continue to improve with age (certainly unlike the books). The reason for this is that a movie focuses more on a particular style in fashion, design and behavioral patterns. And in this regard, The Love Machine offers a lot. The set design fits perfectly with the story. And all characters fit in too. They are perfect in that they complete a balanced overall picture. They are superficial and do not develop, but in this film I would not want it otherwise. David Hemmings embodies the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than a rip off. He is a fashion photographer, looks visibly aged and seems to sow easily. Robert Ryan repeats the role he played in Max Oph√ºls Caught. He is once again Smith Ohlrig, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspired. It is possible that Ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly, on the other hand he would have thought a lot about his role and then given a carefully studied performance. Whatever happened, it fits the picture. Dyan Cannon is awesome (awesome wardrobe!), She dominates every scene she's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie: burning down a luxurious bed and tearing off the Hemmings figure with an Oscar statuette , <Br /> <br /> The title The Love Machine is of course meant ironically. Robin Stone is a sort of Barry Lyndon of the pop era (by the way, the movie is a bit kubrickysh). That he chooses a TV station to work his way up seems to be a coincidence. He sees love (sexual favorions) only as a means of personal development. There are some weird hints of a disturbed sexuality, which are not explored in the film. Homosexuality is handled very casually, probably not the standard for mayor films of that time. The open cynicism of those responsible for TV must not be afraid of comparison with other good films like A Face in the Crowd or Network or Truman Show. They produce crap, they agree that it's crap and they know they'll make a lot of dough with it. <br /> <br /> I have not regretted having spent the odd 108 minutes of this movie and would not be surprised if there's been a sect, provided it's given the chance (which is a DVD Publication means).
