George Scott gave the performance of his life in Paddy Chayefsky's THE HOSPITAL, a very dark drama about an aging city hospital and a middle-aged doctor about to commit suicide. In addition, Diana Rigg comes as a free spirit who is determined to save him from himself. Their dialogue crackles, and it is clear that they are made for each other from the beginning. But will she save him? Her only sex scene is both graphic and memorable for her passion and rage. Meanwhile, the hospital is besieged by a group of agitators who do not want a condemned building to become a cancer center. And a serial killer is loosely hospitalized, specializing in doctors and nurses. However, a good part of the film focuses directly on Scott. As it should be. What a difference some years ago when this movie was filmed. In 1962 we had THE INTERNS, a witty, old-fashioned revision of DR. KILDARE with a horrible drama and a cardboard script. The result was 1971 and THE HOSPITAL. Less than 10 years later. Hollywood has done something right for a change. Today's THE HOSPITAL recalls how much medical shows like ST. ELSEWHERE and SCRUBS owe this lasting classic. And if THE HOSPITAL reminds you of NETWORK, it should do so. Same scripter.
