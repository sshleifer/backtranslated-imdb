This was the very first movie I saw in my life in 1974 or 1975. I was 4 years old at the time and saw him in a drive-in cinema. I did not realize that this would be a classic at the time (I went to sleep about twenty minutes after the movie). After seeing it on TV, along with two of my other favorite movies, Car Wash (my favorite movie) and The Wiz, which seemed to be all together at about the same time each year - about 40, 50, 75 times, I knew this was a movie that I would have as one of my favorites. These three movies were the only live action shows I saw as a kid. <br /> <br /> I would not call that a blaxploitation movie, but an urban interest. Cochise and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles, especially the Wild Irish Rose who drank them. My mother also told me about a few neighborhood parties she attended, and that some of the things that happened in the movie were similar in nature to those of real life. If you are among the two or three blacks over thirty who have not yet seen this movie, I recommend you to buy the DVD now. I am glad that I have experienced some of the events of this era.
