Let's clarify one thing, this is a 7 out of 10 points that are not on a normal scale, but on the scale of a bad movie. This is the kind of movie you purposely lend, deliberately going to know that it's a terrible shed and shunned by everyone else. <br /> <br /> I made a promise from the movie that there will be queues all at once and that there are lovers! <br /> <br /> The Gore itself is really good and the characters have great roles. Come on, it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage drug girls, even an electrical engineer hiring his pimp! You'll see naked nudity, explosions, snakes, gore, and a Mexican trunk running around to heal his girlfriend by knocking on his pipe and blowing the smoke into her face !! As I mentioned earlier and have many others, the tempo of the movie is a bit different but still respectable. <br /> <br /> Films like these hold together the grouping tradition of banding and everything chips a buck or two to see masterpieces like this one. There is no better time than enjoying a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> It could learn a thing or two from other subtleties like alien lock-down or boa vs python, but these are a few big shoes. <br /> <br /> A solid 7 out of 10 points.
