The success of SCREAM brought a whole new horror wave. I'm a big horror fan and I like most of these new horror movies. BOC is a big horror. Colorful, fast and original. I see this movie more as the opening of a new trilogy (similar to episode 1 and aliens: Resurrection), as he comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the relationship between little boys and killer dolls, here's a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers unlike the killer crazy doll lovers. Very innovative!
