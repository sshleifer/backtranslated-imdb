This is actually a very good surreal mystery movie, despite the description that tries to sell it as a sci-fi movie. The Balkan plays a major role as a woman who is pursued by mysterious visions and has lost the memories she tries to bring together. She spends most of the movie understanding her visions. Very atmospheric and effective. It's true that Kinski does not appear very often in this movie, but the acting actors are very good. In the US, there is only one English dubbed version, and the synchronization leaves much to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. The camera of Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro is excellent. A former Giallo by director Bazzoni, THE FIFTH CORD, is also excellent and also a lens by Storarro.
