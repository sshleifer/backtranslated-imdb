This is a cut above other genre films: really exciting, intelligent, brilliantly played and visually stunning. Yes, the plot can be confusing - but that makes them part of such a blow. Take a look at it twice if you can. You'll get almost as much if you know the phrase as if you saw it the first time. a country that is not too familiar to most Western viewers. While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are all too common - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. All of this is superbly handled by Lim Su-jeong as Su-mi, the main character. Particularly noteworthy is Yum Jung-ah, who as a stepmother delivers a deeply scary and disturbing performance. <br /> <br /> Although it has scary moments, this is not really a horror movie as most people would imagine. It's more of a psychological suspense story with a mysterious element. It grabs you from the beginning and lets you guess to the end - and possibly beyond!
