Together with Cops, The Goat is one of the two funniest shorts by Keaton. This makes them one of the best shorts ever made. This has a decent "plot" for a short time, and it's a perfect line to hang some great gags. Keaton is considered an escaped convict (as the mistake happens, is a classic) and then has to evade the authorities. Best gags - the bread line and the "elevator".
