This movie is about three teenagers who have been best friends for the longest time and make the most exciting ride of their lives. When Heroine becomes the preferred drug in their city, these three teenagers find themselves embedded in everything. In this movie, heroine dependency is very well represented, and you can not stop watching. MTV has never been the best made for TV movies, but it has too much content not to look at it. I enjoyed this movie, in the beginning I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen, but as it went on it got better and I could not turn away.
