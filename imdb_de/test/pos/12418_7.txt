I got Monster Man in a set of three movies, where I mainly wanted the other two, but still had a very enjoyable time with it. It unites horror and comedy to a reasonable degree, aided by the decent performances of Eric Jungman as geeky lead actor, Justin Urich as his whole friend, and Aimee Brooks as love interest. The film is quite predictable and can garner ideas from a variety of other films, but remains consistently fun, with a few gruesome throats. Of course, he does not agree with the classic bloody comedies, but that's still good. Director Michael Davis manages even one or two spooky scenes, such as in the bathroom or in the bar. The film is consistently seen when something was messed up and written, and he lost it towards the end, as the monster man of the title Slipknot Member is similar and the movie is trying to play more horror style, but not. t twisted or convincing enough. The last moments are also a bit weak. Despite the lack of suspense and general stupidity, this is still a good example of an unpretentious, often crunchy splatter comedy that fans of the same favor should enjoy.
