That's right, we have a movie from 2008 with the topics "Short Encounter" and "The Bridges of Madison County". It is basically the story of lost loves, salvation and a triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> The performances of Richard Gere and especially Diane Lane are very good. Gere gives a kind of restrained performance when a patient dies on the operating table and searches for meaning. Lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a nice young son who has separated from her wandering husband and suffered the loss of her father the same year. Scott Glenn steals the show at a scene meeting with Gere. He is the man with a broken heart and tells his love for his dead wife. She will bring tears to her girlfriend's eye in the movie and literally hang her hair in a rather harmless performance.
