When I first heard about this film, it struck me that it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed that Elton's music was John, so I thought I had nothing to lose, so I got it. What a surprise!!! The movie was great. It was true that love is about everything. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxury, no money and sometimes no food, yet they were happy. I recommended this movie to all my friends, but everyone criticized my taste and even named it because the movie showed two naked minors. I think that just made the movie more realistic. The cinematography was great, showing only the great skills of director Lewis Gilbert
