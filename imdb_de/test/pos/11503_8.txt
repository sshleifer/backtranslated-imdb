This movie is amazingly free from storytelling. It is a pure experience in which the music overshadows the visual impression. - Words, of course, can not express enough what should be expressed, but it is the requirement of clattering classes that the gossip be brought forward, used in production lines of mediocrity, and therefore a necessity to express a rational thought or opinion about something What should not be broken down by rattling. Therefore, these detailed opinions are brought forward to satisfy those empty heads that must be filled with noise that you will not find in this film.
