My mother, Frank, begins as a friendly, loveable comedy about a Middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack), who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student at her son's university. Most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (Matthew Newton), who falls in love with the girlfriend of his best friend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile, Frank has raised the wrath of her disapproving English teacher (Sam Neill). Matthew Newton completely disarms himself as David; relaxed and natural in the role, even if the character is upset. He creates valuable goodwill and steers the audience through some awkward, broader comedy moments. Not long after halfway through, first director and director Mark Lamprell skilfully steers his film into bleak emotional territory, giving Cusack a real chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The minor cast is fully familiar with and Welcoming Faces (Lynette Curran, Sacha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all principals (including an animated Sam Neill) are excellent. As it winds towards the end, My Mother Frank does more than it promises, and is a true Australian crowd puller.
