Better than the average "Wer-Dun-It" of the Second World War. Warner Baxter was a former gangster who suffered from amnesia and was reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway, helping both the police and criminals who want to go straight. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also affects a victim who may have mental health problems. The connection to "courage" is not very clear. <br /> <br /> This post is about the death of lucky hunter Gordon Carson, whose two former wives live under mysterious circumstances and who in turn lives in a locked room under conditions resembling suicide, but dr. Ordway means murder. Hillary Brooke plays the role of the widow Kathleen Carson, who has to do with Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer, who also includes his sister, who disappears on stage. As a mystery novelist, Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor, as is Lloyd Corrigan, a connoisseur of crime. Haunted houses with creaking doors, caskets in the basement and suspects that are never seen in daylight to the air of tension The set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music is very good. Director, production design and photography stand out. The outdoor shots and costumes suggest prosperity rather than the average "B" detective thriller. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
