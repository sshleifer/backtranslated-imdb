Although the wonderful lemonade no longer exists in the local pharmacy, clothes are definitely right after the war and good and evil are easy to understand. and <br /> <br /> these old planes are really outdated, this movie will never be outdated. <br /> <br /> The post-war human adaptations and problems, the beautiful love stories, the wonderful spectacle (especially Harold Russell and Dana Andrews) are as moving today as they were in 1946. <br /> <br /> I was one of the young women who greeted our wonderful <br /> <br /> veterans from World War II at home. Like so many, my memories of the war years and homecoming are as fresh today as if they were yesterday - this film is very relevant to our time.
