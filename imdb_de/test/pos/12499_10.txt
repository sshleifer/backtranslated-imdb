I was plagued by the nightmares of Sesame Street and the Muppet Show in my childhood. I loved the programs, but when I slept, I would dream of muppets not unlike those on TV ... but not quite like eating on TV and killing each other. They would take a bite out of their sweet felt and it would rip, followed by arterial bleeding. KIND! But that was the past ... I LOVE THIS SHOW! I saw Peter Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES years ago and wondered why there was no similar work out there. Well, here it is, as sick, twisted and somehow socially strong the vision of the old hobbit. <br /> <br /> If you like this show and have not seen MEET THE FEEBLES, get it on Amazon or a similar movie source. They want something good. By the way, Clarence would kick Triumph's dog in the ass.
