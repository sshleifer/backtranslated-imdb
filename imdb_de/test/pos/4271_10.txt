I saw this movie in a small show. Although the budget was low, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast have helped make it a small movie jewel. It is April 8, 1994, each of the characters is in their mid 20s and pursues an artistic ambition (drama, music, film, writing) when they learn suicide by Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain. They are quickly inspired to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. This is where the movie really takes hold and offers a range of fun and emotional scenes. Highlights include a visit to the tomb of Jimi Hendirx, Kurt Cobain's original children's home, and the singing of a campfire. An honest job.
