Walter Matthau is best known for the long series of comedies he made with fellow comedy partner Jack Lemmon from THE FORTUNE COOKIE to THE ODD COUPLE II. One forgets, however, that in the late 70s, he appeared in two films with another partner - a female. This was Glenda Jackson, the English double Oscar winner, who demonstrated her comic skills against Matthau first in HOUSE CALLS and then in HOPSCOTCH. Matthaus' role was slightly bigger in both films, as his characters were more central in the action, but the chemistry between them was pretty good. If you ever want to demonstrate to two professionals who show how sexual intercourse can be crazy, watch Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson experiment to see if two people can have sex under an old movie code everyone has a leg on the floor! Never before has sex been seen from such a clinical and mechanical perspective. <br /> <br /> Matthaus Charlie was widowed right before the movie started. He only had one wife in his life - his wife. Now he is the legitimate bachelor. He is also the leading surgeon in the hospital where he works, but the chief surgeon is Dr. Ing. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney seems to be senile (there are moments later in the movie showing that he turns his senility on and off - see the scene where he rams Richard Benjamin's car). Amos stands for election again (Charlie is his closest competitor for the post - if he wants it). However, Amos manages to persuade Charlie to keep him for reasons of self-esteem. <br /> <br /> One day Charlie Ann notices in the hospital. She had a minor accident and is resting in bed, but Amos put her in a cage-like device (which Charlie has not used since around 1920). He gets her out of the device and soon becomes a romance. She joins the staff of the hospital, but she criticizes Charlie's willingness to take care of Amos, and she criticizes certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital. Death of a wealthy patron of the hospital (Lloyd Gough) who is a baseball team owned (his biggest novelty was separate intake costs for double headers). Amos tries to reassure the young widow of the team owner and holds the eulogy at the funeral service (the line in the summary above is the peremptory line of the eulogy). However, she is still determined to sue (her attorney Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent he has ever seen). So Amos suggests that Charlie satisfies the widow with a relationship to this expensive lawsuit. But how will Ann react to that? The film is quite amusing and was so successful that it not only caused a sequel to Jackson and Matthau, but also led to a television series.
