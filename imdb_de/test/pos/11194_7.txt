My interpretation is that the term "fern" is used in contrast to "warm"; People who are not warm to others. The film reminds me of the teachings of the Dalai Lama in "The Art of Happiness," focusing on the key to happiness being the connection with others. The characters of the movie are not just insular, but they are also humorless, charmless, shy, quiet and rude. These qualities seem to prevent them, among other things, from building and enjoying relationships and being able to talk about and deal with their problems. And that's why they are terribly unhappy. I see it as a strong confirmation of the teachings of the Dalai Lama (by the way, I'm not a Buddist). If you are one of those people who think their behavior is a natural response to life in a big city, you may be right, but I recommend the Dalai Lama's book. Life in the city does not have to be this way. <br /> <br /> I can see why some people found it boring - it draws in places and the characters are not very personable. And unlike Lost In Translation, where the insular characters are much more sympathetic and interconnected, even though they do not usually connect with people.
