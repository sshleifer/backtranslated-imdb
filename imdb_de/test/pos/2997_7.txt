I caught this streak at the back of a tape with which I made a movie that I absolutely wanted to see. When I saw the name of Raquel Welch in the opening credits, I decided to look at it. It was actually mildly entertaining and brought me "back on the road" back to the Farcical films that Hollywood produced in the 1960s, in the same genre as the current Austin Powers. Oh, the acting was not great or the plot, but it's worth watching. There were some charming landscapes, though Mrs. Welch provided the most pleasurable of them. Record it if you have the chance and watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do. It's not a snoozer, but you will not roll in the hallways and want more.
