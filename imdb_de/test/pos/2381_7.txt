The Scooby Doo movie "Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster" is one of the few comic films that turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting and funny, providing a surprisingly good interpretation of the Highlands of Scotland. One annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many characters - Americans who want to sound Scottish in this film are not so successful (although some people put better Scottish accents than others). <br /> <br / Daphne has come to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and the Highland Games in Blake Castle. Seriously, Shannon tells the gang that she believes she saw the Loch Ness monster. As more chaos ensues, the Mystery Inc Gang have another secret in their hands ... <br /> <br /> Good for Scooby Doo fans and for people who want to learn more about Scotland! Have fun with the "Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"! :-)
