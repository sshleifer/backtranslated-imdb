I just saw this movie and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it keeps your full attention, the acting is outstanding, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good movie about big and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the impending ordeal, but he takes matters in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the agony and suffering of the character , Emily Watson's character is very strong and she just has to take a quick look and you understand everything. I will not say more because it is better for you to enter the story as it unfolds.
