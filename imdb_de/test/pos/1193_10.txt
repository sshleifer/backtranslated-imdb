This is a cult movie for many reasons. First because of the phenomenal success as a musical on both Broadway and London, then as a musical film. The film is close to the play and part of the provocation of the play is no longer provocative twelve years later. The discourse against the Vietnam War is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song that shows how the young people of the late 1960s succeeded in overthrowing the political establishment. Milos Forman plays in the late 70s with some situations such as the narrow-minded justice, the egocentric umbilical justice of the rich or the little ones who have only one power group more than the powerless. He also plays heavily with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he constantly builds. The movie remains pleasant and thoughtful. And of course, remembering those years in which we had the privilege is a tremendous thrill, and that was no chance to live them. November 11, 1969, Nixon orders a mass ceasefire for the 1918 armistice that instructs teachers at all levels to take their disciples to the celebration and march, thus supporting the Cambodian invasion, which was in full swing. And some dare to teach foreign countries in democracy. I also recall the long campaign for the dismissal of Nixon in 1973-1974, which will eventually lead to his resignation, and Gerald Ford, the first vice-president and finally the US president, who have not been elected since then, was sworn in by the Senate to Vice President, after Spiro Agnew had to resign because of embezzlement in court, conviction and conviction. Of course, we are thinking of it today when, in the year 2000, a US President was elected not by the people but by the Supreme Court, or a war that was rejected by millions of people around the world and from the beginning. and was started against the better judgment of the United Nations and three permanent members of the Security Council. And some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others. The modern Western man seems to have some problems when he understands that the world has changed and already changed far and meaningfully. The modern Western man seems somehow out of sync and needs special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world as a majority, and the West is far from that majority, and if the Soviet bloc had it Understanding that market economy is not capitalism, but that market economy can be either socialist or capitalist, the Berlin Wall would have fallen, but vice versa, and that China has learned this lesson wonderfully and is at the foot of the wall they have to climb to learn that their socialist market economy must lead to political democracy, but they will, as Vietnam reconstructed itself after thirty years of fierce warfare and damage. In other words, Hair is a perfect way of thinking. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
