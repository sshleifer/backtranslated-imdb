Walter Mattau once again proves his adaptability as an actor. It fits just like Lloyd Bourdelle, a Louisiana Cajun horse lover. This movie gives you a rare insight into Louisiana Cajun horse racing. He has a young quarter horse that has a top racing outlook. "had only one gas station and a good horse." The Bourdelles take the opportunity to make it big by bringing the horse Shadow to Ruidoso, New Mexico, to prepare for All-American Futurity. But how far will Lloyd go to gain fame and fortune? There are also scenes in the film where Lloyd spat tobacco juice and waited for his truck to start.
