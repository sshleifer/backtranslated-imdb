You have to be careful who you tell about 12-hour films. People might easily assume that this is a regular occurrence - even in the world of arthouse cinema, such mammoth runtimes are extremely rare for obvious reasons. This is one thing Hollywood and art cinema have in common: the generally accepted 90 to 120 minute runtime, with a minority of films not reaching the three-hour mark, but rarely exceeding it. <br /> <br /> For this reason, a movie like Out 1 (running time: 729 minutes) is a challenge even for the toughest Cinephil, and he explains why he has always been shown on a handful and remains extremely hard to find , <br /> <br /> Originally conceived as a television series by director Nouvelle Vague Jacques Rivette, he was barely interested in the French networks and instead received a brief theatrical run (Peter Watkins was forced). The same is true of his brilliant nuclear war documentary The War Game, although this had more to do with state censorship than with the term. Released a few times in 1971, Out 1 has reappeared in a handful of Rivette retrospectives over the last two decades, and many who have seen it, including respected US critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, have voted it one of the country's biggest films all time. <br /> <br /> Is it? Yes, if you like Rivette. That alone is a big "if", because Jacques Rivette has never been a commercially successful director. Only two of his films were hits (Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both excellent), and many are still hard to find on DVD (Out 1 was recently released after a rare version on the Internet available) videotape has been uploaded). Nevertheless, he enjoys great respect in the film community and for good reason - his playful surreal tales, his tempo and his use of improvisation characterize him as one of the cinema's most unique and satisfying filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Out 1 deals with a theme that keeps recurring in Rivette's work: the manner of acting, especially in the context of theater and improvisation. His fascination with acting makes Rivette's films a far more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, since the improvisational aspects allow the actors to play a much more active role in determining the interplay of the film. Out 1 is roughly subdivided into four great narratives that gradually interweave and blur as the film evolves: two of actors, each creating postmodern theater adaptations of Aeschylus plays; the other two little thieves (played by the Nouvelle Vague icons Jean-Pierre Léaud and Juliet Berto) use eccentric methods to earn money. and an overarching conspiracy involving a mysterious Balzac-inspired conspiracy revolving around an organization known as the Thirteen. <br /> <br /> As with any Rivette movie with a "conspiracy" narrative, the mysteries and secret organizations are little more than a red herring. As the characters slowly become explored and revealed, collapsing their plans and interpersonal relationships, the film becomes increasingly symbolic of the boredom of 1968 and the decline of the ideals of the time. For a movie from 1971, these were remarkably early subjects; Another French director in Jean Eustache would treat this theme equally satisfactorily in his 1973 masterpiece The Mother and the Whore. However, this is not the limit of the scope of Out 1. <br /> <br /> Consists of eight episodes each lasting about 90 minutes (the beginning of each episode has a brief, abstract black and white montage of the events of the previous chapter) , Out 1 is no less to watch than any quality TV series, and it may even be better to experience one episode at a time. This does not mean that it will not be difficult even in segments. Like most Rivette films, it uses the first few hours to determine the characters before the action begins, and some of those early scenes (especially the sequences depicting the highly abstracted "exercises" of the actors) seem endlessly long to be. However, these scenes are important not only as an exploration of the improvisational play methods that play a literal as well as metaphorical role in the film, but also as a way to adapt the viewer to the slightly boring tempo of the film. Paradoxically, long films make long films much more bearable for an audience, and this understanding of tempo, along with more up-to-date directors like Michael Haneke and Béla Tarr, has made Rivette a less commercially viable movie that still keeps its capacity , <br /> <br /> In a movie that deals with actors in many ways, acting is fantastic. Many famous Nouvelle Vague faces appear, among them the aforementioned Léaud and Berto, the outstanding bull Ogier of Michel Lonsdale and Rivette. Even another legendary director in Eric Rohmer has a great cameo as a Balzac professor performing in a pivotal scene. The people and the architecture of Paris c. However, 1971 seems to play an equally important role - the cityscapes, crowding scenes, and interested viewers freeze out in time, a document of a place at a time in history. <br /> <br /> After just over 720 minutes, the film ends with an incredibly short, enigmatic note; However, the strenuous journey the viewer has made is so full of possibilities, complications and spontaneity that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning or to see the next twelve hours in the life of these characters. For those who have seen many types of cinema and believe that they have seen all that art has to offer, Out 1 recalls that cinema has the potential to be so much more and to paint in so many more directions, as the current conventions permit. For filmmakers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, this is something to appreciate.
