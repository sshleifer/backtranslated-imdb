Like many other critics, I am surprised to see many negative reviews in this film. Dan O'Bannon's earlier efforts were the groundbreaking "Alien" of 1979. Because it and "Star Wars" introduced the stylistic approach of "Used" or "Dirty Space" in the art direction for this type of feature, this does not mean that this Everything was meant to be the only way to produce them. <br /> <br /> Instead of rejecting 'Lifeforce' as a kind of "schlock" and primitive exploit, it's important to realize that the movie is based on the "esteemed" one. British horror and sci-fi traditions - especially the features of Hammer and American International such as Quatermass (specifically "Quatermass and the Pit", 1967), Doctor Who and "The Day of the Triffids" (1963), if not the works by Gerry Anderson ('UFO', 'Space: 1999' and 'Thunderbirds'). None of these influences, however, would be a surprise if other reviewers recognize the genre-scientific recognition of the writer O'Bannon for 'Queen of Blood' (1966) and 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space '(1958) - the immediate sources for "Alien" (1979). Admittedly, this movie has some "old" elements, but maybe it's worth comparing this movie with its more immediate counterparts - 1981 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'The Company of Wolves' ( 1984) - other films from the 80s, which have a look back, while adapting these stories to the zeitgeist of the 80s. All three films relied on past incarnations of the same but essentially gender-specific themes (because they could), and at the same time recognized the humorous aspects of their projects. In the '80s, Neil Jordan's "Wolves" played for many of the psychoanalytic memes in the 80s, while "American Werewolf" suppressed his theme as a coming-of-age movie. It's called an artistic license, and the adjustments to these three films are no less valid than the "Scream" franchise, "I know what you did last summer" and "Final Destination." These films targeting teenagers seem to be part of a box office trend, while 80s films like "Lifeforce" belong to a canon of British science fiction - even if written by an American. <br /> <In many ways, this movie lasts much better than later catastrophe and alien invasion movements ('Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'Deep Impact') because the 'solutions' are not in arms. Battles, armed payloads and testosterone. At the other end of the pole, it's unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron did not look closely at Tarkowski and Lem before reissuing 'Solaris' ... <br /> <br /> The aim of this movie was Fun, no clumsiness or stupidity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
