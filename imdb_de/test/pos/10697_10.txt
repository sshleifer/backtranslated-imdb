This movie is, in my opinion, the best Ninja movie, and if you have not seen it yet, it's worth seeing. I'd rate this movie as 10/10, if you want to see more then visit http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination. The opening sequence, in which the evil ninja kills everyone in his own way, is excellent. He then has to own a young woman who finds him dying. She then has to take revenge on the cops who killed him, which means there's more murder and action. But only a ninja can destroy a ninja. She and her friend, who is also one of their targets, ask for the help of Yamad (Sho Kosugi) to free the evil Ninjasgeist and destroy him.
