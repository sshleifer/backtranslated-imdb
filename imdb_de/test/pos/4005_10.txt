First of all, I want to say that Ang Lee has done a very good job! I saw it yesterday and was surprised. The story is very good, but all ignorant people would say, "That sucks people can not fly!" I say to them, it's the fiction and that's it. This is not to be understood as a film about reality, you could say that this is a "fairy tale". And a very pleasant Asian fairy tale. The pictures can really blow you away. Because Ang Lee was filmed so artistically, he has a great talent. The fight scene is very cool and nicely presented to the audience. But it is sad, but this film has not received the appreciation it should have received. Fortunately, Ang Lee got the attention he deserved when his blockbuster Mountain broke. Therefore, the pictures are entertaining enough even for spectators who are not interested in the story!
