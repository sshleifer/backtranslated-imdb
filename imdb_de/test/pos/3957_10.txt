"Blind Spot" one of my festival favorites. I was intrigued by the idea that three strangers were looking for a mysterious man who loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly impressive as an amazing Los Angeles boy. His diary entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are pretty intense. The movie has a powerful style. It brings elements like road movie and revenge drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in a way that captures the frightening ambience of lost love. Several sequences have a fantastic quality and the pictures are curious with an eerie feeling of tension. Strange. Excitingly beautiful to look at. Definitely worth seeing. I would really like to see it again. At regular intervals I check if the blind spot has been distributed. I can not wait to see the movie again in the cinema or on DVD.
