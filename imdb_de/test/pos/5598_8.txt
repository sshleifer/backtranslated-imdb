In this particular film, the themes of the End of Days and Satan vs. Jesus are treated in a new way. Jesus does not want to open the last two seals, and Satan becomes difficult to open in his attempt to bring another soul to hell. <br /> <br /> What's memorable about this movie is the weird image, blurry shots, and lighting effects that are effective but sometimes irritating. And of course, Donovan is great as a disappointed Jesus trying to deal with what the world and its people have become! So see it, if you get the chance!
