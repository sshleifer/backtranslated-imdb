A very moving and thought provoking film that raises issues of mental health, deadly diseases and euthanasia. Does something sound too heavy? It is a bit, but this is realistically treated in a history of the changes that come to the family that needs to deal with these things. This is a positive story in which one faces the life and responsibility that is not overwhelmed by the subject. <br /> <br /> Afterlife is a beautifully filmed and crafted movie that plays in modern times and deals with modern themes. It's a character-driven, captivating movie with a strong cast and some very good performances. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of movie that always performs well at the box office, so start it for as long as you can.
