I felt like that when I saw the episode in its original run and I still agree with it when I look at it at repetitions. They had the culprits who totally mocked Columbo throughout the episode and treated him like a Down syndrome. And in the end you see her shock when Columbo kills her and arrests her. You also get a realistic reaction from the arrogant preppy killers. They still could not give Columbo his props and said he was just lucky. I like the formula, which has a sophisticated crime, the murderer totally underestimated Columbo, and then you realize that Columbo was totally playing the criminals. I remember, in the first episodes of the episodes after 1989, that they did not follow this formula, and this was the first episode I was satisfied with.
