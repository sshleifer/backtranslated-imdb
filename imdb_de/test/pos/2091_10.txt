When a bomber, a patrician, a pornographer, and a crazy biker, along with various other forms of social scum, get enough of their fucking cell, they spot a rat and search for the hole. The group of 9 souls flees from the sewage, uses their newfound freedom and sets off for civilization. What follows soon is not surprising. Complete chaos and horror follow her. It seems everyone has something to do. <br /> <br /> 9 SOULS is based on The Great Escape and is by far one of the top 5 movies I've seen this year. About 2 hours 9 SOULS delivers such a powerful story that you literally feel breathless. The beautiful yet subtle use of the gentle landscapes adds the realism expected of this story. The vision of director Toshiaki Toyoda (Blue Spring, porn star) is absolutely stunning as he feels sorry for the characters. As fast as each character captures his dream, he is as fast as he is torn from them. Well, the responsibility for the success of this film should not just fall on the shoulders of the director, but props must also go to the actors. This film was full of great effect from top to bottom. Ryuhei Matsuda (the son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition) delivers an outstanding performance and seems to bring some of his mothers scary on the screen. <br /> <br /> I also have to give props on Artsmagic DVD. This is the sixth movie I have seen, and they seem to get better with every DVD. The sound quality is perfect and the picture; clean and crisp. It is very annoying to try to watch too dark a movie, so the discs of these cats are nice. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This movie will soon be seen as a masterpiece by audiences worldwide. Keep an eye for 2005 on 9 SOULS; It is really an amazing movie.
