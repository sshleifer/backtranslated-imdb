Impressive. When I went to the movie at the Toronto Film Festival, I had no idea what I wanted. This film takes you in the best sense of the word in an emotional roller coaster. Sigourney Weaver was better than I have seen her in years; Emile Hirsch was great and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see that this is not for everyone, because sometimes it has to do with pretty tough things that can happen to a family. Do not get me wrong - it's also really funny - at my screening, the audience burst into applause after laughing a lot. I just think, if you are open to investigating your own life, Imaginary Heroes will truly touch you. I can not wait to see it in theaters.
