When I saw the last two episodes, I remembered a TV station from my childhood. It showed the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small salon, a man enters the bar / salon, he is damned thirsty, his lips jumped, etc., he has just run through the Nevada desert and has it managed not to drink water for days. He croaked the bartender, "give a packet of potato chips". While he eats, we can feel how thirsty he gets, we hear a voice in the background that says ... "Build that thirst until you can not keep it anymore ......... .... then blow it away with TEAM "The man drinks TEAM (a soft drink) It feels like a couple of dozen bags of potato chips are thirsting so hard that I can not hold it anymore, Season 2 has even more twists and turns than Season 1. The end answers many questions, but raises many more questions. Hopefully we'll know the answer in Season 3, but I doubt it because I feel like I've lost it. The momentum goes much further than 3 seasons as the people behind the camera continue their good work. <br /> <br /> I will keep watching. <br /> <br /> From Pakistan with love
