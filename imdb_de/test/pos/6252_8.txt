Do not you just hate the slashers who seemingly never started? Sometimes it takes a full hour of lame red herrings before real action takes place. "Tourist trap" is not so! If it's usually cruel slash you want, then you get that ugly slap! Much of it AND constantly from start to finish! This film probably contains the biggest opening sequence in horror cinema of the 80s, when a teenager is trapped in an abandoned house on a walk after an engine failure and is attacked by a spooky collection of wax statues. Four more lambs come to the house and meet an absolutely insane madman who looks like a mix of Leatherface (from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") and one of those crazy sculptors from old wax museum movies. "Tourist Trap" is an exciting horror entertainment, with real excitement, gruesome imagery, ultimate craziness, morbid humor and great make-up effects. The plot changes are not always original and the acting is pretty bad, but seriously, who cares? The fast pace and the groovy killer icon made this "tourist trap" a place among my 5 favorite slashes. A bit surprising, however, is the total lack of nudity. Too bad, because all girls look gorgeous and after 10 minutes is the obligatory line "Who needs a swimsuit?" is spoken.
