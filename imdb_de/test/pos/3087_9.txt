I remember when I saw this movie for the first time. I babysit for a friend of my mothers, and one of the children suggested to see it. I thought it was the honestly ridiculous Prince of the Thieves they had slipped into the VCR. I was ready for a few hours of boredom. What I got was a shock, a pleasant one I can admit, but still a shock. <br /> <br /> Now you all know that the Robin Hood legend is not true? I will explain something. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal who made money here and there and gave it to the people who needed it, while he seduced the beautiful maiden Marion and annoyed the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John. These are the basics! Well, continue with the review. <br /> <br /> This film was released in 1993 and is a take-off of the entire Robin Hood legend and in particular a recording of Prince of Thieves. <Br /> <br /> Legend has it that Robin of Loxley was first encountered in an Arab jail during the Third Century Crusades, and along with a "bog" as they were then called, he leads a cunning escape with a cellmate through. Asneeze. <br /> <br /> After his escape Asneeze Robin asks to find his son Atchoo, a foreign exchange student in England, and to look for him. This Robin swears to do that! Robin swims back to England. <br /> <br /> He returns home, Loxley Castle, to see him being rolled away by bailiffs on the back of the wagon, and sadly realizes that his father, dog, cat and even the goldfish are all dead Desperate for a familiar face, he finds the faithful blind servant of the family, Blinkin, sitting in the toilet with a jazz magazine in Braille. The fun continues throughout the movie. As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must defeat the evil plans of Prince John and the Sheriff of Rottingham, who wreak havoc during their stay and exorbitant taxes on King Richards's kingdom. He's gone. <br /> <br /> Those who are familiar with the films that Mel Brooks previously directed will have a small idea of ​​what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for making Dracula dead and loving him and the young Frankenstein. All jokes, ranging from visual gags to wonderfully funny comments, are in exactly the right spots throughout the movie, with a maximum of one minute break. <br /> <br /> Cary Elwes (by the way, the only Englishman who plays Robin Hood in a movie), whom many of you know from Princess Bride, brings his sassy, ​​grinning, sparkling eye presence into this movie and does a wonderful job. From fancy heroic attitudes to a wicked sexy look, he's really amazingly funny. And the man looks better in tights than me! <br /> <br /> Richard Lewis is weird like the whiny, arrogant Prince John with the ever-changing Mole. He puts the sissy-boy attitude on a t-shirt and his screaming American vocalizations are great. Throughout the film, a mole on his face is constantly changing his position: starting at his left cheek, then to his right cheek, then to his chin, then to his forehead before returning to his original place. This is a subtle joke based on the mole by Alan Rickman when he played the sheriff in Prince Of Thieves. Roger Rees is the shabby Sheriff of Rottingham, who is amazingly slimy and uncomfortable, and has some great movie lines. <br /> <br /> There are some faces here that you know from other Brooks movies. For example, Robert Ridgely, who played the hangman in this film, also played the Hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He also likes to add subtle references to his earlier films; With several in this movie, the hard-boiled Brooks fans will feel slightly. Those who have watched History of the World Part 1 will recognize the music for the song 'Men in Tights'. When Patrick Stewart arrives and kisses Marion, Mel himself (playing with Rabbi Tuckman) says the line "It's good to be a king," one of his lines in the history of the world. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is wonderfully comedic, even those with just a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humor. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so wonderfully warm and funny is, in my opinion, all the improvised scenes. Although there was a kind of script, some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prays in her bed for Rottingham, and he falls through the ceiling and lands exactly where they have him Wanted by the two actors completely thought out and thought through. <br /> <br /> There are few special effects, and those who are there are small but funny moments of computerized camera embroidery. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is unforgettable, with some very funny songs and some kitschy love songs. They will sing "Men in Tights" or at least hum themselves for weeks. <br /> <br /> The rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the movie, except in the use of double instruction and an utterance of Sh! T, and the violence is minimal. Actually, I would say that it is nonexistent except for a few comedy fight scenes. <br /> <br /> A great movie that adults and children alike can enjoy!
