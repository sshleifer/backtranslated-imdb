Russell T Davies had the task of recreating a piece of my childhood: hiding behind the couch and watching monsters with dr. Who fight to see. He and his crew are obviously all true followers of the original series. <br /> <br /> In the same way the Star Trek movies used their budget to make the original concept of the Gene Rodenberry far more credible, Russell T Davies has both the money and the advantages of excellent CGI to be the best monster of all times. I am sure that this series was created on a budget that was expecting both the export and the DVD sales, and it really feels as if no expense was spared. <br /> <br /> The accompanying series Dr. Who Confidential shows the work that's in every area episode, which is a really useful insights behind the scenes. Interviewing with the performers and authors helps tell the story from every perspective of the characters, and is far more useful than simply revisiting the entire program. <br /> <br /> How does David Tenant stand in the pantheon of his famous predecessors? The time will tell, however, tonight, when Billie Piper played alongside Elisabeth Sladen, who was the doctor's companion in the 1970s. She confirmed that she has both the ability to act as well as screen presence and the # 1 script.
