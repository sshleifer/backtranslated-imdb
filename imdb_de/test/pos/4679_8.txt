- Surprisingly enjoyable movie <br /> <br /> - A group of thieves led by Mark Wahlberg rob a gold vault in Italy, and the raids are successful for them, and they get away with little trouble. Before the group can celebrate, Steve decides to be played by Ed Norton. He wants the gold for himself and pulls a Cout De 'Ta into the group and shoots one of the members. He and his accomplices think that the group is dead, but fortunately the group is not dead. One year later we come back to the story where the group located Norton and decide to steal the gold back and the Spend the rest of the movie making plans to take back their gold and earn a score. <br /> <br /> - This was a surprise for me, it had everything to be a typical, memorable summer movie, but it was really memorable and really fun sight. What I like is how intelligent and thoughtful the plans in the movie are and how the film feels realistic. If you look at the trailer, you might think that this is a pointless action movie. In fact, there are only two action scenes in the movie, all of which are really well done. The last action scene is a very long 20 minutes. Scene that has one of the best chases. I like how real the hunt is and how everything is done in the old school style without the help of CGI. Personally, I enjoyed this chase more than the CGI-filled chase in "Matrix 2". I remember music videos by director F. Gary Gray and always realized how well they were made and thought he was going to be a great filmmaker, it turned out that I was right as always and that he proves it here. I can not wait to see what he is doing with the sequel. <br /> <br /> -The actors also do a decent job, with Seth Green being my favorite of the group. The other thing I loved was the excellent rating from John Powell. Since listening to Robots this year, I'm a fan of him and I appreciate his music and the man is really good. He does well to avoid all the typical musical clich√©s of the summer action movie, and delivers a very good score. I have not seen the original on which it is based, so I can not really say how good it is stacked up to this one. <br /> <br /> Well, that's a great popcorn movie that actually has a brain Unlike most of the summer crap that comes out. Has great characters, is hellishly funny and has an incredible score from John Powell. If you love Heist movies, you'll love this <br /> <br /> - you know, if I was in the group, they would call me a pretty microphone
