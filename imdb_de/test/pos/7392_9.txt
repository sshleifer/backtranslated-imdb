I think this movie is different from most of the movies I've seen. It was in some ways exciting, and no matter what others say, I was surprised at the final solution. I certainly did not see it coming! Although it is sad, it is worth to look at it. I can not imagine a movie that would be like that! Actors knew what they were doing. If you say that this movie is shit, you probably say what most people would say. But if someone says that this movie is normal, I totally disagree. And Norman Reedus should be more noticeable. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm a freak, but I liked that a lot. It was kinda messed up, but who cares? I'm tired of boring and ordinary movies.
