There I was on vacation when my host suggested to attend this B-movie festival in Breda. I was reluctant because I had not gone on a trip to sit in a movie theater, but I have to admit that I do not regret it for a second (especially with Stephen Malkmus's contribution). It probably helped that I had no idea what to expect. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST starts like a typical costume drama. We have a young medical student who will help a doctor whose city is being destroyed by a crazy plague (which somehow means the explosion of heads). On the way he visits his fianc√©e and is thrown from the property by her father. As he continues, he finds a girl lying on the street, another plague victim, and takes it to the doctor. Yawning, I thought. It all seemed pretty predictable. <br /> <br /> And then everything went crazy and it suddenly became a completely different movie. Tom Savini looks like Dracula, characters travel to the "other side" of reality and dialogue becomes more and more humorous. <br /> <br /> And when I thought it had settled in a groove, the picture changes again really dark and bizarre. I will not spoil it for the first viewers, but there is an amazing sequence about hollow people, many conversations about society's abuse of religion, and some exaggerated gore effects. And did I mention Stephen Malkmus? This is not a perfect movie (if you did not find that out at a B-movie festival), but it's worth the time for adventurous audiences. Great graphics, cool soundtrack, many interesting ideas. Acting is sometimes a bit crazy, but I think that's the point. <br /> <br /> Funny, I had to go to Breda to find an American image that looked like a British horror movie. You find out ...
