She is the man great. It's funny, original and made me laugh so much that I almost wet my seat. The day I went to the movies, I was not in the best of moods (anger), but when I left the movie, I had a grin on my face. The story is a bit out there, and nobody realizes that she looks too much like a girl, but who should I say, what is believable? in the history. Amanda B. did a great job as a lead actress and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true than her opposite as the beautiful Duchess. Girls look at this because it's a great laugh, and it's a hot guy, and guys, you see, maybe you're learning about girls! <br /> <br /> All in all a brilliant, fantastic and funny movie that I will buy on DVD when it comes out.
