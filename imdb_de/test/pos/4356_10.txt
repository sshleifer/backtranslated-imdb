What attracts a man to military service? What prepares a man to survive brutal torture as a prisoner of war? What desperation leads to planning and executing an escape into the jungles of Southeast Asia? How does he deal with the ghosts and memories with which he returns home? Herzog tries to answer these questions in his documentary about Dieter Dengler, who was shot down in Laos in 1966. He was captured, tortured and starved, but eventually escaped to torture himself for the rest of his life. A powerful and personal first-hand account of the man, his life and his experience, he told through the seamless integration of interviews, archive footage and new material. You will never forget this story - or this man.
