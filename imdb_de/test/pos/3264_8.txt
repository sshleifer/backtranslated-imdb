Due to the current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I did not expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how was I wrong? <br /> <br /> From beginning to end you are deeply immersed in a genre that has been unoriginal for a long time. The director also excels in staging and cinematography and creates a film that has a great imagination. If you are looking for a movie that is not only entertaining, but also provocative, captivating and truly extraordinary, then make this movie the next movie you see. <br /> <br /> I hope that Heath Ledger's tragic death will lead more people to pick up on this film. He was an incredible talent, and his performance should not be missed. Do not make the mistake of judging and rejecting this amazing movie before you've seen it.
