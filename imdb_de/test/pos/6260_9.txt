"Shadow Magic" picks up on the joy and wonderment of the first cinema visit again. It also demonstrates the film's power in its ability to bring the world closer, overcome cultural barriers, and preserve itself for generations to come. Anyone who really loves the art of the movie will love this movie. It's a great first attempt by author / director Ann Hu, who hopefully will follow many films.
