This movie says all about religion - I wish it was needed for all bigots and aspiring clerics. <br /> <br /> The story that takes place in turn-of-the-century Danish villages is about two very religious sisters whose deceased father was a stern priest who discouraged all their dreams of love and exploration of the world and its many beautiful things , They are old now and spend their lives and their beauty. Their quiet new help - which they "teach" is Babette (played by handsome Stephane Audran, who graced so many of her husband Claude Chabrol's films). Life in the village is simple and the strict direction reflects that. <br /> <br /> When Babette wins the lottery, she asks for an opportunity to prepare a feast - a true love job. The celebration of the feast and its main guest reveal messages of love and spirituality, and how there are many ways to love God and life. <br /> <br /> This is a must for the dedication with which Babette prepares the feast and for the speech the general gives in the end. Perhaps the best international film of the 80s.
