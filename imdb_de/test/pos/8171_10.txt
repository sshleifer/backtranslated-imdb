I love this movie so much: music, cinematography, acting, history and all Mormon clich√©s. Just because they are stereotypes does not mean that they are not true! That's not perfect, it's a movie. Although excommunications take place in well-lit rooms with beautiful large desks and chairs, it was apt to portray them as a dark, cold scene they made in this film. I also liked the scene where the angel waited at the bus stop and smoked a cigarette. I thought that was so cool. I mean, I believe that angels are watching over us. What should one wait for? Smoking is a way some people spend time while they wait. I loved the irony because Mormons make such a deal with smoking. I saw this movie 7 times in the theaters of Salt Lake and cried every time! It makes me go. And I've seen it 3 times on video and it makes me cry again and again. I would take the chance to see it on a big screen again. I hope the Tower Theater in Salt Lake will regularly bring it back to the General Conference as a cult movie (pun intended, but no offense intended).
