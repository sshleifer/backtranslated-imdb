This is a very good black comedy with a great view of how different people perceive the same situation differently. The three main characters each met a girl named Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who is a different male fantasy for each of the three men. Each of the three men goes through the same situation, but when they tell other people about it, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say. This is a very good concept, probably not quite original, but it works very well in the movie. The plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes her a good black comedy. The play is just as good, none of the actors seemed out of place or out of his league. The comedy is very black, pitch black in some scenes, and many people will definitely be offended, but fans of black comedy will probably enjoy it. Overall, this movie is not for everyone, but most people who like black comedy will probably love it, as it's definitely one of the better black comedies. 10.7
