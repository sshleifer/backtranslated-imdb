I was 13 when this miniseries (and their sequels North and South, Book II) first aired. I was already fascinated by the personal stories of interest in our American Civil War, which interested me in seeing this program for television. <br /> <br /> I loved it. And now I'm 29 years old and I just love it more. It's full of history, beautiful costly, real characters that have been woven into the lives of fictional characters and all of you are very interested. There is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, lust, slaughter, victory, defeat and reconstruction. <br /> <br /> Even though I had the complete set of episodes aired on tapes that I had recorded at that time, a few years ago I bought the complete set of N & S and N & S IIs from Columbia House, as they did became available. Every few years, I take a whole weekend and look at all the guesswork - and I'm sad when the last episode comes to an end, because I want to continue the story about the lives of these characters. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this mini series.
