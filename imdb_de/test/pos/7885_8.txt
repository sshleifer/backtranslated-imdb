New Yorkers who play with this film at the same time will remember how reflective their time is and how well cast and crew have conquered America, New York City of that time. Norman Wexler's script describes the different worlds of the various subgroups live in and Avildsen's direction produces phenomenal performances. The unbelievable talent of Peter Boyle is seen like never before and since then. It is clearly the best character representation that ever sympathetic Dennis Patrick has ever done. What I will always remember about JOE is the feeling of being in a virtual state of shock coming out of the theater. Knowing that what was on screen was seething beneath the surface in all five districts of New York City. <br /> <br /> This movie has to be remembered.
