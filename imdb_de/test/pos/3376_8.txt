The premise is more original and well thought out, but unfortunately the siding of a good story is a very small budget that does not even allow for decent special effects. Jeff Fahey does his best under a poor cast, as does the always beautiful Linda Hoffman. They should do more films together. The film is not much praise, but at least grants a visit.
