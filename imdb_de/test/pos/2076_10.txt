Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deepest and most intense Hamlet ever made - no other version comes close. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors who have played it. Patrick Stewart's Claudius is cruel and likeable - I especially like the two fools who play Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very insane and yet scary. Some may complain about the need for a strong Ophelia - she's not a strong person, that's the point, and Lalla Ward meets the right nuances. Amazing. Just unbelievable - every one of the more than two dozen times I've looked at.
