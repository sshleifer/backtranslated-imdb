Ice the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A virus pulled out of the ice <br /> <br /> I just did not know how to play nice. <br /> <br /> If he's infected, you'll kill <br /> <br /> Because you're sick. <br /> <br /> The remedy must be infected twice. <br /> <br /> Ice is a great episode; one of the greats from the first season, who helped shape the show. If you ask me, you can not wish much better throughout the series. It starts with a great teaser that I think is really one of the best teasers in the series. A group of scientists in Alaska have drilled something out of the ice core, which for some reason has caused them to kill each other. Now, Mulder and Scully are being sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened. As Mulder says, it's either because they're brilliant or expendable. I mean, they should be better brilliant or otherwise ... The group quickly discovers that the cause of chaos is a small parasite being pulled out of the ice core. A small worm that enters the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. As the pilot is infected, the rest of the show turns into an exciting paranoia thriller that qualifies as a paranoid, as the others begin to suspect each other of an infection. This is not helped by an overly paranoid doctor, Hodge, who does not trust anyone who is first asked by us first: the affirmation of all persons to "make sure we are the one of whom we say we are are". Events lead to finding the infected person and learning how to heal them. <br /> <br /> There are a number of things that I like about the episode, and of course certain characters that I want to look into the face of this episode as well as a few loopholes, but most may be on increased caution and not clear Be due to thinking. I like Bear from the moment I met him for the first time. It's a shame he has to die. I also like the scene shown from the other scientist's point of view, while Mulder and Scully argue in the other room. This gives our typical perception as an onlooker an interesting twist, and to me it seems that perhaps we should not assume that someone is just a government because he knows all sorts of conspiracy secrets. As much as Hodges frustrates me in this episode, I think Mulder was as responsible for some of the exuberant actions as everyone else. I really like Scully in this episode. Above all, she can tackle like a freakin linebacker! Second, I like the focus on her horror at what's going to happen to them out there, and how she's trying to keep Mulder's trust and friendship from faking her judgment. I love the scene when she goes to bed at bedtime and sees first the picture of the previous group hugging and giving birth to the birthday presents to all who slept in this room, and then, as she suddenly freaks out and shoves the dresser in the door, and in a last subtle touch of subtlety, as she sits on the floor and knees in her chest, we see the bottom of a poster on the wall, on which "Bosom Buddies" stands. That's great writing. To say without a word that Scully is worried that she may not even be able to trust her best friend. Unfortunately, this increased suspicion is causing Mulder to become infected since discovering Murphy's corpse, even though they have not yet inspected it to find out for sure. That was my main problem with the behavior of the characters: they could easily have solved the whole suspicion with blood donations. But I think I probably would have acted unthinkingly in this situation too. But then stupid Hodges stats that he has to assume that Mulder is infected, even though Mulder surrenders voluntarily and then willingly inspects it, almost infecting Mulder. Luckily he sees that it is really Dasilva that is infected and we finally reach a solution. At least as much as you can expect from an X file. The "government" does not waste time burning the evidence, as it always does, and Mulder remains another frustrating "unresolved" case. Finally I give "Ice" and easy 10/10 and leave you with a haiku. <br /> <br /> "We are not who we are, it can not go on until today, it's ending here right now."
