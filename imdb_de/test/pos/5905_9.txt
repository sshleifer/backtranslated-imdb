Do not be fooled by the nostalgic aura that surrounds "Mon oncle Antoine" because, as in the best Canadian films, darkness lurks just below the surface. <br /> <br /> The story, which presumably plays in rural Quebec in the 1940s, explores the evolving consciousness of the young Benoite as he learns to deal with sexuality and death. <br /> <br /> The look of the film is astonishing, especially since the public's general aesthetics are heavily criticized by Canadian cinema. In addition, the humble Benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience, who looks at his corrupt community with fresh, innocent eyes. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone who wants to put the film in a historical context to read Jim Leach's critical essay about the film in Canadas Best Features while analyzing the form of the film. Look at that definitely.
