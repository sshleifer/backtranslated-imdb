I made a promise that if I wrote a comment that was not uncomplicated, later felt different, I would return and make known my change of heart. So far, this is the first time it has happened. <br /> <br /> I'm starting to enjoy hack. Something has changed significantly. The actions seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be a bit surreal, but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven. I attribute this to good acting. <br /> <br /> Not every show can win a winner. Some need time to gain speed. I am glad that I have watched this program over and over again and I really hope it lasts.
