Bergman's account of how the hell of war can lead a reasonable pair of musicians to barbarism. With many memorable scenes throughout the film, I found it particularly noteworthy that Ullmann and Von Sydow are sitting in a boat completely surrounded by bodies of soldiers swimming on the sea. A fascinating masterpiece!
