I saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival, and I was also surprised that it did not attract attention because it was not only powerful and beautiful, but also very original. The audience was totally engaged and the biggest part of such a film at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and then participate in the Q & A session. They literally had to throw us out of the screening room for the next movie - we could have walked much longer. The movie is simultaneously provocative and hilarious. It would be a shame if this movie is not picked up for a wider distribution - I hope it will be available on DVD at least because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I know.
