After a man turns up dead, a soldier becomes the prime suspect. Undoubtedly the best movie with three Roberts, and all are in good shape. Young is the cool, smoking policeman investigating the murder, Mitchum is the suspect's suspicious friend, and Ryan is an astute soldier who has something to hide. Grahame has a short but effective role as Femme Fatale. The future Tarzan Barker has a small role as a soldier. This film is about anti-Semitism, a topic that was also covered in the Best Picture Oscar winner "Gentleman's Agreement", which was released in the same year. It is firmly headed by Dmytryk, who creates an effective film noir atmosphere.
