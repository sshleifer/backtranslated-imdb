Perhaps the best John Travolta role ever. Saturday Night Fever was a great movie and a big role, but a long time ago. I can not think of many of his films or roles I even liked, and it's easy to think of lazy movies. He can do dwarves like in Pulp Fiction, but he's the perfect funky angel, and it's hard to imagine someone doing a better job (alike a slobby). Plot summaries are available everywhere, but the plot is not the point. Just set off and enjoy the wisdom of the little funnies on the way. There is nothing to detest about this film, unless you are looking for something profound. I wish there were more such films. We need a break from deep or awesome or cruel or complex or hysterical.
