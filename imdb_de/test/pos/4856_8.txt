The main criticism of others in this film - namely, that Macy suddenly looks Jewish when putting on his glasses - is out of place. The glasses are just the little change needed to convince him that he is a Jew. The scene in which he says to his boss ("paraphrased") "But you know what my background is," along with another discussion with his mother, suggests he had to fight that assumption in the past. The glasses now make him look Jewish, to "confirm" the existing suspicions of his neighbors and colleagues. Then there is the big nose of his new wife, who tastes like nothing but clothes, which of course means she is Jewish. The point of the film is how these little stereotypical things become the whole basis for judging others. <br /> <br /> If he has a Lisp, he must be gay. If he has long hair, he smokes dope. If he is Hispanic, he has a knife ... and if he has round black glasses and is poorly built, he must be Jewish. These statements sound equally (un) plausible to me. If the conclusion to which people jumped in Focus was reasonable, the whole point of the story would be lost.
