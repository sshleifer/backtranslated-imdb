Recovery is an incredibly moving job that overcomes the devastating effects of a brain injury not just on the individual but on the entire family. Tony Marchant's drama depicts a family in crisis in a realistic manner, without resorting to sermons or Hollywood sappy endings. <br /> <br /> Highly praised David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible achievements. Before I saw the drama, I had suspected that some of their previous relationship in Blackpool would be perfused on screen - but it never does. None of the actors can be recognized from any previous work, and I have not seen any of them as an actor who played a role throughout the 90 minutes. Also, the son of Harry Treadaway, who was about to start his own life at the university, was awesome - throughout the play he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role of a houseman. > <br /> Sometimes almost every character in the drama is unsympathetic. As a spectator, I wanted to give each of them a good appetite to wake up in the real world, stop moping and adapt to the rotted but very recent changes in their lives. But under the same circumstances, I see myself as any of them - switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip, desperation to flee to anything, including behavior that is completely different from me. It's the show's biggest strength - the truth, with no sugar coating - to force us all to think about what we could do under the same circumstances. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult, but absolutely observable show. I hope it somehow manages to be shown in the US.
