Of course my assessment for that is not the assumption that it is comparable to the noble horrors of people like Argento, but with other 70s, on a low budget, in motion and in this department it is really a classic. The lack of money shows (is not that too much of an interest for someone)? one moment. Crap, but it's just non-stop crap, crap in your face, and while this is sometimes a bit of a pugnacious thing, this is a must for anyone with an idea of ​​what I'm talking about. This crazy little movie, filled with crazy characters, is sometimes pretty insane and meant for fun and fun.
