For some perverted reason that is best known, these IMDb boards do not seem to call the great Billy Wilder a co-scriptwriter on at least two of his first classics (this and Ninotchka), with each buff recognizing the wilder hand at work can. By chance, this was the first time he had teamed up with Charles Brackett (who gets a loan), and it was a great start. One commentator has noted how satisfying it is to see these types of films in old-fashioned cinemas, and I can not agree anymore. In Paris, one of the smaller revival houses in one of his Salles shows a more or less uninterrupted Lubitsch retrospective, and I am pleased to announce that this has played a very grateful audience throughout the age spectrum, though I doubt if one was actually alive from them it was first published in 1938. The famous Wilder the meet-cute is particularly tasty here, when millionaire, but careful-with-it Cooper tries to buy half a pajama set in a department store on the Riviera and meets sell resistance Claudette Colbert appears and agrees to buy another half. The gag gets milked even more when the manager, having exhausted the chain of command in the store, has to call the owner, who is in bed, and lets know that he too only wears the top half of the pajamas. The movie is full of sights like this one with verbal joke, which makes it almost perfect. Claudette Colbert is just great and is greatly supported by Edward Everett Horton as her impoverished titled father. David Niven in the fourth installment has some weird "business," like Franklin Pangborn and when Gary Cooper does not lack his role, since he does well the verbal skill and sophisticated characters that Wilder scripts have challenged at this point in his career You do not have everything and what you do is almost perfect.
