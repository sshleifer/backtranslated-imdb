I think some people miss big sci-fi stories because they predict part of the future. In no other movie I can remember, it was predicted that disaster would occur when the Space Shuttle studied Halley's Comet. Some differences were: The "Churchill" (the shuttle in the film) actually went to the comet, the "Challenger" was only in a low Earth orbit; The "Churchill" was burned out inside while the "Challenger" exploded - hey, the vampires had to return to Earth. A lot of similarity (and that's always bad luck!) Both had mixed male / female crews - the legend of Halley's comet and its disaster continues! this movie that was not told before. As a space / science fiction / horror / sex movie alone, it did not offer anything really new, but as with all good dishes, the combination counts. And, taken together, this was a highly original and satisfying combination. <br /> <br /> I just wish Mathilda May would drain her victims through another part of her body!
