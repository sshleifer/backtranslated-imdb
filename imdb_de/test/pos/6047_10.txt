Jack Webb's portrayal of the naval drill instructor who designs new recruits in basic training requires no interpretation. Straightforward, direct, forward, all are applicable to this classic. At a time when analyzing the statements of our leaders is a necessity to understand what they are saying, this is film that plays no tricks with our language or our moral fiber. Right and wrong are clear and easy to define. If you like a clear, well-understood dialogue in a disciplined military environment, this movie should suit you.
