Not everyone likes this movie. It's still one of the best "you have to think" films about Satanism ever made. The fact that there is no MTV era is a jump or jerk every seven minutes, it's irrelevant. As someone who actually KNOWS Satanists, the (spoiler alert!) Part of the movie where the Brotherhood exchanges their old bodies for the kids before puberty. The section in which Strother Martin staged the conversion (second spoiler alert) is almost hyperreal, as he uses few special effects, a trademark of this film. McEveety rarely had a large budget, but was often effective. It also worked in this case.
