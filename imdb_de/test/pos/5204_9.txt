I have just seen this movie in the hope of seeing an accurate representation of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century. I got what I expected and much more. Just to think, I came across this movie by accident, before I had never heard of it. It's a German film from 1993, so I'm not surprised it's almost unknown to the modern American public. It's a shame, because this is really a remarkable movie. I dare say he's as good as no better than Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and All quiet on the Western Front. All are iconic war films. <br /> <br /> 1942: The Second World War is in full swing. Nazi Germany has overrun mainland Europe and parts of North Africa, then Adolf Hitler orders the invasion of the Soviet Union. A fateful move that finally condemns Nazi Germany to defeat. At the beginning of the invasion, the invasion proceeds well, and the German armies conquer large parts of the Soviet territory. In Stalingrad, a city of great symbolic and strategic value, a critical battle ensues. The battle soon becomes a bloodbath of epic proportions, a nightmare for German and Russian soldiers fighting. Shortly before the capture of the city, the Germans are suddenly attacked by the Russians, who eventually cut off the entire German 6th Army in Stalingrad. To make matters worse, the Russian winter brings unbelievable suffering to the Germans. This whole battle is seen through the eyes of some young German soldiers fighting for their survival, not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions, but also against their own sadistic officers, who only care about medals and fame, and the Generals who care little for the world average foot soldier. <br /> <br /> This movie will haunt me for a while. The German soldiers on whom the film focuses are so young and naive, then they are deprived of their humanity and their minds, and they are truly sorry that they are not often portrayed by the demonic Nazis in the film. Everything they fought for is no longer important, and everything they believed in was shattered, and after we had fought a brutal fight against the Russians in Stalingrad, we see that they worsened further with the onset of winter Freezing many people lead. The Battle & Winter scenes were like a terrible nightmare, but it felt so real too. It is amazing, in the beginning we see sturdy young men in the prime of their lives, and in the end they are a shell of their former self, freed from everything. After these men had suffered so much carnage, they lost their will to live and it was really sad. When there is finally a moment of hope, they are betrayed by Hitler, who ultimately leaves these men in a terrible death. This is just another crime by Hitler, in which he gives up the men who fought for him to be slaughtered by the Russians. <br /> <br /> A good anti-war movie shows the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. The Battle for the Tractor Factory Sequence The next thing in the world is hell, but that's how The Battle for Stalingrad really was. The German and Russian soldiers were represented with humanity, only the bad apples (especially on the German side) have the men doomed to failure. The bottom line is that this movie is amazing because we see men physically and emotionally collapsing during the war. We all have our limitations and these men have been pushed far beyond their limits in the deadliest battle of our time. What the average foot soldier in Stalingrad endured was unimaginable. Even if they had survived everything they had seen and done, they would have drawn them for life. <br /> <br /> Stalingrad shows us why war is hell and how hell looks like.
