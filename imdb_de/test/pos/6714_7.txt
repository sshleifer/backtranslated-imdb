No, "Lifeforce" is not a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> However, it's an average movie with good effects and a captivating storyline (and of course Mathilda May). It can actually be one of my favorite SF / horror flicks, for the simple reason that they are trying to fight through the science of space vampires. How often do you see that? Not even in "Alien" (the SF / horror movie of all time) does science even go down in history. In "Lifeforce" they try to establish an unreasonable world. <br /> <br /> Well, do I think that she is successful? I think the film has the theme of a massive ensemble ensemble that keeps Hooper so busy keeping up to date that viewers have to focus on more than one "villager", and there are too many car tours. <Br /> <br /> To be honest, the movie is a feast for the eyes and fun to watch. But there's a lot of potential here for a superior remake to achieve what Hooper has been trying to do, and really create a powerful, scary SF / horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the remake still happens, I demand that Mathilda May have a cameo.
