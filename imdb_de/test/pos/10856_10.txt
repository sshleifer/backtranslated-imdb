Of the 24 best lesbian films in my library, I have to call this film the number one of all time. This movie will go down in history as the best of its genre. It's a story about a girl (Rachael Stirling) that turns from wealth to rags and rags to wealth, with her first love (Keeley Hawes) invading her life. In the 1890s, it has a Victorian backdrop, making it an ideal setting for some of the best entertainment in the industry. This film has saved no expense on music and costumes, and the make-up that Rachael and Keeley wore on the stage in the halls only helped to increase the variety of the movie can guarantee that this movie will not only put you in Astonishment, but your attention will be maintained in all three episodes. This movie is played and enjoyed for decades. The un-rated DVD Collector version is a must-have for anyone's library. Rachael Stirling and Keeley Hawes were the best choices for casting in these two roles, and they played them very well.
