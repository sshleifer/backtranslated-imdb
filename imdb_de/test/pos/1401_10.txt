Sure, most people will call "Island of the Fishmen" a stupid and dirty hokum, but honestly, can you name another movie that brings THESE many exciting topics? This Italian gem stands for pure entertainment, featuring voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutated fish creatures, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, treasure hunt, a remote island of death traps and totally crazy scientists! All that and much more in a simple movie? Yes, please! Consistent opponents of Italian horror cinema may easily call this film a cheap exploitation version of "The Island of Dr. Moreau," but the truth is that this is so much more! "Island of the Fishmen" offers thrills and adventures from start to finish with surprisingly compelling special effects and amazingly stylish camera work. The story begins promisingly with a small group of shipwreck survivors rippling a tropical island ashore. They meet the sadistic Edmond Rackham, who rules a native tribe and a legion of genetically-bred amphibious monsters living in the marshes of the island. There are so many twists and extra dealings in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary, but, believe me, this gem is worth a look. Sergio Martino proves once again that he is an ingenious filmmaker with the talent of being both commercial and creative. He uses the beautiful island location very well and also the interior looks very impressive. The stunning underwater footage and imaginative scenery truly enhance this movie beyond the normal standards of late 1970's exploitation. I do not fully understand why Roger Corman reworked the original and released it on the American market under a different title ("Screamers") because there are only a few elements that can be improved. The performers are all Sergio Martino regulars (with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton is a neatly supportive rule) and give great performances. If you can get hold of the recently restored German version, you will receive additional action for fifteen minutes without interruption. See it!
