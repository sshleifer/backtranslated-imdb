The Gymnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber portrays Jane Hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist. <br /> <br /> The promotional material makes you believe that the plot depends on Jane's accidental reunion with a former teammate. Although this meeting takes place, this plot is secondary to the main storyline, which includes Jane, her husband, and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). The two women develop an act, as performed by Cirque de Soleil. The two complement each other - Jane has more experience with heights and tremendous upper body strength. Serena is more elegant and artistic, though she is obviously also capable of incredible physical exploits. <br /> <br /> The film works because we can understand how Jane would turn to Addie, who is caring and compassionate, while Jane's husband does. She was a matter of course for the many years of her marriage. <br /> <br /> Both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and Dreya has a slim body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. They are clearly doing their bit and the results are so great that we can believe they would be a success in Las Vegas or elsewhere. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension between the women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while floating in the air. A woman with a neglected husband and an attractive partner creates an explosive situation that is not resolved in a neat and tidy manner. <br /> <br /> Of the six films we've seen at Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this was the best. It works on DVD and is definitely worth a search on a big or small screen. NOTE: Stay for the credits!
