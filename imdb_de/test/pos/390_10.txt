Cam Archer's lyrical Bobbycrush boldly captures the bewildering kaleidoscope, a youthful desire, with a lush rendering (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt) that is more mood than narrative. Somewhere between documentary and dream, Bobbycrush recalls the ingenuity of early Todd Haynes and the vivacious hyperrealism of Gus van Sant. With Sand, Glamor and Heartbreak, it's a bit like the movie in which Sonic Youth plays bubblegum pop.
