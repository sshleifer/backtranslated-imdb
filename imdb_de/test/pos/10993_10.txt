In the wilderness where the Hollywood Productions have lately been created, this film is truly MANNA FROM HEAVEN !!! <br /> <br /> In what could best be described as a "cute" movie, about 350 years of film acting experience (okay - give or take 100 years!) happily lights up the screen to tell a story about cheating, regret and salvation about a Catholic family in Buffalo, NY. <br /> <br /> Burton Sisters' quiet, small independent film by FIVE SISTERS PRODUCTIONS COMPANY is really well positioned to find its place in the "feel-good movie". He will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart while renewing your faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> From the spectacular footage of the opening scene in Buffalo, NY, to the end credits, the film creates a story that could have been told by any family anywhere. But somehow this special gathering of family and "family by association" in a small, unassuming house in Buffalo more than fits the bill. If you've never been to Buffalo, you'll leave the theater with the idea of ​​"slipping away" for a visit! Images of the landmarks of the city and the surrounding area help to give the film a rustic, down to earth tone - which fits in well. The tranquil beauty of the "Queen City of the Great Lakes" compliments and does not distract from the narrative that is told. If only more films used the natural beauty of this country's "second cities" instead of going somewhere to a stage, the end result would be so much more believable. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Shirley Jones, Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malick, Jill Eickenberry and the rest of the ensemble prove once again that the true talent of Hollywood's "Flair of the Week" lasts anytime! <br /> <br /> GO THE FILM! <br /> <br /> You have been hiking in the desert of Hollywood for too long!
