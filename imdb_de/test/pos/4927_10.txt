CAUTION: Potential spoilers! <br /> <br /> "Steven Spielberg presents tiny toon adventures" has always been one of my favorite cartoons that grew up in my childhood (the hell it still is). And this movie perfectly captures everything I like about the show and summarizes it in full length. <br /> <br /> Beautifully animated by the Tokyo Movie Shinsa Studio (WB outsourced every "Tiny Toons" project and this was it) The film begins at the end of the school year at Acme Looniversity, the renowned cartoon college where Buster and Babs Bunny (no relationship) and her teenage teens with peers from the masters of animated madness Looney learn tunes After the last bell, the film splits into five separate acts Buster entangles Babs in a fight against water guns, with a bursting dam Buster, Babs and Elmyra's dog Byron pour into a fallen picnic table in search of deep South adventures, and Plucky Duck persuades Hamton Pig and his family to take him to HappyWorldLand, "The Luckiest Place in the Western Hemisphere". but he has to settle for a painstaking drive and the danger of a trailer with a chainsaw. "Elmyra s Cat Furball finally runs away, but she is not scared ... not when there are many "Aminals" to play with at Acme Safari Park. Fifi la Fume dedicates her summer to chasing down her heartbreaker, movie star Johnny Pew, hoping to get an autograph. Of course, the hotel he's in is almost impenetrable. And Shirley McLoon sets up fortune-telling on the Acme Acres Boardwalk ... and leaves her day off alone when Fowlmouth takes her to see the horror movie "Skunkophobia". <br /> <br /> All of these story lines are almost funny, and in the end, some even overlap. The only complaint I have with this film is that it does not take full advantage of the Tiny Toons lineup. Dizzy Devil and Mary Melody have only one scene. Gogo Dodo appears only at the beginning and end of the movie and Montana Max. Sweetie, Calamity Coyote and Little Beeper are nowhere to be found. Nevertheless, they are excusable mistakes in an otherwise perfect movie. This movie is pretty rare today, being over 12 years old and never released to DVD to my knowledge, but I strongly suggest you track it down - anyone who is a fan of the Warner Bros. animation, either classic or contemporary , NEEDS see this movie
