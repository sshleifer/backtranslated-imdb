Ghilli is Vijay's best movie and one of the biggest hits of his career. Since I had not seen the Telegu movie, I could enjoy this movie even more. The story is about a girl who wants to escape the clutches of a man local idiot who wants to marry her by force. Since he is an idiot, no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay, who came to play a Kabaddi match, sees it and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how Vijay helps her and how the girl escapes the clutches of the bat and the political friends of the bat's father. The movie has many moments on the edge of the thriller and will keep the viewer in touch until the very end. Vijay is as always very good in the role of Kabadhi. Trisha, Ashish Vidyarthi, the group of Vijay friends, have all done their job competently. Particularly noteworthy is the villain of the movie Prakashraj. The character of the villain was properly etched out, and Prakashraj has portrayed him very well. Surprisingly, for the first time, I felt sorry for the villain for the first time. The dialogue "Hello Chellam" has really attracted the masses. The music of Vidyasagar is brilliant and the song 'Apadi Podu' is a rage everywhere. Harani has to deal with such a beautiful Masala film that will please not only the tough Vijay fans, but also the general Tamil film audience worldwide.
