This is as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> These are six episodes that (briefly) trace what life could have been like when dinosaurs ruled the earth. Made in the style of a nature documentary, this show foregoes talking heads, instead giving us the good stuff with the dinosaurs trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not a true documentary, because nothing of what we have. Look at the screen for sure that you can attest to any certainty, but it is a very good and entertaining guess , Here is a show that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way where they do not eat people. This is a show that should be shown to any kid who loves dinosaurs as it gives them the OH WOW factor to learn more. It will also keep hell out of them and you. <br /> <br /> See this. If you love animal shows or nature or science or Disney True Life Adventures (except that no one really gets killed), or just have a really good trip going there, get yourself a copy. Your brain will thank you.
