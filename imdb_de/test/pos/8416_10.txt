It was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie. The director focused on the main theme without venturing into subplots (the doctor's family or stories of other hospital patients) so typical of Bollywood assembly line products. He kept the narrative simple and made sure that all actors are true to the characters they are meant to represent. The rustic nature of the grandfather in the clinic, the cold and emotionless behavior of the surgeon, the eagerness of the social worker gave the film a sense of authenticity. I am also glad that the director was not tempted to add songs or special effects and reduce them to the level of Anand or Safar. A few scenes towards the end of the film, like the boy visiting other blind children and the workplace of a blind worker, as well as the last scene of the boy clapping and chirping the birds, make your eyes cloudy /> Many Bollywood players do not know that the members of the Oscar Committee appreciate the simplicity of the theme and the genuineness and brevity of the film more than the glamor and glamor. Shwaas is certainly a better nominee than Lagaan, who dealt with a topic that had already been put to death. No MPAA member will willingly endure 4 hours of jingo drama and a lot of song and dance. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to more films by director Sandeep Sawant in the future.
