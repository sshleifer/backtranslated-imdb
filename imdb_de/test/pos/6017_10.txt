I see this on Comcast On-Demand. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this musical, I am amazed at the songs ... one show stopper after another. <br /> <br /> This interpretation is magical for me. The songs are sparkling ... the vocals, orchestrations and choreography are amazing for a "Made for TV" movie ... better than many stage versions I've ever seen makes no sense She's mom. Her voice is brilliant yet full of pathos of the stage mother who lives through her daughters. I still end up crying when she finally has her fame no matter how faded that fame is. <br /> <br /> The Tulsa / Louise duet / dance is now in progress. Fabulous. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondheim is the king of music theater. His lyrics roll like silk from his tongue ... Styne's music is perhaps the best ever written for the stage / screen. <br /> <br /> Thank god we recorded this masterpiece of the American Musical Theater on DVD.
