As a longtime resident of Western Pa I have an in-depth knowledge of this subject and found it REGFRESHING so authentically recorded on film! Kudos to the producers of this epic !!! And what a great legacy for the schoolchildren in the years to come. <br /> <br /> The attention to detail and the realistic portrayal of this complex network of events make it a unique production /> Spectators are fascinated by the plot and fascinated by storytelling. <br /> <br /> Grahame Greene is great as a presenter. <br /> <br /> BRAVO !!!
