Cowboys and Indians is an excellent movie. Writing, acting, governing could not have been better. This story was bound to be told, and this group of talented individuals and teams did an excellent job. Stories like these are not pleasant, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist around the world. I hope that when this movie is seen, attitudes and prejudices will change. A film that can do that is rarely special. Andrew Berzins is an excellent author, and his talents and expertise in this area have prevailed in this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for sharing this story! <br /> <br /> Ruby
