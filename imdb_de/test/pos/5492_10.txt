One of the best films I've seen ... Good script, original plot by a man persecuted for the murder of JFK when he was ordered to protect him this past cold November day in 1963 to assassinate the current president. The intelligence officer loses his partner on his way to the crazy gunmen who are planning, lying and murdering everyone on his path who is in the way of his mission. <br /> <br /> The film is accompanied by an unforgettable score and a modest but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood, showing how difficult it is to have a romantic life in this kind of work. Malchovich is great, sure that many other contestants could have played the role he played, but how many could act with so much cunning and intelligence that he showed in the film? Needless to say, I thought this was a great movie ... everytime it's on TV, I have to see it ... and I own it on DVD! I'm a big Eastwood fan, this has only boosted his already fabulous career and Malchovich's best role so far! <br /> <br />
