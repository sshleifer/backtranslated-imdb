"Black Water" is one of the most tense films I've seen in a long time. The story moves quickly as she pursues three tourists (all great actors) on a tour with a Butch tour guide on a small boat in a swamp. Soon after anchoring in a remote area of ​​the swamp, they are turned over by something huge in the water. <br /> <br /> The three of them are in a hurry to turn into a tall tree when they spot a crocodile attacking them. For the next two days, they must desperately try to escape from the evil eye of the crocodile, and he does not seem to want to leave. The movie just goes a little bit, but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget? It's much better than "Primeval" and other crocodile / underwater predator thrillers. The excitement is great and all three leads offer great benefits. The movie was really shattering and had a deep impression of claustrophobic fear in me. Apparently on true events.
