The worst movie ever? BARELY!!! This is one of the best animated films I have ever seen! It has performances by all the great characters from the animated series Rainbow Brite. Very safe for little kids and the colors catch their attention like no other! There is a wicked princess who tries to steal the diamond planet Spectra, which in turn would cause all life on earth to come to a standstill. This tells the story of how Rainbow Brite and her new friend Krys are able to stop the evil plan of the princess and bring life and color back to earth. It is the proof that children can make a difference! Rainbow Brite will live forever.
