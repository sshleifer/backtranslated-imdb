Why did not critics like this movie? I do not get it. This is easily my favorite effort by Clive Barker. "Hellraiser" is a bit too rough on the edges (the movie just never leaves the dumb house) and, let's just say, "Lord of Illusions" does not move at all !!! I have loved Barker's writing for years, especially his "Books of the Blood". Terrisch entertaining. He has a vicious side that is completely different than a Stephen King. He mixes freely with his own homosexuality and strange religious and occult elements. I love love, love, love. However, I also recognize that Barker is both a dark fantasy author and a horror writer. And fantasy is just not my bag. Put me to sleep. Always has I also think that Barker works best with short stories. His novels tend to be a bit wandering. That was my experience when I tried to read "The Damnation Game". It started well. Then I thought on 100 pages: "Where is it going?" because it did not work everywhere. <br /> <br /> I read "Cabal" (the book Nightbreed is based on) and thought it was good. I especially like the elaboration of Decker's character. The way the mask talked to him and controlled him. I like it, as Barker simply presents it. Black and white. There it is. He gives him a simplicity that is attractive and believable. When asked why Decker kills, he says (simply) "Because I like it." Probably something that Jeffrey Dahmer has said at some point. <br /> <br /> But actually I liked the movie Nightbreed better than Cabal. I love the visual attention to detail that Barker gives to his films. LOVE IT. I just think it's beautiful. Lord of Illusions also had some of it. Some drawings at the beginning, during the nightbreed credit sequence. It's like a whole vocabulary that Barker developed only for the Nightbreed world. I would like to know how much his pure design was. I know that he is an amazing artist who has his own style and his own language as an artist. <br /> <br /> Nightbreed is (I think) also the most entertaining movie by BArker. It moves very fast. Well done It does not pull like Lord of Illusions a bit. Very fast. Everything is just perfect. It also works as a fantastic and scary little Slasher movie. The stuff with the murderer in the beginning, who kills the family and later torments the old man in the store, is really scary stuff. This mask is scary. I would be curious if Barker has designed it that way. It's not just a fancy Jason or "Scream" mask. Something about it is really disturbing. <br /> <br /> That's a great movie strip anyway. Be sure to check it if you have not seen it. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror movies of all time. In my opinion, Clive Baker is the best. It is scary and violent, be warned
