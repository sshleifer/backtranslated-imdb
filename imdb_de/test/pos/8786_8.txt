Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is unjustly accused of sabotaging a hanger making planes for war. He sets off, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) on the way and she accompanies him to find the real criminals and bring them to justice. <br /> <br /> Much is wrong with this movie. Robert Cummings was a good actor, but he is completely wrong in this role. Priscilla Lane is pretty, but never a good actress. History does not make much sense (and takes longer than necessary); it carries its patriotism a bit (but WHAT was done when World War II was in full swing) and there is no end. It should not work, but it works. <br /> <br /> It's full of bizarre lines and characters that will surely pique your interest. <br /> <br /> For example: Lane says to Cummings (while they are falling in love), "I wish I could have met you a hundred years ago" (???? !!!!); Lane pays a villain for lunch and Cummings and Lane briefly join a circus troupe during a run. Also, the direction of Hitchcock was (as always) just great - he takes some really amazing shots and sequences - especially the highlight of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic movie by Hitchcock, but still very good and well worth a visit.
