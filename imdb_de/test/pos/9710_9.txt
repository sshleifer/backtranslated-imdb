Yes. Bam cried a few times and Englund also. And most likely you too. The entire cast is back in action and Knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of kinky retards (I mean that in the best possible way). I thought at first, maybe Bam or Steve-O were the main people ... no, the captain is now Johnny. Do not get me wrong, everyone, and I mean, everyone is great in this movie! Right from the beginning you are laughing and believe me, do not plan to rest your smile. I personally think that the movie definitely has better moments than the first one. You know, when you go to the theater, and you do not want to have any high expectations ... well, this movie goes beyond expectations. If you love Jackass, you can respond with gigantic expectations. No matter what you make you laugh. If you do not laugh, it's probably because someone has a gun in their face that tells you when you're laughing, that you're dying, or you're embarrassed for the sound of your laughter for breakfast and Jack left the city. I just have to say, prepare to have a sore face after the movie. :)
