An entertaining first draft for "North By Northwest", "Saboteur", has some wonderful Hitchcockian moments (one of the best comes at a table when the hero is asked by a woman who has not yet seen him handcuffed to give her.) a plate that tries to do that, he also drops a knife on the floor and stands out even more!), but suffers from a badly chosen line (whether he is giving patriotic speeches, Romping around with Priscilla Lane, joking or trying to look worried, Robert Cummings is made of wood, and a lack of really different rogues (oh, there are rogues, many of them, but hardly anyone has enough time for the screen).
