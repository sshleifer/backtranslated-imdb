I just went to YouTube to watch this Oscar-nominated short by Richard Condie. I had previously seen his funny first steps there. In this play a few Scrabble. The woman keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but E on his side. The wife leaves for a while to suck her bed and bath (!) Before catching her husband looking at her side. Shortly before, the husband catches a television program called "Sawing for Teens," where the stars saw something and the husband gets his own saw. This program is interrupted by a special report on a nuclear war (the newsreader is a skeleton here), when everyone panics, though the husband fell asleep during that time and believes that a parade is taking place while he and his wife continue discussing the game ... There are many other bizarre things before the touching end comes. Very funny and worth seeing for every animation fan. I can not wait to see more animated shorts by Mr. Condie ...
