The Spanish director Luis Buñuel had a nearly 50-year career, from 1929 to 1977. His best films were probably those he had made during his exile in Mexico - from the late forties to the early '60s. There he had to struggle with very cheap budgets and work in an industry that was mainly interested in presenting commercial films to an uncomplicated audience, but somehow he managed to create interesting, thought-provoking films that outlasted time. This film is based on a novel by the Spanish writer Benito Perez Galdos - and the adaptation is quite faithful, even though the setting is now in the early 20th century rather than in Spain in the early 20th century. The protagonist Nazarin is a priest who seeks to live a life as faithful as the one prescribed by Christ. The question that many ask is whether such an endeavor is possible without bringing hostility, incomprehension and ridicule of others. Anyway, he suffers a lot of indignation, but remains stubborn (until the controversial final shot). I think Buñuel wanted to show Nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps unintentionally his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) seems admirable. Definitely a great movie.
