For the first time I saw this with a friend. It ended in the hands of his parents by accident. some video library / bike repair shop !! went bankrupt and such treats were available. We saw it twice in a row and pants are almost wet, how hard we laughed. <br /> <br /> I've seen historical documents like Ninja Mission and Plan 9 from space, and they're still a good runner-up compared to this one. <br /> <br /> Almost 15 years after his first contact, he is now considered the best cult movie ever (in my circles). I have shown it to all my friends ... We have a tradition of searching for films in the same category: the unalterable one. <br /> <br /> It can not be explained or discussed in any category. Normally, because every scene, every take, every movement contains at least one error in terms of editing, dialogue, direction, and so on. <br /> <br /> For any cult movie fan, this is the ultimate prize, the gem of all gems. <br /> <br /> Raiting: As for the craft, it can not be rated as it would even be an insult to homemade videos of birthdays and weddings. <br /> <br /> For the sheer pleasure of being the funniest movie I've ever seen; funnier than any comedy ever made from the past or present. Anything less than 10/10 should be considered an insult to the good feeling of humus.
