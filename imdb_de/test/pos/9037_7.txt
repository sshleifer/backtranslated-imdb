Look at these faces next to the entrance to the prison. They are not the faces of Hollywood extras. Someone in production was really smart when they wanted to film to Oxford, Mississippi, because you can not get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot. Look at the narrow, dusty streets, the frozen earth underneath, and the skeletons just barely hanging. No wonder these faces look hard and unyielding. They only reflect the soil from which they sprout. Old Lucas (Hernandez) has a better fear for his life, but then he springs from the same hard earth. <br /> <br /> The film works because it tells a good story that does not preach, is sentimentalized and even a little exciting. Old Lucas is not very nice. He is a victim and we understand, but he is also haughty and rude. Wisely, the script refuses to sweeten it. In this way, we are forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on the less sympathetic. The script wisely avoids dealing directly with racism, as it tends to be preaching and less effective. Instead, we are shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a terrible death. Through our shared instinct to achieve justice, the effects of racism are revealed, a much more effective way. It also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer easier to understand because they are otherwise part of the Jim Crow system. <br /> <br /> Note that the movie does not attack segregation. It is doubtful that old Lucas wants to mix with white anyway, and there is no indication that even attorney Stevens (Brian) wants to go beyond the color combination, except that justice is achieved. No, the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future, symbolized by the child (Jarman) whose head is not yet filled with "ideas". He is not exactly friends with Lucas, but he has discovered widespread humanity to befriend after falling into the frozen stream. The last line of the dialogue also shows that he belongs to his uncle, the lawyer, and not to his hidden parents (the table scene is important and can easily be overlooked). The lawyer may not enter a future civil rights march, but the boy might. That's the realistic hopeful side of the movie. <br /> <br /> In this short period of three years (1949-51), there were a number of films with a racist background, (The Well, No Way Out, Home of the Brave, Lost Borders). Even the distanced MGM came into the mix with this little gem. Unfortunately, the McCarthy purges in Hollywood put an end to the "problematic" films that may not end the Cold War. Still, it's worth catching up with any of them, not only because they're good movies, but also because they're still relevant even after 60 years and Jim Crow.
