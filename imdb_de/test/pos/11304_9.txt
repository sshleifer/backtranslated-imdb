I have to say that Barbie Movies has generally impressed me. I have a 5-year-old Barbie fanatic niece who watches her all the time. It's needless to say that I've seen a lot of Barbie during the holidays, but I'm not fed up with them. This movie, Optical has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the animation of the characters has improved with every new movie. I especially noticed a significant improvement in the animation of Barbie's hair in this film. It has a nice selection of classical music and I think it's great because it introduces a new generation to the classics. This movie is worth it, especially if you have young helpers. They are entertained for hours!
