"Best in Show" acts as a kind of midpoint between "Waiting for Guffman" and "A Mighty Wind" and features a dog show and the various people bringing their dog friends. Some are weird, others are crazy and different, but they all make the movie good. Director Christopher Guest is especially funny as Gay Harlan Pepper and is very keen to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Bob Balaban are also doing great jobs (I can not imagine that they will not do good jobs, at least not in a Christopher Guest movie). As someone who has never participated in a dog show, this movie is my biggest attention. You sure look neat.
