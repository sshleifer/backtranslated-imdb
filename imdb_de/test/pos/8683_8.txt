All I can say is that I was expecting a wicking film and "Blurred" surprised me on the positive way. Very nice teenage film. All these situations are normal in school life, so all I can say is that it all reminded me of my school days, and sometimes it's good to watch these kinds of movies because we talk and bring ourselves back to those golden years when we were young Let's also think better about how we need to understand our children, because in the past we were just as they would like to be in the present. Try this movie and you will be very satisfied. At the same time you will also have the guarantee that your time was not wasted.
