This movie was a morbid, cute, cute, romantic comedy, the kind of movie I do not usually like, but it was just cute enough to interest me. It was really funny in a moment (probably why I liked it) and then just as serious the next moment. Besides, Ellen had it with me and I always had a soft spot for her. <br /> <br /> Basically, the owner of a bookstore, Helen (Kate Capshaw), finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her shop. She thinks it is for her and goes crazy to find out who sent her. It has somehow isolated itself from the world, so it really throws it for a loop. At some point, almost everyone who communicates with her finds this letter and they all get mixed signals that make some really funny moments enjoy it and highly recommend it.
