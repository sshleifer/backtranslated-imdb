Bon Voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the necessary stupidity of a comedy with just enough sobriety to actively engage viewers in the outcome. Most importantly, the film is historically instructive. it captures the tension of the so-called "fake war" and later the flight of the French aristocracy from Paris before the German attack. Bon Voyage, however, is not a "war movie". It is a comedy about the life of a handful of people before extraordinary times. Bon Voyage conveys the chaos, confusion and emotional confusion of a nation on the brink of collapse and the broad spectrum of French responses to the new political order. This film is a comedy that entertains the audience, a romance that cleverly uses many clich√©s, and the story of a handful of people whose nation collapses around them.
