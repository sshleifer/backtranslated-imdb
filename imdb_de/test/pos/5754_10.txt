I own this movie on DVD and have watched it about 10 times and it is still funny. The jokes never get boring and I often laugh at inappropriate moments, just thinking about them. The premise is that Richard and Eddie of Bottom are famous for having the cheapest hotel in the UK alongside a nuclear power plant. They desperately need money, and if a hidden movie star comes to their whereabouts, it could be that he's at it. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and not get bored or disgusted, the humor must be first. Some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy it. But overall, it's a great movie.
