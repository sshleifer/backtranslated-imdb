The only complaint I heard about this movie was that it was slow. Maybe that's the point. The two characters clash relentlessly, and the slow build-up of tensions between them leads to anxiety. The intricate and subtle gestures and the minimal dialogue bring tension to a point where an otherwise normal argument shakes the audience. Istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy, the scenery is fascinating and the action is exciting - not in this "look, the hero has blown up another car and now he flies his motorcycle". I shuddered as the characters moved into each other's balls, watching as the fog flooded Istanbul.
