If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done often, this is a fun and enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds are so detailed and also very bold colors. The writing is razor-sharp, and the visual gags, especially Daffy, who constantly blows his head, are brilliantly timed. I really loved the clashes between Daffy and Bugs and bugs win every time. I also love that Daffy is really greedy and uncomfortable while being overbearingly funny. I prefer him if he is manic, but he's also having fun here. Bugs is still his charming and mischievous self, and Elmer is funny, if pretty stupid. In short, this is absolutely awesome and actually my personal favorite of Hunting Trilogy, in terms of entertainment value. 10/10 Bethany Cox
