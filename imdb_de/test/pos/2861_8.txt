With Nurse Betty (2000), renowned indie filmmaker Neil LaBute (In the Men's Society, Her Friends and Neighbors) makes his breakthrough in the highly budgeted (Betty's $ 24 million compared to the company's unclear $ 25,000) , and yet remains true to its roots. While his cast now consists of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains as bizarre and bizarre as his first two moves, proving that he may be the next is big deal. Sister Betty is one of the darkest comedies that has been addressed by a mainstream audience for years. Given the moderate box office and critical success, moviegoers may not be as stupid and brainwashed as we thought. The story follows (figuratively as well as literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger), who fell in love with a handsome soap star from afar (As Good As It Gets Greg Kinnear), but in a loveless marriage with a slimy one Car dealer (Aaron) is caught Eckhart, who made his big debut in the company). When her husband is brutally murdered by two hitters (Freeman and Rock), she is shocked and carelessly sets off to Hollywood to meet her object of affection. When Freeman and Rock find out that the car they took with them contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they also hit the road and it comes to a shame. Fans of LaBute's earlier work may find it hard to figure out how this could possibly be the same type that staged In the Company of Men - a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs joking around a great colleague - but if you think about it thinking, the connection is pretty clear: In Company, a vulnerable woman does not know she's ruthlessly exploited. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife does not know that the man she's chasing does not consider her sincere worship anything but a joke. Some may wonder if LaBute is actually a misogyny - considering that its recurrent theme involves the overthrow of innocent women. Personally, however, I believe that he is committed to the defense of the fair sex and accuses the abuser in his pictures much harder than the abused. One of the many attractions of this film is that its absurdity is full: most directors, when working with a script like this, would leave the story behind two hitmen chasing a woman pursuing a dream. But LaBute knows better and has one of the hitmen (Freeman) obsessively dropped for Betty. This was an interesting role for Freeman as it allowed him to play his "This Is Last Time" brand (see Unforgiven, Se7en and Stinker from Hard Rain, 1998); The side cast also includes stars like the famous spinner Crispin Glover, Allison Janney and Kathleen Wilhoite from Mad About You. The script written by first-time visitors John C. Richards and James Flamberg is hugely exaggerated (honestly: Have you ever seen a comedy - or any other movie - anyway) in which a man is penned? his own dining room?). It could be argued that the end is a bit too perfect, but it's really not worth the effort to do anything trivial in the movie's greatness. If Sister Betty is a sign of what LaBute has in store for us next, you can bet I'll be there for whatever he wants. <br /> <br /> Note: A-
