Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, The show begins with this documentary. It is divided into three chapters, each arranged chronologically. The first introduces classical physics and refers to Einstein. The second study deepens quantum physics and goes into string theory. The last reveals the all-theory ... The difficult terms used here are introduced in a very simple way with everyday objects; although you must believe them without testing yourself, if you are not a scientist (and even if you are a scientist !!). The film is not a masterpiece because of its fabulous technique or the way it is produced. What really imports is the story and WHAT A STORY !!!
