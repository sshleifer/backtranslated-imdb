Saboteur is a film from 1942, which was partly aimed at receiving American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. The protagonists are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck wanted in the roles, which gave the film more stature. This is still a good movie, in which Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane give the characters their own style. As in other Hitchcock films, we see the director's disregard for the social addict and the wealthy. He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upper-class people, who at the same time smiled guilty at democratic values ​​and concepts until they proved innocent. These top crust traitors are the last to be persecuted or even suspected by the police. Hitchcock had a lifetime of mistrust of the police. He wanted to raise the normal guy, the bastard and the guy who does not take himself too seriously. You can see that he wants to have Gary Cooper as an icon in the Frank Capra form. Nevertheless, Bob Cummings shapes the next door next door and works well in the role. Priscilla Lane, as a spunky female lead, is the all-American woman who behaves nicely in the test. Robert Cummings is framed as armor worker Barry Kane for a bombing that kills his best friend. This leads to a cross-country chase scene reminiscent of other Hitchcock heroes on the run. Hitchcock reiterates some of the familiar formulas from previous films - the reluctant woman involved in the plot, such as: Madeleine Carroll in the 39 steps and risked his life to escape the authorities who are on his trail. We see scenes of America as Kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombs he is accused of. We see rivers, bridges, backwoods huts, truckers, the Hoover Dam and finally New York City. New York is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we travel from the Rockefeller Center to the ocean steamers (with a cut on the ship Normandy) and the grand finale of the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Do not miss it.
