This is a movie that I love above all others. I try to visit the major locations in Oakworth and Oxenhope over and over again, which helps restore those magical qualities that this film seems so unique to - reminding of a gentler and more substantial age with its unspoken claims that people really do It is important that family life is not just another disposable product and that life is really worth living (though sometimes we can doubt it). In short, a movie that soon brings tears to my eyes, perhaps helped by the deeply evocative music - some tunes are lighthearted (like the percussion melody played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), the rousing melody, In search of Yorkshire, without knowing what lies ahead, and the haunting little tune that comes up. Englisch: emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/art ... = 263 & lang = en Playing a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden childlike changes of happiness Film for adults as well as children that appeals to the eternal child in all of us - a key that effortlessly those deep and seemingly long lost Values ​​and feelings buried in us are reactivated, which are usually swept away by the demands of modern day life. This is a film about basic human goodness and propriety, where we can do what we want to the audience, and there are welcome approaches of humor that are sometimes added as a good measure, such as the arrival of the aunt or more Earthy plane, the bedroom scene on Perks' birthday - "Alright, Bert - there's your birthday!" I have to know every scene, every line of this movie, and yet the magic is so great that for the first time every time I watch, I open a box of joys and enjoy every moment - sometimes humorous, sometimes ... ... well, very different. As Peter says in the film, "It's perfect - more perfect than you know." And so it is!!!
