This film can easily match the emotional power, dramatic impact, and first-rate performance of "12 Angry Men." I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had never heard of it before. I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pace, interplay, and evolution of the characters. The subtle cinematography around the character Estevez plays suggests a natural eye. <br /> <br /> The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw on Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is wonderful in her subtle despair and escapism. a variation of their characters in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord." It is irritating and you can empathize with it at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are moments when I feel that the plot is slowing down and the moments between Estevez and his ex-girlfriend seem almost written for another movie, Estevez all comes together as a different character , But these are minor complaints. <br /> <br /> This film must be based on a true story or written by someone who has had this experience. I rate it with 8 out of 10 points. <br /> <br />
