You can not watch the same movie if you did not grow up in France (or spent at least ten years there, like me). I do not know if it ever goes beyond the French cultural boundaries (I include Belgium and Luxembourg here). You can not translate your fun - every name is a joke (how many people outside of Paris would understand the pun in "Couloirdebus," the name of one of the Roman Legionnaires?). But Monica Bel (l?) ​​Ucci is so beautiful, I almost forgot to breathe when I saw her.
