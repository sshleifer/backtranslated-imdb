I can tire of tired mysteries except for some really great TV series. Otherwise, there are just too many of these murder plot topics. I do not like the theme of the two overweening, selfish teenagers who kill as an intellectual exercise. I have no interest whatsoever in Hitchcock, who seems to be associated with it in any way I do not intend to learn about. But do not get me wrong, the theme is excellent in itself, the whole movie is so well done, and of course Sandra Bullock is superlative, as always. <br /> <br /> Sandra's character (as in Miss Congeniality), despite her obvious ability, is not valued by the male team she works with, and the boss usually ignores her ideas, eventually forcing her aside and giving the case Of course, Sandra explains what's going on and is almost killed in a dramatic resolution. It is intriguing that the boy who drew up the murder plan does not allow him to be killed by his colleague - he has a certain conscience and may be "saved while the other is a true psychopath." Sandra's hard shell is caused by the misery in her past, which is heavily linked to the murder case. When her colleague realizes that Sandra solves this case, despite being rejected by the dense boss, she finally discovers what Sandra himself was doing in her teenagers, that she has to face and exorcise herself, and the last scene shows her departure - we hope anyway - to do just that. <br /> <br /> I can see from the few other reviews I've had time to read. Read that this film would attract a diverse group - those who are interested in the two spoiled boys, those with their cruel ones philosophical determination to cheat the police and get away with the perfect murder, the so cleverly described relationship between them, the cruel connections, the passing of time to the heroine's past, a police theme and some smoke and mirror effects - as well as for Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> For those who asked why Bullock's character must have a problematic past, I think this would be a far less interesting movie if she had just been a detective trying to see what happened with a willing buddy and a male chauvinist boss. The connection between the murder victim and the investigator is necessary to show that the investigator is too involved, or how else would he lose the arrogant boss's confidence and thereby almost lose his life? This is not an original theme; in fact, it is usually a most irritating topic as this male chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired co-worker to give up the case and leave it to someone who obviously does not have the skills to solve the problem although the buddy is. In the end, I was very concerned about what could happen to Sandra's character, as her emotional involvement in the case and his special compassion for the unfortunate victim of the crime were driving her in a dangerous manner with this case. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the relationship between Bullock's character and her buddy. This is interesting and sometimes very moving. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two boys is definitely fascinating, if you are interested. I felt that in some ways it was reserved, either because the filmmakers did not want to go out of their way to make friends with boys and boys, or because we did not think that emotions dominated their relationship. In the film, one skillfully asks which boy is responsible for the situation, and there are some twists, and the boys show their underlying immaturity on different levels. <br /> <br /> There I wished that one thing was clarified happening "after the movie is over" when Sandra's character arrives at the court ... You have to watch a movie to know why she's there is. <br /> <br /> Very well traded by all. I certainly can not agree with those who complained against Bullock's acting - she was great. The part suited her very well. The story is gripping, even if murder secrets are not your thing and they're not mine often.
