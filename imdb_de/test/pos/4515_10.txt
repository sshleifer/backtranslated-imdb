The kite runner was beautiful, poignant and very moving. I especially loved the two children actors in the movie as well as the actor of the father. That really made me read the book again. <br /> <br /> The music was a wonderful part of the material of the movie. When the film comes out with a soundtrack, I buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. It's also a visually stunning movie. The cinematography was great and really enriched the experience. <br /> <br /> The Brazilian word "Saudades" describes exactly how I felt at the end of the film ... "It is a deep desire for someone or somewhere that is very sweet, but also with one inevitable sadness "(definition years ago by Antonio Carlos Jobim). <br /> <br /> I saw it in a small cinema here for an advance screening. I would like to see it again on a really big screen with a mature sound system. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to wait for the official release. I will definitely recommend the movie to my friends.
