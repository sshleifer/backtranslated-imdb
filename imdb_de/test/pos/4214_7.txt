Jimmy Wang Yu, an authentic Asian superstar, has directed and written this movie that I only saw in a dubbed video version. The shape of the widescreen (Shaw Scope!) Was lost and the original actor's voices were missing, but this is still good to see. The story is the usual martial arts school that fights villains from Japan, where our young hero was eventually defeated by punches for various thugs. <br /> <br /> <br /> The fight gets better as the movie evolves. It looks stiff and boring at the beginning of the movie, but later there's a great scene where Wang Yu battles hordes in a game area, then goes into a snowy scene and picks up some more baddies with knives, sword and fists. This part is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Fairly good, but it would be interesting to see an unsynchronized widescreen version, if there is one.
