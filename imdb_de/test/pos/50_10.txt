Fantastically written, played and produced! I loved seeing this brilliant, talented cast - each one of them - providing such a great performance. This movie has thoroughly heated the cockles of my heart! Great storytelling! <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for the Black History month. Full of an accurate account of recent history and very real characters who have survived incredible pain - with dignity and a belief in a better future. It is so easy to see how these various adults all influenced this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would ultimately promote the talent of his adulthood. The next time you are accompanied by a hearing and watching child, remember. show or he can be a writer!
