This is a great concert featuring the best songs of the band's 30-year career. Lee, Lifeson and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. However, I think the audio recording on the mixer and / or the microphone process was miffed. However, this is not the fault of the guys. They even mentioned that the show was set up at the last minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They should not have just released the show for public consumption. Neil's snare sounds distant and Geddy's bass has a good harmonic content, but no end !! They should have endured this concert and wait for a better opportunity. Only buy this DVD if you are a hardcore Rushian. The quality is missing in the audio department.
