My son, an avid skateboarder, sat me down and let me watch with him. Since I love documentaries, that did not put a lot of pressure on his side. The whole amazing story of it all - a bunch of dirt-poor kids push together and in the end make something revolutionary out of the air - well, more of wood, wheels and a lack of surfing waves - it just struck me that way. It still does. I did not think I would enjoy it the way I did, nor did I have the impression that I was watching Stacey Peralta tearing the fate of Jay Adams apart. And watching Jay Adams himself watching ... the sheer genius of the kid skating and the shrug of the adult who remembers it. I saw it again for the tenth time last night and I still get goose bumps that see it flying down the hill while Jimi Hendrix's "Freedom" plays in the background. And I'm torn again. Not too many films have the same effect on me after several visits. Brilliant.
