I just watched Hair after 20 years. It hit home. For those of us who have tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight against the rule of privilege and power; who opposed the fascism of the Johnson / Nixon governments; who now, as veterans of civil wars, have waged war in Vietnam every day until finally the US beast died and fled; for all who have said no in different ways - it is remarkable how unsuccessful we were. How big was the real table on which Treat danced? How the wizard went behind the curtain. We were 20, 22, 24. We did not know the nature of the enemy. The size of the monster that would continue to eat the world for the next thirty years. How can we Even with smoke and the bat (the bat!) In the hand, like Treat, we were too young, too middle-class, too invested, too much of the actions we hated. <br /> <br /> But there was a moment. As Andre Gregory observes in My Dinner With. , , Somewhere in the late 60's and early 70's there was a moment where we might have found something besides the yellow brick road. Something that was not fueled by Bechtel, prisons, Enron, and Dick. Something collaborative. Something innocent and critical at the same time. Something with dance. <br /> <br /> But we missed it. As Kong bends a bearer, the "revolution" was turned on its own. In sexism. Racism. Homophobia And the class that crushes politics. Until we came to "W". Treat would have hated "W". And Iraq and the pathological lies. If they were in this movie. Then. But the moment passed and "W" was almost inevitable. Comprehensive incompetence that rides the drunken, raging bull in estuaries, children's lives and Chinese shops. <br /> <br /> We should have done something more. Something better. But we clearly did not know what. <br /> <br /> Well what?
