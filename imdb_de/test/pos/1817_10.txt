I remember seeing this movie when I was 13 years old, and I fell in love with it and was a big fan of the movie and the characters I loved. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker) because it made me laugh when she showed no interest in Fred (Cameron Dye) who really liked her and I hoped they would eventually come together. Christopher Murray) because he ignored her and was with his friends. I love the cast and the story. I always love the role when Fred tries to meet with Stacey, and I always remember when he chased her in the car. But it was so good. I will always remember that I appreciate it in my teenage years. Now that I'm 33 years old, I've picked up my copy on DVD and I'm looking forward to seeing it.
