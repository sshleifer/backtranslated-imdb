The original story and the funny, captivating characters went well for a teen pajama party movie (now 2 times). I loved it, it was fun and fast, not boring scenes. It's violent and has a small language (though most of it is covered up). It's a great movie. David Strickland was a great actor. Ron Eldard did a wonderful job. I watch it with the girls every time.
