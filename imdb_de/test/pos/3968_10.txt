When I saw this movie, I expected it to be a cheesy American movie shot cheap with frightening actors. I was really surprised that I was totally wrong. The film revolves around Bartely or B, who was rejected by all of his colleges - the actor who plays B is very natural and makes his character appear real - and decides to found a presumptuous school so his parents do not bother him , However, many people see his fake website and join in. Feeling her worries B can not turn her away to the chagrin of his best buddy. College is the ideal place to learn what you want or do nothing. The school is confronted by the right college, which eventually closes. The movie ends with a rush and I recommend you to watch it. It has flaws, but it's a cheerful movie with a few unpredictable twists.
