What I find remarkable about this terrific film is that Altman, the crazy and wild guy he is, took the novel THAT COLD DAY IN THE PARK and the Sandy Dennis character was originally a man in the book. He was a mentally flogged isolated homosexual looking out of his apartment window when he spotted the hustler. It is strange that Altman fans are unaware of how clever he was to change the main character's gender. This avoids the homo-erotic taboos of gay life in the '60s, and Dennis's withdrawn madness in transposition works even better. When you see the movie again, it becomes clear how clever the Altman mind is ...
