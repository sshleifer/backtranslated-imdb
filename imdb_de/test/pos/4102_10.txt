I saw this movie a few years ago and promptly bought the soundtrack because it was just outstanding. Bacharach's music is endearing and should receive the recognition she deserves richly. The cinematography is great. Critics hated it, but they also hated HOME ALONE. I did not find it on video, but I welcome anyone who can find a copy.
