I'm not sure if the comments on the TV series should be used to attract the comments, but on television, The Lone Ranger has really made a name for itself. I do not even refer to the original radio broadcasts of this masked driver. I refer to a point where I should see the movie "The Lone Ranger" in a little boy, about 9 or 10 years old, and have never forgotten it. I remember being in line or we moving to the Paramount Theater - the theater was in the theater district, if I remember rightly. It was right across the street and walked from the building with the ball falling on New Year's Eve - east to west do not know, New York City. High above the street on the rooftops there was a time, and perhaps even today huge billboards would advertise what was shown and so on. At that time, I looked up never been as impressed as I did when I looked at this billboard The lonely ranger above the rooftops - it was great - made an impression and was never forgotten. On the day we visited the lonely ranger, it was the story of how the Lone Ranger was born. The Rangers rode in and the subsequent rebirth of one of the fallen heroes. In this movie, we learn that The Lone Ranger does not have to shoot, but kills, but has to hurt to let the law be judged. This way of thinking is worthwhile that we could be good to learn something from history. Here we learn that Tonto discovers the fallen Ranger and sees the symbol of youth friendship that The Lone Ranger established years ago when he became a member of the adjutant's injured young man in Tonto-For the adjutant, Tonto gave his loyal friend a symbol his thanks, which was now part of a necklace that Tonto recognized. Tonto said, "You are Kemosabe." The only ranger said, "Kemo -sabe, that's familiar?" Tonto tells the tale of that "t Rusty Scout" (the meaning of Kemosabe) I think the Lone Ranger is one of the true heroes of the screen and one of the great heroes It should also be said that these highly respected people Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels sought to live there according to the legend of The Lone Ranger-It may very well be an inspirational story in the history of the Lone Ranger and his I myself was very pleased with the ability to find and buy DVDs, that I stayed awake all Saturday morning and saw the many episodes that are now available Live The Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto-Hi -Ho Silver-
