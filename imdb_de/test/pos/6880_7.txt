Anthony Wong plays Lok, a husband whose wife is seriously ill. Poor Lok - because of his illness he has no sex for a long time. That's why he's plagued by a series of sloppy nightmares involving nurses and schoolgirls. "Erotic Nightmare" is a fun cat III movie featuring sleaze and voyeurism. There's also a bit of thrill as the first part of the movie shows some evil killings committed by Wong's character under the influence of the monk's mystical powers and dirty, so I'm not complaining. Of course, those who expect the cruel Cat III horror in the tradition of "Diary of a Serial Killer" or "Red to Kill" will be disappointed, but fans of the bleak exploitation cinema should give this a look.7 out of 10.
