This movie is a perfect example of Barker's cinematic gifts for the horror / monster genre. I thought this movie did a great job of preserving the feel and look of novels and comic books (or perhaps the comics are the second, I forget). This movie was made for Barker fans. It's helpful to read the book first, but it's not so important to be able to follow a movie. I've seen everyone who's on the fence about this movie, reading the book and then watching the movie again. Maybe you will find a new respect for the movie. I'm already a big fan of Barker for this movie, and after reading the book earlier, the movie was immediately thrilled. There are great cameos, makeup, writing, directing etc. in this movie. This movie does something that most monsters / horror movies fail miserably, the monsters show. They are in full color, not hidden in shadows, and take up most of the time on the screen. Unlike other films that use quick cuts or trick lighting to hide the creature, this film celebrates the grotesque and puts it to the fore as a good thing. Two thumbs up Clive. We are waiting for the thief of Always :)
