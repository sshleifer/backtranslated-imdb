Usually I do not watch a romantic comedy, and maybe I'll do that in the future after seeing Return to Me. The plot was easy and no secret after advertising. You do not have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the actors take you into a world where the "chemistry" is rich and you can win the good and you can just laugh and have a good time. I LOVE this movie .... and ordered the DVD!
