This is one of my favorite James Bond in games because: The missions are fun, they have a lot of action in them. They can be tough, which makes them fun, if the weapons you use are good. The way James Bond looks in these James Bond games is pretty pretty. You can see Pierce Brosnan in him, which is cool and all the other characters in the game look like the actors they played in the movie. There is no way you will not have a good time playing this game. I loved it. The game also follows the movie pretty much, maybe a few extra things, but it pretty much follows the movie. The James Bond game also has pretty good graphics for Nintendo 64, and it's a pity that there were no speakers in this game, but they take care of it as long as the game is fun. <br /> <br /> Total score ** ****** from **********
