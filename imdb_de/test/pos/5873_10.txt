The brilliance of this film is not in the film process, which is a conventional, but elaborate, interlocking story about the lies of three military men after the Second World War, but in the fact that this story was even told. Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for the fact that the chutzpah has pierced a film that has a disabled veterinarian with forceps for hands, an alcoholic, and a subordinate.
