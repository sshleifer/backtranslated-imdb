This is one of the most underrated films of the 1990s. If you identify with the character of Patricia Arquette, you will find that it is a very moving story in which a woman finds a sense of her life and finds a new will to live. <br /> <br /> Arquette's performance is brave because she's intentionally "made of wood". This is a way to determine the spiritual death of her character because she has absolutely no desire to be alive. She moves like a zombie through life because her family was murdered and she can not see the meaning of life. What moves is how it is reawakened throughout history - from the Burmese countryside, from the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes and from the original choices it faces. <br /> <br /> Boorman supports this visually (and Hans Zimmer supports him with one of his finest, most insistent results) with an often static camera and a tendency to shoot through glass, windows, windshields, etc. We look from the outside like Arquette ... until she is deep in the jungle and has to decide if she wants to fight for her life. <br /> <br /> I recommend the film THE PURPLE PLAIN from the year 1954. It is a similar story in a similar environment and offers a fascinating comparison.
