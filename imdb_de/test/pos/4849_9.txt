MPAA rating PG-13 <br /> <br /> My rating: 10 and up <br /> <br /> My Rating 9,5 / 10 <br /> <br /> William H. Macy delivers one breathtaking performance the role of Mr. Neuman. He gives you sympathy and fear of him at the same time. The story begins as a comedy and becomes slow but steady like a horror movie with twists and turns that Macy masters with difficulty. I could not take my eyes off the movie even after it ended, and I could not believe it was coming to an end. A MUST SEE. <br /> <br /> THIS SALES MAY NOTICE OF SOME OF THE SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, look at the story: The Neumans are the United States as a whole, and the character Meat Loaf Aday plays the people of the United States who are anti are semesthetic. <br /> <br /> This was a very enjoyable movie and would recommend to anyone I saw on the street.
