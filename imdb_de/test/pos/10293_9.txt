When I saw L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed, "How complicated!" And she is right, of course. If you're used to simple, one-line graphs, especially violent heroes. Crook plans, L'Appartement is difficult to follow. A few of the negative reviewers here have overlooked one or more important points. Others whine about the confusing flashbacks. Come on! This is not the kind of film you can use to leave the toilet, come back and become addicted in seconds. This requires full concentration and a keen eye for details. Then it's not that hard to figure out what happens when. The director has left more than enough hints in all scenes. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film focuses on the question: why did Max and Lisa split up? The film begins, as my friend noticed, as a romantic love story and suggests that two lost lovers will find each other again. I had the experience with French films and predicted that the story would soon get a sick turn and I was right. At the end of the first part it becomes clear after many twists that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know that Lisa had left and why. Lisa did not know why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace when she returned to Paris. The only one who did it was Alice, and she had her own reasons to shut up. After Max and Lisa have found out the truth, the question naturally arises: Can Alice's manipulations be reversed? Well, of course not, the time has passed and things have changed. <br /> <br /> Many European films use a storytelling technique that I fully enjoy. At the beginning there is no description of the basic conflict according to which two (or more) interested parties try to decide for their own benefit. Instead, the viewer gradually gets small parts of the plot and knows little more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half, Alice seems to be a minor character; Slowly it becomes clear that she is a key figure. <br /> <br /> acting is just great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as a naïve and impulsive character, risking a safe life to chase a dream from the past. Monica Belucci is of course very beautiful, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comic touch. Romane Bohringer, as a neurotic woman plagued with guilt and regret, is very convincing. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I did not give her 10 is the unsatisfactory ending. Of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all these events, Max is just at the point where the movie started, only wiser and sadder. Alice paid for her sins. Nevertheless, the small turns at the airport are somewhat artificial. Max exchanges Lisa too easily against Alice; Alice decides too easily to reject Max, who had been her dream for so long; Max returns to his fiancé too easily. On the other hand, I do not know how this can be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I think sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.
