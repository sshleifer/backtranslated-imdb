Unfortunately, this original mix of action and laughter is withheld from the movie fans as it rots for ever in the Columbia vaults. Too bad, because this is possibly the strongest movie by Jack Starrett. It contains a witty screenplay by a young Terrence Malick and fully realized performances by two leading actors, Stacey Keach and Frederic Forrest, who turn to the life of a crime so they can get the money to open seafood restaurant. Many outstanding scenes include an interrogation with a bathtub and electric shaver, as well as an intense shootout in an abandoned building as it is demolished by a demolition ball!
