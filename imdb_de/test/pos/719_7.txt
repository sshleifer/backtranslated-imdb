To summarize this film: nice for the television, but too small for the theater. I enjoyed watching this movie at home, but he does not look at me for a second time. The concept is good, but what ends in the movie is just a summary. The ending had a 'nice' twist but is still unsatisfactory. Maybe it was the intention of the director, but it was not as it should be. But then again, it's an OK-style movie.
