... instead, you see it in the ghettos of Chicago as a great story about African American men in the mid-1960s. For everyone under the age of 50, "What's happening" was a lighthearted, rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) in relation to a group of young African American high school students, a quarter of the working class. I really liked it - it just has no real connection to this movie. "Cooley High" was originally the basis for "What's Happening", but its seriousness was not good among the test audience, which is why it was repeated as a comedy, even though the sections on "What's Happening" read that it was based on this movie. <br /> <br /> This film starts off lightly but touches on many aspects of life that are unique in the turbulent 1960s, as well as some other aspects of growing up that are timeless. The boys are engaged in sex, betrayal, unemployment, hopelessness and even early death. The ending is pretty powerful and serious, and the movie has a great Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this movie is not new enough to be played on premium cable broadcasters, and it's not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and also played in the few places for those movies.
