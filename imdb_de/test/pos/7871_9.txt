I saw this short at HBO the other day and was really excited. Eight different characters, eight different perspectives. At first I was confused about the way the story moved, but then I realized that only one scene was shown again and again only to show us the different perspectives of the characters. <br /> <br /> At first, you think the employees are phoning the teenager for the theft. They speak in their own language, which I (and the teen who was convincingly played by Eleonore Hendricks) can not understand. The perspective of the employees eliminates this view. I did not know how wonderful the short film really is until the last two scenes. <br /> <br /> Excellent short film. Hopefully, director James Cox can turn the film into a full-length movie with the same cast, or convince us with a whole new movie. <br /> <br />
