John and his wife Emily, accompanied by their child Edward, venture out of the comfort of the suburbs into the village where the husband spent part of his childhood. There was a death in the family, and John must initiate proceedings to take control of an old, dilapidated cottage that sits on the seafront and was once inhabited by an old man who appears to have committed suicide John leaves his family and reality behind, endangers his own life and puts on the clothes of the old man, who is now dead. <br /> <br /> The film is changing now - nothing It seems - the people of his past appear in full gothic / hillbilly glory - his wife is worried about his mental state - and his son disappears in the reeds. John finds that the old man did not commit suicide, that his death is much more mysterious and strange. In a spectacular finale, we learn that the events of the film have never really happened, and that the whole story was thought of by the little boy Edward, who comes to terms with his parents' divorce proceedings. <br /> <br /> Modern Love is a macabre piece of high art cinema, a confusing and perverted bit of presumption, full of vague hints and unexplored red herrings. It is humorless and apparently without regard to the current indie trends, which both confirm the makers and make it pass√©. <br /> <br /> But the weaknesses of this Australian film are its sheer muscular film vision, its bloody deliberate and uncompromising precision and its comical euro horror. The bastard of script standards and the lack of smooth dialogues fade against a backdrop of Noir and a lead performance that must have been seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> One of the most aggressive whimsical Australian movies in years.
