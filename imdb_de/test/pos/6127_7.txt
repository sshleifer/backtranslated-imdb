A very strange, disturbing, but fascinating film. I do not think I've ever had to see what a human can do with his butt, and I doubt I'll ever see him again. That said, there's a lot to enjoy, such as Divine's take on Jayne Mansfield's classic walk in "The Girl Can not Help" and putting meat plates in a grocery store. A hard feeling like a Russ Meyer movie. In general, bad acting, with the notable exception of Divine.
