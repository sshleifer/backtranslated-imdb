What a surprise this movie was. I saw some of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was from the same director. He also wrote the script, which shows that the guy was quite capable of creating a detailed, complex storyline. The synchronization to this is not good, but far from the terrible flood that only hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'. A strange, almost futuristic street appears throughout the movie, focusing on a small town where young boys are murdered. A scene in which a woman is beaten is uncomfortable to see, but refreshing compared to ordinary cinema violence. <br /> <br /> What went wrong, Lucio? Perhaps a strong case will indicate that he had reached his climax with this film, and then it slowly went downhill.
