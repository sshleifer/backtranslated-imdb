I watch this movie at the beginning of every summer and it makes me funny again and again. Here are the jokes packed in almost every dialogue line, giving you more bang than the average Simpsons episode. Some of the jokes fall to the ground or cause only a slight giggle, but others let you roll and then there are those that remain in your brain ... "The audience is now numb." <br /> <br /> The video knows it's a video and does not pretend to be anything else. It's easy to sit back and let the bombing of humor begin. A good mix of slapstick, pop culture and comic comedy ensures that there is something for everyone. I was in sixth grade when I saw this video for the first time, and I have to admit that I still find it weird since I started college. <br /> <br /> Just as you might see for Christmas "It's a wonderful life" or for Easter / Passover "Ten Commandments". More than that, it's just funny.
