Okay, I love silly movies. If you enjoy stupid science fiction movies, great movies, or a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, I would watch this movie. This movie is everything I wanted. As a fan of outstanding films, this is just the thing for you. Every time I thought, "This movie would be the dumbest, best movie ever, if * blank * happened ...", then I thought, * blank * would happen. It's a wonderful stupid "B" movie. If you're a fan of Campbell, I'd say, "See it," bring your friends along, laugh about it. It is fun. It's not classic or anything, but if it's on TV at some point, look at it. It has become a movie for me, which I would put under "enjoyment movies". Movies that may not be good, but after a hard day at work I could come home and watch (this list also includes "Harold and Kumar Going to the White Castle", "Army of Darkness" and "Intolerable Cruelty") <br /> If you feel like an exaggerated, wonderfully bad movie, look at it. If not, then rent "Bubba Ho-tep".
