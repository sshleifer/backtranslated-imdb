Nothing better than an 80's Android device and an aged story, where you can take your thoughts from the depths of your mind and capture them with a beautiful, lovable cast. Growing up in the '80s gave me the priceless opportunity to see repetitions of "not quite human" on many special occasions. Considering that my parents were never present during the sightseeing, I would guess that I would most likely not enjoy it as much as I did as a child. Maybe this is a movie that can be dug out of your VHS collection and handed over to your children. He can be found on the same volume as "The apple dumpling gang" and a series of "Compulsory Tour" if you have recorded LP mode of course.
