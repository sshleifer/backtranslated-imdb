Although I liked this western, I have to say it's not one of my favorite John Ford Westerns. For me, I just miss that certain something that most of his other films (which I've seen anyway) have. I do not know what that something is. It is not tangible. However, the crux of the story is about a Mormon wagon train being used by a band of outlaws as a hiding place from a haunting group. There are some interesting characters, a beautiful landscape, a bit of action and excitement. All together makes a worth seeing experience. It certainly is not boring. Not quite the usual John Ford standard. For me, Wagon Master is a 7/10
