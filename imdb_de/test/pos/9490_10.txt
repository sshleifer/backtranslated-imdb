Just another showcase of LED zeppelin at its best and absolute rocking best form. Each band member is on his best Jimmy side and his bow and guitar JPJ with his thundering bass bozo, and Robert sings like no tomorrow. I have to say, when we start with the first song, where the groove is the beginning of something very special. This DVD follows Zeppelin through her 11-year carree tour, which began at 69 at the Royal Albert Hall, then Madison Square Garden 73, followed by a much older and more mature band at 75 at Earls Court, and finally a different-looking band at their last English Show at Knebworth at 79 This DVD is a fantastic showcase from Zeppelin, and if you're not a fan, you'll be up to it.
