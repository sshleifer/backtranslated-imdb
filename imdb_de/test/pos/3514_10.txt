Just before dawn is a terrific horror movie. It is atmospheric and full of excitement from wonderful shots of wild nature, in which only a few young people meet their fate, in the form of two crazy, fat bastards who slaughter them. Jeff Lieberman is a very talented and intelligent director who is unfortunately underestimated. He managed to build tensions, not with blood, but with menacing nature. Lieberman manages to build tension in a very linear, simplistic way, which is also the best way to not show the blood to the viewer, but to imagine the worst happening happening to the characters. <br /> <br /> Just before dawn, it was always compared to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Liberation and the Hills have eyes. It looks as good as liberation, better than Hills, I mean, scary and better done, and it's scary like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <br /> <br /> JBD is one of the best horrors of the last decades, who finally lives on DVD!
