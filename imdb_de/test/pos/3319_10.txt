If this is not my favorite movie of all time, he's definitely in the top five. I love it. Everything about it is perfect - the clothes, the set, the lines - yes, it's not like normal people talk, but ... Except for the little scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls who change their shoes, pick a wedgie Pour the office ivy plant, put the lunch in the fridge ... Identical to what we do office girls today in 2005. I think all the little characters are wonderful. If someone like Joan Crawford is over the top, everything is part of the package. If you pick out many things in the film, it's obvious that this was the beginning of the sixties, when women started not "lying down", at least not when they did not want to. In terms of characters that are contradictory, eg. For example, is Suzy Parker's character as if she's doing everything, but if you stick to Louis Jourdan's character too much, are not that many people - contradictory? They mix with scenes like Diane Baker's character, who finds the love of her life after mistreating her illegitimate baby in an accident - lying in hospital, with a big old bandage around her head. This is also part of the package, it is charm - brilliant escapism. I like the mix of real stories that are relevant today (the stereotypical career woman who deals only with married men and therefore has no family when she's older) with those you desire, "oh, if only could fall in. " I love a doctor and he will love me, even though he knows my dirty past and has messed me up after the scandalous accident !! "Besides, I just got the DVD with widescreen, which is even more beautiful than the full-screen mode ... Yay!
