For those of you who have no idea what Bug Juice is or was, it was a reality show for children about real kids living in the summer camp. Bug Juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp. It was full of romance, friendships, brawls, overcoming your fears and dealing with the struggle to live away from home for two months. It was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t.v. regular, but still amazing. The show was never boring and always caught my attention. It's really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it's like before they leave. In addition, Disney has done a really good job of selecting camps because who wants to see a show that's in a camp for just a week. The length of the camps was perfect for this show and the environment in which they were was fantastic. They were in camps all over the US, each providing unique activities for the campers. It was a really amazing, unencumbered show.
