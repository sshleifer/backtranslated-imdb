If you overlook the technical problems of this early (1930) soundtrack such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of John Wayne, this movie will be an epic more realistic than almost any film ever made. In Missouri begins a large caravan with wagons, people and animals from Conestoga to the west. The cars are pulled over huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with significant risks for the riders in the car. Indians meet with Wayne and let the train drive through their country. Later, Indians gather west of the train to fight them. The wagons form a large circle with horses and cattle in a circle and fire their rifles, with the surrounding Indians a smoke veil is generated. When the battle ends, the dead will be buried on the spot. People and wagons will depart. This scene is remarkable as the camera stays with the living with the dead. It is unique in the way it connects the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living. The wagons hit everywhere a violent storm with pouring rain and mud. Finally, they reach their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in Oregon. The film is shot in a 70mm widescreen format at a ratio of 2.0: 1 (1930!). <br /> <br /> I did not mention the plot because it is subordinate to the scenic splendor and the enormous workload involved in this movie. Filmmakers will never again work so hard to make such a movie or a movie. Sometimes, when Wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friend's murderers, and in the end, the music is sometimes in motion, given the technical limitations of the sound. <br /> <br /> While all the critics of The Searchers and Wayne's psychology, racism, shortness of breath and complex characters, The Big Trail, tell us about ordinary people who encounter extraordinary difficulties. One of the best western I have ever seen.
