I was not sure if I would get this movie on DVD because I really have something against black and white movies in the 21st century, but I still bought it. I still do not understand why it had to be black and white, but that's the only negativity I can see about the movie, and it's certainly a perfect example of the final rise of Brazilian cinema. Not everyone can understand such a movie, but it is a reward to those who do it. In contrast to O Homem Que Copiava, Surrealism fits in well with this film, and acting is at least as good as these or other successful Brazilian films such as Bicho de Sete Cabe√ßas, Cidade De Deus, Brava Gente Brasileira, etc. <br /> <br /> My only hope is that this gem will not be insulted and raped by a crappy Hollywood remake. It's amazing to see how these guys spend billions of dollars and still can not make a movie that is 1% as good as this possibly low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Bravo for the entire crew! 10/10
