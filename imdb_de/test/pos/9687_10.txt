If you're a fan of Jackass, Viva La Bam, or the CKY videos, you already know what you're looking for. However, this is one of those rare events when a sequel is better than the original! And the man has a middle-poor blow. But I mean that. It's the same kind of deadly, heartbreaking madness we all know and love and expect from Bam, Knoxville and Co. But this time with even more laughs than ever! With Johnny Knoxville's insane tolerance for pain, Bam Margera's love to harass his friends / family, and Steve-O's gross-out factor. The bar for the stunts, skits and general chaos of the Jackass crew has been raised. Jackass 3? Certainly, because it is almost impossible to improve perfection.
