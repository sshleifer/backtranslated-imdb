I sometimes wonder if Meryl Streep, perhaps the most impressive, versatile actress since, well, perhaps at the beginning of the sound age, has been so accepted that her talent is now taken for granted. There are probably three tics that she consistently relies on throughout her performances (most notably a pinched lip), but apart from that, her performances are amazingly variable and original, and a fresh expression of inner working. Although "Sophie's Choice" and "A Cry in the Dark" and "Silkwood" are perhaps even fancier, their work here and in "Bridges in Madison County" is also remarkable - just more subtle. In "One True Thing," she's usually sweet and in love with her domesticated life, and Streep makes what may be routine seem boring, attractive, and charming. I think she needs to work out these mini theses for each character and figure out which things make that person real and interesting. It works from the inside out with every character, and perhaps it is this essential quality that has elicited the main criticism of restraint or self-confidence. I do not think she is cold, but has come up with the unique qualities of her character. I think their critics confuse self-confidence with intelligence. Not too many other actors would be so thoughtful and creative as to make Kate Muldrun light and carefree in her beloved, homey environment, only to show an unprecedented depth later on because of her genuine attachment to this home environment. Her performances are of unsurpassed consistency, she rarely does anything wrong. I wonder if it's conceivable that any of Streep's paintings will be diminished by her presence ... Anyway, Kate loves her home, and her affection for her "family life" is as adorable as her new conflict in shattering her home. When all of this comes together and Kate realizes that she can no longer work in the same capacity, and she breaks the pie and screams that she is not disabled, it is painfully sad to watch because no one was prone to emotion , Streep is smart enough and generous enough to realize how much better it works because she recognizes Kate's dramatic validity, and it's really the only scene where she lets her character go. How refreshing it is, however, to see a character that can really surprise you by displaying something you did not think was possible. Once again, Streep has at least three dimensions ... God, that sounds like a thesis, but as an actress, Streep has only a special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy, and great expressive abilities. The movie itself is probably a bit mediocre. I suppose William Hurt is supposed to be an unlikely fool, and he does pompom very well. I think Hurt is pretty scary though. The script is pretty normal - another tribute to Streep, which she was as touching and believable as she was.
