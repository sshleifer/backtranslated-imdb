Charles "Chic" Sales is absolutely fantastic as he is the only member of the Leeds family to testify against a gangster when they saw a police officer and an informant murdered. He fought at Bull Run in the Civil War, and his patriotism is high, even after his son-in-law's been beaten and one of his grandsons kidnapped by the gang, which intimidates all other members. The fear of his grandson's death is no excuse, he says. He would not want his grandson living in a country run by gangsters anyway. The conflict between civic duty and personal security is sharply driven home in this Oscar-nominated story. Walter Huston is also an outstanding lawyer who threatens the family with family members if he does not confirm the murderer's identification in court. The rest of the cast, including shabby killer Ralph Ince, is all excellent, and the film is ripped by William A. Wellman. There is also a good deal of tension as the sale disappears as the process begins.
