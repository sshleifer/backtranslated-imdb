I have not seen this funny show on Fox for much longer and it was well worth the wait. The children in the series have something that I can identify with in each episode, and even my dad will sit down and watch it. It's not a show for all ages that's not dumb for kids. It is still standing as though to the next level. The stuff everyone says is what everyone says and the actions everyone does. It says things we all think, but in a well rounded way of presentation. When I saw the show for the first time, I could not believe it was Fox, and it was allowed to stay in the air after a few episodes, from Hilary's friendships to Kenny's friendships.
