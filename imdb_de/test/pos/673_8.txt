I particularly liked Delly's review of this movie and agree that Howard is not the only "damaged" character. Howard is "ruthlessly" set up by the script, but there is no indication that his former employer is actually dead or, if it is, he has murdered her. Howard does not know, neither do we. Startled and confused, when he saw the woman lying there, he rustled. However, he never harms Helen Gordon, no matter how angry he is. In fact, he reacts with horror to Helen's impotent spell and the fact that he holds a pair of scissors in his hand ... Then he picks up his cleanup and salutes the recovered Helen with the almost miserable "I am very tired now I believe." go home. "Honestly, I do not think he's a psychopath, certainly a sick puppy, but not a psychopath. <br /> <br /> The problem with Howard is that he does not have a real male identity serving his country, but his mental state denies him a place in the army, he is singularly rootless and isolated: no woman, no girl, no home (at least as far as we know) And he makes a woman - "Floor's are my specialty "Helen's niece ruthlessly dismisses this pride in his thoroughness by caste-shouting that she wants a man with a real job, and although he feels strongly attracted to Helen, he is unable or unwilling to terrifying her by making a strong sexual walkthrough, he is remarkably powerless - can not fight, can not work, can not love. <br /> <br /> Helen is rightly scared, she tries to join him a binding But he realizes that he is not responding normally (ie, outside the comfort zone that her rose-colored memories of Husband Ned offer) and unconsciously presses All Howard's buttons by lying to him in her escape attempt. <br /> <br /> Both characters who are locked up in the house and are trapped by fear, neurosis, anger and memory deserve compassion. I know that the sudden end disappointed some reviewers, but I thought it would be a good fit as it provided the characters with a kind of liberation. I think Helen is free from the past. When Howard tries on her husband's army coat, Helen's disgust is highlighted. No doubt she feels that the "sanctity" of Ned's possessions has been violated, but hopefully her need to "keep her untouched" has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger. Maybe she can go on. Howard is also liberated - from his endless cycle of anger, pain and violence. Whether he goes to treatment or jail is controversial, but I hope it's the earlier one. <br /> <br /> Great performance from Ryan and Lupino. I prefer "On Dangerous Ground," but that's pretty good too.
