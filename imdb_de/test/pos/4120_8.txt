As good as any commentator has mentioned that some of the interview recordings are in places over the concert recordings. That's right and is the biggest mistake of this movie. However, it is not that often or so bad that you should not see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you must see this. Apart from seeing Black Sabbath in the 1970s and early 1980s, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when, as in this video, they also titled OZZfest. The concert was amazing and very similar, which is why I rented it at all. It's just the best geezer rock out there. Listen.
