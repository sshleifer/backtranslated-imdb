This is a wonderful old-fashioned Christmas favorite that I try to watch on TV every year if I can. It is a Martha Stewart like the journalist Elizabeth Lane, which is presented by Barbara Stanwyck in a charming way. Unlike Martha, however, this lady is a dodger without any domestic skills. The other performers complete the story, including Dennis Morgan, Reginald Gardiner and Sydney Greenstreet. Elizabeth Lane is a journalist writing food articles that portrays herself as a happily married countrywoman with children. In fact, she lives as a single woman in an apartment in New York City and can not cook an egg. Her recipes are from her hungarian chef Felix. Elizabeth disappears with her illusion until the publisher of her journal, Alexander Yardley, decides to celebrate a pretty old country for Christmas and invites her to visit her, bringing along the returning war hero Jefferson Jones, who had been shipwrecked , Yardley demands absolute honesty from his employees. To free herself from her predicament and save her delusion-based career, Elizabeth lends herself to the Connecticut Manor of her longtime architect-lover John Sloan, a boring, fussy fellow who has long sought marriage. She also borrows a neighbor's baby (actually several) to pose as her and her "husband" Sloan. <br /> <br /> Of course, this scenario is a lot of fun. It's a screwball comedy and a charming romance with the added charm of a Christmas atmosphere. Whenever I think of this movie, I imagine the snowflakes falling, the tree beautifully decorated, the fire burning in the fire, the turkey roast and the Christmas cookies baking. Why did Hollywood feel compelled to make a movie? Remake? I understand that there is a version of 1992, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, directed by Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation and I do not want it. This old favorite is exactly what it is and a vacation to see, along with "A Wonderful Life", "White Christmas", "Wonders" in 34th Street and of course all versions of A Christmas Carol.
