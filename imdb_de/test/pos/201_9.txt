A true masterpiece of Soviet film art. It is a shame for the Soviet Union that Samojlova never had the opportunity to play in the Western movies - but otherwise she would probably never find herself there. In "Letyat Zhuravli" she is unforgettable. This was one of the few films I cried in. <br /> <br /> Besides Samojlova, Batalov and Merkurjev, who are the front runners, it was brilliant work by the director and the operator who did that film a classic of all time worldwide. Just remember the scenes of the piano music and the proposal under the heavy German bombing or the death of Boris with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions in that sky seem blurry. The very simple means - but the great technique added to the emotional weight ... Mind you, 20 years before "The Star Wars", 41 years before "Titanic" and with a Soviet budget.
