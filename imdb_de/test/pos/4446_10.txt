Do not torture a duckling is an absolutely stunning giallo distraction for Lucio Fulci. Unlike other subgenre heavyweights like Mario Bava and Dario Argento Fulci pursues the giallo narrative in this film very pithy, down to earth and socially perceptive. It's nothing glamorous when the Infanticides and Border Pedophilia (a brave subplot for 1972) take place here, and Fulci shoots wisely with a serene and melancholy eye and avoids flash, melodrama, and directors. The action is interrupted by bloody and instantly insane set pieces, reinforced by Fulcis' shattering sense of realism. Especially the deeply disturbing scene "witch hunt" with her bald head brutality feels like a snuff movie. The composer Riz Ortolani books these gracious scenes with wild, echoing tramps. <br /> <br /> The film is accompanied by a simultaneously lyrical and violent conclusion in which theology, morality, fanaticism and superstition clash. It is a profoundly effective ending that leaves the viewer in a confused and disarmed torpor. <br /> <br /> Fulci could not have chosen a better place for this film. Do not torture a duckling being photographed in and around the old town of Matera in Italy. While Matera continues to modernize (highlighted by the transition from an agrarian economy to an industrial one), it is struggling with its UNESCO-backed reputation as a vessel for mysterious Paleolithic spirits. The fears of the real Materani are reflected in the characters of the film, who are frustrated with their Christianity on the sleeves, any exotic fringe tradition (namely, witchcraft) that is out of the norm. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Matera was also used as a substitute for Jerusalem in Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ. If anything, this increases the power of Fulci even more. Catholic guilt and cruel killings are such a resonant combination.
