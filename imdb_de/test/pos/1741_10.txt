I loved this show. Such talent; and I am so disappointed that it will be canceled after it has just started. I was looking forward to this show all week. And I'm sorry for the people who were hoping to be the One. I would have liked to see who won. It has just begun, and in my opinion it should not have been canceled. I hope these young artists have been seen by talent scouts and have the opportunity to achieve their goals. I agreed and waited for it to start. I never knew it was canceled. And I could not believe it. I am amazed that it had low ratings. because it was in my opinion one of the best reality shows on TV.
