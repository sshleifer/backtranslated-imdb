Of course, one would assume that it is a typical, stupid T & A strip, and that's it. But there are really well thought-out, humorous moments. Given the time it was made, and the obvious aspect of exploitation, it's still one of the better B-comedies of the time. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie you will obviously be inspired by the scenes in "Revenge of The Nerds" and many other films of the same genre. Most acting is terrible and far too exaggerated, but that's what I expect in a movie like this. What he lacks in acting ability more than makes up for it with his stock value and the total disregard of any merits. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie is that it obviously had some money going into it. Films like this one today just do not have the same style. If you can turn off your brain and turn up your humor for an hour and a half, you'll enjoy this streak. I can not dare anyone, at least not to find something in this movie that they think is funny, if not funny.
