This is a unfortunately not recognized classic. <br /> <br /> The look is superb, the design, the costumes etc. are spotless, the scenes after the battle and the cavalry load are daunting and exciting. <br /> <br /> The characters are lively and really human. Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini as lawyer Derville steals the film with his skilful, pedantic, rodent-like performance and enjoys the ups and downs of others' misfortunes. Depardieu is good, but maybe too big for that role. <br /> <br /> Where the film really shines is history and its changes to Balzac's short story. These changes are editorial, as Balzac conducts a lot of discussions about the company and this movie breathes with characters. Nevertheless, Yves Angelo has retained the key ingredient, not just the missing man trying to regain his place in society, but every character must find his place in society: Comte Ferraud tries to buy a peer, his wife (Ardent ) When she was married to Colonel Chabert, she reached her position in the turbulence of postrevolutionary France. In terms of status, everyone has something to lose, which leads to a good drama because their goals conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> It also feels very modern: money is crucial to gaining the status to gain power. but someone can go down as fast as he goes upstairs. Derville likes the strategy, he has seen the worst people he tells Chabert when he accepts the case. The original location of this speech is at the end of the novella, when Balzac summarizes human comedy with great irony.
