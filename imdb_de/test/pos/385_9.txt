In Strangers On A Train, it's obvious from the beginning that Playboy maniac Robert Walker chose Farley Granger to be an unwilling accomplice to a murderous couple. Granger is a semi-public figure, he is a professional tennis player, but not very high. High enough for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to marry Ruth Roman. <br/> <br/> If they meet as "Strangers On A Train" one night, Walker knows enough Granger will be fascinated, at least, with the possibility that the two, utter strangers, will commit murder at the parties and the others be brought together by their downfall. Although Granger is struck back by the idea, one of the nice things about this movie is that you can see in the performance it provides that Granger may be tempted. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Walker Laura Elliot kills Granger's wife, two of whom were timed and even pregnant by another man, Granger expects Walker's father to kill so that Walker can inherit his fortune. Today, Walker is referred to as a trust fund baby and a pretty mean boy. Alfred Hitchcock referred Walker to his professional role, ironically in his final full movie. Walker died the following year with most of My Son John. Hitchcock is also doing well from Farley Granger. <br /> <br /> Of course, if Granger refuses to kill people who have never done anything to him, the tension. Strangers On A Train also boasts some great edits, first in a tennis match where Granger has to end the game and finish Walker before putting up any evidence of Granger's conviction at the scene. And also in this last climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger. <br /> <br /> Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at its best, should not be missed and should be viewed during film lessons
