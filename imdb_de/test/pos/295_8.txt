You will find an anti-war statement here, without looking too hard. this layer is attacked. Or you can find a value-neutral commentary on the madness of the war (without "judgment"); This layer is completely uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Or you can observe this for the damn good entertainment value of Duvalls One-Liner, but that's just a commercial chewing coating. You can try to think of this as a "realistic" Vietnam war movie, but ask any veteran, and he'll swallow that idea - most vets say it stinks or he will not play morality - there's nothing rich. <br /> <br /> Where I found that the value lay in the outstanding self-reference. Coppola needed a container of sufficient size (the war) to match the size of the experienced, multi-dimensional actor who played "a great man". The man Brando was just as much an outsider as the Kurtz character. The studios felt uncomfortable with his acting method, yet he always distinguished himself and won prizes. Despite his strategic genius, the 'generals' feel uncomfortable with Kurtz's 'unhealthy methods'. <br /> <br /> So Coppola is making a movie about Brando's size. To hammer to the point, he sits down in the movie (as Hopper, a manic photojournalist loaded with multiple cameras) to express his praise. Brando himself is only seen in semi-darkness and silhouettes - a brilliant camera by Storaro, which only enhances the power of the actor. And he goes out like the victim bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: "The horror ..." <br /> <br /> Other interesting points: the great use of angle-of-view camera angles, including "being in a firefight" long before "Private Ryan" appeared; the groundbreaking use of sound, especially the ominous flanging sweeps and the tonal representation of an acid trip. <br /> <br /> Do not get caught in the outer layers. The rich part that you should be robbing is the brilliant core of sound, vision, and self-reference.
