Crossing the bridge: The Sound of Istanbul received one of the most enthusiastic applause at the end of the concert, and it was well deserved. I did not expect too much of a musical documentary, but the movie turned out to be much more. It was also a visual documentation of Istanbul with strong contrasts between old and new, west and east, poor and rich, modern and traditional. Exceptional were black and white photos of the old Istanbul by the world-famous Armenian photographer Ara Guler. But the main theme was of course music and by God, what diversity of it! It was similar in some ways to the Bueno Vistas Social Club; The love and respect of the interviewer - Alexander Hacke, who replaced Ray Cooder here - for the musicians who were broadcast from the screen and surrounded us all. The music was mostly interesting. The jazz session of a group of Roman gypsies in a small western Turkish city was overwhelming. I will not be surprised if the travel agencies receive group booking inquiries for Kesan after the release of the film. But most of all, I loved Muzeyyen Senar, who looked amazingly elegant in a kind of burlesque style and "Raki" willfully declared, "My voice and I are 86 years old!" Well done Faith Akin. I bet there are many other Turkish musicians who feel left out: please go to Volume II.
