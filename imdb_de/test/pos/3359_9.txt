25 sitcoms had big screen side effects. Most of them came in the 70s. Here's a list of everything: Be Served, Blackadder, Bless this House, Down, Dad's Army, Father Dear Father, For the Love of Ada, George and Mildred, The League of Gentlemen, Love Your Neighbor, The Lover, Man Over the house, nearest and dearest, I do not care about the quality, feel the width, about the buses (3), please sir, porridge, ascending Damp, Steptoe and Son (2), this is your funeral, until death us do part, Up Pomeii (3), Whack-o, Whatever happened in the apocalypse "Likely Lads" and "Whoops". <br /> <br /> So there was a big screen spin from my beloved Sitcom Dads Army. The film focused on enrolling the men. It showed the difficulties of getting a uniform and getting weapons. It was a big summary of the first series of Dad's Army. At the end of the film they catch some German spies in the church. The Home Guard came disguised as an old waiter, had bayonets and defeated the Germans. The best thing about the film was, as they simultaneously showed a HG lecture and a German lecture: German: Central on the phone, you would get 10,000 bombs, (CUT TO HOME GUARD) GODFREY: Ms. Mainwaring on the phone, you would 1 / 2lb Brussel Get sprouts. <br /> <br /> This was probably the second best sitcom spin-off movie defeated only by Till Death us do Part (1969). It would have been better if the film had already been formed at the beginning of the film, it was half of the war. Although still an excellent movie, a good one for the family.
