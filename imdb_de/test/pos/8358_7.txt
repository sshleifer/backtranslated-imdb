Aslan Adam or Lionman, as he is more commonly known among English-speaking readers, begins an epic battle when King Solomon & his army defeats a lot of guys, though I'm not sure who they were and the movie itself is not very helpful finding the fact. After King Solomon slaughtered all these men, Princess Maria, Bishop Osorio and Commander Antoine are forced to sign a treaty that leaves King Solomon in sight of everything. Soon after Princess Maria seduces Salomon and they have sex, in the shortest wedding ceremony (just two sentences long), Antoine marries Princess Maria and plans to rebel against Solomon, winning a sweet revenge. Antoine and his guards grab and kill Salomon, even though his pregnant wife Princess Almunia and her protector Rostin are fleeing with Antoine's guards after the shortest contractions of all time (less than 5 minutes or the time needed for a bush walk) to Princess Almunia A young baby is born that is hidden in some bushes in front of Antoine's guards. When Rostin tries to retrieve the little guy, he realizes that the baby was adopted by one of Lion's Pride as one of them. A year later and the evil Antoine now reigns to treat his subjects without mercy. Princess Maria has born and he has a son, but Rostin is also trying to put together a rebel gang to overthrow Antoine. The task seems hopeless can take the help of the legendary Lionman, who is more than just an animal ... <br /> <br /> This Turkish-Greek co-production was led by Natuk Baytan as Natuch Baitan and is one unique movie. I found it weirdly bad, but at the same time very entertaining. The script never seems to be serious, it is sometimes a pretty funny movie, it moves like a rocket and is never boring or boring. Part of the English dubbed dialogue is funny in the context of what is happening on the screen. None of this makes sense, we're getting a boy raised by Lion, a bad king, betrayal, dark family secrets, moles that form the shape of Lion, in an element of the story that existed before the kid of Lions madman was trained in battle scenes, torture scenes, in which the posts to which people are bound to wobble, old castle interiors that arbitrarily contain zip lines and gymnastic rings, idiotic villains, all of whom seem to have extensive facial hair, and a central figure with a jaw line, A house tile can be stabbed twice, its hands covered with acid (this acid can eat its way through steel trap doors, but kept in a ceramic jug!), drops over 20 feet onto a concrete floor, and still retains no serious injuries! Aslan Adam is a terribly entertaining movie. I do not think I have seen another movie that I can compare too. If you're looking for something serious, forget it, but if you like it 'bad' then it's 'good' movies and want to have fun, laugh and be entertained, then Aslan Adam should be at the top of your list stand. Totally 100% gold for bad movie fans and those who like the certain something & bizarre. On the disappointing side, Lionman gets his steel claws only 10 minutes from the end, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Director Bayten keeps things moving at a refreshing pace, even if they are anything but good during the opening fight. In one moment the boys fight on a sand dune, the next on a grassy hill with trees in the background! There is a point where Lionman uses a 'branch' for pole vault, but it's obviously just a long tube wrapped in a vine! Then there's the scene where a bloodthirsty pack of bloodhounds chases the Lionman, but the dogs used are obviously different races, including some of the most innocuous dogs ever! There are just so many individual scenes in Aslan Adam that are just funny, stupid, bizarre or all three that I could go on forever. Just look at the end, when Lionman jumps everywhere and flies the way he can fly. There is a lot of blood in Aslan Adam, though not much graphic blood or violence, a few knives and someone who has cut his hands is as graphic as it is. <br /> <br /> Technically, Aslan Adam is pretty tricky The costumes are bright and glaring with purple, yellows, reds and various other bright colors. The fight scenes are cheap, but at least the filmmakers have tried to use as much action as possible. The music seemed more like a classic ballet than an action movie and is another bizarre aspect for Aslan Adam. Acting was bad, even as a dubbing one could say that acting was bad. <br /> <br /> Aslan Adam is gold from start to finish in the end it really did. By no means can Aslan Adam be a good movie in every sense of the word, but hell is more entertaining. Maybe I have to look at it again someday just to prove to myself that I did not dream it all! The best Turkish action movie about a Lion's raised man you'll ever see, period. Proved to be popular enough to produce a sequel, Lionman II: The Witchqueen (1979).
