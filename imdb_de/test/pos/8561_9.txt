I agree that this film has achieved its goals perfectly. I saw it late at night as a teenager on Showtime, and again in college. I thought it was funny. And there are breasts everywhere! It seems that a lot of such films were produced in the late 70's and 80's, from R-Rated movies like "Porkys" to "Soft Core" au pair girls. It's a shame that they seem to have fallen by the wayside. The thing that made HOTS great was that, just like the two previous films, it's incredibly fun. HOTS is like a girl-power version of "Animal House," where girls form a sort of sisterhood and engage in campus chaos. By the way, whoever designed the girl outfits from "Hooters" must surely have seen this movie.
