The movie Haggard is one of the funniest films of all time. It contains the cast of CKY (the movies) and also has a great soundtrack. If you've seen CKY or Viva La Bam, you'll find that all of them (of those two) are in it. Including Bams parents and many other people. <br /> <br /> The story is about Ryan Dunn's girlfriend Glauren (Jennifer Rivall) cheating on him and he tries to talk to her. He does this by having Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo) vandalize their house. There are many different characters with many different stories. <br /> <br /> There is great music on the soundtrack. Bands like Him & Her, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and the Stooges Pop and New Order. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Viva La Bam or CKY (the movies), I doubt you'll like that. If you like the stuff, this movie is great.
