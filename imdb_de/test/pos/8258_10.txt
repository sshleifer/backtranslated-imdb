Please, why not put this awesome movie on DVD, I have been looking for years like the previous author, what is holding or showing on TV. His underrated is one of the most romantic and beautifully written books I've ever read, and I think I've read a lot. I think it was read on Radio 4, but I can not find it either. Why do not you try to do it again? I promise it will be the top earner. People love these kinds of stories. So either let them go and take us out of our misery or make it new, though I doubt it could be improved. If somebody went to earth from the same author or saw the movie with Jennifer Jones, it's great, but maybe not the same.
