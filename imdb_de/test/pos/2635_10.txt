This film is an excellent example of the size of the 80s. Oh, do not get me wrong, most of the music was sucked then. I just always liked the metal bands from the 80s. Bands with balls. Forget this tiny keyboard crap and all life is terrible and I want to kill garbage. But the movies from the 80s are the best. They were all about nonsense and just had fun. This movie illustrates that! Party! Nude take off Let's lay down WOOOOOOHOOOOO!
