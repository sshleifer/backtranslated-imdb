Undoubtedly the best drama / comedy show on TV. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16-year-old daughter who explores life and finds out not just things about the world, but herself as well. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) strives to find a way to stay in touch with her daughter, but to put her on the right track, which is becoming increasingly difficult throughout the show. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), who has entered a world of books and learning, is just beginning to discover boys and their own sense of rebellion, which surprises both. With the help of Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) and Sookie St.James (Melissa McCarthy) and a tremendous variety of other fun characters, this show is without a doubt one of my favorites. What truly excels the show is the complex, yet incredible and witty writing that often uses references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.
