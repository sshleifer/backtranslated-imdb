The important things first. <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons is a much better and totally different film than the Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> After the recent series of comic films, remakes are being made and questionable resurrections of older franchises. It's refreshing to see a very solid and entertaining movie that does not include shaky cam filming techniques, lens flare, excessive GCI and superior action sequences. Angels and Demons feel almost old-fashioned in this regard. It offers a good and thoughtful debate on the age-old topic of religion against science, providing insight into the parallels between the great houses of God in Rome (beautifully shot casually) and the Temple of Modern Science, CERN is big hadron collider facility. <br /> <br /> Hanks pretends to be the smart guy, and he adapts the role much better than his wood performance in Da Vinci the second time around. A good support provides an absolutely solid cast. A special highlight is the Stoic Cardinal of Armin Mueller-Stahl. But the main thing of the movies is the tempo. Throughout the term, I was totally involved in the story, and the movie never really gave me time to explain its logic mistakes. <br /> <br /> My only serious criticism is that the illustrated science is something at best about the authenticity of the real world. But this is not the fault of the filmmakers, but an observation of the old adage that one should never allow the truth of a good story to get in the way. <br /> <br /> Talking about the story is a cracker, a mix of adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and one or two nice twists. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would recommend this to all fans of national treasure films (this is clearly imitated, but with a much more serious mood and fans of adventure stories in general.
