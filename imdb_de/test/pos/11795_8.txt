When Detective Mickey Hayden stumbles through life in an alcoholic haze in a filthy police station, it's hard to say that he has a sure sense of reality right from the start, but if a blow to the head unleashes terrible psychic visions, it will difficult really funny. Soon he is on the trail of a serial killer, unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice. <br /> <br /> The role of a bitter burnout seems to be tailor made for Keifer Sutherland and he does that the most. The plot is a typical serial killer, but it has enough quirks, twists, and real surprises to lift it above the usual genre price and even catch up on a painful, low budget. (One wonders what that movie might have been, if the money would have taken a few bounds and a few more shots.) All in all, "After Alice" is a nice change for everyone, but for fans of Lewis Carroll's "Alice "Books are a real treat. From the crazy reality where things are rarely as they seem, to obvious references - to a murderer named "The Jabberwocky" who leaves playing cards on the bodies of his victims, there is an "Alice" reference turn. Below is a list of those I've discovered. Since half of the fun is to find them myself, I marked them as spoilers. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> Character occupation <br /> <br/> Mickey - in a sense He is Alice himself, who wanders through strange landscapes and encounters strange characters, but Harvey recognizes his true nature and identifies him as the unfortunate, awkward White Knight. <br /> <br /> John Hatter (Mickey's boss) - Is he really "angry"? You are the judge <br /> <br /> Claudette - An African-American transvestite. Obviously, Black Queen Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests the Queen of Hearts. Gideon Wood - Suspected of Being the Jabberwocky killer, his ambiguous role suggests more of a snitch (or maybe a bujum). Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to "Wonderland" and his name reminiscent of another famous movie rabbit makes me think he must be the White Rabbit <br /> <br /> Vera Swann - Her last name and her relationship with Mickey point to the White Queen. <br /> <br /> Other connections <br /> <br /> Mickey's adventures begin when he chases a man in white and drops a (rabbit) hole. <br /> <br /> Mickey says drunk to his cat, he should stop grinning (Cheshire Cat). <br /> <br /> The killer is revealed "through the mirror glass". <br /> <br /> The climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards, just like Alice's adventure. <br /> <br /> The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
