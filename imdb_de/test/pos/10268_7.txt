From today's perspective, it's pretty ridiculous to rate this movie 18 (or X in the US). The film has a sexual and yet sublime erotic story to tell, but the pictures are rather innocent. Throughout the film, you can feel and see the spirit of the late '60s and early' 70s in fashion, dialogues and the typical experimental cinematography and lighting. And that's what makes it worth seeing.
