I have to say that this film had a great cast, places, music and camerawork. Cameron Diaz was great, she had a very exciting role, very exciting, while Jordana Brewster had a serious role, but still played a role. jordana is very nostalgic for me, it reminds me of a classmate of mine! What really impressed me in this movie was the very carefully planned camera works and the choice of places. The story is very clever. It is a must. Those who are in mystery films should see these, I guarantee you all that you will stay in your seats until the very end.
