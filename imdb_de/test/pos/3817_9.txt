The Outer Limits is a brilliant show, which usually leaves me with very strong emotions. There are undoubtedly some stinker episodes, but it's essentially an old Pulp comic turned into a TV show, so this is to be expected. Mostly it's done well, well produced and staged, and often equipped with some great talents who seem to enjoy a solid translation from short stories to hours of television. <br /> <br /> The Outer Limits tends to focus on fairly large ethical / philosophical / moral issues and rarely ends without the voice that inspires serious thought. <br /> <br /> From time to time the themes are hammered a bit too hard except for the fat spectators. While a degree of mistrust of the government is conducive to effective democracy, unfortunately you can catch several episodes at this border absurd in terms of distrust of the army / CIA, and so on. Another note is that every large group of power (the Roman Catholic Church, the Evangelicals, the People's Republic of China, etc.) is thrown in a bad light in a frequency from once to often. <br /> <br /> During the show, hitting a dead horse when it is seen enough, the overall quality is amazing and I am grateful that Sci-Fi has decided to send it on until a DVD set for Season is produced (and I can afford it).
