The Jazz Singer is one of several films made about Jewish experiences in the United States in the late 1940s and 1950s. Apart from Crossfire (1947) and Gentleman's Agreement (1947), which dealt with anti-Semitism, they usually had a background in music theater. These films included The Jolson Story (1946), Jolson Sings Again (1949), The Eddy Duchin Story (1951), The Eddie Cantor Story (1953), The Benny Goodman Story (1956) and Margorie Morningstar (1958). The main characters of these "Jewish" films were always played by non-Jews. For example, Larry Parks, a non-Jew, played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme tangible to a mainly non-Jewish audience. The jazz singer (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic, and Peggy Lee was certainly not a Jew, though she plays a non-practicing Jewish woman in the film. The key to her background is when she goes to Golding's family dinner before she arrives, she says, "I have not been to a Sader since I left home." <br /> <br /> The film is about a Cantor son who has just left the service after seeing action in Korea. His dilemma is to become cantor, family tradition or singer in music theater. His choice of the theater leads to an inevitable conflict with his father. <br /> <br /> But there's a lot more to this movie. This film was created after the Rosenberg trial during the McCarthy Whitchhunts and the Hollywood Blacklist. Therefore, the Jews in this film are shown as good loyal citizens and are American Americans. The synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. The Cantors' friends also talk about baseball. One of them is a referee of the Major League. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington is said to have visited. That's why Jews are portrayed as part of American society. Nobody in this film has an Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. In this movie, you'll see how she sings "Lover" and "Just One of Those Things" wonderfully. Danny Thomas is pretty believable and he plays and sings the role very well. The comedy routines could have been left out. Yes, the film is schmackig and sentimental, but worth seeing. I really enjoyed it.
