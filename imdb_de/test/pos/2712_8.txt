I also did not know Karen Carpenter and Richard personally, so I have to remember how the film portrayed them. I think a better person who asks for accuracy would be her brother Richard. After all that I have seen and experienced from Karen, I felt her pain, shared her grief, and she was a very special person to me when I was growing up. I know that I was only born in 1965, so I did not meet her as often as some older fans, but I definitely grew up with her music and have fond memories of her music. I remember the song about "Radio" (every sha la la whoa ... so good ...) etc. and I remember, "We just started! Actually, I memorize many, many of their songs learned and some people (some) tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to it !!! (I'm not joking about it.) I was anorexic during high school and part of college (1978-1987) too and weighed somewhere between 82 pounds and finally 120 pounds in 1987. I developed some serious health issues that help me identify with the actress Karen is showing in the movie The mother (Agnes) was very much like my mother in many and I was able to To feel the pain that Karen had experienced, because my mother often felt uncomfortable, critical and disapproving of Agnes's (if that was the exactitude) movie was helpful in recognizing and getting to know Karen A somewhat personal Here Note by not only listening to her music, but also seeing what she's just gone through To represent a person's entire life in 2-3 hours and tell every detail perfectly, I have to say that there's probably no biography that is so accurate. But I will give this story an 8! I wish I had known Karen personally! I would have met with her !! I wanted to shake her hand, hug her, or talk to her. I feel her warmth and love when I hear one of her songs and she is greatly missed.
