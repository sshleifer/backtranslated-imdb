SUI generis. People, I will not lie to you; Merhige is a miracle for one or two hits, but what a movie (almost excuses SUSPECT ZERO). Nor will I pretend that I fully understand it; Half of what it does to what it is is an attempt to guess what the hell they are doing on screen because of the chiaroscuro. Richard Corliss says, "real, three biblical stories - Creation, the Nativity and Jesus' torture and death on Golgotha." This is not a bad description, but it seems to be more than the seemingly one-to-one correspondence. <br /> <br /> There is an environmental issue very close to the surface. (after the barren landscape) there are large pipes that are not unlike those on a construction site. Oh no, he will tell how people rape Mother Nature. You rarely see a dead metaphor in action and with so much exaggeration, but seeing that it has turned out to be effective is far worse than the language implicates soundtrack, it has the necessary atrocities. But for me and others like me, it's an important art film that deserves to be published by the Criterion collection. At the top with Murnau's FAUST. <br /> <br /> ~ Ray
