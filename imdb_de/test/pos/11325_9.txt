This lasted several years, although it was late. <br /> <br /> Like many crime stories of the 80s, it looked cold. Both physically and figuratively. That's not a bad thing. And the (obviously) low budget actually worked in his favor. At a time when it was "slippery," it was stubborn. <br /> <br /> Allan Royal's wraparound segments when the newscaster gave him a small edge. <br /> <br /> The only actors I remember were Scott Nyland's earthquake) and Tony Rosato (SCTV). Casting barely known people was a good thing because you could see the group as a whole and not as a group of people supporting a "star". And yes, this is a young Clark Johnson (Homicide) in a recurring place. <br /> <br /> I hope a DVD release is in the future. Someone out there wants to get that done?
