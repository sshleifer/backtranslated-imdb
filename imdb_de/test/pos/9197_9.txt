This is probably one of those films, too many commented on, but undiscovered ... This is probably a masterpiece of Spanish cinema like a masterpiece by Bu√±uel. "15 days with you" could be the better "now and her". Revisiting other films from a long time ago: could be "Midnight Cowboy", but could also be "Les amants du Pont-Neuf" or a realistic and not realistic -spot-look (but most realistic) "trainspotting". This hard story has room for humor, love and obviously dramatic sense. In the new social Spanish cinema, this little diamond could be the revival of Italian neo-realism mixed with the best of Ken Loach films. <br /> <br /> Probably the better movie I've discovered in the last 10 years.
