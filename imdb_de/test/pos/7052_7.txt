As a young teenager, when this came out, I was busy with it. As an adult in today's sex-obsessed American culture, he does not have enough nudity to be considered tame. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for American Pie Art, the Meatballs will be disappointed with impunity and warranty. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill Murray and like good, clean fun, you'll probably like this movie and enjoy it. Similar to Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shack, etc. <br /> <br /> Well, look at it and stop intellectualizing it. They are meatballs to cry aloud! Why read a review? Just enjoy and have fun. And ignore the garbage talk of others. Movies, like so many other things in life, are subjective. To each his own <br /> <br /> Always beware of the "expert" who reduces the taste of other people.
