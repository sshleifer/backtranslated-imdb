This is a fascinating documentary about a 15-year-old black boy who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and subsequent trials. This movie shows how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it really can be to convict an innocent man, and how a senile old fool who thinks that a black man looks very much like another? said he was the man who murdered my wife. The star is the defender, who not only excelled his work in court, but also did what the police should have been doing all the time. Fascinating stuff. 7 out of 10.
