One can not take this film seriously ... the plot is predictable and banal, acting often exaggerated, the dialogue ridiculous; but that makes a lot of fun! Three "career girls" in the late 1950s find their way into the BIG city and all the evils and temptations their mothers probably warned them about: married men, alcohol, premarital sex, abortion, etc. Then there's Amanda Farrell (Joan Crawford), who had a professional success, but whose private life was sacrificed to an office with her name on the door. <br /> <br /> This film may have been credible 50 years ago, but now it's just great camping fun! Rent / buy and enjoy.
