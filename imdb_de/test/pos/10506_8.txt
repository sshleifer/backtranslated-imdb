Undoubtedly, this film will not be well received by some, as the horror is mostly mental. But there is something for almost everyone, including some really cool alien abduction scenes. The film takes full advantage of the alien abduction mythology, but also shows a little more intelligence about some facets of abduction myths than you would expect from a movie. Jillian McWhirter is excellently in a grueling performance.
