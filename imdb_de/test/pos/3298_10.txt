I had the pleasure to see this movie at the Big Bear Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved, because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and escalates constantly. It also has a great tension of tension going through it. They do not know what will happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor is not the most ideal person to live with. The jokes are fast and unexpected. The plot lets us guess. The dialogue feels very real. I thought the direction was first-rate and director Travis Davis showed a lot of potential to grow up in the world of studio comedies. Not a small praise, considering that he is also the lead actor of the film, so he had to do this in triplicate, writing, directing and starring. If you can watch this movie in iTunes, it's worth downloading. It will make you laugh a few times aloud. And that's more than most shorts offer today.
