WOW, a masterpiece of a movie you should not miss. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what this movie was when I started late at night. I did not find out it was a Stone movie until I went to IMDb after the movie. When I saw it, I was fascinated. The cast, especially Eric Bogosian, is just great. One of the best screenplays and cinematographic work ever ... The movie drew me in and fascinated me until the end ... I did not dare, for fear of missing something, blinking So captivating and well done while watching movies with a huge budget that offers tons of action and computer-generated special effects that can be incredibly boring. Do not miss this movie ...
