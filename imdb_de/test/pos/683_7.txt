I saw this as a kid for the first time (THE LITTLE RASCALS was first seen on television the year I was born) and recently bought it on DVD. In between, I have seen it on the occasions and made careful notes to 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: Farina as a Nubian slave, for example voodoo. I think Roach and McGowan were beaten to death if they tried. <br /> <br /> Note how the cake in Three Stooges' HALFWITS-HOLFAY and sweet PIE and PIE are similar to this one ... and this movie appeared several years before their first contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. Obviously, there was some inspiration from SS and Laurel & Hardy's THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY for these films ... Remember, back in the day, they all stole themselves from the best !!! <br /> <br /> One more note: Laurel & Hardy Buffs, this back-sale lady was none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared in TBOTC - the 'flapper' who got in her car and it in the Heck got. I always miss, why she was never credited?
