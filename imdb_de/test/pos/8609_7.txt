Pretty good for a French movie. I have not seen any of Catherine Breillat's previous films and therefore have no opinion on them compared to their previous work. The French cinema usually keeps to the last Arty movies and leaves the shoot em-ups and star vehicles Hollywood. This is probably a good business strategy, as probably no other nation's film industry will have the resources to compete on such projects. Movies about filmmaking are often boring as they do not appeal to people who are not in business. But this interested me much more than I thought. Despite the title (weird in English) it's not really a comedy despite some droll moments. I've just seen a few of Anne Parillaud's films, but she shows a generous amount of talent and reach, from the action / psychological drama of "La Femme Nikita" to the dry comedy "Innocent Blood". This film also expands its spectrum as it plays a more or less ordinary woman, yet captivating on the canvas. A big compliment to Roxane Mesquida, with whom I was unfamiliar. She plays for the most part of the film a very expressionless actress whose talent is pulled out in the end. If you have no chases and explosions to entertain, check them here.
