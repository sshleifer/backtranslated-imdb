Apart from that, I really have nothing to add to the other comments: For me, the film looked like a silent movie slowly adapting to the sound. The text boards that brought the story reinforced that impression. On the way the actors were allowed to leave the stilt-like, theater-like acting; Marguerite Churchill looks like a typical heroine of the early silent movie at the beginning of the film, but leaves at the end finer expressions. Gus, the Swede? Reminded me of the cartoon characters of the Shakespeare tunes, and Windy sounded to me like an early Donald Duck. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised that everything was done outside, on site and even if the dust of all cars, horses and livestock obscured the view, it must have been so for the real settlers! It was also clear to me that many of these Indians had been real, and I have not found any obvious racism against them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a true Wayne fan through John Ford's cavalry trilogy and thought that Stage Coach was Wayne's first star, this film was a revelation. The plot is very simple and reminds me again of a silent movie, but the sand is really real! An amazing movie made in 1930 using this technique and under these conditions.
