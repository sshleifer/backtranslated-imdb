I think this movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I think Debbie Reynolds is weird and the chemistry between her and Glenn Ford is perfect. There is no boring moment in the movie and Debbie looks beautiful as always. <br /> <br /> The story is about a showgirl Maggie (Debbie Reynolds) meeting a destitute soldier Joe (Glenn Ford). She dislikes him, but after accidentally tearing her dress, he gives it back to her on the condition that she seeks a date with him. They marry in the evening when they have a date after just one kiss. Joe and Maggie move to Spain and find that they have nothing in common, except physical attraction. Therefore, Maggie suggests that they live for a month, but not as a man and a woman, which means Joe can not kiss or sleep with Maggie, much to Joe's frustration. A funny plot and a wonderful movie. Not to miss.
