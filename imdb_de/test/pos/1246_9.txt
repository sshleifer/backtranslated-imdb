I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, there has been disrespect throughout the movie, but Bruce Willis learned from The Kid that it's more valuable to reject others, and that his life of disrespect must change. This movie was a refreshing change from the trash that Hollywood is trying to push down our necks. There are some very good lessons to learn in this film. I really think that this was one of the best Disney's, even if a few things could be left out. I was impressed by the lack of cursing and sexual inuendo. It's not perfect, but much better than most other things out there.
