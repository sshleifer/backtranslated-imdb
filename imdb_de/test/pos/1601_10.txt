I saw this movie many years ago and absolutely hated it - I could not wait until it ended and would have gone out, but a girl was lying on my shoulder. You know what? I never forgot that movie, and I would say that he keeps following me with his pictures and his music. How many movies did I cry and laugh at the movie house and then forget, as soon as I'm on the street, how ... You see, I can not think of one thing! Less common are films such as Death in Venice, which invade your consciousness and change your work. The French like to say that film is an art, and films like this prove that they are right. I give 10 stars, of the 3 that I gave the night when I saw it.
