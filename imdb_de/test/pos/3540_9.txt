I have to say, when it comes to Book to Movie Adaptations, the BBC rarely lets me down. Now for this mini-series. I love the Starling Novel, it's by far the best murder / mystery I've ever read. The mini series defiantly made my day when I saw it. The primary story was preserved almost perfectly. The characters agree well with the novel, the personalities and behaviors were just right for Red and Jez. I thought Duncan was as good as Kate, Eric was too much of a simple character, he had a little more depth in the book, but they also changed his Substory, so maybe that had to change. Of course, there are changes, but most are cosmetic, but I found some disappointment in the deal with the murder of Eric. That changed the whole dynamic between Red and Eric for the movie and they cut off the triathlon training Jez did. Some of the other events in this book have been modified to suit the viewer. All in all, if you liked the book, you will like it, if you like the miniseries, then you will love the book. I have to say, this is the most accurate adaptation of Book to Movie I've ever seen.
