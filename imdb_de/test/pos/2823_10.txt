This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can lead to nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more common in men than in women, so I felt even more uncomfortable seeing the actress's behavior. I think women think about this behavior, but I do not think they act on it. The dark scenes added the sense of evil that had to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was confident that the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but not. Maybe that's more realistic. Life seems to be moving in the same direction instead of creating a new riverbed that leads up the hill.
