Pity about the Monkees. People always accused them of being made (what they were) or nothing but an American The Beatles (again, what they were), but for the children of the time, when they really were, they were important, they were legitimate , Discussing who was better The Monkees or the Beatles were common in schoolyards, but the critics never really got involved. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop songs, the Monkess did not have much respect for their albums. Unfortunately, her only movie car experienced a similar fate, even though it is the best band movie ever. Beatles fans may say that "Hard Days Night" was better and I'm sure many kids thought "8 Mile" was superior, but none of these movies was as daring and imaginative as "Head" and that's probably the reason why he failed. <br /> <br /> If Head had told a direct A to B story, that would have appealed to the young fans of the band, but through the envelope and the opportunity of the film to make fun of their own image, Could They Really Sabotage The Movie? Could you Imagine Eminem Turning To The Camera And Actually Talking About How Sad It Is That He's The Best Selling Man In A Genre In Which Only 5% (And I'm Generous) Files are white. If you can imagine, then you have an idea of ​​how brave it was for the Monkess to sing, "Hey, hey, we are the Monkees, you know, we like it, a finished picture without philosophy." If you have a movie in which Frank Zappa Davy says he should focus less on dancing and more on the music, it becomes clear that there is much more going on than you expected. <br /> <br /> The story, What's up, concerns the boys trying to escape their manager, who eventually forces them to play dandruff in a commercial, but every time they run away, they end up in a box. I do not think you have to be Fellini to find out the symbolism of this piece. A few nice little comedy pieces follow with Davy as boxer, who has to give up playing the violin to make a dive in the big game, and Peter refuses to throw away an ice cream cone he does not want because starving children are so wrong They food, but the real selling point of this film is the music and the best band the band has ever recorded. Even if you are deterred by history, you can sit back and enjoy great music. <br /> <br /> Any movie that starts Mickey's suicide attempt by jumping off a bridge (the band follows at the end). If you're a fan of the band or experimental cinema of the era, you'll enjoy this movie ,
