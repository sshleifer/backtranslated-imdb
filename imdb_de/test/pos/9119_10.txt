I saw this movie by accident. I was standing on 42nd Street, waiting for a bus to go home, and a sister started giving out free tickets for a preview of this movie. I gave him a chance not to expect much. I've seen on the subway walls that this movie does not do it justice. <br /> <br /> The film is about a young rocker going on a journey to learn the craft and the art of Heavy Metal. The movie is a heavy comedy and a lot of fun. If you're old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the 1980s, you'll love this movie. Jack Black is an incredibly talented comedian and actor Provided he has really written and performed the songs in this film, he is also a talented musician. <br/> <br /> Tenacious D is definitely worth a look!
