During the last convulsions of the Vitnam War, our central figure, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), is sent by the CIA to an illegal one-man mission to a rogue US Navy commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who is allegedly murdered has been "insane" to murder, but who successfully leads a private cross-border war from his base in Cambodia, a neutral and thus forbidden country. The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does Since he is being driven by an undisciplined and terrorized naval patrol boat crew to murder the Da Nang, Kurtz is a great metaphor for the excesses, decadence, and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon Psyche: If we do not understand something and we can not control it, destroy it. Kurtz had finally learned this. <br /> <br /> If you do not fully pay attention to every emotional gesture, every word of dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two are alone in Kurtz's darkness, Lair, you become one of the central themes miss this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with his hangman, his one-sided 'surrender' in return for Willard, who agrees (he nods?), Kurtz 'son' (another metaphor for us, the next generation watching the movie) the truth about to tell all the horrors they both saw in Vietnam are amazing things. The connection between the two men, while Kurtz Willard scrutinizes, interlaced with some of his own horror stories, is unbelievable, no, awesome, film. The final (intercut) scene of the ritual slaughter of a victim is the most powerful symbol. Coppolla has deliberately or not delivered the ultimate anti-war message that should resonate over the centuries.
