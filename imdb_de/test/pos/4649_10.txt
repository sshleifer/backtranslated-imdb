This is my favorite movie of all time! <br /> <br /> I remember seeing that when I was younger and since then I'm in love. I rented it so often in that one video shop that used to carry it, and when we moved, I could not find it, so I'll go back to the faraway shop just so I could watch the movie again! Finally I found it for sale and bought it and watched it again and again .... great movie! <br /> <br /> It's been my first DVD since I got my DVD player ... OK, I got it at the same time, the quality of the DVD is a lot better, I could not believe! You have to see this!
