This is one of the best films by Peter Sellers. Why is it never shown on TV or in the cinema? Will it ever appear as a home theater? Is it too derogatory for the medical sector? I would like to see this movie again. I want my son, the doctor, sees it. Laughter is the best medicine and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for it.
