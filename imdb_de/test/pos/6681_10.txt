If you enjoyed the Butterfly effect, Donnie Darko or The Machinist, you will also enjoy K-Pax. <br /> <br /> For me, this film really felt uplifting and depressing at the end. Spacey does a great job as a prot. Let's not forget the appearance of Saul Williams in the movie that I'm a big fan of. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I recommended the movie to many of my friends and everyone was blown away. <br /> <br /> But it's still very underrated, maybe because of the lack of action and explosions. I'm sorry, this is not a movie about blasting things, it's about how people behave and how people live in worlds that do not exist. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and enjoy it.
