"Dope Sick Love" is a truly remarkable documentary for HBO about two pairs of heroin addicted lovers roaming the streets of NYC. I accidentally caught it one night and found it absolutely mesmerizing. There is no narration and we never see interviews with the motives, the camera follows them like a third eye that is completely detached. The people being persecuted do not seem to realize that they are being filmed! (or at least they do not seem to care). The material is amazingly open. Some of the most open ones I've ever seen. This is as real as it gets. The nuts and bolts of being on the street and being addicted to heroin. We watch them rate, shoot, make up, shove and even spend the police as a man robbing Dope to rob the humans, and about a million other tiny details that less attentive documentary filmmakers would be missing out on. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots are really awful. As if he had been looking for a guy who was desperately looking for Fix, he lost. I prayed he would find it just so his misery would end temporarily. And when he finds it, the guy literally dances on the street. <br /> <br /> The cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very clear during the enrollment. EVERYTHING is about getting the next score for these people, but the next score seems to be worth the tremendous effort they are going through. <br /> <br /> I would like to receive a copy if anyone knows where it is available. Highly recommended if you can catch it on HBO.
