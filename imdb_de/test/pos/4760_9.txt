He is currently playing but with a calm intensity that makes him one of the best cops in film history. Roy Scheider plays the main role in the French Connection of a poor man, who has a little bit of the same charm. FC is a better movie, but I prefer this movie because 1) Scheider I think is great and this is his best movie Bill Hickman who actually plays the driver). It does not hurt that Tony LoBianco plays (again) a bad guy. Please enjoy.
