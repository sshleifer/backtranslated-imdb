This movie surprised me. I make a habit of learning about movies as little as possible before the visit, as trailers and reviews offer spoilers for spoilers. When I walked into the theater, all I knew was that it was a documentary about a long married couple, and the IMDb readers gave it a 7.8, the users of Rotten Tomatoes rated it 7.9 and the critics did on average a staggering 8.2! If anything, they infiltrated this little gem. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents "for posterity", and at the beginning of the film we were offered the required interviews with his parents, the mother Mina, and less than the upcoming father, Mike. I found this pair immediately interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (Mike & Minas son Doug) was going to take us. I actually doubt that Doug himself knew where to go with this movie. <br /> <br /> Life takes unexpected twists and turns, and this beautiful expressive film follows the journey. It's hard to say how I moved with this story and the unique way it was told. Absolutely fascinating from start to finish and it's really a must, even if you're not a fan of the documentary genre. This film lets you think about your own life and possibly evoke memories that you thought you would have forgotten for a long time. "51 Birch Street" is one of those rare cinematic experiences that will leave a deep impression and never leave you. The best news of all is that HBO has been involved in the production. Instead of playing in front of a limited art house audience, millions of people will finally have a chance to see this incredible piece. BRAVO!!!!!!!!
