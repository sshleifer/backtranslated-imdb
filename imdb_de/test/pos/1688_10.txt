When I saw this movie for the first time in mid-January (2005) I did not like it. I found it too funny and thought that some parts that the main star Judith Light behaved were as different as they were. (Which of course is true.) And then I saw a little bit of it the next day when it aired again, and I felt pretty much alike. Then I took a look at it two Sundays ago (March 20, 2005) and it was really fun, and this time I recorded the whole thing. I even cried the first two times, but mostly because the actress was actually crying and I'm a big fan of her. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a great job in this movie! I watch it over and over again. It's a sad movie, but very good. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it! It's not usually my kind of movie, but I enjoyed this movie! A +++
