In addition to minor flaws, this film is a masterpiece and definitely the best war movie I have ever seen. Not to mention that it's one of the best movies I've seen in all genres. I may have already written this for no-man's-land, but now I think it's better. It is very sad at the end, and I almost cried after the two shocking scenes were within 5 minutes of the movie's end. <br /> <br /> Karel's performance as a protagonist was intriguing, though he was a novice given his age. This movie makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least gets you) and you hate all kinds of war and political BS. The flashbacks to the prison hospital make the movie even more delicious. <br /> <br /> A minor flaw of the film is the non-British accents allegedly British people. Most Britons on the screen were actually British, but what about those who are supposed to be British and speak with a foreign accent? That really did not fit in this charming movie. But it's pretty much the only mistake I've noticed. Effects could also be a bit better, but we all remember a lot of movies from a particular country that have huge effects and absolutely nothing else. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is an absolute masterpiece and every single one should see it. If you want to travel to Czechoslovakia in the 40s and want to experience a lot of emotions at the same time virtually, this film is for you. If you do not want them, you'll feel like watching them in this movie.
