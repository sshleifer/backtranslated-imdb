A huge action movie I've ever seen. It was the first expression I pronounced after seeing him twice on local television in my country, Indonesia. A combination of constant shooting and a great fight choreography was well played by David Bradley. He was good here next to "American Samurai". His martial arts was above average. He managed to look nice on the fight scenes. Not just hit and kick, as most martial artists show in their films. David Bradley was able to use all martial arts techniques such as throwing, punching and kicking. Highly recommended for action fans. I tried to search for the DVD, but still can not get it in my city. Can someone help me?
