This must be one of the most terrifying titles ever. The kind of title that ruins a movie because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters. A title like this makes a movie a flop, even the French title is not much better. Pity, Truffaut & Deneuve must have been enough to sell them. <br /> <br /> This is a long film, but essentially worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride, her rich husband, a theft, a change of identity, and an obsessive love. The plot here is really good and leads us on an unexpected journey. <br /> <br /> The thing that works for and against the film is the focus on the relationship. It's an interesting study of how these storylines are played in a "real relationship" with these two people. Unfortunately, that's why the movie is drying up and ultimately unsatisfactory. We like movies to have a sense of finality, and that's missing here. <br /> <br /> In many of her films, Deneuve has become a screen where directors can play their fantasies. This time it does not work so well. Messy here is the fact that the director apparently just a few times from Deneuve complete. Deneuve is an actress who always looks very deliberate and thoughtful, so those attempts to make her appear spontaneous fall flat. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script had to be worked out better before shooting began to make the film tighter and shorter and snap. But Truffaut did not snap, did he? So - it moves a bit, but remains interesting.
