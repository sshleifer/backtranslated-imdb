A feature film follows the plot of the story - or at least the historical gossip -. But the Chinese, who know the story very well, because they let them see it again and again, would never tolerate it otherwise. The attention to detail is wonderful, especially for those who have read the account of Sima Qian in the historian's notes. According to Sima Qian, Jing Ke actually made an attempt on Qin Shi Huang at the request of the Crown Prince of Yan before the unification. Sima Qian explicitly mentions both General Fan's head and the dagger rolled into the card, as well as the dagger thrown into the brass column. Although Jing Ke is not called a stranger to swordplay, he is hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by Chen Kaige. Jing Ke is indeed the weakest link in this movie. In reality (again, according to Sima Qian) he was a heavy drinker and relocated his visit to Qin as long as possible. He spent a lot of time with the ladies of Yan before the Crown Prince finally ordered him to leave. He was, in short, a human and was not looking forward to death, though he was ready to accept him. Chen Kaige's Jing Ke is afraid of death, but not of his own. He is the classic reckless killer who became the Disillusioned Pacifist. His love (or perhaps only affection) for a woman and his compassion for several hundred children whom Zheng had buried alive (not even two thousand years of hostile Confucian historians claimed that Qin Shi Huang did so, even though there is a legend that 460 Confucians were buried and then beheaded) is enough to bring this former assassin to kill again. The melodrama does not convince and the character just gets boring. The spectacle here is not shabby, though it's not very interesting given the character. As for Lady Zhou, she has never appeared in all the numerous stories I heard about Qin Shi Huang. However, Gong Li is famous enough for Americans who have heard of her (thanks to Zhang Yimou) and it had to be a love interest, so here she is. It's unfortunate that her performance is almost as wooden as Jing Ke's character. She did a lot better (in Qiu Ju, for example) to be subtle; Here she hardly manages to create a presence. All this, however, is trivial compared to the extraordinary spectacle of Li Xuejian as Zheng. Qin Shi Huang is more to the Chinese than what Milton's Satan is to us: accepted as a villain, but more noble. Qin Shi Huang's achievements radiate into the present all the way over two thousand years, and Li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity. Li's power is fine, but the scope of the film is great, though photography is intentionally drab. It feels ancient. The score is appropriate and barely moving, though it is very appropriate for the action. Although I have only seen it once, I believe that Chen Kaige should be given more recognition for his camerawork than other critics have allowed him to do. The opening credits are intoxicating. If five stars are absolutely average, I gave three more for Li Xuejian's acting and Chen Kaige as an actor, writer and director.
