This movie has to be as good as John Ford did a movie. The movie is magical, a masterpiece, the reason why Ford was so good. If you want to know why Ford was so good, this explains that. <br /> <br /> The photography is of course superb, black and white like black and white should be, wonderful shots, not a conversation over the shoulder of pure Ford, great moments, big and small. The famous torn trousers of Ward Bond. Apparently, two dogs entered the set and fought, so Ford wanted to use them in the fight scene. Instead of fighting, however, the dog ran away and the other attacked Ward Bond and tore up his pants, which gave Ford no end of pleasure. An entire scene braided around a rope. The way Ben Johnson burns, then sniffs his rope, wonderful foreboding and anticipation of the finale. Harry Carey's naive admiration of caution. The usual line of being afraid and not showing it. Bond's horse accidentally fell into him and his rest in the film. Johnson and Bond are fantastic in this scene. Lord, help any Ford actor who does not stay in character while the camera rolls, even if a horse falls on you. <br /> <br /> A couple of very cute romances that do not affect the whole focus, two very sympathetic allusions, not to mention the girls, how often the cameras focus on Ben Johnson's rather delightful backside. Many old stuntmen getting lines and roles, Cliff Lyons, Frank McGrath. Some wonderful character studies, mostly faces, all bad guys and main stars. A series of villains that can compete with any group in every west. <br /> <br /> Many many Fordian shots of faces, groups, children, women, little things, foals in the background (Ford seems to love pictures of foals), women in aprons who allow the moment while wagon rivers cross and the camera lingers. <br /> <br /> This is probably not a Western, but an artist's image that happens to be playing in the West. Fortunately, the film was shot in 1950 because you can not imagine that such a movie could ever be made again, but then it's such a work of art that it would be a sacrilege to try
