I really liked this movie. In the end, it shows the viewers that Leila should keep what she had. Leila was tired of her husband Jim, who cared more about the work than about her. He was so excited about his work that he forgot her birthday. He was also very sloppy. She could not stand it any longer and went to see if he would miss her. The movie shows he misses her, he even tries to make up for the night he messed up. He goes to her and tries to bring her home. She finds another man named Schuyler. He seemed like the man she always wanted neatly and noticed her. In the end, she remembers looking at Schuyler's shoes and dropping his cigar on the floor, just as Jim did the same. Jim finishes a lot of money and cleans himself. In the end, Leila thinks she should keep her husband because that's all she really wanted and he has changed.
