Okay, let me first say that I do not particularly like anime in general. I have enjoyed some of the oft-cited "classic" series, but consider the medium as a whole just like American television: namely, that a good 90-95% of it is pure tripple, the rest falls somewhere from "observable" to "decent". So it's no wonder I do not like the self-ironic anime parodies out there. I do not get the most jokes and the medium itself enforces a certain humor that does not appeal to me at all - loud, hyperactive, low and totally over the top. <br /> <br /> So when I started to watch this series on behalf of a friend, I was disappointed after the first episodes. I assumed that the characters should be clich√©s of carved stories and that their actions should be similarly satirical. I could somehow see where it came from, but I did not think it was all that smart - lots of "crazy, funny high school shenanigans and actions, but now we're ironic." By about the third episode, my opinion changed drastically. <br /> <br /> At this point, the strengths of this series manifested itself. The quirks of the non-chronological sequence of episodes, their biting self-esteem and, above all, clever humor with (gasping) a well-executed, straight-forward man. In what I think is right This show is a rarity in any medium and offers thoughtful, witty interactions between diametrically opposed characters. Protagonist Kyon's constant sense of vaguely angry resignation provides the perfect foil for the actions of the title character Haruhi's generic "anime-like" exploits. It's a departure from the formula and it works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Based on this strong foundation, the series is successful with a truly phenomenal attention to detail. As mentioned earlier, the episodes are broadcast in chronological order. At first I thought it was a gimmick, but it works surprisingly well. The chronological sequence of events makes logical sense, but the sequence of episodes broadcast follows more closely the traditional structure of the Aristotelian drama. The chosen order leaves no narrative gaps that can not be closed by a simple conclusion (although it is possible to guess what has happened in an "unforeseen" episode "unforeseen", one still feels compelled to watch closely, how these events develop), and excellent planning prevents this from recording holes or contradictions. I saw this series a second time the first time and was amazed at how well seemingly trivial events were connected. <br /> <br /> The last point is the extreme attention to detail in every part of the series. While the "anime" designs of the stick figures leave a bit to be desired, the background art is presented exquisitely and realistically based on actual photographic references. The animation quality is excellent even at important points. For example, there is a later musical performance in the series in which the characters are actually shown how to play a song - this may sound trivial, but the unconscious effect of the (movie quality) animated film that actually corresponds to the soundtrack is unbelievable , <br /> <br /> In short, I love this series for some reason. It's inherently something I generally dislike, but its execution is so unique and well executed that I can not help it.
