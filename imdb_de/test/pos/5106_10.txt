I really enjoyed the movie and the story! I saw the original (1939, I think) and it was fun for both of them. To truly appreciate the story, one must be familiar with English culture and customs. The professor (Peter O'Toole) was dedicated to his school and the "boys" in this school. It was an English "public" school that we call a private school in the US (E. G. Andover). He is a very ascetic person and looks stiff, stuffy, callous and weak at first glance, so he is demoted. He has strict educational standards because he "cares about his boys", d. H. He does not want them to get a cheap or weak education. He gets to know (through introduction) a "Dance Hall Girl" (Petula Clark) and is totally in love. In England, the reference to "Dance Hall" at that time was associated with extreme sexual promiscuity and definitely "lower class". We find that the professor is indeed a very hard and courageous person, and he is loyal to the people and institutions he loves and / or respects. Clark becomes more than just a lover and his wife ... She lets his personality "fall" and makes him grow as a man and a person, much to the benefit of his beloved school and his own happiness. The first movie was filmed before World War II, it goes through World War II, it's also 1969 (we had the "British invasion" ... Beetles etc, Clark had hits and was very popular for me at that time), the music is great, color and photography are excellent. I think O'Toole played the character perfectly! There are dedicated people like "chips" ... all around us, but many get no recognition. Very pleasant movie and story!
