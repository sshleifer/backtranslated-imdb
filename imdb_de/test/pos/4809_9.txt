I just bought An Zhan (Run of Time) on DVD and it was an excellent movie I have to say. Not really action-packed when it comes to the game of the weapon, but definitely exciting and funny. I do not think I have seen Andy Lau better. And the editing of this movie was done very well. Take a look now if you are a fan of Lau or HK Thiller / Actionfilm!
