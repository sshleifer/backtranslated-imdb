My young aunt is unique in many ways. This is the first action movie by Hui Ya-Hung (Kara Hui). Second, she actually did the fight scenes after being operated on for a few days before filming. Third, this movie is from the chain. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Wang Lung Wei trying to take his brother's inheritance. His brother then has Kara to marry him so Wang can not take the treasure. The story is pretty good, to get everything to the right place. <br /> <br /> What comes next, I can say, what was not said for films like this or the disciples of the 36th Chamber, The Victim or even the magnificent butcher. The fight scenes are the sales movie, and this movie will have no problem with that. Liu Chia Liang and Wang Lung Wei became involved in a struggle that must be seen to be believed. Why have not these two men fought any more is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to spoil anything, but you have to see My Young aunt to experience all the excitement. My only criticism is that Yuen Tak was not used as widely as he was used in 3 Evil Masters or even Invincible Pole Fighter (8 Diagram Pole Fighter) to watch movies. 9.2 / 10
