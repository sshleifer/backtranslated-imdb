The joking and humorous rescue scene makes this film one of my favorites in the 14-movie series. Wonderful spectacle, great cast. And this movie contains one of the few, often-known facts about Sean Bean's career. The part in which he and Alice Krige of the horse fell into the water, was not written, but was left behind, since both after the appearance of acting properly acted end of Sharpe's enemy.
