Las Vegas is very funny and focuses on the substance ..... <br /> <br /> The sets are incredible and the scenes outside are breathtaking; The characters are all very funny and cool. <br /> <br /> The women are a plus. <br /> <br /> Holly Sims is as adorable as the daughter of James Caan, the security of the casino. While Josh Duhamel is very funny and shows us, it looks like he could tear everyone down. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Marcil and Nikki Cox give the special accent very funny and sometimes weird. <br /> <br /> You can just relax in this show a little and do not bring the heavy stories like the other shows that regulate the reviews ...
