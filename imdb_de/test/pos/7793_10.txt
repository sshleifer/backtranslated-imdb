The first time I saw it was when it came out (1994), and the last time I saw it, it was just before I wrote this post. Truly the smartest Bollywood comedy ever made. This is an Indian movie that earns its place in the IMDb Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan in probably one of their best performances in comedic roles. What makes this piece less classic is the weird timing and the wonderful editing. The jokes are refreshing and not cheap. This is a movie that is really ahead of its time. If you have not seen it yet, look at it now !!!!!!!!!
