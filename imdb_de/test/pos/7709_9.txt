Film Noir meets anime ... awesome! This was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative Animatrix shorts. This was one of my favorites, if not my favorite (I also loved world record). This is essentially a reference to these classic 1940s film noir detective stories and movies, except that it's animated and contains the matrix. By animating it, it's able to take the extreme camera angles, the detective's lifestyle, the shadows and everything Film Noir has taken to a whole new level. The Femme Fatale? Trinity. The detective in this story seems to live in his mind in the '40s, but stuck in a modern world, and everything gets too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents as a mysterious black woman walks into his office , , <br /> <br /> My grade: 9/10
