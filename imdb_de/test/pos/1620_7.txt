As with many films of this kind, my non-Catholicism interfered with my understanding. The church has this mass of rules that have been put together for centuries. We only have a short time to learn it and have to accept it at face value. Then you throw in some bad guys who take revenge on them for a long distance, work by these rules and try to get around them, and you have this book and this movie. I thought, "That's pretty cool, why did they do that?" There is this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character, where he always seems to take the right first step, no matter what the topic. I think it's like watching CSI, where they solve incredibly complex cases within days. You know the location of the country. There's so much land in this movie and so little time to really understand what's going on. However, if you create Robert Langdon, you must hire him to work. That's okay because heroic nerds like him have saved the day forever. I found the movie funny. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think. This is a wonder that you can look at and never stops for a second.
