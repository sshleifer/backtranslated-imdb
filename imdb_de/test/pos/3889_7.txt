Any movie starring Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman, and Amy Sedaris in the side cast must be seen, and comic actor Jeff Garlin uses the great talent he recruited for his directorial debut in 2007, a sad sack comedy about a man's overweight, who does not feel with the world around him. Known as Larry David's manager Jeff on Curb Your Enthusiasm, Garlin James, a still-tedious 39-year-old Chicago actor still living with his widowed mother, plays. His self-esteem is so low that he can not meet women, but it's the weird way he views his status that brings with him his dilemma. If the plot sounds a bit familiar, it's because the film is partly a tribute to the 1955 Ernest Borgnine classic "Marty" about a lonely Bronx Butcher who lives with his unanimous mother. In fact, Garlin uses "Marty" as the piece that James desperately wants to do, as he is so sensitive to the character's situation. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a kind of love story in this new millennium version Silverman plays Beth, an unpredictable, sexually insatiable ice cream parlor server who takes him on a shopping spree with underwear. Their best joint scene is in his favorite convenience store, where different characters are improvised in different aisles. Hunt plays a lonely primary school teacher who shares a passion for jazz musician Ben Webster with James. They accidentally meet at a record store and then again on a career day at their school, where he reveals his sexual neurosis in front of a first-grade classroom, including his best friend Luca Pert's daughter Penelope (played by Dakota Fanning), baby sister Elle). In a jammed cameo that looks pretty much like Jerri Blank, Sedaris plays the school's advisor, who talks to James about his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquesi plays Luca, a retirement home manager, and his scenes with Garlin have a simple relationship that makes it easy to believe their friendship. Almost stealing the film is actress Mina Kolb, who plays James' pixilated mother with pluck and heart. <br /> <br /> There are also unexpected cameos by teen idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon's setup is funny), as well as sharply played pieces by director Paul Mazursky (as a meandering director of an open-camera series "Smear Job") Tim Kazurinsky (as the unsuspecting victim of this show) and Dan Castellaneta (as a hard convenience store owner). Garlin's comic feelings are similar to those of Albert Brooks, and his informal dialogue at its best reminds me of "Modern Romance" and "Defending Your Life." The only problem I had with the movie is up and down, as some scenes were pulled out longer than necessary. The problem is more obvious in the first half when Garlin tries to set the right pace, and the lack of real conflict adds to the sluggishness. What he does well, however, is the prisoner of desperation felt by the revelation that life is not what it should be, that one significant other can not be within reach, and that a constant diet of junk food is on The bonnet is the only safe when it comes to satisfaction.
