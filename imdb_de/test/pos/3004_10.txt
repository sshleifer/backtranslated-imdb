I would give this TV series a plus of 10 if I could. The authors were "in the fix" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show. These characters were so real. It can be said that the two main actresses Mrs. Toussaint & Mrs. Potts were genuine in their relationship between camera and camera. It did not end until you hear these familiar words "cut" at the end of a "take". The show has me a lot about life for z. Historical struggles, tragedies and triumphs, relationships, everyday situations, every household has the same situations no matter who the members are. It was really just a wonderful family show that at the end of each episode, you can just sit in the living room couch and say, "Well, what did I learn from this episode?" <br /> <br /> I have to say that I have recorded most episodes and I look at them over and over again. <br /> <br /> Now you know why I gave him a 10+ !!
