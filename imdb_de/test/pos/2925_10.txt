One of the most enjoyable aspects of watching movies is losing yourself in a movie. They totally washed it over so you can absorb it the way it is and experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, "The Egyptian" is such a movie. Over the years, it's a picture critics love to hate. Many have thrown darts at their vulnerabilities. Or maybe it's the sound the movie brings, not the most obvious features. It is immediately repellent, distant, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies in it! The haunting chords of the music, which can be seen above the 20th-Fox logo, lead us to titles with other secular turquoise lettering. <br /> <br /> Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! It's like descending into a vault of antiquity where great treasures might be mixed with uncertain dangers. (One would imagine that Darryl Zanuck commands: "Do it ancient!") What a dark, dramatic story unfolds in the same tone that was set at the beginning. <br /> <br /> From Hollywood's '50s Egyptian trilogy', 'The Ten Commandments' portrayed the severity of civilization, the phenomenal land of the pharaohs, its 'nuts', while 'The Egyptian' shows everything from glamor to the tragedy, to surprise us. <br /> <I do not have to say much about the players here, but I think that Bella Darvi will be redeemed over time. What a perfect face for the role, straight from a symbolist painting. If her acting does not please some, one could argue that in her role as "courtesan" she is obviously better in bed than with a poor, helpless admirer. I think Curtiz has captured the confusion of her sado-masochistic relationship with Edmund Purdom's character with flying colors, censorship being what it was then. Sir Peter Ustinov was quite friendly with "The Egyptian" in his memoirs, writing that it was "lost" like in a huge set for "Aida." I've always appropriated his pronunciation of the word "beer." (One of the historical exact references of the film: the beer invented by the Egyptians!) Henry Daniell, egads, what a perfect performance Gene Tierney, what a screenplayer Bless DFZ for this 'late' role Come on, do not be so strict with Victor Mature! He is the son of a cheese maker! Who has risen to pharaoh! Sounds like a strange American opportunity One of the best moments: John Carradine's existential observations on the sands of time and Purdom's statement about the sunset behind the world Class A is, what is it? <br /> <br /> Of course the music along with everything else is great, and it is often noticed that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann are one of the most convincing The results of the screen have created perfectly harmonious, but each theme is well developed and has its own life. Newman, who was put under pressure by DFZ, called Herrmann to someone he could trust implicitly to carry half the burden. Benny, not the simplest man he could work with, apparently respected, Newman was enough to really make a difference Inspirational music They changed notes, a brilliant approach. No spoilers, who did what here, but Benny brings an edge, mysterious, great sounds. Alfred brings madness, longing, spice. Both are absolutely epic. Even if you look at it on a compressed television picture, the effect that the two composers' names are side by side in the main credits, and that the ultra-wide anamorphic screen can comfortably record, leaves a sleeping-beauty feeling to Leon Shamroy, the Dean of CinemaScope us not in the lurch. The lurid greens and moody shadows (probably distortions in all the terrible television prints I've seen over the years) perfectly accompany the multidimensional writing (from the great Philip Dunne and WB veterinarian Casey Robinson, whom Curtiz must have brought) to 20) , How notable that Shamroy, who was as much an institution of film art in Fox as Newman would be with music, would photograph "Cleopatra" a few years later, but in the brighter, sharper images of Todd A-O '60. These old studio men are really heroes of mine. <br /> <br /> Who wants to deal with all the imperfections and criticism in such a picture? I would rather give in to his magic and plunge into his ocean of waste to emerge after the inspirational climax of 'The End', refreshed, moved and hungry for more. <br /> <br /> And yes, we should ask 20th-Fox for a DVD release worthy of the DFZ's legacy.
