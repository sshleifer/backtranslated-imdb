I thought it would be a fantastic story. But the theme is pretty down-to-earth compared to the story about the Death-coach that I expected. In fact, there is much more a social drama. As usual in the "European author films". <br /> <br /> Actors are interesting and not too exaggerating as in the average silent movie. Pictures are not as good as being stuck in Bergman's Smultronstället. <br /> <br /> This is true, the comparison between the two films is the main point here. Smultronstället begins with the vision of a death-carriage in which Sjöström's figure can see his own body. There are watches without hands. He has to look back on what he did wrong. There is a vision of his happy family in the country. In Körkarlen Sjöströms wife does not cheat him before his eyes, but she wants to flee with the small children, because it would never be better with him. After all, the confession of Edit is a kind of live judgment. <br /> <br /> Well, I would just like to add that Sjöström destroyed the door with an ax because his wife has locked her up and plans to go away with the children Luminous. This was much more of a fantasy story in which death hung around.
