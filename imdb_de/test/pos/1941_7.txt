I think that's a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it very interesting for me. It's obvious, if you pay attention: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bully on The Simpsons. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney and Tony is Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons in which Jimbo used the line "I've infected her with a stick". <br /> <br /> The connection between Jimbo-Layne and the knit cap, long hair and voice is the most obvious. Kearney has the shaved head, unlike John, but is the big, stupid. The Tony Dolph connection is pretty obvious with the long, parted haircut and even the second stage status.
