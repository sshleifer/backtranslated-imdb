Another Raquel Welch Classic! This picture was released on November 10, 1969 in theaters with Raquel Welch as Michele, James Stacey as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki is on her way to her friends Michele and Jackie. On the way, she meets her ex-husband, who wants a second chance. Nikki walks away from him to the table where she sees Michele and Jackie. Alan goes back to her and she walks away as Alan shoots her in the back. Nikki is taken to the hospital while Michele and Jackie go to the police station. Michele goes to the hospital, where she meets with Jackie, only to find that Nikki has died. Alan then follows Jackie, whom he strikes with a car and tries to knock Michele down. Michele jumps in her car and drives to Los Angeles. When she gets there, Lloyd calls her boss in Las Vegas to let him know she's okay. Lloyd asks her to go to the club that called the losers to see Jeri for a job. There is a problem though! The bartender has a drug problem and Alan knows, so Alan and the bartender are talking a bit. Back in Los Angeles, Michele not only gets a job as a dancer with Jeri, but also with Jeri bouncer Joe. Now some thoughts on this picture! This picture was much better than Raquel's last, and this picture had an uninterrupted action. Luke Askew played the former husband of Nikki very well. He was your typical murder with the associated look. As for the performance of Raquel Welch, the only word that comes to me is fantastic. She was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and shone like never before. The outfit she was wearing on stage for dancing was breathtaking. In fact, all the outfits she wore in this movie were stunning. Of course, it does not matter what Raquel had because she looks good in all or nothing. I'm giving this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons. The first and by far the best is Raquel Welch, who is the lead actress and earns 10 stars. The second reason is that this movie was stretched from wall to wall from start to finish.
