I was kind of surprised by the PG rating on the back of the DVD case. I certainly would not want my kids to see this here. I think that would scare the shit out of a 10 year old. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A girl trying to fit in with the clique is tarnished and tormented by the crowd. They persuade her to spend the night in this spooky mausoleum (which reminded me of Phantasm ...) and they torture her in the night. They do not know that a recently deceased clairvoyant comes to life again and raises the dead around them! It sounds awfully cheesy, but given the age and budget, which was undoubtedly quite small, this movie is fun on many levels. I enjoyed it and my girlfriend got scared. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 children.
