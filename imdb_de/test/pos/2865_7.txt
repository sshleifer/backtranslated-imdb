I did not know much about this movie, but I found out that Kane was a wrestler, which did not really upset me, but hey, I liked "Santa's Slay" and that had a wrestler hell. The story starts out very strange and promising, but after a while it does not become much more than your typical teen terror-slasher movie, though the attitudes have helped some. A bunch of criminal young people are rounded up and taken to an old hotel, which used to be a luxury palace, but is now a garbage dump to clean up as a homeless shelter. The driver is a man with an arm prosthesis. He is a veteran of the opening scene of this movie, in which he meets this big buddy who has just killed his partner and dazzled another woman. The teens, all punk smarties, of course refuse all real work, but they're part of a unique co-ed work program, yes, what a great idea this is of course. Little does anyone suspect that there is someone lurking in the hotel, who in his own way will save the taxpayers of that state some money. Of course it's the guy who likes to collect eyeballs, and he has a pretty big collection. There will not be much that horror fans have not seen yet, but there are some brutal scenes and enough gore to satisfy the hardcore fan. The backdrop of the old hotel is also an ideal location for a Slasher movie, and there are small sub-stories, such as finding an alleged safe with money and finding babes, as this co-ed work group is equal. Most of the teenagers are well deserved, so that works well. Not great, but way better than Silent Hill or When A Stranger, and maybe better than any other crap I would not see. 7 out of 10.
