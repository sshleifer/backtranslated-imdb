This is without a doubt one of the most successful debut films by a director. The movie is only 90 minutes long, but it says all about life and death. Not much action and dialogue are minimal, but the film flows perfectly and requires everything due to the wonderfully natural feel. The performances of the leads are perfect, and even some minor characters get strong emotional scenes. The film will be lost to today's modern audiences, but everyone should see that. Refreshingly unsentimental and honest, that is comparable to the works of Ozu. <br /> <br /> Scratch my title, this one is perfect!
