This was a great movie and the sequel should get to know our socks !!! The action will be nonstop and I've just bought the Special Edition DVD with the animated backstory that is similar to the Animatrix. This will put Vin Diesel back in the limelight and hopefully bring him the coveted role in Spider Man 3 as Venom. He would be the most logical choice for the role. Back to PB this movie, though it's an indie thriller, has a great story and characters with backgrounds screaming for you to learn more. If they were making books or comics, that would be great reading. There was one thing that I felt was a little under-supplied. The end requires a bit of work, but not every film will have the best end.
