I thought that would be a beautiful movie. It's not my favorite in his movies - the Chungking Express keeps this spot - this one is unlike anything else I've seen of him. it's slow (but not annoying) - it takes time and ponders the characters ... there's only minimal movement in the frame - the camera is wonderful. the spectacle is great. The movie feels like a long warm comforting drink.
