You can tell by the first shot of the conveyor belt in the bank that this would be a great movie. <br /> <br /> A minimalist touch with a touch of retro - this film radiates style - the brilliant camera work, drama, script and the way the protagonist's secret life develops complement each other, to possibly make the best Italian movie I have ever seen (above with La Stanza Del Figlio - if different). <br /> <br /> Shame on the people who sit behind me and who make it obvious that they can not recognize the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes carefully created by the camera. Do not miss
