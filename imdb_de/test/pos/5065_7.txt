The ratings for RENDITION were generally not cheap, so I waited until it pulled into the local discount theater to see it. The film tells the story of Anwar El-Ibrahimi, an American-Egyptian scientist who is stolen from his international escape and dragged to interrogation after a strange coincidence has linked him to a recent terrorist attack in an unnamed North African country. Not as bad as I had feared, it's an interesting and thought provoking entry in the thriller genre "Breaking News". <br /> <br /> The film ultimately poses difficult questions regarding US methods of digging information from political prisoners: Is crossing the previously unbridled line (openly) of using torture against suspected terrorists something our own Country should do? Is there any useful information that can save lives? If so, at what price? What monsters arise when innocent people are captured and tortured? What kind of monster will we as a country sanction the use of torture? It's always disappointing when a movie with such provocative material is sloppy and contains some details that make great movies great. For example, I would have liked to be able to sympathize with Anwar's wife, who spends the entire movie tracking him down, but the only recognizable personality trait she receives is an advanced gestational state. RENDITION also seems to imply that Arab women, who disagree with the arranged marriages of their fathers, only cause trouble, and there is a poorly conceived scrapbook kept by another protagonist of the film, who describes all the details too comfortably and in detail Information that his love interest urgently needs right now. I laughed out loud when the moment was filled with fear. <br /> <br /> The film offers a good central performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and strong (but too short) performances by Hollywood veterans Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin. as well as stunning twists by Omar Atwally as Anwar El-Ibrahimi and the actors Moa Khouas, Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor, which I would like to see in future films that have nothing to do with terrorism. Well then good luck. The five or more stories that follow RENDITION are beautifully interwoven until the filmmakers introduce a light yet effective twist that eventually hints at the infinite cycle of carnage that results in violent attacks of terror.
