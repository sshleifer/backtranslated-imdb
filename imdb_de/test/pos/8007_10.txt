A perfect movie to see during the Christmas season, how the winter / Christmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is very cool. It's strange that Warner decided to release this movie as a summer movie. It does not fit. <br /> <br /> What's even stranger, considering the content of this movie, is that it was aimed at families. A family from the upper class throws her mutated baby in the sewer, a sociophobic billionaire disguises himself as a flying rodent in leather, a lonely secretary disguises herself with leather as a cat and a freak runs for a political office. And S & M and bondage are very perverted. But Burton got away with it. His visual style in this film is the finest. <br /> <br /> This and Batman: Dead End are the only real live action incarnations of the cartoon character. While the animated series was closest to the source material, Batman Returns is the best of the four compared to Batman Forever and the Unnameable. Darker and more violent than that In the first film, the sense of gothic pathos reaches a new climax. I was very interested in Michael Keaton, as Bruce Wayne (not even George Clooney should start!), He showed the right balance between funny loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (a lot of sexy and "realistic" feline), she wears this leather outfit better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was as convincing as the penguin that his scenes were disturbing. And Christopher Walken is brilliant as the scary Max Shreck (if you think you recognize Chip Shrek, it's nothing but a very young Leatherface / Butterfinger). <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman's score is even better than the first time round. His powerful and engaging themes are far better than the slag that followed in the later 2 Schumacher films. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at Zenith. Forget the following sequels and then stay with the animated series. Let's hope that Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale will be able to bring some more integrity to the live action Batman next year with their film. <br /> <br /> This DVD was one of the first DVDs released by Warner (almost 7 years ago!). !!) and as a result there are NO features and the case is a snapper. Get it as cheap as I do and hope for an SE in the future.
