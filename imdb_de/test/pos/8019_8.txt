A very intelligent and exciting thriller that does not rely on action but on situations that are all too rare these days. I would compare this movie to the Jackal's Day, another film about the persecution of a dangerous international criminal. Acting down the line is a superlative - Aidan Quinn has a tricky dual role as malignant terrorist Carlos and as a Navy man who personifies him. Donald Sutherland plays the amoral CIA agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who supports the plan. This is a very exciting and effective movie and it is remarkable considering how little action it has. The first half of the film is all prepared as the Navy man prepares to embody Carlos. The second half is a breathless actioner. The action comes from the characters and their situations and makes them all the more exciting. A really tight movie that should not be overlooked.
