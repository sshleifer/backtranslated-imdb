This is a kind of unknown and forgotten movie that you dream about when you discover old videos. It's an awesome comic gem with brilliantly witty lettering, embedded in the wonderful array of characters, a wonderfully inventive and witty score, and a fun, light-hearted Montgomery twist. This is one that you have to watch again and again. Montgomery is a small actor commissioned by his military reserve department to infiltrate a young debutant's home to discover the identity of her former admirer, a suspected jewel thief. While the premise is rather absurd, the results are hilarious. Montgomery is the confused plant, Ann Blyth is a miracle, for the romantic-obsessed, terribly serious debutante and comic-character parade of the seasoned stage actress, Jane Cowl's attorney mother and Lillian Randolph's maid - are all fabulous. <br /> Strangely, this only has earned an Oscar nom for sound when it was earned for director, screenplay and musical score. <br /> <br /> DO NOT MISS IT - it's one of the best in Hollywood.
