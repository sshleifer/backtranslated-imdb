"Stripperella" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson), who acts as a stripper in a gentleman's club called "The Tender Loins" and as a sexy criminal named Stripperella, aka, Agent 69, who works for one Government organization works. As a Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil like a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or get fat, and Cheapo, a criminal who steals out of 99-cent shops and gets his two henchmen into doing one To share weapon. The creator of the character and series is Stan Lee of Marvel Fame (and the creator of Spider-Man). In late June 2003, Spike TV (then The New TNN) had its Thursday night block of three animated shows. These shows were "Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon"; New adventures of classic children show the characters Ren and Stimpy for adults created by John Kricfalusi, "Gary the Rat." about a lawyer turned into a human rat showing the Kelsee grammar of "Cheers" and "Fraiser" and "Stripperella"; the adventures of a stripper acted as a superhero by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember that I saw all three premieres. I really wanted to see Ren and Stimpy because I love the original show. I was a little disappointed. It was okay, but it seemed a bit too far; Seeing how the two have gay sex with each other was a bit much. Although Gary the Rat was not bad, Stripperella was the best of the three. The animation was really good, there was a great intro song, it had a good talent behind it and it was damn funny! The show was so stupid, I do not know how to start explaining it! After four or five weeks (if not less), the animation block disappeared, which was strange because I know it received good reviews and was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go, but a few months later I heard about new episodes airing at 1:00. I only saw one, and although it was damn funny, and I was glad to see the show again after all this time, it seemed a bit outlandish. <br /> <br /> In the beginning it's a short run, "Stripperella" had a great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic and a bit sexy. The Stripperella costume looked good too, the character was well drawn. After the long break and during the rest of the episodes the animation was very different. Instead of a dark and realistic appearance, it was originally colorful and cartoonish. However, Stripperella received the biggest changes. Before she had normal, long hair, she now had hair that was larger than Peggy Bundy's (Married to Children), if at all possible. Even the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; Before it was just white, you could see what was cool, as it was more superheroic. The upper part of her costume was a sort of vest with a collar and her costume was dark blue; that changed to a bluish-purple costume, and her overall looked really shitty by comparison. In short, the show was an animated cartoon and very stupid, but in the second half it became more cartoonish and even though she was still laughing funny, she also got crazier; For example, there was a later episode about an are-beaver ... yes, an are-beaver. <br /> <br /> Instead of complaining about the changes in the middle of the series, "Stripperella" ran only one season, but it was a very good show. Like the stories from the "Bordello of Blood" crypt it may sound very loud, but it's really fun. As long as you are not a scam, you laugh at this show again and again. I have not seen every episode because I do not have the DVD for two reasons: # 1. Paramount has been released and they have disapproved of this policy of not adding any extras on almost all TV shows, even though this was the entire show (I would like seen the comments of some parents explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and 2. The great kid rock song during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of him, but the intro sang WHAT the theme for the show! If you do not pay to have any extras, you'll at least have to pay for having the original intro song you spend. The show also had some interesting guest stars like John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as a plastic surgery that hates models. Even Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was present in almost every episode as the owner of the strip club. Stan Lee also has a cameo in one episode. <br /> <br /> The Breakdown: <br /> <br /> PROS: First had a great look at it, FUNNY AS HELL, a very funny show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (see Watch the show and check out some of the stuff he does), and was by far the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> CONS: The middle series animation change and the crappy DVD that was previously described. Apart from the fact that a part of the humor can sometimes be a little stupid, I have nothing really negative to say about it. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: Stripperella is a big guilty pleasure from me, and it's just a shame ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy, action-packed cult series that I hope will one day be seen intact on Adult Swim with the original intro and possibly another season like Family Guy. Also check it if it is on the lousy DVD. They will laugh themselves ridiculously. <br /> <br /> Rated TV-MA: Tough and sexual humor and nudity, Running time: Approximately 25 minutes per episode, Result: 9/10
