The 80 year old "My Dinner with Andre" starring Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory is essentially a dialogue about the world and its impact on the mind. 'You Are Alone' from 2005 shows how worldly events can shake the soul. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around three main characters. There's Daphne, a pretty teenage student who worries about virtually every decision in her life. Then there's the prostitute or the paid escort Britney as confident as Daphne is self-confident. What makes them interesting is that they have the same body, if not the same people. Part of the magic of this film comes in one of the early scenes where Daphne approaches an old hotel door. She stops and is obviously torn by the decision whether to knock on the door or not? But it is Britney who slides effortlessly into the room when the door is opened. On the other side of this door, Buddy is finding attractive. He goes so far as to confront Britney's profession as soon as she enters the room. However, we soon learn that Buddy is Daphne's next neighbor and over the years has watched her turn from a little girl into a woman. This makes things more complicated for the audience. Buddy is just a worried neighbor or does he want something else? <br /> <br /> If it's the sex buddy wants, it's here. Britney loves sex. Their definitions may be Clintonesque, but that does not make their enthusiasm. She prefers older men and wears a rainbow made of plastic bracelets that customers can choose from. Each ribbon identifies a specific act that it will perform? But exactly what act is revealed after the band is broken off the wrist and the choice is irrevocably hit. <br /> <br /> Britney is or believes that she has control over every encounter. Even blindfolded and tethered by one of her regulars, she imagines her arms and body being stroked by several men, but her legs and pubic area are caressed by a woman in blood-red lingerie. The imagery of the film keeps coming. The wretched life of Buddy is an acceptance. He has lost his wife, his dog, even his fantasies about the pretty teenager next door. It's no coincidence that he lured Daphne or Britney into this special hotel room. On the wall of a dinner plate is a painting, of which only one fish head is left. This is a perfect metaphor for the life of Buddy. All good parts are ready. So here, where he brought his wife when they were college students, does he make his point? to regain control of his own life to make his statement. <br /> <br /> Gorman Bechard, the director of "You Are Alone" knows his trade. The main action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film, supported by a multitude of cutscenes that add dimension to the characters, their circumstances and conflicts. <br /> <br /> Later in the movie Britney, Buddy asks if she should undress. He says yes, but she just undresses to her underwear. A real prostitute would probably take off all her clothes (she gets one of the five professions). But it's not buddy who gets upset, it's us. After completing the film, we find that human emotions and motivations are much deeper. A tease works only if it actually delivers. Britney also does it, "You Are Alone".
