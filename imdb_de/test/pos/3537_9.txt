Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more cruel; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a little too much for my taste). Great script and acting (Ken Stott impressed me and there were no weaknesses in the cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen in years. Although it was planned in three parts on BBC, I have shown Messiah in a take on video. A criticism; The rogue's motivation was not very convincing.
