Like most people, I was more interested in "More" just because of the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which turned out to be the only Pink Floyd album I still hear after all these years. It was quite surprising to watch the movie in a local video library in a digitally remastered version. It was even more surprising to see that it is a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> Visually, it's pretty nice, especially when the two main characters are on the rocks of the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of soundtrack music, which in my opinion comes exclusively from Pink Floyd, is excellent. It was a pleasure to see the movie with my copy of the album next to me and to mentally mark each track as it was used in the movie. Dave Gilmour's short film "A Spanish Piece" was the only one I did not hear, and several tracks are used rather prominently, notably "Cymbaline", "Main Theme" and "Quicksilver". This latter track is boring on the soundtrack album, but works very well during the title sequence of the movie and reappears at least once later. Maybe now I can appreciate it on the album, as I now have some visual companions in my mind. <br /> <br /> The plot of "More" is sometimes a bit difficult, especially in the early years, when the movie seems to be just a vehicle to show the hipness of those involved. But ultimately, the film proves that it has much more to offer as the plot becomes more focused. Why does Stefan take heroin? Why EVERYONE takes heroin and knows the possible consequences? The film does not try to answer that question directly, but Stephen's heroin use seems to be a logical extension of his purposeful pursuit of pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to any Pink Floyd fan who has his own movie theater recognition of the heavily underrated "More" soundtrack. I also recommend it to anyone who is interested in the counterculture of the sixties and how it is portrayed in the media. I have no idea how realistic this movie is because I'm too young to experience the sixties first-hand, but it seems to capture the zeitgeist like no other movie.
