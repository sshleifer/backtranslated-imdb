I think Toy Soldiers is a great movie. It is one of the few films that has, in addition to some well-known actors, an unknown cast that can actually work. In my opinion, the plot is fascinating. It keeps your attention without having an outrageous story that could not possibly happen in real life. I think everyone would enjoy this movie. Sean Astin always seems to pick the perfect movies to show his talent. He is very undervalued and does not get the recognition he deserves. Other films he has seen in other actors have been in the limelight, but this film and Rudy really show him because he is the main character in both. I hope that one day he will receive the awards he deserves for his acting. If you want to see a great movie, you need to check this movie. If you are a fan of Sean Astin, you will definitely like this movie.
