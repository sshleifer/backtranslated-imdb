Where the hell is Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) exactly? Sky? Hell? A parallel universe? When the troubled man leaves the subway platform and encounters an ascending train, his next conscious moment enters a bus; solo riding, the latest arrival, in a dead underworld, where all suicides go. Andreas, dressed as he was at the time when he suddenly left the physical biosphere, is greeted by an official man who transports the annoying man from the barren flatlands to a city and transports when the eyeballs are working, which is a great call a kind of urban landscape, which he once inhabited, if the memory does him right. Andreas retains the gaze of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man who has alienated himself from people and objects and can hardly orient himself; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, when the annoying man happens to be designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard (John Joner), his boss, tells him, "They'll get used to it," which is more than just cracking numbers. We suspect that the same thing applies in this world as in the old world. <br /> <br /> If life is meaningless, as the French existentialist Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death. The subculture of office life may be heaven to a man, but it looks like a hell to us in the context in which "The Brysomme Mannen" operates. Working in the afterlife essentially means working for the rest of your life. The social intercourse among Andreas's office colleagues may be considered normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates an alienation in the viewer as he / she now recognizes the drudgery of the employees being carried out by employees kill the hours their insignificant small-talk and certain jobs that they exercise in the course of a day, like automobiles every day that seem irrational in their obvious absurdity. To portray everyday life in a speculative light, "normalizing the Brysomme" makes normal human interaction look like a deadly comedy, as everyday life becomes a performance that transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word "alienation" because here men are and Women In the office identifies themselves "doing" with their work, like actors in a play conspiring to make their fictional self appear as real. The annoying man is never completely involved in the facade. He is always aware of the cracks. <br /> <br /> Andreas sees from a wooden bench the consequences of a jumper who spits on an iron fence while people have walked past him during his lunch break, no matter how his bowels fly away. That creates red splashes on the clean sidewalk. Andreas is indifferent to his own work collegiality after deliberately cutting off his own finger with the hope that he will feel the pain on a paper cutter. He does not. It's just another sensation, in addition to the ability to taste and smell that gets lost for the annoying man. This inability to take solace in the simple pleasures intensifies man's annoying need for love, where simple joys compensate for his loneliness in the physical world. Andreas Anne Britt (Petonella Barker) meets at a dinner party hosted by his boss. They did it. He goes back home. She invites him. They will be a couple. He moves. If they have sex, that's fine neither for Andreas nor for Anne, who enjoy the interior more. Love is an abstract concept, another feeling unattainable in this world, but love is important to the annoying man, so he tries again with Ingeborg (Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. Deconstructing the Brysomme deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures required of both man and woman. When Ingeborg, after his hygro-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt, does not elicit the same tender feelings, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic but strange city with an open ending that is solvable and offers a range of interpretations. Puzzled by Ingeborg's apathy to his commitment to love her, the annoying man wanders into the same subway station, stands on the same platform, and looks aggressively at the same couple and jumps. He can not die this time. How can you die when you are already dead? Hit again and again by train, Andreas's face turns into ground beef; his body is distorted in angles that were previously seen only in art. When the disturbing man realizes that love and death are not within reach, he seeks out the man from the club who was ready to say what is unsaid in this city of walking dead. Which means death, not life, has no meaning. <br /> <br /> The mystery behind Andreas's whereabouts is what drives the narrative, and the filmmaker satisfies this puzzle in a scene that is reminiscent of Spike Jonze's "Being John Malkovich", as Andrew does Tunnel crawls to go into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain, which Craig Schwartz encourages people to crawl. Andreas's attempt to overcome the great gap is a beguiling paradox. With heaven and earth literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable border acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheist belief that "heaven is a place on earth." At the same time, the sky is proved by the reality of a hell. the place to which Andrew was sent after he was banished from the city of his destination.
