I saw this movie on TV many years ago and recorded it from there. I never really understood why my own mother was angry when I saw him. I was so young then. I have just seen and seen this movie again. I now have two children of my own and I had to try to hold back tears, but that did not happen. I cried most of the time of the movie if you have kids of your own! Such an amazing family, such a heartbreaking movie, really wonderful! Someone said that there are about 8 more messages left. If you are still in contact, I would like to know! Touched by the movie everywhere!
