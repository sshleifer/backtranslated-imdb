This is easily my favorite movie. A tragic romance interwoven with a complex mystery whose threads are virtually invisible until they unfold in a fantastic onslaught. Brilliant brilliance. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see more of Gilles Mimouni's works, but according to imdb, he did not create any other features. Has the high quality of this work led to another daunting task? Has he retreated into another creative area? I certainly hope that this will not be his last movie, but I can not really blame him if he decides to stop with this gem as the only contribution to the world of feature films.
