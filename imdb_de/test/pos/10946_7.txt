As my Chinese friend told me, this movie features two famous Hong Kong pop stars. While this makes the movie a mere marketing stunt, I found the acting acceptable and both are sweet. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty bad overall. The vampiric traits and weaknesses, however, are used in a humorous way and create some uniquely entertaining elements. The altercations between the two girls made me giggle, which, along with the well-executed action scenes, gave them a good balance to create an entertaining movie.
