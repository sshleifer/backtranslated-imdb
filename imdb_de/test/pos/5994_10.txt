I am slowly working through as many Hong Kong action movies as I can get my hands on and have come across this gem - mainly due to Ching Wan Lau, one of my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> It's great action movie, though not as OTT as the title suggests. It moves at a fast pace and is really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this movie was the soundtrack. It seems that Rob Dougan - the guy who played the popular "The Matrix" song "Clubbed To Death" - has upgraded Big Bullet's soundtrack to one of the tracks on his album "Furious Angels". The piece in question is "I'm not driving anymore" and is also the opening song for the TV series "Law and Order" AND the opening track of the DVD menu teaser "Matrix Reloaded"! That really surprised me, by pure coincidence!
