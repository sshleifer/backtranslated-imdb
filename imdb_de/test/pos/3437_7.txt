"Jaded" should not be considered an en-erotic thriller, since the sex scenes are unlike films like "Indecent Behavior" or "Friend Of The Family" not for pleasure. <br /> <br /> "Jaded" is not an easy watch, as the story is hard to pin down and not so common in the society. From the beginning of the film, the first scene will give you stronger scenes. <br /> <br /> The rape scene was (in my opinion) not a well-made scene. I think the director did not use proper camera techniques in the movie as a whole. That's why it sometimes looks boring and gets boring almost at the end. <br /> <br /> The performances are extremely good of all five female characters. These women gave strong, intense, but credible performances that demonstrate the dramatic skills of the actresses. <br /> <br /> The legal concepts have done much to understand the difficulty of the act, as the legal term sodomy differs from simple rape. From the standpoint of Meg's defense, sodomy must be punished as a rape (a high crime grade B), even though it is another crime. Pat and Alex's defense claims that Meg enjoyed it and asked for it. Here the film becomes interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. What is certain is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime. <br /> <br /> Take a look at "Jaded" if you like legal issues that are not commonplace in your society. If not, give it a try, because it's a very good and strong drama.
