Although not often mentioned, "Do not Look in the Basement" is a very interesting movie and definitely worth a watch. The story is of a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, hired by Stephen's Sanitarium to help Dr. Stephens after he was murdered by a patient. Many patients begin to torment Miss Beale, and her boss, dr. Geraldine Masters, pretends to be hiding something ... <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are many appealing characters that you really care about, the climax that is not common in horror movies. The music is great and reminiscent of "Dark Shadows", the performance of Rosie Holotik, Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee is great. The story is very interesting and ends with a great shoot. This movie has a camping atmosphere that can not be captured with any other movie I've ever seen. Many horror fans have never seen or heard this movie, which is a shame because it could have been a horror classic. "Do not look in the basement" is definitely worth a look for all fans of the 1970s.
