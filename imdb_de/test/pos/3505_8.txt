Ali G. Indahouse was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and Cohen's portrayal of a British gangsta is weird. This movie has cult classics, and it has some really great lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good party movie in which the audience literally laughs from start to finish. Definitely choose Ali G and consider it real.
