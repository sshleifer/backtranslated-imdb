I am a 55 year old gay white man. Since I do not watch TV, I watch at least 250 movies a year, most on DVD. I take notes on all films and rate them. Since December 2003, I have only seen five films like EIGHTEEN. So I rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 new films. Mr. Bell is far too modest in his commentary. EIGHTEEN is a great movie. And there were also two "firsts" for me. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie for the first time, and I was through and weepy for the last half hour, something that happened to me only three times before. (Five minutes after the movie, I knew it would be very good.) When Jason started reciting Whitman, I lost it and then ... The Kiss. Well, this is one of the greatest kisses of film and this scene among the most haunting and memorable movie doms. As Pip blows out the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I clapped. I cheered I love happy ending. I cried. <br /> <br /> Then I looked at the trailer and the TLA preview and thought, "Okay, are the $ 800,000 or so indie really that great?" So I saw EIGHTEEN again, something that happened only three times before. And ECHTZEH blew my socks off again, all the more. Then I saw "The Making of Eighteen" documentary and was completely fascinated by the cast and Mr. Bell. <br /> <br /> So I thought, I would look again EIGHTEEN with the comment of the director. I have never seen a movie three times in one night. After the third time at 3:00, I knew that I had just had a great movie; EIGHTEEN is now # 10 in my Top Twenty movie ever. And in the very small universe of a large gay or gay subtext movie, there are Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and complete, with a great cast, a wonderfully moving, unobtrusive score, superb cinematography, an entertaining, touching, absolutely fitting and humming song. I can go on, but I will not sweat too much anymore. <br /> <br /> This film would have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for Best Picture. The performances were without exception wonderful. Mrs. Gill's sweet, sultry voice was a startling enlightenment. And Sir Ian McKellen? 'Nuf said. Awesome. <br /> <br /> EIGHTEEN is the reason why I move through over 200 mediocre films a year to form horrendous films (some worth more than $ 150 million) to find this treasure, one exquisite, magical, unique and unique film Enchanting, perfect "Faberge egg" that surrounds an unforgettable heart. <br /> <br /> Finally (promised), my second "first" - I've never posted a comment on any movie I've seen. <br /> Thank you again, Mr Richard Bell! Stunning genius. Give this man $ 100 million for his next movie! He made 700,000 dollars in one of the 50 best films of all time. If I had the money, I would give him $ 75,000 in living expenses a year and make up for the money he collected for his next movie. Mr. Bell is already a great director at the age of 31. Can you imagine that he is 45 years old? <br /> <br /> Wise and witty, tender and brutal, tense, touching, unobtrusive, nervous, freezing and exciting, fascinating, haunting, unforgettable: EIGHTEEN, THE MASTERPIECE
