Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, smartest, most astute, sarcastic and heartwarming TV series I've ever seen (second only to my favorite TV series of all time, F * R * I * E * N) * D * S). The fast pace and many Pop Culture references may confuse some viewers, but once you get to know the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be thrilled with life. Just a few random comments, I recently (finally) started watching Season 6 and wow! It is one of my favorite seasons. I love the Luke Lorelai thing and the drama in the various episodes is (as always) exciting. The only thing I do not like is the surprising bad attitude and reckless acts that Rory suddenly "adopted". Unfortunately, I do not think that's very realistic, and I hope it's not just a way to create more drama to make the season good. All in all a great season and I can not wait to wait for the next one !!! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashly a.k.a. "Tookie Clothespin"
