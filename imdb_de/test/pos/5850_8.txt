This multi-level thriller kept my attention upright throughout. It is disturbing and enlightening to see how perverse human behavior can be. It also reveals what past wounds can do to motivate present behavior. Nobody but Sandra Bullock's partner is very likeable. Everyone is believable. Sandra did an excellent job. Her character, Cassie, comes alive with all her pain, fears, and defenses. She is a survivor, so she brings her life experience into a healing moment. I really enjoyed this movie. Tom Landers
