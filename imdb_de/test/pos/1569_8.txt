While I can understand some of the points that have been made in relation to cinematography (I thought a more appropriate approach would have better supported the feel of low-fi movies), I have to say that I thought the script and that Spectacle of WHAT ALICE FOUND were outstanding! Dean Bell has created a real gem that charms Judith Ivey with characterful enthusiasm. Her idea of ​​Sandra is a pleasure - alternately diabolical and romantic. We are immediately fascinated and repelled by their actions ... and never receive more information than necessary. Her and the side cast meet Bell's postmodern fairytale with wide-open arms. Emily Grace's Alice is full of magical eyes. It seems to form like clay before us and turns into a kind of beautiful, lost animal. In the end, we disagree with the words she does as she says goodbye to her mother. A kudos should also be given to Jane Lincoln Taylor, whose mother provides the right level of tragic historical weight, and to Justin Parkinson, whose shy John, Sam, offers one of the sweetest, if not most unpleasant, sex scenes in the movie. Bell has created a world-class story and put together a wealth of talent to create it.
