I wonder if I could imagine a whole musical comedy from Russia or the GDR or other countries that for decades has almost always been propagandist films, anti-fascist films, anti-war films (as this documentary points out), the mirrored dark, grueling times under Stalin and the life behind the Iron Curtain. It's fascinating to see the other side of the coin, the kind of clowns and rebels with music at their side to try and satisfy the masses as if they're on the socialist path of life. A movie seemed really impressive, called Jolly Fellows by the pioneer of the very small group of musical filmmakers, Grigori Aleksandrov. From the clips I saw of this movie, I would have wagered that it was one of the few works to step out of oneself and go into a wild, manic mode that makes you laugh. But as this movie shows, if you were a filmmaker desiring entertainment, you should be better off with a "message." Through interviews, occasional quasi-dramatizations (from Russia / Germany / etc) picture counter), and at the censorship table and at clips you get a full picture of how it was - both behind the scenes and on screen - to the masses only entertaining. Some of the films (well, most of them, as it appears that they were shown in these countries for only 14 over 40 years) have made a good change, but for what purpose? One is also drawn into the culture of everything, as it differs greatly from the American style, "if it works, do it while it is hot". But at the same time, maybe out of this repression, some interesting, funny and (what I saw) up-beat movies were made. They may have been quite typical of what was required to be shown to the masses, under Stalin's loving but demanding conditions, such as tractors. It will be an even juicier story than we are shown, as it was in the '60s, the last wave of musical comedy, when rock & roll and pop tunes finally reached their airwaves. <br /> <br /> In short, some good stuff ... but only if interested, really. I was shown the film in a documentary class, and half of the class fell asleep. So be warned on one side, but looking for it on the other can make this a truly rewarding journey into European film history.
