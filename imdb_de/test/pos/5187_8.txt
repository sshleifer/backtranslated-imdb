I recently bought it on DVD as I had never heard of it and like Robert Carlyle. Of course, this movie will not have Hollywood blockbuster special effects, and the acting was fine, too. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pleasant and did not regret the purchase at all. With almost 2 hours it is just the right length for this type of movie. <Expect no exciting explosions from start to finish, it's a fairly balanced movie with a decent storyline!
