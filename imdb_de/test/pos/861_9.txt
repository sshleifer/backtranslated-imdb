Watched the movie at the Hollywood Film Festival in October '04. Mark Robertson had a great chance to write an extremely difficult part for his first movie and it was well worth the casting of Kelly Overton. I had a strong feeling that she came out of the theater, so I looked up at her and ... surprise, I'm right. Other Hollywood actors should follow their example, give up the expensive acting lessons and return to the theater, because only with this kind of training will you be prepared for such a ride. For all the great things I can say about the movie and the director (and there are many), I just can not stop talking to people about Kelly Overton's masterful performance. No doubt we will see MUCH more of their work. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly on a daring movie. Get it in the cinemas so I can bring all the people who want to see the movie ASAP!
