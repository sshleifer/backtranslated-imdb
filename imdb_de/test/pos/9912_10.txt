Of all the episodes in all the series, this is closest to Roddenberry's original teaching. Roddenberry, in his Guide to Authors, states that any alien creature, no matter how horribly ugly, impossible to believe, benevolent or vicious, must have the appearance of humanity showing the television The public can empathize with and / or relate to. Devil In The Darks HORTA, which no longer resembles a large cow dung, is a mother who protects her babies. These spherical silicone knots that miners find and destroy miners time and time again because they have no idea what they are doing! This is one of my absolute favorite episodes, if only for that!
