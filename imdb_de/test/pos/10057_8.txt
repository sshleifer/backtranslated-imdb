Nikki Finn is the kind of girl I would marry. Never boring, always thinking positive, dealing well with animals. Okay, as one reviewer wrote, a bit too much peroxide, lipstick and eyebrows (only Madonna could get away with that). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, she's no ordinary girl. She lets things happen, always exciting and always honest. Sure, she steals, but she does not rob or murder (unless you want to get her in). She knows which rules can be violated and which ones should be followed. She knows what to take and what can not be stolen. If you need a favor from her, she has 100%. Conclusion: She knows how to enjoy life. Nikki is always affectionate (that's why she has a path with wild animals) and is totally dedicated to those who loves her and who loves her. Who is the girl? She is the girl for me.
