Chokher Bali ?? A passion play. <br /> <br /> Based on the eponymous novel by Rabindranath Tagore, this is a classic story about deception, adultery and exploitation of relationships. Director Rituparno Ghosh, born in Bengal in 1900, turned the highly praised literature of the Nobel Prize winners into a delightful visual treat. The story of Tagore deals in detail with the Bengali society live a life of its own. We are taken to the picturesque part of Bengal, where we meet our heroine, the pretty, young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai). Despite their beautiful looks, two handsome men look on the rich Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji) and his friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury) denies marrying her. Mahindra chooses a naive Ashalata (Raima Sen) over Binodini and marries her. The free-spirited Binodini leaves the country life behind and accompanies Mahindra's mother as a caretaker to Calcutta. Soon her friendship with Ashalata will flourish. It seems that the two who call themselves "Chokher Bali" (sands in their eyes) share a lasting bond. The English-speaking Binodini occupies a special place in the house. But soon she exposes her true face. Binodini manipulates the good-natured Ashlata and approaches Mahindra and fulfills her sexual desires. <br /> <br /> When discarded by Mahindra's angry mother, Binodini seeks solace from a reluctant Behari. The rest of the story shows how the lives of these four characters criss-cross to an unimaginable climax. Aishwarya goes through the role - a manipulative, rebellious lady who still wins the sympathy of the viewer - with the elegance of a ballet dancer. The other main artists - Prosenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhury - are just as brilliant at staging their characters. <br /> <br /> While Tagore wrote this groundbreaking story at the turn of the 20th century, the idea of ​​widow marriage was taboo even among the upper classes! Through the parallel narrative of the freedom movements of nations, the author emphasizes the importance of individual freedom from cage life. Kudos to the Art Director, who brought Bengal to life in the early 20th century, applauds the cameraman for capturing these sets with enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Tagore's 'Passion Play' was eagerly converted to the screen of the most capable filmmaker, without losing its originality.
