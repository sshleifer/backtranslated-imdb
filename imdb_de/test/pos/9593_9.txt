I think that this TV movie aired for the first time in the week in which Manchester Utd played in the Champions League final (1999). There was a lot of footballing stuff this week, and it was an absolute highlight. It played on all the clich√©s that were exploited during the FA Cup in each season, ie brave outsiders, lucky clothing / mascot, name on the trophy, etc. and proved as incredibly funny surprised that it was never repeated before other big football events, even now that the World Cup just started. <br /> <br /> A few previous posts by non-football fans have said that they still love it, but a football fan will find it hilarious.
