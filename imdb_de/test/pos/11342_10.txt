Kar Wai Wong is an amazingly impressive romance that's perfect for me. Set in Hong Kong 1960s. As we have shown, this is a turbulent time. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan. A man and a woman meeting in an apartment in Hong Kong where they both move into. Chow Mo-wan works for a newspaper company. Su Li-zhen Chan is a secretary. Two very different people. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan are forging a special bond after both have found out their spouses and are out-of-marital trysts. Together. <br /> <br /> The characters of Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan are just incredible. Both Leung and Cheung manage to combine such amazing chemistry, it's better than any Hollywood romance that is extinguished today. Combined The film is all about the focus of the two leads and their feelings about their partners' infidelities. Kar Wai Wong manages to create such strong character development between these two characters that you really start to feel. Leung and Cheung are both amazing, they are better than any Hollywood couple shown on screen today. Combined. <br /> <br /> There's nothing else to describe Fa yeung nin wa other than a beautiful, energetic romance that also features an atmospheric, atmospheric piece with great cinematography. Many elements of this film help make it flawless. In addition to Kar Wai Wong and acting, the cinematography of both Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee is haunting. Nice understated. The images of Kar Wai Wong help your mind to create its own world. A world that creates these characters. Original, melancholic and nostalgic. This movie is unbelievably unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The costumes of Kar Wai Wong's regular William Chang are absolutely beautiful. Cheung, who wears an elegant, ankle-deep, beautifully patterned dress in every scene. She is a scene-robber. Her costumes say a lot about her character and an emotion is appropriate in all her clothing colors, which are used vividly and skillfully. Very original. Chang, also the production designer, creates a brilliant setting for the atmospheric piece of the films. Especially with the help of the wonderful scene music and the masterful film editing by Chang. William Chang seems incredibly versatile and is an unsung hero for this film. Overall, this movie is one of the best of this millennium. Incredibly captivating and full of nostalgia.
