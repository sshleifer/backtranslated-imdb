They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers movie, The Life of Jimmy Dolan, in which Douglas Fairbanks Jr. starred as a price-winner on the Lam. <br /> <br /> Even with the limitations now being produced by Im Hays Office, this remake is actually better than the original one. Douglas Fairbanks jr. As a pugilist is a terrible failure. John Garfield, with his background and style, enters a role in which he was born to play. <br /> <br /> They made me a criminal headed by Busby Berkeley, who thought Jack Warner was busy between the musicals. Berkeley would soon leave Warner Brothers for MGM. <br /> <br /> Berkeley does a good job here and keeps the action going at a good pace. I especially like the scene where four of the Dead End Kids and Garfield swim in a water tank and get stuck there when the water level drops. They get it pretty tight and with some ingenuity. <br /> <br /> Other performances alongside Garfield and the children we remember are May Robson, who runs the summer camp for the kids, and Claude Rains, the obsessive detective on Garfield's wake.
