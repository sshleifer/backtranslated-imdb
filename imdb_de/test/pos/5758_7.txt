I had searched for this movie for a long time before I found it. I had seen him when I was younger and loved him. After my second visit I still loved him and still do. <br /> <br /> this is a love / hate movie, if you like Bottom, Young, the comic then you will find it funny. If you do not like that kind of humor, do not worry about it. I love this movie and grew up with these comedy programs. For me, this movie simply puts his comic genius on the big screen. He is by no means a prize winner, but if you only want good healthy slapstick, then this is the case! <br /> <br /> The movie lacks the quality of the TV series. This is usually the case with films, but he still has enough material to make you laugh, even though many of the jokes are very similar to their previous work. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the humor is a bit childish and not to everyone's taste, but sometimes you just need it in a movie.
