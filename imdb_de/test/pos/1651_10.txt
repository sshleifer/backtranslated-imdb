Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is in tune with the Melville crime images (notably Bob le Flameur and to a certain extent Le Cercle Rouge) that he is totally focused on history and character and ensures that no word is spoken is not needed. and was ahead of its time. Ionian, he still has some kind of professionalism among his characters, a kind of respect (if not for himself, as a kind of duty for others) that sounds good in France after World War II. His actors have faces for these characters who say, "We know what these guys are about," and that's where the story begins. Maybe it's because I have a weak spot for mugger attacks, especially if we just see the nuts and bolts (um, actual physical side) of how a robbery is pulled off. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with today's robbery is being filmed in today's movies: it's all very fast (like Snatch) or in a way we've seen too often. Dassin decided, like Melville, years later, to create virtually a silent movie of a raid with sound effects. While the excitement that builds in this scene may not surpass Melville's peak in "Rouge," on its own level, it reaches its own size and dynamism, and is as crucial to what has been done before. There are some close-ups, for example, when the safe is cracked, which marks some of the best I've seen in France at the time. Another plus for the film, apart from the larva stage of the film's New Wave movement, which ultimately makes it a bit more modern, is that the story works so well and differently. It gets quite over character at points and then keeps up the thrill. The last ten to fifteen minutes are wonderful. As with another classic predator in the Asphalt Jungle, it's not even the last stop that counts, it's about how much you transcend the call of duty and humanism is going to be greeded for all the amusement of the camera Speed ​​with the cars flying through the trees that he could only do it. Dassin has a very entertaining and intuitive film of his genre here with a small musical number.
