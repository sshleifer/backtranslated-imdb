After the success of "Muppet Babies", Warner Brothers created "Tiny Toons". Instead of making Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and all the other Looney Toon gang kids, they created new animal figures that were children with their own personalities, but with their own role models. The leads included Buster & Babs Bunny (no relatives who became their running gag or catchphrase), Plucky Duck, Hampton Pig, Dizzy Devil, Shirley 'the' Loon, Elmira, Montana Max, Furball, Sweety, the Rats and Various animals from Perfecto Prep, and the original Looney Toons throw themselves off. The Tiny Toons lived in Acme Acres and attended the Acme Looniversity, where the Looney Toon gang worked as teachers serving the younger generation as mentors for ins and out of comedy. <br /> <br /> During the Show Run The Bush SR made several pot shots. Administration, pop culture and in connection with various other gags and parodies. <br /> <br /> Buster & Babs, the main characters of the show, as mentioned above, were in some ways similar to Bugs Bunny, but also had their own different personality sticks and comic styles, namely Babs' tendency to suit everyone while Buster, who is able to be a big idiot himself, usually played a pure man (or a straight rabbit) to Babs' antics. Plucky Duck was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck (not a Daffy screw game, but an egomane Daffy), with nearly as big an ego as Daffy and as obsessive about upgrading the Buster & Babs as Daffy with bugs bugs flat on the face, but he remained strangely adorable. Hampton was an even more timid version of Porky Pig, and he had the thankless job of playing Porky against Plucky's Daffy. Shirley, the blonde duck-wife, was a girl from the New Age Valley, with whom Plucky went to show her affection in phases of spotting or gambling. Dizzy was the violet version of Tasmanian Devil. Furball was the silent New Year's Eve and Sweety the pink Tweetie Bird. There was also the violet female skunk, who longed for a friend, and the pint-sized versions of Wile Coyote and the Road Runner. The evil was defined as Montana Max, a rich boy who was always out to make money or make people's lives unhappy. There was also Elmira, a confused animal lover whom everyone feared. And then there was Godo Dodo, a strange creature that did not have a clearly identified species, except that it came from "Wacky Land" or something like that. Pop culture credentials included Batman (quite common), Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Wolf Dances, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supergirl, Fast Food Joints, The Ten Commandments, The Twilight Zones, Saturday Night Live and even The Simpsons , > <br /> Not only funny, but also warm and touching, something his successor "Animaniacs" has never quite reached. Also followed by "Taz-Mania".
