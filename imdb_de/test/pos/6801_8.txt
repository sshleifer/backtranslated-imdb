"National Velvet" tells the story of Velvet Brown, a young Englishwoman who dreams of competing for her beloved horse at the prestigious Grand National Horse Race. The film follows her as she trains her horse with the help of a former jockey and the support of her parents. <br /> <br /> While "National Velvet" is a family movie, this fact should not scare anyone who usually views the movies with ridicule. The film is indeed one that will appeal to the whole family, not just attention grabbing teens. It even managed to land five Oscar nominations, which is hardly a copy for a general public. Anne Revere, in the role of Velvet's mother, actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was indeed excellent in the role, but it's the twelve-year-old Elizabeth Taylor who steals the show. She is a charming presence and shows a talent beyond her years. Also on board are Oscar winner Donald Crisp as Velvets father, Mickey Rooney as former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of her first film roles) as Velvets older sister. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Technicolor of the film makes it possible The second of the two Oscars of the film secured itself an attractive visual experience during the processing. In addition, the film was nominated for directing (by Clarence Brown), Cinematography and Art Direction. Noteworthy is also the score of the ten-time Oscar nominee Herbert Stothart, who was not overshadowed. <br /> <br /> All in all, National Velvet is a wonderful family movie that deserves a higher rating. I realize that the prospect of watching a movie about a girl and her horse is not going to thrill some people, but it's worth having a chance.
