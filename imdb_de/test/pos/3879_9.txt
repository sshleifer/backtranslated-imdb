He did one at Christmas to bring back a number one song, and now the great Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the actors and maybe even a crew of one of his favorite TV series as a child, The A-Team. The only member he could not get was the late great George Peppard, who starred in Col. John "Hannibal" Smith, but got some medium to try and help. He managed to reunite all members, including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton "Faceman" Peck # 2), who joined Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Captain "Howling Mad" Murdock), Melinda Culea (Amy Amanda Allen) , William Lucking (Colonel Lynch) and Lance LeGault (Colonel Roderick Decker, the only member of the team that has died). He spoke in an expected interview with Mr. T. (Sgt. Bosco "B.A." Baracus), but he could not appear for reunification. It was really fun to see him trying to find them and talking to them, even though they probably did not want to, and the reunification is, of course, the great climax. Very well!
