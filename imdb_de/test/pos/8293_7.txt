This is certainly a good movie, beautifully photographed and played evocatively. Nevertheless, one should certainly criticize it and Mizoguchi, because it is not without flaws and weaknesses. Mizoguchi really cared about women and wanted to make statements about the lack of compassion and total cruelty of the man. Nevertheless, he sometimes tries to use the wrong means to make that statement. This is certainly a case in "The Crucified", "Princess Yang Kwei Fei" and "Zankiku monogatari". He sets the scenario in feudal Japan, which leaves the audience with the partly correct exclamation at the end: "Boy, sucks the feudalism, I'm glad it's over ...". It is true that some of the scenarios in which Mizoguchi's weaker films exist would be impossible in literary terms today. In addition, his female characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic self-sacrifice, making the scenario less appealing. "Crucified Lovers" is a good movie with so few relative weaknesses, though the sometimes cool, cynical prose by Ueda, the scriptwriter, helps this film. I still prefer and recommend Mizoguchi's "realistic" contemporary films from 1936: "Osaka Elegy" and "Sisters of the Gion" as well as his late masterpieces, in which he showed more reserve and subtlety: "Ugetsu". 'Sansho Dayu' and 'The Life of Oharu'.
