When you think of golf movies, think of Caddyshack, but what if children are around? Go directly to this movie! The use of Disney is a proven formula for making a movie that appeals to both adults and children. The acting in this movie is pretty good in my opinion and the main part is for the most part very young! This movie is also very well and uniquely shot, seeing all angles of the game of golf. I think this film should be awarded for some Academy Awards for film editing or the like, since the entire movie flow is top notch. Although the end may be a bit predictable, the film does a good job by itself! It also shows that you do not need cursing, nudity or violence to make a great golf movie!
