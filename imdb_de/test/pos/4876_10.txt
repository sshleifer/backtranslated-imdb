I also participated in the RI International Horror Film Festival and can easily see why this movie was awarded the best show. SEA OF DUST is a wild game of horror, comedy and beautiful scenery. A story from the past of strange events. An increasingly common disease, with an overwhelming irritating side effect of the explosion of people's heads, carries the apprentice of a young professor; Stefan, to investigate. On his travels, he decides to make a short detour and ask again for his long love hand in marriage, only to be packed once again by her extremely stubborn father? On the way "out of town" he comes across a sick girl on the street and brings her to Dr. Maitland (brilliantly played by aspiring Vincent Price as the actor: Edward X Young). Who fills Stefan in the Evils a foot. Only the doctor is offended that he had called for the professor and received only one boy in training? Nevertheless, it turns out that Stefan is much more than just an ordinary viewer. Horror icon; Tom Savini portrays the ultimate religious torturer. Prester John. Cry queen; Ingrid Pitt retires to perform outstandingly as Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting actresses seamlessly kept the story together and effectively brought it to a climax. <br /> <br /> Dark religion and beyond, but fun and sometimes very original gore scenes play a big part in hammer tribute. This stylish film moves back and forth between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and the reality of character. <br /> <br /> Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very funny movie! Slapstick, tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads between the dark storyline. As others have said; This is really like three great movies in one. Very entertaining and original.
