When I saw this movie at a festival years ago, I was very impressed and started looking for it. Nothing to do, either in theaters, on DVD or on Blue Ray. Absolutely nothing !!! How is it possible that this can really happen? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is fascinating and filmed in a very original way, the music is perfect and James Franco is hot as hell !!! it is the right life !!!!!!!!!! This is really a very good movie that people should see and deserves another chance !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Edvard
