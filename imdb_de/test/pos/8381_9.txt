I am a little disappointed with Tarantino since the death certificate. But I insist that it was just a little bit because I appreciate the amount of work that such a tribute to stunts people brings. The inglorious Basterds has definitely taken Tarantino to the top of my universe. This movie can be summarized in a word (albeit inadequate): "RAW". <br /> <br /> There is an intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main topics. From the beginning of the film, one feels pity for the victims of the Nazis and is placed in Tarantino's fictional dimension of the historical context of World War II. <br /> <br /> Characters are unpredictable, funny, scary, brutal, sexy and other adjectives that I'm sure will escape my mind, which are just as fitting and positive. I will not go into appreciation of each character, but the other comments of the co-users summarize the appreciation of the different achievements. <br /> <br /> The dialogue has evolved from the classic provocative style of Tarantino "Bad Ass", as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. You can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino makes more open references to other films. In fact, many dialogues were close to the cinema visit, the setting takes place in part at a movie premiere; a reference to a movie is close to every corner. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see that every language (German, French and English) is pretty much the same and natural. I speak fluently French and English and am often disappointed with how English-speaking characters in French films behave badly and how French-speaking characters behave poorly in English / American films. Amazingly enough, Tarantino managed to gain a natural and graceful performance from his actors. It helps to place the audience in a historical context. Indeed ; Soldiers, spies and civilians rarely understood soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries. <br /> <br /> The visuals / photography is beautiful, and landscapes convincingly convey a Europe of World War II of the 1940s. The outfits are perfect and the violence is orgasmic / realistic. No beatings are withheld and the Nazis are often tortured. This does not make the movie accessible to all viewers; Graphical violence can shock the more sensitive populations. Volumes can be written for this film. But the movie is so good that I had to pee during the premiere of the North American Inglorious Basterds at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal, but I did not want to leave to miss a single scene. I hope this picture shows how much I feel about this movie, and I'm a tough audience that I like.
