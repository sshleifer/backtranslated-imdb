I wish there were more films about middle-aged people. The intellectual journey and the turns of the moral road of life make an interesting consideration possible. Women who have extramarital affairs seem to judge differently than men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behavior towards her husband seems to be without comment. Turn the roles around and expect the man to face a flood of condemnation. If she found her husband boring and judgmental, she would have been able to tell him, went away, waiting for undoubtedly great financial compensation after the divorce. The country and London scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich, while the autumn weather complements the melancholy background perfectly. The end is perfect, in keeping with the real adult life.
