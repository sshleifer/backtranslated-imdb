I saw this for the first time on Thames television and loved it. I then saw a terrible criticism from someone who certainly had not seen or heard it. So I bought a copy and then another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL VHS or Region 2 DVD. The Australian version is great, but this one is better! I could buy another .............
