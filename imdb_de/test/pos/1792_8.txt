The dealer of Four Seasons is not at all what I would call a happy movie, or even one that impressed me so much that I praised him in the sky (there are other Fassbinder films like Veronika Voss and the underestimated Satan) brewing). But it's certainly a fascinating experiment to take a look at those in a society that you and I and others we know know or may not really want to know. I can imagine that in the early 1970s in Germany, a generation from World War II had a stigma that she could live with, but did her best to cope. This is a stigma that runs through the entire film, and in many cases in Fassbinder's work in general. Most of all, with Four Seasons being the middle-class and one particular couple - distanced, depressed, angry Hans the - observing fruit vendors and his longtime wife - this is nothing short of an attempt to be realistic in the guise of a melodrama. If Cassavetes was a crazy German, he could make this movie, maybe just as a lark. <br /> <br /> The story just sounds when Hans's alcohol consumption gets out of control, he beats his wife (this scene is one of the hardest to do, maybe in any movie, the way Fassbinder's does Camera sits without cut because his wife remains helpless and her daughter tries to stop him in his rage) and then she is ready to leave him. When he stands in the room and his family holds him back, she calls for a divorce and he gets a heart attack there. He recovers, his business suddenly starts to boom again with the help of some good (or less good) employees - and this only continues his longing for another woman and his despair in general. Fassbinder, however, tries this simplicity, and mostly succeeds in the kitchen, in the bedroom, or out in the street, it creates a fearful mood to create a tense mood that you can cut and bleed with a knife. The weakest part of it may be the spectacle ... at least that was my first impression. Hans, played by Hirschmuller, can be a stilted presence, with only the slightest movement in the face and eyes, and for a while it does not look like he's a good actor. The actress, who plays his wife Irm Hermann, and her sister (Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla) are doing better, but only because they have conventionally more to do, like crying or looking worried. It takes some time to adapt to what is essentially an emptiness in his husband Hans. Something from his own psychological self-complaint or self-pity that pervades himself and the people around him, who only want to get away with a sense of normalcy, especially if Hans is successful. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Four Seasons does not all come together, but enough to recommend to those looking for a different stage of life than you might need with more modern American films. Fassbinder's world is a struggle between the melodrama he loves in the cinema and the harsh, crushing sense of humanism he personally senses and places in characters with which we somehow identify with the good or the bad. Are the Epps a family you know? Or could you even be her? Who is to say? It is a methodological study of the tragic emptiness in the human mind, and all its goals are achieved.
