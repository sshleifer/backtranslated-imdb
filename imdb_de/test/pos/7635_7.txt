L'OSSESSA, aka THE TORMENTED or THE SEXORCIST, or the ridiculously titled THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST rip-off that contains one of the best horror moments I've ever seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes alive. This great scary scene is memorable and absolutely effective (great effects). It's a shame that the rest of the movie does not maintain the level of scaryness of this scene. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most frustrating movies ever. Imagine that the producers would choose to make an EXORCIST copy, but in fact they manage to create something truly original (a possessed sculpture of a crucified man that is shocking, if you think about it), but then completely their original idea Forget Make a boring and uninspired EXORCIST rip-off. If the film had continued with the obsessed sculpture concept (with the characters who wanted to destroy it, etc.), this film would have rocked. But once the girl is obsessed with the spirit of sculpture, it does not tell anyone where the demon came from. She and the script forget the enigmatic crucifix, that is STUPID !!!, completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like so-called "Eurokult" films, the first 45 minutes will deliver an incomparable effect films. But after the scene in which the girl has the vision to be crucified, and she gets stigmata, the remaining 45 minutes SUCKEN. Boring. There is nowhere as fast as it tries to emulate THE EXORCIST (bad). So take a look at the first 45 minutes of L'OSSESSA and enjoy the 70s fashion, the sleaze and the amazing statue-alive-to-ravish-the-girl scene, but press after the first 45 minutes the stop button and the ejection Just as well fold your toenails.
