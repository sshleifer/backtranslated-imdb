I loved this original script and the different places it took me, emotionally, spiritually and just stupid stuff. I'm not involved in "credibility" in the script or the actors and did not even think about it until I read the reviews listed here in IMDb. It's really interesting to hear Michael Parness interviewing Q & A about his idea of ​​filming and seeing how crazy people or "f'ed" people fall in love, as he said. I identified with it that I had no romance for the story book and liked that dysfunction was best. I like watching David Krumholtz in everything he does and have followed his career for several years. I think that's some of his best work and tell everyone to just watch this movie to see an amazing young actor. I agree that Guillermo Díaz was really a scene-robber and what he did to his character is really a great acting lesson. I both laughed and cried in this movie and was disappointed he did not win prizes at the festival. I wonder why that did not happen. I gave Max and Grace ten because these interesting, unique, creative indie films deserve an audience. Technically, is this movie really beautiful? The colors are amazing and it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie in a long time.
