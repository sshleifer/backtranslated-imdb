This game is not exactly the best N64 game ever. Sure, it's good, but only if there are 4 players. Without 4 players, the only fun you can do is to take distant mines and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game consists of levels where you have to rescue Natalya. Therefore, you must limit the use of remote mines in these levels. That gets pretty boring. The graphics do not quite reach the level of Super Mario 64 or even Mario Kart 64. And if you speak of a great multiplayer in a 1st person shooter, you have to choose Perfect Dark. At least you can play multiplayer alone.
