My father The hero used to be my favorite movie when I was younger. It's about Andre, a divorced Frenchman who wants to take his beautiful daughter (Katharine Heigl) on holiday, hoping to get a little closer to her. Of course, Nicole is not so easy to get along with, she's just started puberty, I think, is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to take it hard for him. One day on the beach Nicole meets pretty Ben and she tells a wild story about her and her father. The whole island gets involved and the movie becomes a fun, entertaining, entertaining movie. I would give My Father The Hero 8/10
