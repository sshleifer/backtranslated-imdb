Gary Busey played great rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly (1936-59). He has a spiteful picture of the man. Being a garage band in the 50s is certainly different from today. Having a group of three is usually easy. I bet Buddy Holly (Busey) was a much better musician than most I've heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, although his mother strongly supported her son's work. That's one of the reasons he did not act like Elvis. He stuck to his friendly ways. That really makes him good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated Rock'n'Roll, that made Holly great. Getting used to the other atmosphere was a challenge for Holly and his friends. He went on tour with Sam Cooke, went to the famous Apollo, which the African American audience quickly accepted, I liked that! And Sam Cooke made sure that Holly and his band got a service. That's what I call tolerance. It is sad that he, Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson broke off her music career in a plane crash in 1959, at least her memories will live on in our hearts. I can not say what inaccuracies were in the movie, all I care about is that Buddy Holly overcame the barriers of music and politics and the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey he was perfect in the role and also made the music. God bless you GARY BUSEY! 5 STARS!
