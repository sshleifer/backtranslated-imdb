I have both enjoyed Van Dykes over the years and I was glad to see them again. <br /> <br /> Just cute and funny and easy to see and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dick was good when he was younger, but I enjoyed him more as he got older. Son Berry was a great way to follow in his father's footsteps. <br /> <br /> Together they form a great team and work well together. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed that I have not found another Murder 101 listed anywhere. <br /> <br /> I saw both that were shown. I hope for more as it is really a fun duo you can see. <br /> <br /> You can safely say that Berry follows in his father's footsteps, they talk the same way and have the same behaviors. <br />> Would enjoy everything they do separately. <br /> <br /> Be sure to see everything you do alone and together.
