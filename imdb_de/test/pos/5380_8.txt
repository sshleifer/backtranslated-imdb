From time to time, you stumble upon a movie that surpasses even your wildest expectations. Given the IMDb rating of 4.0, I did not expect much from The Brotherhood of Satan. I hoped it would at least be kitschy fun, like The Devil's Rain, or one of the other satanic horror movies of the early 70s, which was similar to Satanic's. I could not have been more wrong. What I got instead was an ambitious and intelligent movie with a cast that I really enjoyed. To avoid betraying anything, the style and structure of the film are much more experimental than the straightforward narrative that was so prominent in the early 1970s. The Brotherhood of Satan does not beat you with action points and explanations. The viewer has much left to fill in the blanks. As a viewer, you know something is wrong, but for the longest time you're not sure what it is. The unknown contributes to a far scarier atmosphere than most similar films. The end is effective with his surreal images. I was amazed when the credits began to run. Those who want a big slam-bang finale will be disappointed by the simplicity of the ending. A smaller movie would have tried to pull out all the stops and most likely failed miserably. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the film where it's easy to forget that director Bernard McEveety had mainly worked on television before the Brotherhood of Satan. There are some scenes that are so well adjusted, lit and filmed that even the most accomplished director can learn a thing or two. For example, over the years, I've seen enough movies to realize that directors sometimes have trouble making widescreen indoor shots. Not here. The scene in which the men talk about their action plan in the sheriff's office is amazing. We see all five men at the same time? everyone does their own thing as in real life. In a smaller film we could see all the men at once, but everyone would be motionless and would wait quietly for his turn to lead his dialogue. It's a small scene, but it looks so natural and so beautifully filmed that it's one of my favorite moments of The Brotherhood of Satan. <br /> <br /> Finally, I mentioned the acting in my opening, so without going into lengthy speech, I'll just say that the Brotherhood of Satan contains Strother Martin and LQ Jones. Every movie with these two guys is almost an automatic winner for me.
