Martin Ritt's first film (three years later) offers an extraordinary existentialist response to Elia Kazan's rather conservative "On The Waterfront". While "Waterfront" profited immensely from an electrifying Marlon Brando who inadvertently veiled Kazan's offensive attempt at masking attempts to justify names (as Kazan justified before the House Un-American Activities Committee), "Edge of the City" features a young John Cassavetes and an aspiring Sidney Poitier, who dared to ask questions that the Waterfront did not recognize, namely workers' rights and racial relationships. <br /> <br /> "Edge of the City" boldly plunges into this (then) unfamiliar territory, and though the appealing black protagonist (Poitier) seems a bit simplistic, Hollywood is the brave fight against thinly veiled bigotry and violence barely aged. One wonders how shocked the first moviegoers of 1957 were over such a bold display of white-black relationships (if some of the bigots have not left the theater early, they must be amazed, if not insulted). <br /> <br /> The final role of the film will still surprise audiences as it refuses to sink into expected stereotypes, including those that have invaded the Waterfront. Only the most confused viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining movie "Edge of the City" is all about. <br /> <br /> What bothers most about this lost classic: how it's unfortunately not available in any format, z reasons that stay rather cloudy. This movie should be seen in high school or college history lessons across the country, but you can only find it in obscure late-night TV, if that.
