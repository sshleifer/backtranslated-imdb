How do you describe perfection? In the mood for love! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong dance virtually on screen and offer outstanding performances that stay with you hours after leaving the theater. Each scene in the film is associated with the powerful combination of superb camera and image selection, world-class drama and sensual soundtrack. Nat King Cole, who sings in French, sets the tone for the entire movie. Maggie and Tony look wonderful, with Maggie hanging around in truly glorious cheongsams, and Tony, who's always elegant. I've seen this movie several times and every time I see it, I find something new to rave about. Love it!
