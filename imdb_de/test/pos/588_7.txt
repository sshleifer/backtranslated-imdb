The first full-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved Muppet characters is a very proficient musical comedy as Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree, swampy environment for the bright lights (attacked by stranded Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise, who overheard him singing). Along the way, he meets Fozzie Bear (a miserable comedian in the El Sleazo Caf√© of James Coburn, who has Telly Savalas as bouncer and Madeline Kahn as patron!), Pianist Rowlf, beastly drummer Animal, and his laity. back, funky band, egotistical beauty queen Miss Piggy (in a ceremony conducted by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc. All the while, Kermit and others are being pursued by Frogleg burger magnate Charles Durning and the reluctant acolyte Austin Pendleton Cars, ice cream, and balloons by Milton Berle, Bob Hope, and Richard Pryor served the food of careless waiter Steve Martin, who was almost brainwashed by the crazy German scientist Mel Brooks, and eventually landed an audition in the offices of film mogul Orson Welles (who has Cloris Leachman for a secretary)! The pleasant song score is by Paul Williams, who also appears as a resident pianist on El Sleazo's. I've recently purchased four of the following Muppet films for the record and should watch them in the coming weeks when it's their turn.
