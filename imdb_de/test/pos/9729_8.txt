And she was really beautiful (Laraine Day, that's her) - herself, her role and her performance. A captivating story of selfish vs. selfless love for the same man, the wealthy heartbreaker and the dipsomaniac Robert Cummings. One of his noisy efforts leads to an incident that upsets the local community and tests the courage of the two sisters (Jean Muir and Laraine Day) who are close to him (and each other). Their comfortable and somewhat superficial milieu is enhanced as the two girls grapple with the resulting crisis and respond to their conflicting demands for wisdom, integrity, loyalty and love. After abandoning the old vanities and subtleties, their real characters reveal themselves in a fascinating contrast. <br /> <br /> A wonderful find on TCM!
