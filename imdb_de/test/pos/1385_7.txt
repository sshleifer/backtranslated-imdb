"The Planet" is an amazing piece of filmmaking. For just Â£ 8,000, Stirton Production has long been recognized as one of the most original science fiction movies. <br /> <br /> Physically intimidating Mike Mitchell is a mix of great special effects storytelling and well planned action. From the first space battle to the hectic finale, everything about this film seems to be well above its budget. <br /> <br /> To start with the special effects, they are not "Revenge Of The Sith" standard, but they are at the market level if not above, like Babylon 5 and Farscape. And for a small price. The detail and movement is superb and captivates the imagination of the off. The design of everything, of ships, weapons, entities is unsurpassed. The imagination and creativity is a real surprise for a movie with this budget. <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the strength of the story and the bow she needs. There are a few twists and turns, most of which are well written in the script, surprisingly and well played out. I was surprised that for the first time two years ago and fifteen years ago, people thought about how important some aspects of history are for today's society. Events around the world may resonate with the length the mercenaries are forced to survive. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects are just right, as well as the atmospheric music. The use of light and costume adds to the professional look. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen looks like a lonely place. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film looks 10, if not 100, budgets, and it shows a creative, hard-working team of directors, cast, effects on the producer, and the sound team , Wonderful effort, I recommend that you get a copy as soon as possible
