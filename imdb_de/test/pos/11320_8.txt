This is a pretty good movie for the TV version "What if". What if terrorists exploded a "dirty bomb" in a big city, London in this case? Many people come across people who say, "We're all ready in an emergency," and then show they do not tell the whole story. And is someone prepared for something like that? You can not bet on it. This shows the material for the smuggling of bombs into the country, the bomb making, the secrecy and the double life that people are behind it, etc. It also shows public servants (firefighters) who do everything they can to save people, if you do not get help, if the government does not want to send anyone to the affected area. It also shows how annoyingly inadequate "preparations" are for such an event, as the government discusses everything and then stands there with open mouths as the tragedy unfolds. And could this happen in the good old US? Well, unless you've been living in caves for the past 20 years, something already and to some extent, and you can not bet someone's getting ready for something like this. That's pretty realistic and yes, even scary. Worth seeing, but I just hope that something really does not happen. 8 out of 10.
