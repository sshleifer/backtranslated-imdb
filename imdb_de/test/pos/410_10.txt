While many refer to it as a B-movie, it's actually a top-notch comedy that's well written and played. Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton, better known as Radio Buddy as The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fianc√© Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a very good cast of criminals. I've read a review of this movie that says Vincente Minelli directed this movie, unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who shot all three Fox movies. This is a very entertaining movie made when imagination was promoted. Overcome your black and white prejudice, if you have one, sit back and enjoy a really great comedy. This was Red's first lead as well. Note the reference to Orson Welles's War Of The Worlds broadcast during the climax.
