This is not a life-changing movie; It is not an epic or something similar. But it's entertaining and fun. It's a movie that the whole family can watch together, and right now there are very few children-friendly movies that DO NOT contain a love story! It tells a good story in a carefree way, without trying to blind the audience with outstanding special effects, as many films are today. The drama is pretty good, and all the music that was used fits in well with the movie content. The acting is also pretty good, the actors look comfortable and believable in their environment and, above all, the jokes are actually funny. I would recommend it to people of all ages - it definitely made me laugh. :)
