When his older mother, Emily (Jeanne Bates), is attacked by her tenant Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and becomes a cannibalistic monster, television reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) tries to prevent the dear old mother from satisfying her hunger /> <br /> Although the above summary of the plot evokes images of trashy, exaggerated horror songs of the '80s such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, it turns out that Mom is indeed a refreshingly original version of the werewolf / vampire. Zombie myth (just what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it's not pretty!), As well as a touching study of the close connection between mother and son: Clay's devotion to his mother causes him to do all other duties including his job and relationship with pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough), while Emily's love for Clay ultimately drives her to self-destruction. Technically, the film could be sharper and have a more stylish feel and better effects (the creature shots are kept very short so as not to disappoint), and some experienced members of the cast are frustrated with horribly cheesy performances (Yes, Brion James and Stella Stevens, I'm referring to you); Fortunately, however, the strong emotional undercurrent in the well-constructed story is enough to ensure that Mom is an effective, compelling, and sometimes shocking story that I recommend without hesitation to those who seek something different.
