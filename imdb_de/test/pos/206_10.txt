The plot of this film is juxtaposed with the most terrible war in human history: the violent clash between Adolf Hitler's Germany and Soviet Russia from 1941 to 1945. Wrecked with the western territories of their country and 20 to 30 million Russians killed are still in Russia today to feel. Not to mention the year 1957, when the memories were still very fresh and painful. <br /> <br /> This very black environment is in stark contrast to the fine and coherent style of the 'Letjat Zhuravli' beautiful photographs. Her simple story is about human behavior in wartime: courage, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption. Everything tied together nicely by a toy squirrel. <br /> <br /> Add to this really great spectacle, and it's easy to understand why this movie is so famous. Really one of the best ever made. <br /> <br />
