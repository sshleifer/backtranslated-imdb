This movie is probably not the funniest I've ever seen, and it has NO redeeming value. In fact, it's really nothing more than a collection of vignettes held together by a loose plot. However, this setting affects how you can do it to the benefit of the movie. "Tommy Boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that the SNL sketches of Farley and Spade have made the lead: their untold stupidity and chaos make them humorous despite their immaturity.
