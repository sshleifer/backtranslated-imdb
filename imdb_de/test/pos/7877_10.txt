Oh man, this movie is awesome. It's very good, it's a story about a man who does not like to accept black people. He sits at a bar at night, trotting over hippies who oppose the war, and how blacks and hippies do not deserve to get social insurance. This movie is very realistic because it depicts a guy "Joe" who represented a lot of people back then, and now too. The story goes like this ... Joe is in a bar and he rubs shoulders with a rich man who accidentally killed his daughter's hippie boyfriend. And this rich man goes to the bar to rethink what he's just done, and while he does, "Joe" is in the bar, raging about hippies and people opposed to the war. The rich man accidentally tells Joe that he killed a hippie; and obviously Joe applauds the rich guy because Joe hates hippies. Amazing movie, watch what happens next. I liked this movie because it reminded me of that time in the early 70's. I liked how movies were made back then. Very good stuff. It's not like today's movies. Basically, the film gives you an insight into the head of the main character "Joe". I like the theme of the movie ... about the worker who wants to rip his ass and tries to make a living
