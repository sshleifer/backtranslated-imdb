This movie should do something very special, it should not do certain things. In short, it has a certain intentional trajectory - the idea of ​​facing death (with very few choices and bad choices) as serious and real, rather than something casual or funny. In search of this realism, certain conventions such as obvious arcs and hooks were avoided. It's not about the characters, it's about the human condition. No matter what the actors would do ... what would YOU do in their situation? <br /> <br /> Open Water may have been an initial idea for this film, but goes much further. In the end, unlike this movie, if you find out there are really no sharks you could ever talk about, it does not cheat the audience. This has a real monster, not just the idea of ​​a monster and not just an animated stand. It also has fine production values, considering what these very resourceful filmmakers had to deal with. And unlike this other movie, it has exciting and brilliantly rendered action at its peak. And let's not forget the "dazzling" presence of the youngest star. It can prove to be a find.
