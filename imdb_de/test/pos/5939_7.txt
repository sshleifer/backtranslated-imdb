This was essentially a remake of "Diagnosis Murder" without Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter. Dick plays a college professor who teaches Criminology 101 and can not even find his own classroom. Barry is now a private look, not related to Dick. As a result, Barry can shoot at guys who jump away from him, what a police officer can not. Barry still gets the girl in the end. Tracey Needham portrays the girl. She is the prime suspect and Dick and Barry believe she is innocent and prove it. That's all the spoiler you get. The end is sufficiently unexpected that you will not know it half way through the movie yet. <br /> <br /> Do not take it seriously. Do not criticize criticism Just sit back and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
