This movie was fun! Especially if you are between 8 and 15 years old. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes form a credible team of eighth-graders who return to an adult who truly deserves it. Paul Giamatti is a great adult you really want to "get". My 13-year-old daughter and her friend were thrilled. Parents: No really bad words or sex to worry about. Recommend it to the "right" crowd.
