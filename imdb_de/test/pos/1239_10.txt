Why should I say that? Because when the movie was over, I was in a good mood. So many people call out in the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be funny. For those of you who believe he has learned to act in the sixth sense, you must be very new to his career. He won an Emmy for best actor in a comedy series before playing The Hard. It's like saying, wow, heaven has learned to put snow on the ground just because it's the first winter in life. The movie was hilarious. What baffles me is, as some other comments on this film claim, that there are no memorable lines or scenes. Spoiler ... <br /> <br /> The Waaaambulance? I'm not a loser Have you ever seen a grown-up scream I've never seen before? <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was great. It was funny, it never got boring and in a kind of cheesy Disney style it made sense to do it. It has something to do with life and of course every children's movie that tries to do that is over the top, but for once I did not care. Do this. You will like it.
