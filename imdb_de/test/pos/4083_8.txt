I saw this at two o'clock in the morning on local Mexican television and decided to give it a try as it relates to a real-life case involving the assassination of the typical American family (a father, a mother and a young son). <br /> <br /> At the beginning, evidence suggests that Walker is the killer, as he had strong differences with his father. Shortly thereafter, when Walker and Luke are taken to the sheriff's department. In order to be examined by the lie detection engine, it turns out that things are very different. <br /> <br /> When Walker and Luke make an appointment with their father's lawyer, they learn that Luke will receive $ 200,000. Walker is out of heresy. Luke immediately buys a convertible. Anyway, this is an excellent mystery movie about treachery, ambition, feelings and cold, very cold blood. I know the real name has changed, but the experience is still the same. Try this movie. I know there are hundreds of "real-life-based" or similar events, but this one is really worth it. Quality on acting, directing and action.
