Wow, I just got this movie from Blockbuster and I love to find such gems. While it was definitely shot on a budget and misses some awkward editing (ie accident, hospital scenes, last but not least final scenes), I only give 10 stars for a first directorial work! I absolutely love the ideas that make you think so, and if you're a freethinker and open to ideas, I highly recommend this movie. I think the director and author Jay Floyd should be given some attention and more opportunities in the film industry. Due to his credits he could be another Quentin Tarantino.
