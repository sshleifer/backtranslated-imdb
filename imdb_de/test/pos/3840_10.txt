This is one of my favorite movies. The story is just fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of that time, this movie never bores audiences. Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but they lack what we have here. That's funny, creative and always on target. This movie has just one extra that you can not learn in books. However, this is not the best animated movie ever made. This title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story. However, this is a considerable second, followed immediately by The Lady and the Tramp. Just watch it and enjoy one of the cinema's biggest achievements. By the way, I'm not a kid, this is for older viewers who want to recapture their childhood. An absolute must!
