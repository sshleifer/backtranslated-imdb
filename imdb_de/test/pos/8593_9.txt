To answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked the name of the US official named in "Lumumba", the name of the character is "Mr. Carlucci". Frank Carlucci is said to have been the second secretary of the US Embassy in the Congo at the time. He was subsequently named US Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Minister of Defense, and is now Chairman of the Carlyle Group. It is no wonder that Carlucci's biographical sketch on his website www.carlylegroup.com does not recognize his service in the Belgian Congo. If his name was deliberately censored from the HBO version of "Lumumba," it may have been possible to avoid the possibility of HBO being transposed to US courts. However, Carlucci's name is clearly mentioned in the recently released theatrical version of "Lumumba". In that case, I expect him to deny any involvement in Lumumba's murder. Others have commented on the disadvantage with which the film "Lumumba" treats the parties concerned: Lumumba supporters, other Congolese even Belgians. A somewhat more sinister point of view emerges from the BBC's documentary film entitled "Who Killed Lumumba?", The based on the book "The Murder of Lumumba" by the Belgian historian Ludo de Witte. On closer inspection, these films show that the fate of Lumumba and the history of the Congo are not just a question of black and white. Only the murderers of Lumumba believe that.
