I'm surprised by some comments on this site because I really liked this movie. If you are looking for something different, this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical, mindless story that seems to be playing everywhere with Ben Idiot Affleck or another Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual movie, you actually have to watch out for it to turn some people off. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you going, this is a good choice. Warning to parents - there are some pretty graphic sex scenes, so watch when the kids are in bed. People who like Euroflicks will like it. Adam Sandler fans should skip it as it is above their heads and definitely NOT their style.
