If Western Union is not the actual story of building the Transcontinental Telegraph, it certainly captures the spirit and dedication of the people involved in the project. Dean Jagger is the responsible man and one day he is thrown by a horse and carries some broken ribs. Randolph Scott, an outlaw on the run, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but thinks differently and brings Jagger to help. Later he is employed by Western Union and works for Jagger. <br /> <br /> Jagger also hires a young Easterner, played by Robert Young, an engineer. Young makes one of his few rental films outside of MGM for 20th Century Fox. Both Young and Scott become friends, but rivals for Jagger's sister Virginia Gilmore. Western Union has plenty of action, enough to satisfy all Western fans. The telegraph crew has to deal with outlaws, Indians and the problems with working in the garden. Slim Summerville as a fearful cook and Victor Killian as a border guard guarding him have some of the funniest scenes. Both offer a good comic relief. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang got good performances from his cast and kept the movie moving. Western Union is solid western entertainment.
