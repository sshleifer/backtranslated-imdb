This story is set in Wisconsin. I half-looked at the tape when I heard the name Appleton. I was not sure where it was until I heard them say Green Bay. Then I thought it was Wisconsin. The further confirmation confirmed it. <br /> <br /> In fearful anticipation of the result, I really felt Corrine's frustration. I did not know it was factual until the end. I was happy but sad and wanted to know more.
