I added this second version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" to Hitchcock's Top 10 Movies. Together with "Frenzy" this is probably the most talked-about film among the fans of Hitchcock. I think it's way better than "Rebecca," who has gained so much recognition. <br /> <br /> The film contains many ingenious scenes (most of them have been mentioned in other reviews), but that's something to be expected from Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour for everything to happen, but this time is spent preparing for the following events that are full of exciting suspense. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the clumsy back projections, these are just the sole weakness of this movie is the main villain, played by Bernard Miles, a rather shallow and undeveloped character. Fortunately, there is a scary assassin in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, the little boy, is not as irritating as most kids in old movies.
