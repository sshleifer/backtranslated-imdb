Alex North (John Cassavetes) has problems with his relationship with his father and flees home to join the army. From there he will soon leave and come to New York to start a new life. He uses the fact that nobody knows about him past. He finds a job at the Waterfront, where he meets Tommy Tyler (Sydney Poitier), a lively young man happily married, a living contrast to Cassavetes' sad and unhappy character. They quickly become good friends and Tommy does his best to help his friend. The only problem is that her outstanding worker, a hard worker, Charles Malik (Jack Warden), is jealous of her friendship, as well as Tommy's consistent, happy disposition and success in personal life. He really manages to make life difficult for them by learning the truth about Alex's past. <br /> <br /> A good drama that has been cleverly nominated by the Academy Award Sydney Poitier and Jack Warden. 10.7
