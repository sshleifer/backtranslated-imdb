That was so much better than I expected, the film was more professional than other B-moive of this kind of budget. The script was good, albeit somewhat formulaic, but the acting was surprisingly good of everyone, including Lorenzo, and you always expect good standards from Scheider and Busey. Aswell, as the plot and action is good, especially the car chases and crashes are A-Class. All in all, this is an increase over other B-movie thrillers, and it does not rely on constant nudity or a flurry of cheesy puns to make up for budget and scripting flaws, it's certainly worth a hire.
