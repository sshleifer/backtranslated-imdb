For some reason, I've always enjoyed animated ducks: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Although none of them are as confused as Duckman. Originally aired between 1994 and 1997, Duckman lasted a total of 70 episodes, but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stale. The titular character is a disjointed, unapologetic slob and quite the worst living human in the world. He is a private investigator, a widower, a philistine, an alcoholic, a sex-madman, a murderer, a (fill in the field). They call it, Duckman did it. But who can blame him for being such slender baseball, when the world he lives in is so insane, abominable and simply nonsensical? Eric Tiberius Duckman (voiced by crazy Jason Alexander) could be on his own all over the show, but when surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting actors, all you know is that anger is just waiting to explode on every occasion. My favorite is Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or just Cornfed Pig), Duckman's incredibly fatal buddy who is seemingly talented and highly skilled in everything and does not know the infinite vices and incompetence of his partner. <br /> <br /> The typical plot will include a bizarre case in which he inevitably rummages or turns his highly dysfunctional budget, though Duckman's arch-enemy King Chicken (Tim Curry), a kind of Professor Moriarty in poultry form, some diabolical hiding place has scheme of revenge because I was bullied in high school. <br /> <br /> Since I was a teenager, this was my absolute favorite animation show, better than The Simpsons, Family Guy and even King of the Hill. Nothing will ever surpass it. There was or will never be something like Duckman again. The level of satire, observation humor, and writing is so keen that it is deadly and understands the animation in this unique Klasky / Csupo style (anyone who has seen Rugrats). It's a wonderful, imaginative and wild world, all with a noirish feel of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> You can never have too much of this bird.
