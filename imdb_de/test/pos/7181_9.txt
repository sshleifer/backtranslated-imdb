The second (not animated) film about the only people who still refuse to surrender to the Roman Empire is even more comical than the first film "Asterix & Obelix contre Ceasar". There, the first movie got all laughed because all the cartoon characters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their cartoon-like identity, this sequel (which like all comic books is a separate story) is even better. Sure, all the ingredients you find in the first movie and in the comic books are back: Obelix still wants to taste the "potion" that gives his other tribal members enormous powers, Caesar and the rest of the Roman Empire is still the enemy number 1, but it also brought some new, refreshing elements to the stage. <br /> <br /> Not only very idyllic (most of it plays in Egypt, of course), but movie replay Firstly, some extras were added by making all sorts of references to other films (Bruce Lee etc.). This is not all that new, but the unexpected combination of the familiar story from the comic book (with almost the same title as the movie) and references to stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with Asterix & Obelix really work. <Br /> <br /> In this way, the film builds on a tradition of comic book writers Goscinny and Uderzo, who did not hesitate to bring Laurel and Hardy on stage and even devote a full story to Kirk Douglas <br / > If you can not convince all this to watch this movie, I am sure that Monica Bellucci plays Cleopatra ....
