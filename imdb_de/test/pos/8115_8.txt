I loved this movie! It was charmingly touching and funny. Finally, a story about a group of people who face some challenges, babble a bit and then decide to just be themselves and finally be happy. when did you last see a movie? In dealing with the fluidity of life, love and sexuality, the characters face real problems (albeit in often ridiculous situations such as the men's group travel destination and the explicit real-life contacts) and learn to learn and grow without them the movie preaching becomes dark desperate or too unrealistic. They will love and take care of the characters, who, far from being hollow clich√©s, are real people with a touch of truth behind their potential labels. <br /> <br /> A good Romcom for a Saturday afternoon. and the only movie I've ever seen where sexual fluidity ends happily and nobody is forced to be something they do not want to be. Much better than Kissing Jessica Stein, a good choice if you're tired of watching gay movies that have painful lessons and bitter lessons. Or, maybe you just like a good British move? James Purefoy looks the same as usual, and Tom Hollander is deliciously funny. So go on, watch, enjoy; you will not regret it!
