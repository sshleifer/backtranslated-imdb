Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert cult who tries to revive one of his people just to suffer a heart attack! In the end, he dies on an operating table, and in revenge his mind takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson), who then hacks and dissects until their sisters know what to do to drive out the demon. <br /> <br /> Although I know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it's mostly down to business, "Nurse Sherri" is not that bad. Sure, it was clear that this was very cheap stuff, but all I found annoyingly cheesy was the visual effects. Acting is not as bad as you might expect. <br /> <br /> There are two different versions of it on DVD. A much sexier version that contains plenty of T & A is the original cut, with such funny stupid vignettes as the victim and their love interest sharing their "weirdest sex" moments, including one that includes fellatio during a college lecture ! The film would then be re-edited for the Theatrical Version, with more emphasis on the horror elements. Some scenes are filmed with new scenes (with Stevens, the role of J.C. Wells, expanded). The most memorable sequence of the film in this cut is a scene in a foundry, and it works pretty well. This film clip is more interesting overall; I would recommend a viewer to see and compare both. <br /> <br /> Both versions took their step in the last third and benefited from an amazing scene and scene stolen performance by Bill Roy as the crazy Reanhauer atmospheric climax in a cemetery (though filmed in Adamson's backyard!). Marilyn Joi is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse, attracted to the footballer, becomes patient patient Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), who has lost his eyesight in a car accident and who happens to dissolve the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals , The film also uses music from the personal collection of composer Harry Lubin, including compositions for television series such as "One Step Beyond" and "The Outer Limits". "Nurse Sherri" (known for more alternate titles (including "Beyond the Living" and "Hospital of Terror") than any other Adamson movie) are actually pretty entertaining low-budget plans. In the end I had a lot of fun watching. <br /> <br /> 7/10
