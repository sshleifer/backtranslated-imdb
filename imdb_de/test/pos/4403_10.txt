The Coen brothers really excelled in this wonderful story of three escaped convicts. Although based on "The Odyssey," Homer's old work, you do not have to read "The Odyssey" to follow the story. The Coen brothers have woven a carpet of celluloid and listening pleasure! The soundtrack is inherent to the movie, in fact it is as if the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper. Each character is taken wonderfully and comes from ancient times, when the films were rich in character actors whose appearance adds richness, texture and authenticity in the film. George Clooney is gorgeous, as is the greasy-haired Everett Ulysses McGill, an honest cheater on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are funny and appealing. O brother, Where Art Thou is by far the best Coen movie and Clooney's best. Clooney is good enough to justify a Best Actor nomination, as is Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of devious friend Delmar, while the film itself deserves a Best movie nod.
