This is a phenomenal movie. Really one of the best movies I have ever seen. I'm a serious critic and it takes a lot to touch me, but this movie had all the right combinations for "stirring". The passion of the actors, without the exaggeration, the pain for all involved characters, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce make this film a must, even if it is the 1970s. This is definitely not an "old movie", but a classic / vintage movie. I hope that you are dealing with how I did when you considered how unstable relationships of all kinds can be, even considering how deeply felt pain can be connected with love and how the hardest decisions you make must always be the most painful, but only once will the pain subside, but only gradually. This film certainly shows that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving is certainly not synonymous with loss / lack of love. The making of this film certainly starts from a place that is deep in the heart and mind of a human being.
