This film was very interesting to me, a movie in a movie about a very bizarre director, who persuades an actress and an actor (who dislike each other) to produce film in the production of sex chemistry. The director faces a fusillade of obstacles as she tries to get the two people to perform excellently on film. Sex is Comedy is much more than a comedy, full of uncomfortable, whimsical moments. The film also looks at the psychological and innate instinctive behavior of men and women in relation to the sometimes controversial act of sex. I loved this movie, the character Jeanne played by the beautiful Anne Parillaud. She plays wonderfully on the screen as you join her fight to produce a film artwork.
