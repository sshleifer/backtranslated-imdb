Having recently seen Cry Uncle from the same director, I decided to find out, and I'm glad I did! This is an exceptionally good movie. Far, much better than the ingredients might seem. How many times did we have to suffer the embarrassment of someone playing a middle-class dad who mixes him with the flower children! And here it is made credible thanks to a perfect script. Not ideal, not good or bad, but believable. Peter Boyle, as a working class, hippie and little hater, and Dennis Patrick as a jaunty suit, play their respective roles flawlessly, and I can not remember ever seeing the two classes come together without things becoming sentimental. Susan Sarandon is effective as a hippie chick, but does not have much to do in her first movie. This is an absolute must-have movie capture, as it is at this very short time in the Western and especially in the American times, when the counterculture was about to leave.
