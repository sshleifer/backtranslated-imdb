This movie will never be on a list of the 50 best movies of all time, but if you compile a list of "fun movies," this is not a bad starting point. Liv Tyler is awesome, captivating and juicy, and everyone else is absolutely fine for her role. It is a counterpart to "Tom Jones" of the 21st century - in other words; just good, scary fun. I think this may be Tyler's groundbreaking movie on the way to becoming a big star. Without nudity she seeps sex in this movie. No wonder that all boys give their toys. How could they help but for a helpless, innocent person like the Jewel of Liv?
