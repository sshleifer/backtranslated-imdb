... and my reasons are simple - there are so many great films to be presented and discussed here (most of them by their own directors and stars), so many clips about notorious moments in movie history in the 70s and indeed a series of films that I have not seen yet, that it would not be fair to rate this work. According to this logic, I should not have given other film documentaries like Martin Scorsese's personal journey through American films and My Journey to Italy. But while these films were based on a man's point of view on cinema and most of them tell stories, Richard LaGravanese and (the late) Ted Demmes 'A Decade Under the Influence' make the films and the creators speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> What characterizes 'Decade' at least for a watch for movie lovers or anyone who likes the movies of the late '60s and' 70s in America are the levels that are in the Uncut version (three hours, not the Theatrical Cut, to which I have no comment) is abundant ground covered. Interviews include Scorsese, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Julie Christie, Jon Voight, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Schrader, Pam Dier, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper, Robert Towne, etc. Insights from start to finish. Also fascinating is the appearance of the clips and the directors / actors, which are edited in a striking and fast style. <br /> <br /> The only comment I have about the documentation is that most of the information in various books like Easy Riders, Raging Bulls and even though I have not seen the movie version of this I am sure that this (As a matter of fact, the book is one of the best I've ever read, but this documentary is special for the movie connoisseur, and occasional moviegoers of the future may look at it and not only known pictures like Easy Rider, The Last Picture Show, Annie Hall, Coming Home and other famous characters like Scarecrow, Panic at Needle Park, The Landlord, Joe, they do not shoot horses, they also learn who influenced them Waves of Europe and Asia) for whom they served as influence and how the theme that sparked controversy after controversy is still fascinating and chancy material for the contemporary Great mass ut!
