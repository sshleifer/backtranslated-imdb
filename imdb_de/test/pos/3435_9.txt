'Skenbart' is one of the funniest films to come not only from Peter Dalle, but also from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It's a black-and-white movie to learn about the atmosphere before the days before Christmas in December 1945, which works very well. Almost the entire property is in a train that does not go to Berlin. On the train is a mixture of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the literary critic "Gunnar", played by Swedish actor Gustav Hammarsten. The main character "Gunnar" is the type of person who, though his intentions are for the best, seems to make anyone near him extremely funny in a catastrophe and a living hell, especially for a Finnish soldier homecoming, wounded soldier, played by the extremely funny comedian Robert Gustafsson. On the train is also a doctor who cheats on his wife with his mistress. Together they planned to murder the doctor who travels the same train without knowing her husband's intentions. Will the doctor's wife avoid plans to assassinate her, and will everyone else survive the unfortunate fellow "Gunnar"?
