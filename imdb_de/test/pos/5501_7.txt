Founded by the brilliant Monkees TV writers Gerald Gardner and Dee Caruso, WHATWAY TO THE FRONT was the last of the "Jerry Lewis" movies to "Hardly Working" almost a decade later. Jerry's comedy is obviously an acquired taste, and although he can occasionally be his own worst enemy when he is a producer / director - but even in the most desolate of his films, there are always moments of brilliance. > WHERE WAY manages to be amusing, entertaining and yes, quite funny. It's a bit different than the typical Lewis films. The pace is very positive and there are many outstanding support players - a kind of JERRY DOES HOGANS HEROES. The whole thing looks like an unsold television pilot and you'll love it or hate it - but hopefully VILLA LAUGH
