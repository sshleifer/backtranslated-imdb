From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! It took a while for the movie to resume, at least for me, as I expected it to be an outdated America Pie movie. But it was a bit different - a fun loving slacker who graduates from high school and does his own college and does it accordingly. As you might expect, there are many parties and hot girls in bikinis, but this movie has tried much more than a normal teen movie. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students to learn through free speech and ultimately "push into the system." The humor was varied, which I loved. All performers delivered fantastic performances - rent them out with a friend, it's a damn bang!
