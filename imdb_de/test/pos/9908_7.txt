This movie was recently shown as a subtitle and not dubbed in the Australian Special Broadcasting Service. I thought I read here that sometimes there is a presumption that * Rats' revenge * is a sequel. In fact, the rats revenge themselves for something done in this movie or in human history. As far as I know, there is no prequel. <br /> <br /> Now let's get rid of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. Maybe that story came to mind when I saw the movie, but that's all. At the end of the film the word "Kassen" was used. A dazed mayor tries to justify their actions by saying "the coffers were empty". "Kassen" is not a word that you often hear these days, unless you tell your children folk tales as I do. Since I've seen * Revenge of the Rats *, I've read two versions of the Pied Piper of Hameln. Now I see the comparison. A metaphorical fat, but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford to get rid of the rats. This is about as far as I can follow the analogy. The children are not led to a door in a mountain. A lame boy stays behind to talk about a land with winged horses and fountains, where it's always spring and everyone is always happy. <br /> <br /> There's a lot, that's pretty mainstream about this movie. The romance and above all the dissolution. The female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are really quite impotent. Where this film is quite rebellious (compared to American cinema), it is anti-authoritarian. The helicopter pilot is fired by the mayor for "doing good". The mayor and the local government are portrayed as corrupt and given large sums of money. After all, it is up to a doctor in Frankfurt to solve the epidemic of a deadly and infectious disease. There does not seem to be a national agency for infectious diseases that coordinates things or sends in support. <br /> <br /> I'm not a horror aficionado, so any horror I see is usually mixed with humor. From the Rat in the Blood Bank, you can see that for most viewers, this is the right balance between horror and comedy. The number of rats is impressive and even the horror fans seem to be satisfied.
