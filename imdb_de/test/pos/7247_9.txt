The same year as the first Lumiere films, this is a much more dramatic short film than the brothers who tried "Niagara" until the following year. The surviving print is very rough, but this only contributes to the visual violence of the Turneresque, as huge waves of water bounce against a solid pier and are ready to engulf the viewer with the camera. <br /> <br /> If you watch a series of these early shorts in chronological order, and try to get into the mindset of the times, there is another shock that this movie contains a cut in contrast to the lumieres' single-shot structures Anyway, he was as fast as the razor blade in "Un Chien Andoulu". In contrast to the monovision of Lumieres' films, Paul opens up the possibility of multiple perspectives and frees the viewer from the force of nature, which gets rid of in a way that the Lumieres never could. The second shot shows a similar momentum as Niagara, but is less scary because we've messed up the danger by editing it. In a film like 'L'Arroseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe' nature is indifferent and powerful, unimaginable by the camera. The basic grammar of the film puts an end to superiority.
