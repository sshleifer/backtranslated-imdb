Sigrid Thornton (SeaChange) was apparently born to take on the role of Catos Philadelphia Gordon. This story is often compared to Margaret Mitchell's American Civil War classic Gone With the Wind. Waters (Heaven Tonight) is undoubtedly his best role, even when it comes to the interest of her Larrakins. The two leading actors perform a wonderful Australian cast, arguably the best known and most popular Australian miniseries. It's an outstanding overall performance, though you're not trying to see it all at once, and it deserves to be remembered as a wonderful depiction of life in Australia before the Federation. Rating: 8/10
