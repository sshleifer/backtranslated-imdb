This Royal Rumble basically had the message of wrestling these days. Gimmick and image are more popular than wrestling skills. <br /> <br /> HBK vs. Edge. Pretty good game. Much heat for Edge, who has just started as a heel again and how better to get into a match with HBK. In the end it was a bit slower than usual. Overall, this game gets 6/10. Undertaker against Hedinreich. No good match. Undertaker had to carry Hedinreich through this match, which seemed to be lost and messed up his features. It became interesting to see Raw's Gene Snitsky and a little later Kane in this match. Overall, the fans seemed to have more interest in the end of this game. 2/10 Kurt Angle vs. JBL vs. Big Show. This match was slow at first but ended up being pretty good when Angle managed to accelerate the match. JBL and Big Show found a slow game. The end of this game was bad. In this whole match, it was mainly due to Kurt Angle a 5/10. Randy Orton vs. HHH. Good game, surprising heat for Randy Orton, who was the face in this match. Randy has proven that he can reach the limit with every top star. This match also marked the first match HHH has wrestled with, where someone does not run down and saves him from a loss. This whole game was about a 6/10. The Royal Rumble game was fine. Some surprises Some not so good surprises. I was kind of upset that Kurt Angle was not given enough time in this match. But in this whole match there was a man I never thought would be pushed so fast. I will not tell you who wins. I give this game an 8/10
