I recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase that I am currently undergoing. I was born in 1980 and the movie from the mid-80's to the mid-90's has a pretty important place in my growing up. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites, and I was thrilled when it became available in the UK. It has not gotten worse over time, it's still a great fun movie that's got a lot of excitement in its own right. Sure, it fades in the shadow of bigger, bigger budget movies, but do not let that stop you from enjoying it. Worth a rent or even a purchase at the reasonable prices that you will find here.
