This is one of the best television productions of a musical ever. I heard the Merman Cast album, the Angela Lansbury album. I saw Tyne Daly live and saw the Rosalind Russell movie countless times. I think Bette is if not the best, then connected to the best. It captures not only the bravura, but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I've never been a fan of Natalie Wood, so I enjoyed Cynthia Gibb in her best role. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supportive performances is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the ever-reliable Christine Ebersole, are tough to beat. A few years ago, there should be a TV production of Mame, with Cher, but I think Bette would be the best choice (pun) for Auntie Mame.
