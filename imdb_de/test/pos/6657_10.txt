I just saw the DVD and loved it. I thought in particular that the director and Jew and Nicole had done an incredible job with the kiss between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in a movie. I thought it was crucial to set the tone for the rest of the movie. It was possible to make credible that Inman and Ada would be running / waiting for each other all the time without ever having had a relationship. I thought the movie did a much better job than the book itself. I'm sure many of you will quickly call other movie kisses that are best for this movie, but this one is for me! Jude and Nicole had shown incredible chemistry in the far too few scenes they had together.
