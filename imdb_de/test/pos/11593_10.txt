This small, calm, harmonic film becomes a masterpiece of human dignity. It is intelligently structured, filled with meaningful little details and important subplots. It tells the story of a man of great humanity, without positioning himself politically, but promoting life as a precious right (no obligation) and emphasizing the right to vote of the individual. It enjoys the richness of different landscapes (mental and physical) and languages ​​(important detail). Outstanding acting by each of the actors, especially the incredible Javier Bardem. His screen presence has such power that you forget that this is fiction. The film has a wonderful rhythm, it is beautifully filmed and superbly directed. It takes real talent to make a film about such a difficult subject with understanding, humor and heart. Six out of five stars.
