This film is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players who took the championship home 20 years ago. They all met for a reunion. Terry Kinney plays James, a junior high principal, and with all his moaning will quickly annoy me and regret the role. Vincent D'Onofrio plays Phil as a heinous businessman with just the right amount of "money" staff. Tony Shalhoub is George, the current mayor of the city, and is about to collapse. Gary Sinise plays Tom, a writer who has become an alcoholic and, in my opinion, plays a prominent role. While they all probably celebrate their championship, there are many conflicts, jealousies and struggles. When men accept what has been and is now, they are forced to look upon their lives in an unpleasant way. It is unusual for a group of men to talk about it and cry what could have been, and I found it interesting to observe how they relate to each other. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly good enough for a visit.
