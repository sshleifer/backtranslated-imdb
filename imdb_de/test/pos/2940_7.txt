This show is my guilty pleasure! When I first became involved with America's Next Top Model, I expected it to be boring and it's very stupid. I do not have this show is really fun. I read in one of the other reviews that you're wondering if you have what it takes to be America's Next. And it does too! Who does not love the glamor and excitement of modeling? On ANTM you can see how REAL it is. And who does not love when the girls beat each other and fight each other? Or would you like to give something to the Janice Lady? <br /> <br /> Give this a chance. Do not expect something intelligent or a show that you can visit for a lifetime. Just enjoy it as it is. Serious fun!
