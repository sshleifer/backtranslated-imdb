The beautiful yet deadly Alexandra (Stacie Randall's stunning, statuesque blonde beauty, who is absolutely pervasive in a tight black leather outfit) must find a magical amulet for her evil demonic master Faust to pass into our dimension. It is the job of the fearless, robust policeman Jonathan Graves (likable Peter Liapis) to stop them. Meanwhile, two merciless, uncomplicated "comic relief" dwarf dwarf creatures are running amok in Los Angeles. Experienced veteran of Schlock exploitation expert Jim Wynorski tells the most inhuman story at a brisk pace and takes nothing seriously from this stupidity at a distance. The performers fight wildly with the stupid material: the adorable Barbara Alyn Woods as a cheeky policewoman Kate, Raquel Krelle as a cake, sexy whore Jeanine, Bobby Di Cicco as Graves' limping, excitable partner Scotty, Peggy Trentini as seductive museum curator Monica and Ace Mask as the funny dr. Rochelle. Mark Stevi's puerile cookie-cutter script, an amusing, uncomplicated sense of straightforward humor, Chuck Cirino's jumping cornball score, the two dwarfs with obvious cheap gummy Halloween masks, JE Bash's simple cinematography, no tension or superfluous female nudity, by The sticky (less than) special effects further enhance the delicious cheeseiness of this premium piece of celluloid Velveeta. An entertaining brainless piece of adorable lousy dirt.
