I suppose we all, no matter if we're fans of cars, love the sound of a Dodge Challenger growling on the road, the noise a Chevy makes when it screams with ecstasy when it's knocking around a corner and Above all, the sound of a classic vehicle has gone up in flames when it explodes. Although I'm not the biggest car enthusiast, but every one of the above things really turns my engine! It is undeniable how important transport is in the cinema. It was even said that the invention of the train had one of the biggest influences on early cinema (when you look out of the window almost like a moving picture and are put into another time / room). However, the car is still the most popular and developed, it even has its own genre: the genre "Autosploitation". A genre that focuses exclusively on the beauty of cars. It's basically porn only! Car Porn! And I'm not talking about this pretty nasty documentation about Channel 4, where men actually had intercourse with cars. Whatever your ... car is swimming, I guess. It continues ... while RUNNING ON EMPTY is not as pornographic as VANISHING POINT (Richard C. Sarafian, 1971) with its close-ups of the car in motion, all its bumps and curves (!), This does not mean that Car is not the focus of the movie. In fact, the cars themselves become characters (more on that later). They are just as objective and fetishized as women, maybe even more. And holy holy, these cars are something! Any car in this movie (except those in the background) is just beautiful? Artworks, no question. <br /> <br /> As I said, these incredible cars are sort of characters. You actually start to sympathize with the car! SPOILER ?? Especially during the scene where the car is destroyed and the SPOILER OVER is burned. This has almost become a convention of the carsploitation genre; The Wicked 1978 Plymouth Fury by CHRISTINE (John Carpenter, 1983), Satan's Inch Lincoln Mark III in THE CAR (Elliot Silverstein, 1977), the sly little mini coopers of THE Italian JOB (Peter Collinson, 1969) to the befriended Volkswagen Beetle in THE LOVE BUG (Robert Stevenson, 1968) and of course every car from DEATH RACE 2000 (Paul Bartel, 1975) and even WACKY RACES (1968-1970), all of which had their own character. Ironically, however, this emphasis on the car takes the human characters (!) Over! This is certainly the case with RUNNING ON EMPTY, where only a human character (the blind character who drives his car with hearing rather than sight) has some dimension, the rest is very extensive. These are all your stereotypical Australian teenagers of the 1980s; Big hair, annoying accents, and none of them would look inappropriate in NEIGHBORS, especially the Kylie Minouge. But who does that damn? It's about the cars that run and crash! That's it! If you do not like that, really look at the wrong genre. <br /> <br /> The car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film and the best it has to offer. They are fast; very fast! And we're not talking about the pretty annoying technique some movies seem to use when they "speed up" the car at about 40 mph and then accelerate it. Oh no! Not with this movie not. These cars zoom in real time at top speeds? There are no fancy cut tricks here. So we have speed. Check. What about crashes? Check, check, check! Although there are no cars falling EVERYWHERE, like the unbelievable BLUES BROTHERS (John Landis, 1980), but when cars crash in this movie, they definitely overthrow! It seems they use gunpowder or the like to make the cars a small hit, and KABOOM are on fire. It somehow reminded me of THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE (Bo Arne Vibenius, 1974) in that sense. <br /> <br /> Between these simply great scenes (especially the beginning and the end) there are some scenes that slow things down and in my opinion do not contribute much to the movie. Note: more exploding cars needed! However, here are a few exceptions that are great scenes. SPOILER especially the attempted rape scene. <br /> <br /> So all in all, a men's movie! A boy's movie! It's full of cars being led around in the outback, and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure. I would recommend this little movie to anyone, even if he is an enthusiastic cyclist (!)? It's a great movie that you can just turn off, sit back in your leather chair, and turn it on! I give it 3.5 luvs out of 5 luvs ?? Bruuuuum! P.S ?? Amazon sells this for just over â‚¬ 2? It is a real bargain, although the DVD has no special features.
