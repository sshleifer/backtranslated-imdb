<br /> <br /> This film is a summary of Visconti's obsessions: the decadence of nobility, death, aesthetic search, homosexuality ... all blended with melancholy mastery. Slowly, just to enable you to see all its beauty (which is in both the music and the images as well as in the story). We can no longer enjoy this kind of film, courageous, deeply personal and intelligent. The real fruit of a genius like Visconti.
