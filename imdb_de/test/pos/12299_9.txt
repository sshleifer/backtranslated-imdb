A rare exception to the rule that big literature produces disappointing films. John Huston's beautiful farewell to life and the movies is almost entirely in line with the narrative and spirit of James Joyce's short story, a tender meditation on love, death, and time in the events of a twelfth night party in bourgeois dublin around 1910. As uncomplicated as the material may seem, the film succeeds in its willingness to tell the story in its own, calm, seemingly irrelevant manner, instead of forcing a conventional cinematic form of action points and dramatic incidents on it. Only once is the wrong note sounded when old Miss Julia (a trained singer and music teacher whose voice was supposedly broken by age, not broken) sings so strongly that the audience laughs when I see that in the cinema. Fortunately, the mood of muted and gentle melancholy is restored in time for the moment of revelation between the couple Gabriel and Gretta Conroy in a hotel room as it begins to snow. It's a sad story, I suppose, but the way you feel better, not blue. Especially recommended as a date film - for lovers who are not afraid of the sweetness and sadness of life.
