For people like me who were born long after the end of the 60s, we can only learn the time through cultural artifacts, of which "hair" is one. This is certainly a successful tour de force. You can get a feel for how it was for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene is - at least for me - when the group crashes the party of the rich people. As far as the final scene of the film is concerned, it could be interpreted as the symbolic ending of everything the 1960s represented. <br /> <br /> But no matter how you interpret this film, it's important to understand it in the 60s. Even if they may have ended, the movements that characterized them still exist in small enclaves. It's a time people will not forget so quickly. Anyway, this movie is one that I can definitely recommend. Milos Forman got another great album here, right in between his two masterpieces "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" and "Ragtime" (why did he later make a piece of crap like "Man on the Moon"?). Performers John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.
