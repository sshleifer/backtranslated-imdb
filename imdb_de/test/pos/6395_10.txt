It is one of my favorite series. A wonderful cast, a great script and a plea for outdoors. <br /> <br /> As you watch the Kyle family's routine, you'll enjoy great moments of humor and great comedy performers. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no comments. He is one of the best today. Se has a perfect timing and always gets the point of the joke. <br /> <br /> - Tisha Campbell: Her paranoid and sentimental Jay is just wonderful to see. - George O. Gore II: Perfect for the paper. It is impossible to imagine someone as the enchanting (and stupid) junior. Jennifer Nicole Freeman: The ego-centrist Claire has found the perfect actress. Nice and talented. <br /> <br /> - Parker McKeena Posey: Impossible not to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> - Noah Gray-Cabey: This boy has a future, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I will be very sad when it ends, but I will remember this show forever. Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadie ... we love you!
