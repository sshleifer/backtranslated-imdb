I was cast in the beach scenes as Surfer Dude. Cast almost as a sore muscle because the real muscle guy was really late that day. Pauly had made my brother and me (the skateboarder in front of the tattoo studio) in between VJ stuff from Venice since he still did his MTV thing. This movie is also very good. Would I have made my Top 100 if I was not there ........?
