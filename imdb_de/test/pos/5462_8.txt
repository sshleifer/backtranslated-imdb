Okay, maybe the imitations of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not exactly right, but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they work behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are outstanding as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz. <br /> <br /> The movie is not good for joke and punch, but it's still funny. Kathy Bates is particularly impressive as Leno's manager. <br /> <br /> Funny, amazing, interesting and very good to see, this is a good TV movie.
