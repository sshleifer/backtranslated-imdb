Blade is a fantastic action / thriller that keeps you hooked all the time, and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would call his best performance so far. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything you would expect in an action / thriller, it has a lot of blood, courage and thrills, a twisted, disturbed purchase, moments of humor, but above all a very good story with many turns. <br /> <br /> It's a constant action throughout the world movie with breathtaking stunts and effects, Wesley Snipe's fight movement is fantastic. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see in my opinion Wesley Snipe's cool, solid performance makes this movie and I can not wait to see the sequel 'BLADE 2' will be released next year. <br /> <br /> My IMDB Rating: 9 out of 10
