This movie was well played and kept my interest in the main character for the entire movie. Stu Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if Stu were still alive today! This film paints a picture of what Stu Unger's life might have felt like. It was interesting to see how networked. I would have liked to see more details about Stu's party, his art of playing, and his relationship with Bob Stupak. But all in all, this movie was well done, well played and the story touched many facets of a life that was full of events that were bigger than life.
