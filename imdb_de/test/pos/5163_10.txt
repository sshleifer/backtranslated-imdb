A short meeting without spoiler follows. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival. My first reaction is wonder and luck. I am so happy that such films are made in our blockbuster era. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson's new movie "You, The Living" is nothing short of a complete masterpiece. You, The Living consists of about 50 vignettes, which were taken with a static camera. I will not reveal the content of the scenes here, because I hate it when people spoil even the smallest details. But, yes, most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the Claude Debussy Theater absolutely baffled and amazed. When the movie was over, we applauded for a few minutes. We had no choice. <br /> <br /> So what's the score with "You, The Living"? Hm, Andersson is not afraid to face tough questions; History, Guilt, Violence The Holocaust during World War II is a big topic (and these issues work very well together). <br /> <br /> The pictures are brilliant, the depth sometimes exceeds "Songs from the Second Floor". <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for this honorable, honorable review. Watch the Flying House at the beginning! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars - A masterpiece (I never throw that grade off).
