The actor, who became the director of Liev Schreiber, makes an above-average screen version of the novel "Everything Is Illuminated" by Jonathan Safran Foer. This journey and self-discovery story is highlighted by powerful ensemble performances and a sharp alignment with an action that enriches and enlightens the soul. Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather. Saffron, die. Jonathan has a special habit of taking small items and small memorabilia of life and zipping them in plastic bags to show them on the wall. Saffron gives Jonathan an old picture of a young saffron standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago. So Jonathan sets out to find this mysterious Ukrainian woman without knowing if she's still alive. He asks a brazen, young tour guide named Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin), to bring him to his destination. First, the journey hits dead ends and false leads, but as the group nears their destination, the men are in the midst of the ruins of a dark chapter of history, with memories of the war and past ghosts of a nonexistent city. There they find their own destiny and are forever changed by what they learn. <br /> <br /> This film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to best use their actors. Sometimes the film is spoken in Russian and looks like a foreign movie. The title itself is a game of self-discovery. This is a thoughtful hike of a man into his past, and his past involves his companions ironically; Jonathan's obsessive journey also becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather. It's a story about the long haul and the guilt that you have to bear for a lifetime. By the end of the film, all these characters have experienced life-changing events that permanently intertwine their lives. It proves that memories of traumatizing and purifying the soul can be strong. It's also about another's inheritance and how others see an event or person in the past. Alex finally sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these individuals will have changed at the end of the movie, which is a tribute to a well-told story. The story is deceptively simple. It works as a road trip movie (like The Straight Story), combined with an interesting mystery story. It really contains many layers of emotions and subplots that go from the past to the present. The end is a bit surreal with his déjà vu feeling. Elijah Wood (Sin City, The Immortal Sunshine of the Spotless Ghost) has chosen a wide range of roles from the Ring Trilogy since splashing into The Lord of Waters. Here he does a good job with a substantially minimalist role that is not much to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin are better than Alex and his grandfather. Even the grandfather's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. (that's right) is funny as a faithful companion. <br /> <br /> The replacement music score by Paul Cantelon is an atmospheric compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film. Editing is effective as past and present images are effortlessly interlinked and transferred. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is correspondingly keen and lifeless with some impressive images of the war and its aftermath. <br /> <br /> The coincidences that occur during the last half of the movie are good drama but are a bit too random. We never understand the entire backstory of Alex's grandfather and his motivations. Even Jonathan's blank looks and the lack of apparent substance and depth give us little more than the sketch of a bizarre man. Sometimes the movie feels a bit depressed and depressing as more terrible revelations are revealed. However, these are minor criticisms of a good, thoughtful story with good performances and interesting topics like remembrance and closure. The fact that Schreiber not only staged the script, but adapted it to this worthwhile piece of history is a tribute to his talents and a promising future potential.
