This film just won the Best Film Award at the Cleveland International Film Festival. The American title is apparently Autumn Spring. The spectacle is great. The story introduces you to the life of an older man who takes what life brings and peps it up a bit. He is thrilled by his best friend (and partner in not so serious crimes), he brings people at every opportunity, but often reveals his heart of gold. His boring wife is over and makes a decision that changes his life, and it's heartbreaking to watch her. The dissolution of the story is beautiful.
