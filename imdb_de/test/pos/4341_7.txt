LOL. <br /> <br /> The mere fact that I start my review with 'lol' says it all. I saw this movie as a kid all the time; and even then I felt the stupidity of everything. The low budget, the horrible drama and the lame script were always obvious. I looked at it again yesterday and just could not stop laughing. It is so bad that it is really good. As another reviewer said, he does not take himself seriously. There is no way to watch this movie and to say that the creators have done it. The soundtrack is so funny, I laugh every time I hear it. The "climax" is just a laugh uprising. It's an outspoken war zone in New York, full of explosions and total chaos ... so ridiculous that you can not help but giggle at the sight. <br /> <br /> Other funny moments: <br /> <br /> - The scene with Kersey and the policeman running side by side like two cowboys against the entire Wild West was so cheesy that it was funny. <br /> <br /> -It killed me how the bad guys could shoot at Kersey, and he even dropped to one knee, aiming for such a cautious (and slow) goal and not hitting LMAO. Of course it was a single shot with his elephant handgun LOL. <br /> <br /> - Another funny scene was the end, when he finally killed the leader of the gang with a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol ... destroying the whole side of the apartment building with it. <br /> <br /> - It's obvious that Kersey is used to losing family members ... when his new girlfriend gets dumped after just a few moments some appointments Acting is so bad you can not blame anyone who could only think that Kersey is mad at the destruction of the autolock ... he runs down, looks at the carnage and just walks away. <br /> <br /> Again, that bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> *** of **** stars.
