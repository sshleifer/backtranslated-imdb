This movie is full of sexy situations and healthy young people who do not see their eyes, whether they wear clothes or not. The strong superstructure of his action is confirmed by the art of Shakespeare. As Joseph Papp discovered in Central Park in the 1950s, Shakespeare's conspiracies can be adapted to the customs and customs of the present. And so the classic tales of cross-dressing and other nonsense in such lighthearted comedies as Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night's Eve and As You Like It are well used in this film. All young actors and actresses do a good job of promoting the conspiracy with their blockades, dialogues and costumes. And the idea of ​​a football game to bring things to a peak reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another charming comic-of-age movie.
