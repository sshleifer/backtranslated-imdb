Fun movie! The script is awful, but the quality of the actors saves the day. John Hurt is perfect, as is Jane Alexander. Beau Bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. The story is the true star. Based on a true story, the tempo moves well and the whole concept of escaping from East Germany attracts and holds you. The happy ending offers enough enthusiasm to compensate for the script. Do not expect Oscar quality, but it's a great trip for the whole family.
