When I saw Greek commercials for the first time, I had some questions about how they would approach Greek life, whether they would betray sacred allies and sisterhood secrets if they were concentrating on fraternity, or bringing fraternity, or what most Keep college kids from Greek life as a huge party. Luckily, it covered everything. The plot was great, it gave you a character you love, hate, someone you would like to be, someone you do not want to like, and of course a crazy roommate! <br /> <br /> It was one of my first insights into what the writers in Greek life suspected, and I can honestly say that they hit the nail pretty dead. <br /> <br /> I love it, as one of the biggest things they treated throughout the season was the relationship between Rusty and his crazy roommate. It's hard enough to move away from home and be forced to live in a small room with someone you do not even know and then find out you have nothing in common. Probably every college was the worst nightmare. <br/> <br/> Rusty's sister Casey was pretty much the typical girl on campus that everyone is jealous of. What did not she have? Oh, that's right. Evan for himself. Rebecca and Evan had an "affair" at the beginning of the season, which made them pretty likable to Casey. Her character continued to develop and her relationship with Rusty became more and more loving and open-minded. <br /> <br /> Cappie is one of the funniest characters and absolutely crazy. One of my favorite episodes was that he was completely garbed up in a strip club and had to call Rusty Casey to rescue her. I like how they dealt with the issue of gay people in Greek homes. Calvin was a very impressive character, and I really respected him for keeping to his standards. Jen K was pretty crazy, but actually she liked Rusty. It was surprising and I kept asking her from the beginning, but of course I wanted it to work between her and Rusty. I'm definitely looking forward to the return of Greek. It leads you to the truth of Greek life, something that many people overlook. One of the greatest things known to the grotesque and sorority is parties and drinking. Greek is a great show and the characters are easy to understand.
