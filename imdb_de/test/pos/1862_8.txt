Paul Bettany played a big role as the tortured father, whose dearest little girl tragically dies of illness. For this he deserves all recognition. The main purpose of the film, however, was to maintain Darwin's adventures as he gathered data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children, and completely overrun the quarrels about his ideas. Two things bothered me terribly: the soundtrack with its whiny sound that practically pushes the sadness in the neck of the viewer, and the movie trailer shows some beautiful landscapes, the theological dreams of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends on prepare a battle against blind beliefs, rendering the film completely misrepresented. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly: removing the film trailer's scenes from the film would result in an unsung family drama about a little child mortality and their parents' needs. Of course not what I expected from a movie about Darwin, although the movie was beautifully interpreted.
