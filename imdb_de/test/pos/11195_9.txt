Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant (Uzak) - his third feature film (his first was the black and white The Small Town Kasaba in 1997) - is a major step forward from his good but flawed 1999 film Clouds Of May (Mayis Sikintisi ). The earlier film had potential, but smelled on a small budget and improvised quality in the worst possible way - plotting holes and woodwork from amateurs. That Clouds Of May was successful at every level was evidence of Ceylan's talent as a budding filmmaker. Distant, however, is the appearance of Ceylan as a great artist on the international stage. He has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (though his screenplay is not so dialogue-heavy, it's just as scary and lacks Bergman's penchant for close-ups - his shots are usually long shots for outdoors and medium shots for Interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose vivid scenes of contemplation reconfigure Ceylan). The main part of the film plays in the snow-covered, wintering Istanbul (the fact that it is snowing in Turkey will probably surprise some), giving the film a definite Bergman feel and reminiscent of one of Krzysztof Kieslowski's gritty, snow-covered cityscapes The Decalogue , The natural images rely on the best of Werner Herzog, as they tend to take one or two bars longer than standard film theory would dictate. This makes them even more memorable as the cityscapes depend on the almost precisionist compositions of Michelangelo Antonioni. To the cultural hagiography of Woody Allen - a photograph of a bench overlooking the water is a Manhattan direct reading (read steal), apart from the missing Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene Ceylan quotes a famous photograph of a ship in the harbor of Ozu's Tokyo Story. Like all great artists, Ceylan makes his appropriations into his own art by slightly changing them and adapting them to the needs of his own film. Distant is a film whose title pervades the characterization in the film and the feeling that some viewers will have, but does not describe the film itself, because scenes are preserved long after the movie ends. Perhaps the most memorable scene and the most beautiful image of the film arises when Mahmut pursues his ex-wife at Istanbul airport and watches her with her new husband as they board the plane that will forever take her out of his life. When he watches her from afar, we see that she only gets a glimpse of how he watches her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this movie. He retreats behind a column and Nazan turns her head back to her future. Mahmut is her past and she knows how best to move on. Mahmut will never get it. Such moments rarely get insight into themselves. The fact that some viewers get the movie and that Ceylan has his own creative powers shows that ignorance can teach as long as you move about it. Remote makes it, although it has just the right length.
