I was very excited to see a documentary about one of my favorite Italian directors. D'Amato has tried everything from horror to post-apocalyptic to hardcore porn. With films like Buio Omega and Emmanuelle & The Last Cannibals he has touched the genius a few times. This documentary is a long and informative guide to D'Amato's films. He is interviewed throughout with English subtitles across the bottom of the screen. The excerpts from his films are told by a narrator (with English subtitles). The documentary proved particularly interesting as she analyzed the often censored "Emmanuelle In America." Here D'amato explains the fake "snuff" scenes in detail and reminds of some funny stories. In fact, good old Joe is very warm and funny, always wears a smile and smokes a cigarette. The one disappointing aspect of this documentary is that she spends little time on D'amato horror films like Anthropophagus and the brilliant Buio Omega. She spends too much time in the erotic cinema and hardly touches the post-apocapical movies. But I can not complain. It's wonderful to see D'amato get the respect he deserves. Highly recommended for fans of D'amato. Rest in peace.
