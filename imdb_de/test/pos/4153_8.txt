"Nuovomondo" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories largely in dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually. For everything he wants to say, he finds powerful images that can stand on their own. Therefore, he understands film as a medium that tells his stories mainly about the pictures on the canvas. In particular, European cinema is often very conversational (and many of the young American directors are strongly influenced by it). Criales's opposite attitude was really the point that made this movie special for me. It also has a very interesting theme that is summed up in a rather unusual story and told with humor. Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as family leader Salvatore and as the fantastic Charlotte Gainsbourg that I watch in each of her films. There are many great sequences in this movie. Just to pick one: If the ship leaves Italy and people just stare. This scene is great, especially considering the related pop cultural references (Titanic!).
