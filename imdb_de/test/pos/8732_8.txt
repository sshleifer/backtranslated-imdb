CACTUS FLOWER was a delightful 1969 comedy based on a Neil Simon drama about a dentist (Walter Matthau) having an affair with a young, free-spirited woman (Goldie Hawn) who does not know that his devoted nurse / assistant (Ingrid Bergman) is in love with him. Matthau can play this role in his sleep, and he does not disappoint as the beautifying dentist. Julian Winston, who is with a woman but really has no idea that he loves another. Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for her glittering performance as Toni Simmons, the aging flower child, slowly realizes that she is trapped in a dead end and is not as bleak as she appears on the surface. But the real pleasure for me in this movie was the performance of the legendary Ingrid Bergman as Stephanie Dickinson, dr. Winston's totally devoted assistant, ready to bury and sacrifice her own happiness as long as Dr. Winston is happy with Tony. Bergman is bright in this movie, looks absolutely gorgeous (although the camera has always loved her) and shows an unforeseen talent for light comedy. Yes, the dialogue and the attitudes are a bit dated, but the story is timeless and the appearances of the stars make them immediately visible.
