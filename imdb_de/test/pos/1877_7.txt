Or, if you've seen the "Evil Dead" trilogy and / or "Bubba Ho-Tep," you should know that his films are total farces. With "Man with the Screaming Brain" he goes out again. In this case, he plays the smooth American businessman William Cole, who visits Bulgaria - when can we ever see this country? - If a woman kills him. Well, weird scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent, making him act like "All of Me" like Steve Martin. Yes, the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for the sheer nonsense. Much of the real humor comes from "Evil Dead" director Sam Raimi as Ivanov's almost insane assistant Pavel. The two men have a relationship like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and the skipper. <br /> <br /> Just understand that this is a total stupid movie and you will not be a little disappointed. I liked it anyway.
