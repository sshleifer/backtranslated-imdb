Planktonrules comments must have been written on Topsy-Turvy-Day, since everything stated in this simple way of life is the opposite of true truth! - The chemistry between Colbert and Cooper could not have been finer ... To support the cast is excellent. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing are great !!! <br /> <br /> Like so many other comments I complain again on this board: "Why can not films be like this anymore?" <br /> <br /> This is the classic Paramount 1930s screwball comedy at its finest, folks!
