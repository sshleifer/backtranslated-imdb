What can I say about this movie, except that it is great fun! <br /> <br /> John Cusack plays Hoops McCann, a new high school graduate who has two options to take over the street sweeping family business or spend the summer in Nantucket with his buddy George Calamari (weirdly played by Joel Murray ) and his crazy friends. <br /> <br /> If I say crazy, believe me, it can not get much quieter than the Stork brothers Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Villard) and Ack Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Throw in a little girl named Squid and her crazy mutt and a great performance by Demi Moore, and you have what it takes to make your sides laugh, laugh, movie. <br /> <br /> In this movie and in the story, the Laugh Free Flow line, although the typical good versus bad and good conqueror, is great with the turn of a regatta as a showdown. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a lot of laughs and a good time. If you want to enjoy and enjoy your movies extensively, you can not miss One Crazy Summer!
