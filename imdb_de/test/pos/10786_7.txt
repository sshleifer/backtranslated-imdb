Barry Champlain is a radio talk show host in Dallas whose unbridled ideas on a plethora of social issues disturb and offend many of his callers and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah in search of the truth or a social loser attacking his audience? <br /> <br /> This is an intense, provocative character piece about a man who has almost no redemptive traits that at the same time appears to be a truly profound philosophy. Although co-written and staged by Stone, this is truly Bogosian's work, and he delivers an amazingly sharp-edged and pervasive performance of which there is no escape. Barry is sometimes one of the most disgusting characters you can imagine, spitting evil misanthropy on everyone around him, especially those who take care of him. At the same time he is also strangely sensitive, hypnotic, wise and even lovable. Bogosian's cruel features are burning into the frame, and his green eyes are constantly flitting around, as if they are constantly searching for an answer to a riddle. The film is essentially an angry, self-righteous slogan against all the bigotry, injustice and banality of the world ending in a three-and-a-half-minute three-hour single shot of Barry delivering the ultimate I-hate-all speech, but the boy has one hit , The supporters are great, especially Greene as ex-wife and Baldwin as boss. Robert Richardson's passionate photography manages to make the single radio studio set look interesting, and there's an intriguing score by Stewart Copeland, with a moving coda that includes The Penguin Cafe Orchestra's enchanting telephone song, Telephone and Rubber Band , If you are unfamiliar with Bogosian, check out his amazing talent in this movie - like his contemporaries Bill Hicks and Denis Leary. He is someone who seldom appears in the mainstream media just because he writes outside. I find Stones movies variable; His great achievements are not particularly close to my heart, but if he is more orderly and objective, as in this case (or Salvador and Nixon), he is much more conspicuous and arresting. A great primal scream of a picture based on a play by Bogosian, inspired by the true story of Alan Berg, a presenter of the radio program in Denver, who was murdered in 1984 by neo-Nazis.
