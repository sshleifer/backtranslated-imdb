The film is a starter for what really happened in Phenix City. I am a grandson of the people who really lived the story. The truth has never been known to me. I tried to figure out the whole story, but the people who lived it are still afraid to tell it. Phenix City is still run by sick people. Albert Patterson was not quite the saint, history wants you to believe. The story was filmed in Phenix City. It still contains some of the famous sights that you see in the movie. The Colonal Funeral Home still looks the same. But if you want the true story of Sin City, you must visit us and find people who will inform you about Ma beachies and their kindness. She got the name ma not in vain.
