This was the best movie I saw in 2000. The Cohen brothers have never let me down, and this time they have not. <br /> <br /> It's one of those rare movies these days - it's funny, intelligent and extremely entertaining. I left the cinema with a warm heart. Of course there's a lot of Cohen stuff in there - weird characters and special gadgets, well-developed storyline and magical camera works. But no Cohen movie is like another Cohen movie, of course, overlooking the overall quality. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. The true masterpiece in this film, however, comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But also the rest of the cast is outstanding. <br /> <br /> A film that is a light comedy with a musical touch that evolves the story of rednecks and country music of the old days - dripping wet and intelligent. That's a very unlikely combination. But that's exactly what this picture is.
