This Fox spectacle was a great success when it was released in 1954. It was elaborately produced, with great music and sets and fascinating cast. It moves slowly, but interestingly. Edmund Purdom is strikingly handsome, like an Egyptian who becomes a renowned doctor and juggles three gorgeous women: a man Jean Simmons who passively reveres him, the seducer Bella Darvi who eludes him, and a sister of Pharoah Gene Tieney who him as your pharaoh wants. The popularity of the film has not diminished since it was shown on AMC (preferably in widescreen format). Purdom is especially great, his character seems to be crazy with the women and never ended up married and a "thinker". Darvi is amazing and enticing in her role as Femme Fatale. Victor Mature, Michael Wilding, co-star of Peter Ustinov. Listen.
