This film gives the golf a high grade, it was played well and judged. Giving you a glimpse into the story that some non-sports fans will enjoy. Just the historical factor gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really well done. I'm in the northeast and saw Brookline as a fan and as someone who loves the game. The film was well done on all levels. A MUST see 5 stars. The acting was great, Disney has another winner in his pocket with great movies. For no other reason, watch the movie to give hope and encouragement to young people who may not see the hope in their lives. I would tell you that the attitude in the late 1800s and early 1900s is very realistic. The costumes and the dialect were just right. Beyond the call of duty for a golf movie. A must for fans and non-fans.
