I own this movie. I'm actually from the same city as the brother directors. But that does not make the movie any better. But if you do not want to see something serious one night and do not have high expectations, I strongly recommend Demon Summer. Yes, the lines are cheesy and the plot is corny. However, it contains key elements of a horror / comedy. I just want to see a few little kids making a movie full of effects. And I tell the brothers Campell "Bravo". They are now making more movies and continuing a long dream. Demon Summer was one of the films that will help them to start a great career with a great future. Speed ​​freak productions and composite images in one word: POTENTIAL
