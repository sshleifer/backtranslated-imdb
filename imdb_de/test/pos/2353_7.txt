What makes this better than most "movie films" is that it does not feel wrong. The film tells the story of the hot-headed director and his rise and fall and rise, using real recognizable names and events during the silence and early sound era. Instead of the generic "sounds we are out of business" business, they actually show JOLSON and "The Jazz Singer". The acting is really good, especially with credible performances by Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg.
