* Minor spoiler * I just wanted to say that anyone who wants to entertain baseball movies is definitely one of my top three. Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this in my eyes. I would also like to thank the authors of this film for creating such entertaining dialogues !! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very appropriate for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. His animosity towards the overseas game in Japan sets the tone for strange but meaningful interactions with his new team, the Dragon. He has to adapt to life in Japan ("First wash, THEN bathe!"). He finally sees eye-to-eye with his trainer and sets his goal to reach this one last season of size, though presented in a different environment than ever before ! For any baseball fan or anyone who wants to watch a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball will not let you down!
