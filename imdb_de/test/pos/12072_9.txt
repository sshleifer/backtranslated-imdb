At the end of this movie I dubbed like a little girl and I would dare everyone else to hold it together without a sob. Absolutely heartbreaking stuff, but uplifting in the core. <br /> <br /> A big effort by Ann Margaret, who plays a terminally ill mother of ten children who does not know her arthritic steel-working husband. Able to support the family when she's gone, she arranges the adoptions of her children, before she mixes. The role really deserves an Oscar. <br /> <br /> You really feel this poor family because the dying mother gives her everything to make sure her children do not end up in a poorly managed state orphanage. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, get it if you can.
