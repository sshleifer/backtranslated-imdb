Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is jailed for murdering an autistic child. If with the question "Why?" He has no answer. In prison, he meets Pearl (Don Cheadle), his teacher, who takes matters into his own hands and helps Leland find out why he did it. In this film we learn all about Leland's troubled life, including his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), his famous father Albert (Kevin Spacey), and all his sad life. <br /> <br /> This is Matthew Ryan Hoges second film, which is spectacular in almost every way. This is a movie where you end up thinking and wondering how it all works. The movie is pretty dark, but if you can handle it, you'll see how good a movie is. <br /> <br /> There is no evil in this movie. There is nobody to whom you can blame. There are no stereotypes, and the audience does not try to prove Leland guilty. Instead, we sit back, relax and watch the boy's life spread throughout the movie. All the problems depicted in the story are very real. Drug addiction, parental expectations, overwhelming sadness; They all exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling gives one of the biggest accomplishments of his career in this movie as a depressed teen Leland. His father lives in Europe and does not really care about his son. The only person he loves is Becky, but she has her own problems. He knows exactly what he did, but as he says in the film, "They want a why, but maybe there is not. Maybe that's something that just happened. 'There is a reason, but we will not know it until the end. As you watch the movie, the audience is surprised that such a young person knows so much about the world. Leland notices things that people ignore. <br /> <br /> A special scene that made me think and really touched me was during Leland talking to Pearl. Pearl has just cheated on his wife and when Leland asks why, Pearl answers that he is just human. Then Leland says something that really does not come to anyone's mind: "Why do people only say that if they did something wrong?" In the film he plays Allen Harris, the friend of Becky's sister Julie (Michelle Williams). Although he is not one of the main characters, I was amazed how deep his character was. You can identify very well with everyone. You know how interested he is in the Pollard family. It is as if they were his own flesh and blood. At the end of the movie you realize how far he would go to help them. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a masterpiece that has been overlooked by many people. However, if you take the time to look at it, you will most likely find that everything I mentioned above is true. And when you're done watching, you'll never see the world like this again. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
