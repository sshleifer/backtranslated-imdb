At first, I did not like the director constantly switching from the past (Gulliver's Travels) to the present day (Gulliver in the lunatic asylum). But it's really the best way to film the story, even if it takes some getting used to. Danson is outstanding as a title character and Edward Fuchs makes a wonderful villain. The worst thing is Mary Steenburgen as Gulliver's wife. She has never been so beautiful in Hollywood, and for some reason, they are downright stupid in this movie. I'll never understand why directors make a woman ugly if she does not add anything to the story! Besides, you want to strangle her because you're so stupid as to believe in the lies that the Bates of Bates keeps telling. Even her son can see through the bastard. Still a good show and I rate it B +.
