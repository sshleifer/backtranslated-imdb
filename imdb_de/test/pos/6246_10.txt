"Tourist Trap" is a really scary low budget horror movie that will surely satisfy horror fans. It contains an extremely strange atmosphere and there are some rather disturbing moments of total fear and fear. Some scenes are downright bizarre, for example, there is a scene Chuck Connors sits down to dinner with a mannequin, which comes to life and talks to him before the head drops. There is very little thrill, but the violence is pretty strong for horror films with PG rating. The mannequins look very scary The highlight is scary. David Schmoeller returned to film several other genre films, including Crawlspace, Puppet Master, and Netherworld. Still "Tourist Trap" is definitely his best horror movie. So if you want to be scared, give this little bit of gem a look. <br /> <br /> Rated PG for short nudity, violence and obscenity.
