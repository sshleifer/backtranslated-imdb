I really enjoyed this movie and I do not like animated pictures. But I found the cats appealing and the story was charming. There's a good song called "Everyone wants to be a cat," which is great fun. It has some funny moments and is an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this movie.
