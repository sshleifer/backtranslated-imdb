I like this film because it has good access to Buddhism, for example the way Buddhists cultivate all kinds of beings and combine some unusual and real situations; In some areas photography is very good and there is much news about freedom, as the Hawk episode always remains focused in difficult situations. She also has funny situations as Swank's birthday and talks about these two-time Academy Awards. Her play shows us how the people who have lived in this kind of culture show resistance behavior when Miyagi takes them to a Buddhist temple and how they slowly changes her mind. And of course Pat Morita was always great
