What often turns into a sloppy and silent drama about misunderstood middle-class youth ends with a surprisingly shady and subdued film by John Frankenheimer script). <br /> <br /> We're still in those semi-mythical 50's when teens were jalopies and jeans were still wearing dungarees. James MacArthur (adoptive son of playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, who later enters Hawaii's popular culture as Hawaii 5: 0 Danno) is implicated in a minor incident in a movie theater that leads to a hit on the manager (Whit Bissell) and in be booked out of the police station. His father (James Daly), a large-format film producer, gets the call, does not listen to his son's version and pulls the strings to fend him off. <br /> <br /> But MacArthur always carries a chip on his shoulder that even his likeable mother (Kim Hunter) can not refuse. Things are getting worse in the Coldwater Canyon homestead, until MacArthur, who tries to defend himself, stages a repeat of the original incident .... <br /> <br /> The film does not quite avoid the settings ?? and clich√©s? of their time, but presents them with considerable nuance: each character receives an honorable ear; Each viewpoint has its merits (and the reactions to the movie depend on what the viewers bring to it). There are mistakes (the word "crummy," a common rebellious euphemism of the era, is used about 30 times too often), but they outweigh the strengths. The film benefits from a strong cast (most notable among them being the outstanding character actor James Gregory as a police officer) and a determined, non-exploitative way of telling its story. From a favorable point in the new millennium, the hot water that MacArthur is in seems to be a bit lukewarm, but The Young Stranger remains honest and honorable. <br /> <br />
