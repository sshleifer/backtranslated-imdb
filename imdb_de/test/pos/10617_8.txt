"The Piano Teacher" is all about Huppert's character; a classical middle-aged piano teacher with a stoic fa√ßade behind which hides a powerfully captivating, aberrant personality. As a story unsatisfactory, but fascinating as a character study, the film follows the Huppert figure by the notion of their embarrassing relationship with a student who performs excellence in doing so. Not for everyone, "The Piano Teacher" can best deal with those in foreign films and dramas with characters and dark topics. (ON-)
