I have only seen this movie once several years ago. But I remember that I like it a lot. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler Ahead ** An old well-known opera singer is retired and she decides to give her cats all the money she has. Her butler hears that and plans to get rid of the cats so he can be lucky. He puts knockout drops in her milk. When they wake up, they find themselves miles away. You have to return to your house before it's too late. With the help of an independent kitten and other animal accomplices as he dodges the butler and defeats his plan. <br /> <br /> Could have been better, but it could have been a lot worse. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10.
