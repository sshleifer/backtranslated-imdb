I have to say, it was a flop. All in all, it is great to see how Aparna Sen dealt with schizophrenia. I'm not very well informed about this and got everything that was presented in A Beautiful Mind, and here's its interesting depiction. <br /> <br /> But what disappointed me was the artificial dialogues and overuse of English. It's true that a new class is being formed in India that also speaks English at home, but I'm sure it's not as formal as in the movie. In addition, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable speaking everything in English. Charus dialogues in Bihari sound seemed to be much more realistic and wholesome. <br /> <br /> The second thing is the abstraction she tries to give to the movie. I generally like open-ended movies, but there were a lot of loose ends here. It's like cut pieces that are put together to make the movie. Also, the film did not seem to have a central theme. Schizophernia was certainly the main line, but mixed sister-sister, mother-daughter, added a relationship between doctor and Azmi, no real use of the brother, Bose-Bose's wife ... all were not needed and made the audience unclear What did she do actually trying to show. <br /> <br /> By and large, a watch for people who like off-beat movies, a must for those who only watch movies as an entertainment tool.
