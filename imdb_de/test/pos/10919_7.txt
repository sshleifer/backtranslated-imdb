In & Out was a funny comedy with good performances by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Kline. The thought that Kevin Kline was gay was very funny. If I were him, I would not like to say that I'm gay at his own wedding with his family, his friends and his wife, who will be there. Very rarely would that ever happen. I also loved it when he was dancing around when the voice on the radio spoke to him. I would say that In & Out was a stupid comedy with a lot of laughter and giggles. This is a commendable comedy and Kevin Kline did a great job as a gay man. Trust me that you like this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
