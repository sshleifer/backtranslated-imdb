I hope the author, the director, the editor and the composer (and let's not forget the producer) read this ... because their work in this film was really incredible. Let me first say that I am in no way associated with this film. I'm just a normal guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and has seen about 8 times. <br /> <br /> Every second of this movie is touching. Every scene is classic. The spectacle is real. The movie is honest. You can refer to these characters as human beings, not actors. <br /> <br /> This story follows three different killers at different stages of their lives. The story is carefully thought out and every negotiation is interwoven and interwoven, resulting in a message that brings us to reflect on the values ​​of right and wrong that each of us carries within us. Roebuck, Dennis Hopper and Joshua John Miller ( as a 12-year-old boy) give absolutely amazing, real performances. I've seen this movie about eight or more times and I'm still so entangled in their performances that I forgot that I saw a movie. It is so good. Great work, all who worked on it. Good work. <br /> <br /> The music is also wonderfully coordinated and insistent. With the cast selected, the meticulous cut and pace, the mood and the tone and even the theme, the director made some of the best choices for a movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is real. It's honest It's a real movie experience that I'll never forget. You may not be in the topic, but it's something you can not ignore. Ultimately, it's about people being human ... and anyone can relate to that. I recommend this movie to fans of drama, suspense and horror about almost every other movie.
