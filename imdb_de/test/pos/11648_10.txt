After reading most of the comments, I feel like I have a word to say. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that most people here think that this movie is prone to either death or dizziness and whether it worked with them. I remember reading an article in 1995 when the movie was released (yes, it has interested me so much since I heard it would come out that I did not forget the articles I read back then ), in which Tim Robbins said that he did not want to make a film to convince the audience neither one nor the other. <br /> <br /> And I think that's completely true. I have to admit that I think he has a bit of an anti-death penalty side in the way he made this film, but people can still make their own choices. And that's a very rare thing in American movies. <br /> <br /> I have been showing this movie to many people since it came out, and I have seen all sorts of reactions. Supporters of the death penalty became even stronger opponents or in their beliefs. And many opponents of the death penalty (including me) were stronger in their belief that the death penalty should be abolished all over the world. But I have even seen that opponents become followers. That, and the fact that people seem to argue here, shows me that there are really many points of view. Regardless of what effect it has on you, the most important thing is to make you THINK. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that really gives you the choice of not going through a simple path that either makes the convicts bad or innocent. This can be a difficult task for people who prefer to be entertained or learn a lesson. There is no lesson you need to find one yourself. <br /> <br /> Everybody praises acting, directing and music, but as it has been said so many times, I will not repeat it again. <Br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do it - if you dare to be challenged!
