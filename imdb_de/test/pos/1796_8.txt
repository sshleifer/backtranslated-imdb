The Merchant of Four Seasons is a film about lack of love. The movie starts with the main character; Hans Epp returning from a spell in the Foreign Legion. He returns to his mother not to say how much she loves him or how much she misses him. But to be told that he is worthless, and worse, that she would have preferred it if the man with whom he had gone had returned instead. It is the character's relationship with women that makes this movie so hateful; the fact that his wife is taller than he is a symbol of his relationship to the opposite sex; he is constantly humbled by them, and by his relations with them his life is not as great as it could have been. This is also evident in the way he treats his wife for a drink. He lost his job as a police officer by the desire for a wife and even his wife; A woman who should love him never really shows affection for him. Even in the end, his wife cares more about what she and her daughter will do than her husband's condition. The dealer of Four Seasons is a thoroughly unpleasant movie. There is no scene in the movie where someone is happy, not just that; but the movie seems incredibly happy to wallow in the misery of its central characters. The film is certainly not recommended for anyone who is currently struggling, that's for sure. Despite all the misery, the film never goes beyond the limits of reality; Any event in this film can - and most likely - has happened, and this is just to make the movie more shocking. Director is the film of course by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; the cult German director who committed suicide in 1982. This is just my second taste of the man's work, but with just two films, it's easy to get an idea of ​​the kind of art he creates. Both films are run-down and bleak - yet realistic works of art. His characterization in this film is subtle; We only ever get to know the characters through their distress and not through their character. This is a very clever way to show the audience that it's the environment that sets the people in the film, not the people themselves - and because almost everyone who sees the movie knows what it's like in one To live urban society, it is difficult the majority of people to whom you can refer. <br /> <br /> The dealer of Four Seasons is not a movie that's easy to forget; The film has a high substance and little style, and that makes a very memorable image that anyone who considers himself a cinema fan should experience. In this sense, I give this film my highest recommendations. It's not sweet and it's not pleasant, but you will not see a more realistic depiction of depression, and this is certainly a movie that will stay with you.
