This is just my favorite movie. Nothing special. It's so incredibly detailed. Make me cry, just thinking about it. Geronimo Bill is the nicest guy I can imagine. Money is not important. Bamboo spears are important. You do not need money to get what you need. If you need something, it will just come to you. If people realized that the world was a much better place. Whatever you do, do not do it for the money.
