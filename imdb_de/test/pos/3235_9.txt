Do not look at this movie and expect the joke of Jane Austen, a sharp dialogue or a clever social commentary. This time, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! <br /> <br /> In this version, Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just stupid fantasies, but a connection to the adult sexual world she looks into in her daytime adventures. By day she is very primitive and reserved, and her gay Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams change from mild to steamy to lurid! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, Catherine's sex visions are based entirely on the gothic novels she devours in bed. It is heartwarming, sexy and provocative to watch her dreamy image of handsome Henry dissolve into a grim dream, swept away by rogue villains and devastated! At the same time, it's tired and touching to go back to bed in the morning - Catherine, who looks peacefully asleep, so innocent that you would never suspect what's really going on in that pretty little head! <br /> <br /> Later, when Catherine was invited to Henry, Catherine stops a family quarrel and completely misunderstands the meaning. She jumps into bed, covers herself with the sheets and lies awake and listens anxiously. Her striking blue eyes are the only visible sign that she is attentive. Gradually these pretty blue eyes drop and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire. This time Catherine dreams that she is in Elizabethan times and anxiously waited in front of the castle for the rapprochement of "Banditi!". It's pretty clear she's more excited than scared of the idea of ​​being carried away by bandits. She shudders with excitement and anticipation! But then, after desperately running for refuge, we're back in the daylight world, where the maid cursed her for causing a mess in her room before falling into a sound sleep. It's worth noting that Catherine's strong-eyed yawning in the morning light itself is a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams were! <br /> <br /> Finally, Catherine's stern and uninspired lover gives Henry the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture. It is interesting that Katharina's immediate collapse in tears does not symbolize a withdrawal, but the progress in relationships between adults. In the next scene, she burns her gothic romance with tears and shamelessly throws herself on the bed. Significantly, this turning point is also marked by Catherine falling asleep - unless there are no dreams of passion this time around. Presumably, Catherine is mature enough to be ready for the real thing. <br /> <br /> Although Katherine Schlesinger has beautiful blue eyes and a lively expression and all her services are charming, one has to say that they are outside the heating. Dream sequences This film is painfully boring. I give it only 9 stars, because the really romantic can only enjoy it on a daydream level. <br /> <br /> If you want to read a book about a really strong, strong-willed young heroine, the real darkness overcomes danger in a real gothic environment, I recommend THE PERILOUS GARD by Elizabeth Marie Pope.
