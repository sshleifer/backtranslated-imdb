Insanely well-crafted miniseries. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing most of it twice when it was shown on PBS in American Playhouse. Was then heavily promoted. I believe it could have been one of the early mini-series shown outside of the Masterpiece Theater series on PBS. Was a total of 6-8 hours. This length has been reduced to 6 hours. Cut some interesting but slow scenes. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that people holding their current rights will recover a complete, unedited version on DVD. The creation of a VHS version is not worthwhile at this point. <br /> <br /> Fits very well in the mini-series or the dramatic history genre.
