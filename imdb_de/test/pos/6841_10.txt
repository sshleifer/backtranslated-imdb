Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Carla Gugino and Gil Bellows are a delight in this sexy capsule. This movie is intelligent, edge entertainment for adults, and what a relief these days is with great conceptual cartoons. Great music and camerawork add to the fun of this New Orleans puzzle. Highly recommended. Ten stars!
