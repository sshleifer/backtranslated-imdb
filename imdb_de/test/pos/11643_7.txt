This movie has two new features related to the message conveyed by other equally good films about the death penalty and executions. This is the burden that even the drama of the parents of the victims must endure - without, for that reason, obscuring the hatred and craving for revenge that they feel or the horror that constitutes the execution and the Christian vision of all the implied questions reduce. We must also point out that the convicted man in this film is not the usual nice innocent person we see in other films dealing with executions, which does not cause us to give up on the idea that a sentence would only go one way anyway legal murder is. Finally, it should be noted that the last moments of the execution class, with all the catharsis that show the last words of the condemned, have an extraordinary emotional weight and the detail depicting the act of execution in a parallel cut with pictures of The murder scenes in the forest emphasize that we are confronted with another homicide that is as ruthless as this one, but carried out in a cold and supposedly "legal" manner.
