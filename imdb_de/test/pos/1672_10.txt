If the hawkish genius Walter Huston owes much, it also owes Jules Dassin, a man ahead of his time, who had suffered greatly because of his blacklist when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a Communist. The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr Dassin, but the move to Europe has shown that he was bigger than the people who contributed to his downfall in Hollywood. <br/> <br/> "Rififi" is an elegant man movie in which the right elements come together thanks to Dassin's vision. He decided to adapt Auguste Le Breton's novel because he saw the possibilities of turning it into a capricious film that became an instant classic. Jules Dassin was destitute in Paris when he discovered the city that would serve as background for his film. The bad weather has paid off for Dassin because the roads were always wet and not much had to be done to show them that way. <br /> <br /> When we meet Tony for the first time, he plays cards. Tony seems to be feeling bad. he coughs all the time and sweats violently. After he has lost all his money, he goes to Jo, the Swede, who tells him about a possible robbery at Maupin & Webb, the chic jewelry store in a Tony Paris area. They pass on the idea through Mario, who proposes Cesar, the Milanese, an experienced safe cracker. Tony, who has recently come out of jail, learns that Mado, his former lover, is now crawling with Grutter, who owns a nightclub. In the confrontation with Mado, everything he feels is just contempt, and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his place. Grutter has no love for Tony, who is his natural enemy because of his connection to Mado. <br /> <br /> When the day comes, the gang can get to the apartment house, which is on the second floor, directly above it. The owner lives in the jewelry store, but he is gone. Everything is going well and the gang is getting away with the jewels. Cesar, the typical lady of Milan, takes a ring as a souvenir, which he gives to the chanteuse in Grutter's nightclub. This tactical mistake is the spark that uncovers the thoughtful plan. Jean Servais made an excellent Tony. He showed a tired man who was possibly making his last robbery. Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel and the director Jules Dassin can be seen as Jo, Mario and Cesar, the quartet jewelry thieves. Marie Sabouret plays Mado. Marcel Lupovici plays grutter with subdued intensity. Robert Hussein, who would later go to the movies, leaves an impression with his Remi, a man of Grutter. <br /> <br /> The best film is Philippe Agostini's great cinematography, the atmosphere of Paris and the places where all these criminals operate. Georges Auric's music plays well with the action in the film. Jules Dassin was peculiar in his selection of films he shot, and that's our loss, because this man was a genius, as evidenced by The Naked City, Night and the City, and Rififi ,
