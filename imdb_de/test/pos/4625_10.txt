I had the pleasure of seeing this brilliant movie in a preview in Sydney. Although it was a pleasure to see it. The pleasure is not the feeling with which you stay with the credits. 2:37 is a film that addresses not only a stigma that young people feel, but all. Boss of his isolation. Not only is it to put the final galvanizing scene of the films on a pedestal, it's important to see it as a highlight. And from this it is important to recognize what it represents for you as a spectator as well as for those directly affected. 2:37 is not a soft image, but the way in which Mr. Thalluri handles his subject with a deep dignity, and it is not a contradiction that serves as a message for his message. <br /> <br /> I do not think movies like 2:37 should be scaled by favor. Rather, it should be recommended to those who seek purpose in their consideration. <br /> <br /> A brilliant portrait of innocence lost. And a Master Stroke for a not yet mature talent. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed.
