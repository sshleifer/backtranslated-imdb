Very nice love story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina. The whole story is very bizarre and funny. A mortician (A. Molina) loves a married woman (B. Blethyn). They try to fake their death to escape their husband and the village. A scenario of strange situations begins. As good as SAVE GRACE and LIVE LED NED DEVINE.
