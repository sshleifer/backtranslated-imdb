If they were awarded prizes for the world's most corrupted and dirty films, Japanese cinema would clean up: The exploitation cinema wipes the ground with most of its competitors. The most extreme examples are absolutely stunning exercises with bad taste and disgusting gore, crazy craziness and misogynistic sex. The guts of a beauty are a prime example of such a crappy filth that offers discerning audiences just over an hour of extravagant debauchery and violent violence surpassed with some very insane J-splatter goodness. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a young woman named Yoshimi, whose search for her missing sister has led her into the hands of some evil yakuza who rape and shoot her full of heavy goo called Angel Rain. After the gangsters have finished their fun with the poor woman, she manages to escape and flees to a nearby hospital where the sexy psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) tries to help. But the distraught and confused Yoshimi finally throws himself off the roof of the hospital and turns into a watermelon as she hits the ground (at least the way I look!). <br /> <br /> Revenge seeks Yoshimi's death, Hiromi lures Higashi, a member of the Yakuza, into her office, and as he throws him out he hypnotizes him and attacks his colleagues. After being satisfied with a knife at Yakuza headquarters, Higashi is severely beaten and stabbed, has to speak of Hiromi and is then chopped into tiny pieces. <br /> <br /> The psychologist is captured by the gang who was subjected to forced rape (while at the same time being forced to turn a yakuza bitch) and Angel Rain was sprayed, promptly speaking to her , The gangsters then plunge into the trunk of their car, along with the remains of Higashi, ready for disposal. Before they can dig up the bodies, the Super Dope has an unexpected effect on Hiromi: she comes back from the dead as a hermaphroditic monster with a toothed penis and a raging wound and prepares to kill the yakuza one at a time. This leads to a few memorable scenes of monstrous bloody spatters, including a messy mess, a man suffocated by the monster's dripping vagina, and a woman screwed to death by her huge, crunching phallus. You're most likely off From the overview above, this is crazy, hooded stuff, and probably not the taste of most healthy people, but for those who have been fed up with mainstream cinema for a long time and are already familiar with Asian excuses. The guts of a beauty should prove to be delightfully distracting and deviant. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
