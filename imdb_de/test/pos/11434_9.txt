As a modern Marco Polo, from Venice to China, we return to Amelio and undertake the task of representing the gray area in the middle of two worlds in monochrome colors. The collateral damage of globalization has shaped Europe's pessimistic vision of China. <br /> <br /> The view of this charming yet enigmatic land is treated from below, with no claim to learning or opinion. The reality, however, is tough. Abandoned and exploited children, hive-houses, backward areas are the OTHER porcelain that we ignore. Vincenzo (Castellitto), a steelworks technician, is one of us. His trip to China is a pretext to understand, to learn from a country where progress and problems of the Third World live together in an infamous balance. It is not clear if Vincenzo knew for the first time that the mechanical component had already been repaired, I think; anyway, this is a minor aspect. Liu, the Chinese girl, is the key to the entire movie. She has a lot of difficulties on her back, she has the strength to overcome, but how could she fight with little money and little help? <br /> <br /> The realistic and unbiased consideration of the facts by the girl who refused Vincenzo's money has touched me a lot. A set of banknotes can not get back her husband, her baby (who is treated as a stranger to the law), protect her with contempt. Liu knew his intentions were benign and kind, far from a cold charity action. Her friendship is beautifully told as she grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. A priceless heritage to preserve. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are breathtaking, either for acting (Vincenzo cries on the ferry) or for the dialogues (in the restaurant, on the tracks). Apart from a careless cut and a rather lazy start, "La Stella che non c'Ã¨" is brilliant and sharp just because the unfathomable truths are recorded Ling for the Mastroianni Award, which is dedicated to up-and-coming stars. She definitely deserves this award. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
