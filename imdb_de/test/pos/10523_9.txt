I happened to catch the last 45 minutes of the movie, about eight years ago. What a wild and funny 45 minutes. At the end of the night I was shot dead in an old hotel, which is being demolished with a demolition ball. Incredible. Incredible. I vaguely remember Stacy Keach, who stole a police car, was fake to be a cop, and heavily armed some Winos ... Wino to Keach They do not make them that way anymore. Great movie. The Golden 70s ... Hopefully it will appear as a DVD together with other lost treasures as daylight ... Hickey and Boggs are one.
