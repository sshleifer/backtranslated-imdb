Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role. In my opinion, this is by far the best movie in the series and my favorite movie of all time. This film does not take itself seriously because the filmmakers knew that all necessary social commentary was conveyed in the first film. Golan and Globus have made this film for Bronson fans, not for the critics, and it works. DW3 was wrongly criticized as "garbage" and "a tired entry in a worn series". These statements would be true if the film was to be taken seriously or a statement spread, which was not the case. If you look at it for what it is, DW3 is just a fun, action-packed hustle and bustle where Charlie does street punks, which we all wish we could do. The action is incessant, the atmosphere is great and the movie is the best Bronson movie ever made. As you can see, the penny pinching the Cannon group spent a lot of money on this group. It is believed that Bronson considered the film too violent, and for this reason Winner has not made any of the following posts. I understand his concern, but as with sequels, you still need to press the envelope to pass a previous entry. In any case, this movie was not more violent than any other movie that was filmed at this time. What makes DW3 the best in the series and my favorite movie of all time (not the best, just my favorite) is the action, Charlie's presence, memorable baddies, and the ability to get viewers to get on the train. The first movie may be technically the best, but it's the most fun. For once, Charlie has some smart lines (though he does not say much) and a half-interesting story, photography, action, and directions to support him. Charlie has never been as intense or cool as he has ever been. Yes, it's exploitative, maybe it promotes stereotypes, and maybe it's the same story as before, but Bronson's films always have and will defend the simple man and give his audience what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates their audiences. My answer is: The films do not manipulate us, the fans are the ones responsible. We demand that Bronson blew away earned scum, and again Winner and Co. deliver the goods. And for those of you who still want to take it, you should remember a few things. DW3 was the first movie in America when it came out, and was one of the favorite favorites of millions of people in video and television because they realize that not all films must be epics, but only have to be fun. ********** / 10 It does not get any better.
