I think this show is fantastic !!! I love it and I love Fabian (not in a romantic way), but if I were there I would totally support Fabian, as Haley did, and the other girls, yes !! I mean, if they're wild, why do not you want to fight them? Fabian is the only one who has the courage to confront people and say what he thinks, not just to stay and to suck !!! FABIAN 100% !!!!! I also love Haley because she is like a normal girl who does not want to be everywhere with cows, beetles and grass and wants to sleep in a warm bed with servants. I mean, if you have the chance and the money, why not you do that !!! and also Fabian, Fabian brought pizza and how two or three people thanked him, he said he spend money !!
