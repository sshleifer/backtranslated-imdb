Since watching the trailer in the DVD "The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea", I felt like this movie is going to be awesome because I'm a big fan of Disney. And guess what? I am right! This film is a very worthy successor to the original classic "Lady and the Tramp". <br /> <br /> He tells the story of Scamp, the mischievous son of Lady and Tramp, Scamp who wants to be wild and free instead of living a dog's house, though the movie may not be as good as the first one He has a great morality that you would not find anywhere else. <br /> <br /> I admit that the movie is not for everyone, But those of you who hate it, all I can say is that you have no mind for it, and I suggest you do not should see again. But hey! It's really a great story with brilliant animation, music and talented vocal talents like Scott Wolf (Party of Five) and Alyssa Milano (Charmed). So, if you have not seen the movie, why are you standing there? Go and get the copy !!!
