Ever since Jason and his husband took over horror movies in 1980, nearly every horror movie has involved a group of hormonally charged teens who focused on hacking rather than tension. <br /> <br /> This little movie is different. Made in the early '80s, it does what any good horror movie should do - arouse your worst fears while you just sit and know these horror types are just around the corner. Then let those horror dishes simmer, just do not turn them into a lesson in the biology of slaughter. <br /> <br /> In the story, Meg Tilly becomes just before her short-lived turn, starting with "The Big Chill" and then disappearing in the dark at the beginning of the 90s. Meg plays an outcast teenager, who just waits to fall into the mercy of some classic mean girls. They tell her that she can be part of her small group when she spends the night in a tomb. The mean girls mean to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt, which gives her a double reward - the outcast girl continues to be tormented and has an excuse to refuse her. Meanwhile, the famous occultist Karl Rhamarevich died. The bizarre death, shortly after he claimed to have found a way to return from the grave, and after his return, he commanded great magical powers. His daughter does not believe that at first, but she listens to a tape about her father's experiments, including his successful animation of small dead animals and his plans to get out of the grave with the power to animate larger game and gain more strength these animations. She also learns that she may have inherited her father's power and may be the only person who can stop him if he is actually raised from the dead. I think you know where that story goes, so I stop here. Did I mention that the magician was buried in the same tomb where Meg Tilly's character spends the night? <br /> <br /> I would like to mention that the commercial DVD that contains this movie is a bit run down compared to what you would expect, a movie that was made recently. I saw it on TV in the mid-eighties, and I remember it looked better. The problem is that the original negative of the movie was never found, so the DVD had to be created from a print. This means that it comes complete with dirt and scratches. <br /> <br /> It's worth it for any horror fan. It was an independent film and an example of unusual things that could usually be found on late night television until the infomercial turned this time slot around 1986 into a vast wasteland. Only TCM Underground releases this kind of movie more.
