I give this film only 9 out of 10 because there is not enough specific scientific evidence on the amount of energy needed to produce food to satisfy the science haters. mdixon seems to believe that the admittedly biased commentators are the stuff to do it, but even a basic understanding of the resources and laws of thermodynamics will suggest that they are at least solidly based on science if they claim that we are not continuing With oil, we have to move to different types of energy and have no plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil. Other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have been killed. Read "Collapse" by Jared Diamond, a popular book or basic Ecology or Earth Science textbook, and you can review the basic requirements of this film. Go ahead, fiddle while Rome is burning!
