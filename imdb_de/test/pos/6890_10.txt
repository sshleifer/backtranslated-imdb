I can only say that I really miss this show !! My wife and I just got married when this show started !! Why did CBS take it out of the air ??? I think it was the best show for the whole family! It made me laugh !! It also made me cry. But when CBS took it out of the air, I thought CBS had made a big mistake. Do you know what would be great? Have a reunion show !! That would be so cool !!!! Does anyone know if it is still on DVD? Did CBS show the whole last season in the last season of Promised Land ?? I think CBS took it out of mid-season. My wife and I will never forget it. The opening with this title song was fantastic !!! This show comes only once in a lifetime! May we never forget the promised land !!
