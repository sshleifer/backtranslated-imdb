Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza, which in 1953 was Western's biggest commercial success. Guy Madison leads a group of guards and outsiders to rescue two white women held by Indians. The 3D format was an early stage Hollywood gag to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. The rescuers make their way with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the whites stand on an island in a stream bed. The Indian weapons are constantly coming to the public, and a splash of tobacco juice aimed at a rattler is thrown into the room for a reason. Madison was hugely popular on the television as Wild Bill Hickock and is well-suited as a displaced rancher who gets his thankless job from the army. For the entire film and the presentation, the film was shot in just three days.
