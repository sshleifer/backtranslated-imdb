My family and I enjoy this show and find in it a good sketch of what people have been through. <br /> <br /> My own father spent some time in Changi before driving on the Thailand-Burma Railway in "F". Makes. So much of the treatment received by POWs was said, I'd just like to say that my dad was 6 feet 1 inch and 196 pounds when Singapore fell; at the end of the war he was 5 feet 11 inches tall and 91 pounds , <Br /> <br /> No show could really convey what the POWs went through, but that comes closer than most. <br /> <br /> As ex-prisoners of war say, "If you did not have any comrades, you did not survive." This show manages to convey this message.
