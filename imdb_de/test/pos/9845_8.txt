This is a typical fast-paced, entertaining movie from the early 1930s. If you have James Cagney at the top, these pre-code movies are even better: just fun to watch. When movies are "outdated", this is usually negative, but not for movies from 1930-1934. Yes, slang and attitudes, clothes, hairstyles etc. are outdated, but that's a big part of the fun. These films have an advantage that is almost always fun. <br /> <br /> You also have a craze that is appealing and fascinating. You see people - like the juvenile delinquents pictured in this movie and their stupid parents - who you will never see outside of this (early '30s). At the beginning of this film, the kids go to the judge and you just sit and laugh about these crazy characters, who appear in court for their children one after the other. Yes, we get the stereotypical emotional Italian father. the Jewish father; The Anglo-Saxon mother and a few other mothers, all of whom are working for her in a dramatic way, are "a good boy". While things are predictable in some cases, you do not care because everyone here is so much fun. <br /> <br /> This also teaches you that children 75 years ago were also punks, stealing, robbing, lying - hey, that's the human situation. This film exposes the theory that "people used to be more beautiful". No, people were always bad or good. The degree was supported by the environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here we get a lot of "Dead End" kids who end up in the Reform School. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous and stupid-liberal act lets children act like angels as soon as they conduct the show at the Reform School; not to be punished in the least because a man fell to his death and the institution was set on fire (the explanation: He was a commoner and earned it, so much for real justice and reform.); and "Patsy," who shoots a guy who never has to be questioned by the police because he's the good guy! Notice the subtle antireligious dig where the only guy seen is the evil "warden." This is no coincidence, no coincidence. This kind of negative association thing has been around ever since the Hays code was canned in the late '60s and as you can see in the early' 30s of the pre-code. <br /> <br /> By the way, Dudley Digges is outstanding in his role as "villain" of "Mr. Thomson". Above all, his voice was very effective and I could imagine that he played one of those similarly evil roles as an institution head in a Charles Dickens film adaptation. Cagney played his normal role, the tough guy who plays the pretty girl "Dorothy Griffith" by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro was also the leader of the boys "Jimmy Smith" effective. The very expression of Darro's face made his character believable. Somehow he was the real star of the movie, but I'll go with Cagney anyway. The rest of the reform school kids were not too believable and they were really ethnic stereotypes, but it was fun to see them. We saw how bad these kids were and witnessed the good and bad and stereotypical parents in the court after the children were arrested , These scenes are pure dead-end kids stuff of the 30s. They always showed the kids that they were bad news at the beginning of the movie, but when the story was over, they all looked more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - hardly crude "offenders." It is very far-fetched, but it works as far as entertainment is concerned. All in all, a hokey but very entertaining movie, typical of Cagney movies and the early '30s. Almost all of them rate their entertainment value at least eight stars.
