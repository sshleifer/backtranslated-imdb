This is a very strange film for Harold Lloyd - at least in terms of the cute character he played in movies in the 1920s and 30s. Instead of a nice guy, he and Snib Pollard are crazy to blind everyone. In a particularly successful case, Chester claims to have lost a "very valuable ring", and a little later Harold finds that he is also looking for the ring as a henchman. The ring is of course cheap and was found by Harold, but the thug's greed is so great that it "convinces" Harold not to say anything and sell him the "precious" ring, and then they run away to rejoice her luck (?). Again and again they find Patsies until they meet a woman who is herself a cheater (working with a man who does wrong s√©ances). She arranges a fancy con and takes all the money they stole - and a cop stands by to make sure they're giving her money. <br /> <br /> As luck would have it, the two Conmen lady trip dodgy shops when no one is home. Soon the lady comes back and confuses her mind - she's done a lot of dirty tricks to punish her for her evil ways. <br /> <br /> This is a totally strange and fictional movie all around, but it is also extremely funny, as the jokes work very well and Lloyd and Pollard form an excellent team. Besides, while I was weird and weird, I liked seeing Pollard dressed like a lady.
