I can differ from many people on this board, but I enjoy watching Mind Of Mencia. The reason why I like Mind Of Mencia is that the host is not afraid to voice his opinion or use clichés. Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends but is not ready to admit, and so on. <br /> <br /> Mencia has no problem making jokes about any race, religion, sex or orientation. While he gets a lot of flack for it, it's a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times. Mencia does not care if he insults someone, but he is not a racist and even jokes about his own race. <br /> <br /> The typical format for the Mind of Mencia is as follows: There will be an open skits fun at a person or a recent event. Mencia comes out and makes a 5- or 6-minute stand in which he talks about different topics. The show then has two separate skits shared by commercials. In these sketches, Mencia does a variety of things, such as making fun of people, voicing his personal opinion in a funny twist, or simply making parodies of people, events, or movies. At the end of the show, Mencia comes out for a minute, either with a last sketch or something else. <br /> <br /> People criticize Mencia for using clichés and say his statements are too offensive. Carlos only does what everyone else thinks about certain races, but is afraid to say. Regarding the offensive of Mencia he only speaks his opinion. I think nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br /> The show is not perfect. The skits can not be the best, and Mencia sometimes goes over the line in his jokes. But most of the time, it's a show where the comedian says what's in his head, no matter what the consequences are and presents himself in a humorous affair. So, if you're not afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone speak their minds and often say what they wanted to say, you should check out Mind Of Mencia. However, if you are slightly offended, you should not watch this show because you may be offended or worse and might even laugh.
