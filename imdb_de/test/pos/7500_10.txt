36. THE HOSPITAL (Comedy, 1971) A series of emergencies has hit the Manhattan Hospital. Patients die due to overcrowded conditions and inability of employees left and right. When a local doctor is detained in the death census, the chief physician Bock (George C. Scott) was consulted. After Dr. Bock has worked for too many years as a doctor and has experienced a medium-term crisis, he is difficult. He decides to commit suicide. Then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), a young hippie beauty. His keen insights into life help the depressed buck. <br /> <br /> Criticism: The Black Comedy features a 'tour de force' performance by former actor George C. Scott. He is good at playing demanding, serious characters whose strict morals are rigorously tested. The first half of the film unfolds like a melodrama that describes life in hospitals pretty well, and the confusions that they sometimes are. But as things prepare for a dramatic climax, it becomes a slapstick comedy. If Paddy Chayefsky's script had retained his dramatic feel, I wonder if Scott would have moved out with another best actor Oscar (previously he had won him "in-abwesia"). His mischief scene is one of the worst realities in cinematic history. <br /> <br /> QUOTE: Dr. med. Life and thinking about suicide. I said, "No, do not do it, you're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, your life makes sense." Then ... I find out, my doctors were killed by some nurses ... How can I maintain my sense of purpose in the face of this problem? "
