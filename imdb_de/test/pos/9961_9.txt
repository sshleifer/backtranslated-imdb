The Merchant of Venice is a fantastic movie. It is very similar to the original Shakespeare play. If you've seen Jeremy Irons in Casanova and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! If you have seen Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare in Love and liked his performance, this is a movie for you! If you have seen Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco and have liked his performance, this is a movie for you! It's a very enjoyable movie, and if you're studying Shakespeare like me, this is a great movie you can watch !! The only problem with this movie is that you can not let the little ones see it because it has a bit of nudity. But besides that, it's a really good movie !!
