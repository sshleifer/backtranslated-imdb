This movie is full of great performances from start to finish, a great soundtrack featuring original Douglas Brown music and a well-played script full of surprises. <br /> <br /> Full of New and Fewer Faces The film shows promising talents, especially in the case of Craig Morris, who plays the main character Eddie Monroe. Morris, who also co-wrote the script, shows a calm power combined with a strong emotional performance while creating a believable character on the screen. Also a poignant handover from Paul Vario, who plays Uncle Benny with a sincere warmth, was so convincing that he made me hungry as he lovingly prepared his Italian sauce great new story - what more could you ask for? This movie is highly recommended!
