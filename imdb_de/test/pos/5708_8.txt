THE STUDENT NURSES is not a typical sexploitation movie. Sure, the nudity and sexual openness is there, but it's not all laugh. Stephanie Rothman filmed a socially compelling, well written tit and ass movie that explores the issues of racism, socioeconomic inequalities, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, the Vietnam War, free love, LSD and drugs. Four sexy college roommates are taking their nursing internship at the same time. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) is assigned to the terminal station, Lynn (Brioni Farrell) of the Public Health Administration, Priscilla (Barbara Leigh) of Gynecology and Phred (Karen Carlson) of Psychiatry. These four beauties have ample opportunity to undress and decorate, which they use to the delight of male onlookers. These women are liberated at the height of the sexual revolution and as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful. Visceral, but inexpensive action sequences are consistently interspersed. At the resistance headquarters, there is a very bloody shootout in which two police officers and several members of the group are shot dead. A (Vietnamese) war protest, consisting of creepy-clad young people of all races, painted like skeletons, becomes violent, with police beating protesters. The effective travel on the beach consists of beautiful, eerie and confusing sensory and memory montages with hypersensitive overtones. In short, THE STUDENT NURSES is a thoughtful and captivating reflection of the time, which expresses itself from the perspective of the woman (since she was written and directed by a woman). But it is still fun and tickling despite its sobering treatment of objects.
