The movie was better than I expected. I was working on the movie when Damien made that movie. The gunfire, stunt, and acting were pretty good on the cut tip. Better music would have a peak in this movie. Part of the music sounds like the hippie days. Damien remember, you have gangster gangsters, a few oldies or hip hop would have done it. It was more realistic than blood in the blood. The casting was really well chosen. Suspectentert did a good job in this film. But in the end you do not always win. And in my story that was the way it was. I adapted to the movie when I saw it for the first time. Damien congratulations to this movie.
