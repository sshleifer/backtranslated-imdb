Made from characters previously developed in a series of critically acclaimed short films, THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT is as far removed from the usual "family" as you can get: beautifully crafted, with witty dialogue and clever concepts, this is really a movie that will appeal to almost every family member. <br /> <br /> The story is about Wallace and his dog Gromit, who live in a village that is obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair, the "anti-pesto", a humane solution for all these annoying rabbits tormenting passionate gardeners everywhere. The business is a great success - but Wallace proves to be too smart to do anything good for himself. When he tries to "rehabilitate" rabbits from their vegetable crunch, he unexpectedly unleashes an ancient horror of legendary proportions: the Were-Rabbit! And suddenly, no vegetables in the city are safe! The movie is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly clever dialogues and references to everything from KING KONG to THE WOLF MAN - more than enough to lure even a mashed teen - but the true charm of the thing lies in their characters. The amount of personality that artists and animators can pull out of pieces of clay is amazing: they look as alive as any actor of flesh and blood. The DVD release (and I recommend the widescreen) contains a number of informative and entertaining extras. We recommend! GFT, Amazon Reviewer
