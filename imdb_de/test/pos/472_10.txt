I'm a nightmare for movie directors ... especially the mega-buck multiplex variety. Although I'm not a student of the arts, I still have a high threshold for disbelieving suspension and buying into the vision of the filmmaker, if I can find them. That's why a gem like "You Are Alone" is such an exciting find. The intimacy and the pace attracted me and never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give thoughtful, nuanced performances, and director Gorman Bechard skilfully shows what a disturbingly disturbing day is in the lives of two terribly damaged people. Spoiler below: <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD version and shared it with several people. The reactions have been different, from disbelief to Daphne's ability to do the job Buddy paid her for not seeing the whole movie because he was just too real and emotionally devastating. As a compulsive skeptical movie goer, I have to either be grabbed by the collars and taken to the ride or seduced to the filmmaker. This film took the later path for me, and in the end I was so involved that I felt Daphne's horror and pain in her role in Buddy's death. My reaction to this film reminded me that many years ago, Peter Greenaway had seen 'The cook, the thief, his wife and lover'. In the end, I was fascinated and repelled and could not distract myself from this movie. I've seen this movie several times now and really appreciate the eye and the ear that the director has shown. I know of other works he has done, including a few cheeky films, "Galactic Gigolo" and "Attack of the Killer Bimbos" and a mixed bag "The Kiss", which I recently learned from the manufacturer and in the Cradle was not really representing the vision of the directors. Too bad, because I loved the two previous films and even found "The Kiss" interesting, but "The Kiss" was in a Director's Cut with all the original vision and music in tact. I am looking forward to the future work of this interesting director and responsible persons Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.
