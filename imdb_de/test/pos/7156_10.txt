the most "spiritual" movie I have seen in a long time. maybe already. Also a scene around the dining table a piece of comic perfection. I understand that a release date is approaching in the fall. When it comes to your city and you want to see a movie that makes you think that it is. Aviva is great at it and she's sure to be a future star - (Superbad is out now, in which she is) - all the actors are perfectly calibrated. There is a sound set from this movie to surprise thoroughly. I would not know what to call it - it's a comedy, but the supporting message is so fierce and direct that "comedy" is not enough. I love this movie. It's a thinking comedy. But even this sentence is not really good enough. FTF has a message and this message needs to be heard now
