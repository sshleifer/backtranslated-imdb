The first time I saw "Alice in Wonderland - an X rated musical comedy" was in the early 80's in a New York City movie theater with a few friends. I remember that we really enjoyed it, although we wondered why all the "goodies" are in different color-coded patches and why the movie suddenly jumped from scene to scene and advised us ... Obviously it was the soft-core version (hacked) that made me want to see you soon, but in its original integral version. Well, more than 20 years went by without me forgetting everything about this movie and just a few days ago came across a commonly used VHS copy (which had seen better times: slightly faded colors) (scratchy sound and a few flaws), but you know what? It's the original uncut version and this time I really had a ball! Humor, musicals and porno images may be a nasty combination, but in this case it really works and unlikely, the vast majority of the boring porn movies that invade our screens today is a truly amusing and entertaining sex fantasy that will not disappoint. The direction is smart, the fast cut lets the movie fly like a bird, all the familiar characters are lovable or just funny, all the actors seem to have a good time, the songs are catchy (the mention of "growing up" is worth mentioning) From Alice's beginning to the film and the comical "What makes a nice girl like you on a knight", the dance numbers are well choreographed and staged (surprisingly energetic that Terry Hall proves she can "dance" too) enthusiastically dances her Do not worry, she does what she was best known for ...), the acting, the singing, the set, the costumes are of high quality and then ... there's Kristine "Blue Eyes" DeBell, in the first starring role of her career and (oh man!) She actually has some HC sequences! I personally think that they are absolutely not unpleasant, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and quite exciting. She is young and (ohhh!) So pretty; With the help of her new friends in Wonderland she discovers her body and her sexuality. She sings, she dances and ... what do you expect? She also experiments with sex! The final sequence, when she finally loves her boyfriend, is exceptionally well photographed and staged and is the highlight of the film. I think her "Physique du Roll" (the innocent blue eyes and the captivating smile) and her acting skills make these explicit sequences more than acceptable and actually very enjoyable. There is plenty of sex in (this) wonderland and everyone seems to be eager to engage with the first available boys or girls, which means there is a lot of hard action to see. On the other hand, some close-ups that are clearly "picked" just to make the "porn dogs" really happy make my taste a bit unnecessary. In general, however, the sex action is not offensive, as it is handled with great humor and fits in almost seamlessly with the music, the dances and the comedy. If you think that you and your partner can handle graphic sex, look at it together. Take my word, you'll have one and a half hours of good time (maybe an extra action after the show ...) This is "Adult Entertainment", so be careful, do not leave this video with other kids' videos. If your 10-year-old can lay his hands on it, he may be amused, but you'll have to make embarrassing statements about why "this" Alice behaves very differently from the one he ran into in Lewis Carroll's novel or the he watched on the Disney video. I bet you will not forget this "unique" soon. It is a pity that they do not do that anymore ...! I give a 9 out of 10 points.
