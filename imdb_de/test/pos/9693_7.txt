This is not a movie that really deserves critical attention. It will not win any Oscars - it's really not a very good movie. It's not even a movie, just a series of short, disgusting skits strung together to create entertainment. And as much as any critical bone in my body screams to give this movie a bad score, shit, damn it, I'll give it a much better score. The people who will enjoy this movie are not the people who really care what the critics have to say, so I will not give a shabby critique of Jackass's quality of surreal existentialism that pervades and comments on how our society .... oh, forget it. What is to be said? There is no plot, no character development - no real beginning - there is a half pleasing ending that is not nearly as funny as the sketch behind it, and everything in between stinks of inappropriate bathroom humor, about the young high kids laugh. It's actually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Let all the prejudices of a good movie at the door. Jackass: Number two is just fucking crap. That's really all it is. However, I give the following to the filmmakers: They come up with quite imaginative things. They're likely to contract several times, wanting to vomit a few times, wiggle and move uncomfortably, while the people on the screen do stunting and death-defying stunts. Vomit, manure, urine, sperm ... In Jackass: Number Two is virtually every body fluid to see. There is nudity, sexual humor abound and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining. If you're the type of person who finds this stuff entertaining, you'll probably really like Jackass: Number Two. I laughed several times. Like I said, it's pretty imaginative stuff. I never wanted to vomit - though I have a pretty strong stomach. Just assume the premise of the film: A few idiotic guys make funny crap for fun. Once you have left that, accept it and continue with it, you will enjoy it. The only flaw in the movie is the sheer excess of all the weird and disgusting stuff. There are several very imaginative, very disturbing sketches, but they come in many places because they are less interesting. Towards the end of the day it gets a little bit worse, but in the middle of the film, the resistance of the overall quality of the film damages. In a half-hour TV show, this is not a problem, but with film-length celluloid, it's inevitable that eventually boredom comes up. After a while, the coarse crap becomes simply desensitizing. <br /> <br /> By and large, however, Number Two is a fun, imaginative and, above all, disgusting comedy that will leave a sense of pain, nausea and discomfort cheerfulness. Look at it, if you have to, but hey, if you know you do not like such things, do not bother. You will only be disappointed.
