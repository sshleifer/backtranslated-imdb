This is by far the funniest sitcom ever to be televised. I own all 9 seasons on DVD and literally watched them over and over again. Anyone who does not find this show funny, heartwarming, entertaining and hysterically laughing is crazy! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians. My boyfriend and I enjoy comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and have seen Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) once. They are both incredibly talented and just planning their work wisely. There are so many comedians that are terrible, and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of a real comedy. Leah Remini, although a real life snob and slut (as I read) is an amazing actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms. She really does the show ... along with Jerry Stiller! This show is a must and you will be hooked on one to two episodes!
