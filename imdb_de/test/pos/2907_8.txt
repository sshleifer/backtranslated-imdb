It came before "the Ten Commandments" "Land of the Pharaohs" "Ben Hur" and is overlooked today. How unfair! Based on Mika Waltari's Mammoth novel, it does not cheapen it! Waltari's novel was so great that only a miniseries could be so great doing justice (I hope it will happen someday). Waltari, whose message is essentially Christian, remains intact (another of his books "The Secret of the Kingdom" (first part) takes place after the death of Christ in the Holy Land). <br /> <br /> "The Egyptian" is the rise of a monotheism close to Christianity long before Christ: The Pharaoh (Wilding) is a kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the real kingdom is not in the Middle Kingdom is material world: He asks to return good for evil! And he has disciples who eventually turn to martyrs (the scene in which Simmons and the other worshipers of the Sun God are killed is visually stunning and looks like a pagan ballet) but priests mean that this new religion is the end of their influence means the population, and therefore they are looking for a strong man (mature) who can lead the army against both the Hittites and their dangerous compatriots. Another religion or non-religion, we should say, is Sinouhé (Purdom), who is two years old. Hours does not believe in anything (the order of the grains of sand is absolutely sensational, setting the entire movie far beyond the average pee !!) <br / > <br /> There's another intriguing page: The movie looks like an extravagant melodrama Just for the script (especially the last revelation of Pharoah's sister (Tierney) that was two years before the "Ten Commandments") but also for the splendor of cinematography: Viviani speaks in his book on Curtiz about a Baudelairian atmosphere, blue and gold Especially in the scenes with the prostitute (Darvi), who looks at her reflection in the water of her bath, the highest narcissism. Around the hero, all the characters appear, disappear, reappear, but when they reappear, they follow their path, and all dealings come together with perfect dexterity. Apart from this, this is often the case in "modern" melodramas is a long flashback, framed by two short sequences that show Sinouhé, an old man who remembers. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful sword and sandals that had a strong influence not only in America, but especially in Europe in Poland, where Jerzy Kawalerowicz staged a fascinating "Faraon" (1966), the Curtiz lot owed.
