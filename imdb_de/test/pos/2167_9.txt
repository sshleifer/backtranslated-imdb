I'm a jerk for a decent superhero movie. (I do not count super bug budget, no Batman story). <br /> <br /> A few of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpion can be added to this collection. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the demolitionist, you'll get this movie. It's basically a copy of this heroine. (It's even the same guy in both movies.) <br /> <br /> If not, let me explain ... The father of a police officer is murdered and she's looking for revenge. She laces up the black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, terse outfit that looks absolutely great for Joan Severance) and sets off to prey a bit I do not want the kids to see it ... without screening to see Whether you like the pretty graphic sex scene of Severance. Which in my opinion was a bonus (alright, give an extra star <smile>)
