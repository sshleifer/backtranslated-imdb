College teacher Larry Donner (Billy Cristal) has been a blockbuster writer since his former wife Margareth (Kate Mulgrew) ruined him and stole his novel, which became a bestseller. He does not hide his hatred for Margareth and upset his girlfriend Beth Ryan (Kim Greist), who is an anthropology teacher at the same college. While teaching creative writing, he is followed by the student Owen (Danny DeVito), who wants to know his opinion of his crime story. Larry says that he did not like it and explains that the killer in every mysterious story should remove the motive and set an alibi, otherwise he would get caught. In addition, Larry Owen suggests watching Hitchcock's films to understand the structure of an exciting story. Owen, who wants to kill his despicable mother (Anne Ramsey), watches "strangers on the train" and misunderstands Larry's advice. He believes that his teacher wants to exchange murders to eliminate the motive. Owen travels to Hawaii, and while he's in a ship, Margareth falls overboard, disappears into the sea and is considered dead. Larry, however, has no alibi and becomes the prime suspect, while confused Owen urges him, his mother as part of her alleged Deals killing funniest comedies of the 80s and a great tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. The direct reference is "strangers on the train", but there are jokes with "Vertigo" (with the camera), "Family Plot" (with the car without breaks) and other films. The lines are excellent, and there's an interesting point when Larry says that every great romance or mystery has a move. Anne Ramsey is amazing in the role of a wicked and abusive dominant mother, and the onlooker will surely feel grief and understand the insanity of Owen. Kim Greist is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect slut. Billy Cristal plays an obsessive character with many stupid and unreasonable attitudes, but these are necessary for the plot. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jogue a Mam√£e do Trem"
