The director of Kannathil Muthamittal staged the first Indian movie I watched "Dil Se", which made me buy well over 122 Hindi DVDs over four months. I can say that I understood the entire attraction, I was somehow confused why the movie would stop because of "music videos". It was an excellent movie, I did not know what to do with dancing, and the female vocals were a bit shrill for my western ears, but somehow I found the score of AR Rahmen hypnotic. I bought the soundtrack the next day and then Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week. With the exception of "Ichi the <br /> Killer" and some other Korean movies, I can not bother to see much else. A little strange for someone who has seen only a strict diet of Hong Kong, horror <br /> <br /> and action / science fiction movies over the past 30 years. <br /> <br /> But I Should Come Back For Kannathil Muthamittal, It's one of Mani Ratman's last efforts, and I laughed, cried, became totally crazy, horrified and most of all, I did not feel manipulated. The acting was great, the photography was beautiful. I think you could stop the movie anytime and find out that every frame would be worth the effort. The music was perfect for the movie, and after the credits had <br /> <br /> rolled, I wanted to watch again ... so I did it. <br /> <br /> It would be foolish to discuss the conspiracy in fear that you will miss the pleasure of watching the events and developing the characters. That's what the great movie is about! I stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over! <br /> <br /> My wife is watching now and I can hardly wait for her reaction. I can not expect it to be anything less than mine.
