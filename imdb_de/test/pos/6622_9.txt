My skateboarding career ended in 1974, when my 2/4-wheeled steel skate hit a rock and I crashed for days, apparently in front of my parents' home in Boston. When the cast came from my arm, the summer was over. <br /> <br /> But I've always admired the X-Games guys and surfers. I think I spent the first month after surfing the beaches and piers in southern California, surfing and watching that I missed my calling. It is something you should learn young before burying the terrible senses of self-preservation and self-awareness. Otherwise you will be so worried that you will not hurt yourself or make fun of it like a trained bear. <br /> <br /> I've always admired how a good surfer seems to be doing nothing but this moment, that wave, that experience. One with the forces of nature. A good surfer makes it look like there's nothing but this wave and the way you interact with it. There is a lot of Zen in me. <br /> <br /> This documentary describes how some young people used the surfing concepts and extended them to skateboarding. Ramps, downslope, low, curved curves as they interact with the cement waves beneath their feet. In her day, all this was new. Radical. In front of the Zephyr skate team, the idea was to ride in a straight line on a skateboard as fast as possible, so my long "Evel Knievel at Caeser's Palace" stumbled like a walk through the front walk. <br /> <br /> This film is a retrospective of the time, of an America, before ALL was labeled "extreme", tagged, marketed and pierced. (Seriously, what's so "extreme" about a "meal of extreme value" at Taco Bell? Apart from the fact that it's an extreme danger to your colon ...) <br /> <br /> Take a look watch this movie and watch the birth of "extreme sports". Before X-Games, Boom-Boom Huck-Jam, Crusty Demons, ASA ... there were these young street kids who created "extreme sports" without really trying. They did it only for the purity, the sheer pleasure of skateboarding with friends in the sun. <br /> <br /> I hope you get the extremely "extreme" money out there. Goodness knows they will not get the credit they deserve. Maybe this movie can fix that. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie with a great soundtrack, a portrait of Southern California, yes an America that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> I do not care for Sean Penn, but he does a decent job story.
