This is one of Stan Laurel's best solo comedies before working with Oliver Hardy in 1927. Laurel is a very good actor in the movie and offers good comedy. The best scene in the movie is when Stan dances with Mae Laurel (his wife from Common Law) at Cafe Espanol. Stan makes silly dances that are funny without you listening to the music. I will recommend it to any fan of Stan Laurel.
