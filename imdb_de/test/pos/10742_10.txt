"Kramer vs. Kramer" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman leaving her husband and little son. The husband must now take responsibility for the boy. They get to know each other better. Then mother and wife return and she wants custody of the boy. "Kramer vs. Kramer" has a lot of drama with some wonderful comedies. Dustin Hoffman won his first Oscar for Best Actor for his brilliant performance. Most people say his performance in "Rainman", which earned him his second Oscar, is his best performance. He was great in this movie, but I do not agree that it's his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors today. He is also funny sometimes. Meryl Streep, who was not so well known as she made this movie as it is today, is a great achievement. Like Hoffman, Streep also won her first Oscar (as Best Supporting Actress) for her work in "Kramer vs. Kramer" as a wife and mother trying to find herself after she left her family. Justin Henry, who was only eight when the movie came out, is wonderful as the son of Hoffman and Streep. For his role, he won an Oscar nomination and is still the youngest artist to have received an Oscar nomination in a competition category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also doing well as a respected family friend. She also received an Oscar nomination (for the supporting actress, in which she lost Streup). "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a great movie from start to finish. Director Robert Benton has made a film that is absolutely unforgettable. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
