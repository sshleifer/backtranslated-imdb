Anyone who likes the Lynchian craze of Twin Peaks or a fan of HP Lovecraft, who knows that the most frightening things are the familiar things, will really enjoy this movie. Do not look at him as a horror movie in the "traditional" Western sense, but more like a Grimm fairy tale. It's bloody and definitely for 16+, but as soon as you start watching it, you're also drawn into the vortex. Definitely one of those films that will stay with you for a few days after watching (I'll never look at my snails like this again!)
