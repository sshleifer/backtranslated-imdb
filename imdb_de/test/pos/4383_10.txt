This must be the best movie I have ever seen. You definitely have to see it more than once to find all the humor and twists. I'm not a fan of George Clooney, but he shines here. The actual performance comes from Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro as Pete and Delmar. One of the few films that I own.
