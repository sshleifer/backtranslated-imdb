If we could have "Separate Tables" why not "Separate Lies". <br /> <br /> That gets a bit complicated. The husband of a housekeeper is killed when he is hit by a car on a bicycle. It turns out that the culprit is the woman she cleans for. The latter had an affair with a friend and drove the car with the lover when the accident occurred. To make matters even more complicated, the housekeeper once worked for the man's parents and he was imprisoned for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident. Sounds like she wants revenge. <br /> <br /> All this will be confused. When our housekeeper finds out that her boss drove the car, she revokes her testimony much to the annoyance of the officer working on the case. <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, a few months later, our lover (Rupert Everett) is dying and our wife (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to take care of him. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, despite the never-ending "Peyton Place." Tom Wilkinson is a lawyer and tries to protect his wife. <br /> <br /> The movie is good but we could have done without the deadly disease Oh yes, the marriage ended anyway.
