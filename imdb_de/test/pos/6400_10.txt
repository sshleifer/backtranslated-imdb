I think that "Key West" is well suited as a DVD. There are probably many failed Star Treks who have never had a chance to succeed. We'll never know if this could have been a great show. I'd like to know if there's a way to see older shows like this, or is it just another Hollywood footnote? Is it possible to find copies of these shows so that we can enjoy loyal oddballs again? The show had a great writing talent and some, if not all, episodes, had a feel for the characters that in today's hit shows often lack the very unique characters. Thank you.
