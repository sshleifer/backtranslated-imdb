Finally, a movie that manages the likelihood of alien visits with reasonable depth and loving warmth. In the event that we are not alone, I think these visitors are just too touristy to take care of us or to give stable proof of their existence to this inhuman bunch of anthropocentric idiots. We would not interfere in the slaughtering of an agitated desert tribe, unless we want to do our travel insurance, right? The film shows the transitional occupation of a tired mind and body from a superordinate unit. that happens rather unspectacular and unrecognized, but this is a movie, right? Therefore, the hospital stay of Prot is only a trigger for the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges works as usual, but spacey is weird. The role seems to him tailor-made, convincing and lovingly "crazy". Eating unpeeled bananas, sitting on a tree and giving his doctor a hard time with speed, wisdom and (above all!) Breathtaking quotes. they let me think for hours and philosophize. <br /> <br /> It's an encouraging movie, to say the least, and the soundtrack of Edward Shearmur is just beautiful. Just go and get a copy. catch a ray of light. now.
