This film was a favorite of mine and is associated with the Christmas holidays for two reasons: (1) Growing up in the 1960s, everything from advertising to television programs was space related, and even Santa Claus was in spaceships Epoch; and (2) I saw this movie during a Christmas shopping trip when I was ten, and it brought back fond memories of my favorite TV shows when I was younger ("Supercar," Fireball XL5, and "Stingray"). So, for personal reasons, I'm a bit biased when it comes to this movie. <br /> <br /> That means, as a longtime film student, this is mainly a movie for fans of Gerry Anderson (and Barry Gray; oh, this beautiful score!), while the casual movie guardian's through the visions of the future (from the past) ( the wild cars, airliners, clothes, etc.) and the so-called "plot twist" will deter what will make some moan. However, if you can look for the desire of "2001: A Space Odyssey" to shoot a sci-fi movie with a "far-sighted" storyline, and if you enjoy imaginative special effects, then you will enjoy this gem of a time in which man has just walked on the moon and people still look in the stars and in the hope of the future and not look to the future of the banal traps of the real 21st century.
