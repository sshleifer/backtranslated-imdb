"Subconscious Cruelty" has to be one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Although it is sometimes extremely bleak and bloody, fans should not mind politically correct mainstream horror garbage. The film combines many wonderful images with a lot of sleaze and gore. It is extremely strange, vicious and disturbing, so fans will not be disappointed bizarre cinemas. My favorite segment from "Subconscious Cruelty" is "Human Larvae", which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The birth scene is particularly unpleasant and will not be forgotten so quickly. The last segment "Right Brain / Martyrdom" has yet to come It is believed. It is incredibly hard and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and cruel torture. We see Jesus captured by three naked women who mutilate him, tear meat from his chest, lick a wound on his knee and piss on him. There is also a Jesus statue with a projection of a swastika on it. "Subconscious Cruelty" is a really memorable movie that should be seen by fans of extreme cinemas.
