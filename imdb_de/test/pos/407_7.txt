Red Skelton plays a radio detective song known as "The Fox" in "Whistling in the Dark," starring Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eve Arden, Virgina Gray, and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton, also known as "The Fox," finds his plans to marry his fiancé Carol (Rutherford) when he is kidnapped by a leader of a sham cult (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult, The Silver Haven, does not receive a promised inheritance due to the existence of the nephew of the old woman who will live off interests. He wants Wally to plan a perfect murder action so that the man on the way can be killed with the lawyer. For backups and because he's not sure who Wally's fiancée is, Jones abducts Carol and also the daughter of the radio sponsor (Gray). <br /> <br /> This, in my opinion, is the second entry in this series "Pipes in Dixie". The plot is better, the cast is better, there is less slapstick and less jokes. Skelton, if he does not make faces and twists his eyes, is pretty gracious and Rutherford is very good. Veidt has always played these evil men perfectly. Eve Arden is Wally's agent, who arranges an appointment for him and Gray to ensure that his contract is renewed. I only saw Gray in movies in the 1950s. She was always a good-looking woman, but who knew she was such a knockout in the 30s and 40s? This is a funny movie with a nice cast.
