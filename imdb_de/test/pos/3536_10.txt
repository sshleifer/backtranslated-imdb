The Messiah looked compelling from beginning to end. The story focused on seemingly random murders of men in London in various cruel ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) has to find the truth, which, to his surprise, is a bit closer to home than he might think. <br /> <br /> A gripping drama and Ken Stott were brilliant. Hopefully we have not seen the last of DCI Red Metcalfe.
