This was a pretty good movie, which was pretty good overall. The idea of ​​Mercy (will not spoil) was also original. I think Angelina did a good job as one of her first films. The only thing that disapproved me was some crazy fighting scenes (will not spoil either). I liked the first movie and I liked it too. 10.7
