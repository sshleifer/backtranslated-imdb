See no harm with Kane. The movie has a great storyline, but it just was not a hiding place for my eye, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick. I enjoyed the movie, although I loved the story. <br /> <br /> GREAT FILM EXCELLED WOULD BE A PART 2 BE <br /> <br /> It does not matter if Kane is killed The end <br /> <br /> Or not that she has any other horror Kill stars in each movie <br /> <br /> You need to get out and they'll come back for more So part 2 would be <br /> <br /> Be very interesting.
