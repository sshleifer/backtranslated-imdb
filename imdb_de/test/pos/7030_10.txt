This is the best movie ever, but that's my opinion. Some say it's cheesy, but I think it's really a beautiful movie. The chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze is like no other I have ever seen and that makes the movie so perfect. I always wonder what the movie would have been if these two actors never existed, because not only did they make it for me, but both. If you've never seen this movie, you'll understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing looks like it was made by heart, and for some reason it feels so real, like magic and the soundtrack Love IT. In addition to the two main characters, the soundtrack makes the movie the beauty it is. As you can see, I am in love with this movie, and I know you will.
