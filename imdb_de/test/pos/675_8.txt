Careful, my darling came from a piece by Mel Dinelli, who apparently liked writing about frightened women. His first and best piece was the script for The Spiral Staircase. He also made a Loretta Young suspense thriller Cause For Alarm a few years earlier. The piece, which Dinelli wrote, was originally entitled "The Man" and ran in the 1950 season for 92 performances on Broadway. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway to see Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. <br /> <br /> The roles Gish and Boone played are taken over by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For whatever reason, RKO thought, to eliminate the age difference. Dinelli has rewritten his play for the canvas, so I wonder what he thought about it. Certainly the question of frailty has been completely removed from history. <br /> <br /> That was not the only thing that was eliminated. People wear all the historical clothes of the First World War, but there is absolutely no indication of the time in which this story takes place. I thought that was weird, and when the phone company's repair worker came to Ida Lupino's apartment, I noticed that his car was a vintage from the same time. <br /> <br /> The film plays almost exclusively in Ida Lupino's house, where she hired a foreign wanderer as a craftsman in Robert Ryan. The movie is a great lesson if you do not hire strangers with no connection. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenist who detained Lupino at her home for about a day. Both leads do a good job despite the changes made. Movies like "Beware My Lovely" are what a small studio like RKO did best. If this were done at MGM or Paramount, the shiny trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story.
