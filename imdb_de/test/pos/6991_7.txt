Even if this film begins with the usual: something goes awry, spaceship crashes, people are stranded, etc., but takes off and leads the viewer to new ideas. Riddick is a pretty bad convict and has his eyes modified so that he can see in the dark what is highly sought after by the ship's crew and he enters. The cut in the film is very good and underlines the mystique that surrounds the protagonist of the anti-hero and the male man: "Riddick". The story in Pitch Black is, as mentioned, sometimes very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but the cutting and trimming in the film, mixed with some surprising elements that have been added to the story, helps him to still support himself very well afterwards with a hybrid sense of satisfaction and hunger for more. Vin Diesel behaves really well in the role of Riddick, and although his character is a hard-core survivor, he still makes moral decisions that are almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean that his choices are not at the very end for decide him ... Why destroy an already perfect reputation? All in all, this is a very good movie, but not perfect. The story seems to be very unoriginal on the surface, but below it shines with enough originality to entertain it. Some scenes have this wow factor, while overall it's slightly better than the average. It could perhaps be called a cult movie and is definitely a recommendation for people who want a bright science fiction story with a few minor psychological moments and a fascinating protagonist, Riddick.
