I admit that I caught Sci-Fi's "Sci-Fi Prime" for the first time last week, but even though I was a big Sliders fan coming into the experience, Farscape is now just my favorite of the Four Shows. <br /> <br /> Unlike most modern sci-fi shows (including the two new Star Trek series), this show can be fun without having to feed MST3K.
