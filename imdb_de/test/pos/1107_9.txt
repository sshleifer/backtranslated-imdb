UK-born Australian helper Alex Frayne is attracting attention with his strange, attentive reading and visually stunning Modern Love (2006). If you follow the steps of a man who is unable to control a drastic personality change triggered by the death of a nearby relative image, this provides a fascinating exploration of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. <br /> <br /> John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small town in the south to look after the deceased uncle (Don Barker) Property. While Emily and Edward check in at a nearby hotel, John begins questioning the locals after Uncle Tom's death. Confused, John imagines his own theory - Uncle Tom is healthy and hiding in the nearby bushes. <br /> <br /> If occasional dialogues were not used to lessen its heavy atmospheric tone, Modern Love might do so were easily mistaken for a Sokurov movie. Stained with a 16mm camera, the color scheme is strangely reminiscent of the Russian director's reflection on human agony. Perhaps it is no coincidence that Modern Love premiered at the Moscow International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> However, the look below the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals shows a different picture. Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to the point where they intentionally separate the main actors from their surroundings by blurring everything into a big splash of favorite yellow director. John's gradual psychological transformation depends on it, and as the story progresses, it becomes apparent that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. In Sokurov's The Second Circle, a young man returns to Russia to bury his deceased father. In the hut where the old man used to live, everything is covered with dust. He collects the few old clothes and puts the body of his father in a coffin. Then he says goodbye and buries it. The rest of the film is a lengthy reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction that many have dealt with. <br /> <br /> Love is a bit ironic in modern love. On the contrary, it is pain, loneliness and dissatisfaction with the "modern" that suddenly enters John's life. Unlike The Second Circle, however, the main actor has the opportunity to rediscover his modern life. His wife and son are waiting for him, but he leaves. Slowly but surely, the present is crumbling under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. <br /> <br /> I doubt that Frayne intended Modern Love to have the striking resemblance to Sokurov's in the Second Circle. However, the pace and, above all, the enigmatic framing make this film an almost meditative experience - a difficult and enormously brittle way of deconstructing the human psychology that the two directors master to perfection. Mark Constable offers a first-rate performance as John is his most extreme challenging character gives even more depth. His facial expressions are excellent. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger are a perfect match for her tense visual style.
