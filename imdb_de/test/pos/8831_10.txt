Duck_of_Death has to watch this movie again because his main criticism is completely groundless. The film has never forgotten the time delay and has been explicitly mentioned in some places. The crew was never shown to have talks with mission control who did not comply with the time-delay rules. <br /> <br /> One thing I thought was far-fetched was the amount of risk - would a crew land on a planet where pressure suits would only take two hours? I doubt that. Would a manned spacecraft go into the corona of a star? I doubt that. Would people land on a moon that was bombarded with huge amounts of radiation? I doubt that. The ship, too, seemed overly robust. Would a ship that was constructed risk an atmospheric flight to slow it down? I doubt that. Would it survive being hit by comet remnants? I doubt it. I think that in both cases the burden on the structure would be too great. All in all, the unlikely scenarios were compensated for by some well-made special effects, good editing and production, and a good acting performance, especially by the actors of the ship's commander and the Russian cosmonaut.
