Although it may seem a bit bizarre when a 32-year-old woman plays the role of a 12-year-old, Mary Pickford soon lets the disagreements go by and just enjoys the fun. <br /> <br /> Mary is a street kid in New York City, with her own adorable gang of nonsenseers, whose attention the older William Haines employs (he was 25 at the time and was just on the edge of his own screen.) <br / > <br /> Too much of the act would not be fair. Suffice it to be Mary's great fun to watch and show why she was Hollywood's first and most popular superstar. The production values ​​are very good, with many extras, the street scenes in NYC are quite believable.
