The movie begins with the promise, as there are more interactions between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows down the pace considerably. Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas shows a very strong performance in his early scenes. If left behind on the river boat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man and asks for help and is repeatedly rejected, the viewer really wonders if this is a comedy or not. Seeing a children's party through a picket fence is another moving moment. As another reviewer mentioned, I was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken bones! Once spanky and buckwheat are at home in Marshall Valiant, Spanky tends to interact primarily with the adults, and the children's chemistry is essentially lost. <br /> <br /> The Old South / Huck Finn guy does not play much for the plot, except that the kids can be out there a lot. Ralph Morgan is the most dedicated adult, but then the other roles really do not have much substance. Louise Beavers creates some fun moments with a Yankee soldier towards the end. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are not really rogue enough and the lovers are not intense enough. But I think it's worth it to see if you're a Our Gang enthusiast, if for no other reason the strange curiosity of the whole piece. I give him seven stars because, though not a great movie, I was busy all the time, curious as to what would happen next.
