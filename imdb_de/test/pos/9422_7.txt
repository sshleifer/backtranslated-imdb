From 1942, the portrayed by Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes figure was used in the then "modern" Britain. Many Holmes purists have praised the first two entries of the series (produced by FOX), but rejected the 12 following features. I have never been an avid reader, and so I appreciate these films because they are without initial prejudice. In fact, the scene of World War II for this entry represents a part of the period in which British propaganda can be seen throughout the film. The execution of modern Holmes is treated with much more care than the previous entry (Sherlock Holmes and the voice of horror) and is much cheaper for two reasons. Firstly, Roy William Neil is in charge (and would be for the remainder of the series), and secondly, although Holmes is against the Nazis, the inclusion of Professor Moriarty feels more like a battle of intellect between two rivals. The performance of Lionel Atwill has been criticized by many critics who were far inferior to those of George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but I feel it's more the script than the character interpretation. Especially after seeing that Atwill could be much more versatile and enthusiastic in other horror roles. Basil Rathbone, on the other hand, is exceptional in this post. He seems to be enjoying himself in the role of Holmes, but I blame writing on that. For example, the introduction of Holmes in the Voice of Terror seeks to instantly see how superiorly intelligent Holmes is once he's on the screen, while this film shows Holmes' brilliant deductions as well as his shortcomings. Even at its peak, Holmes initially has the upper hand, only then slowly let his blood flow out of his body. Now there are a few bugs in this movie that I thought I could point out. First, the opening; Are not the Germans too easily deceived? Maybe it's just me, but the book seller just rolls over to the bar. He says he'll make Tobel, after weeks of hide-and-seek, not just answer his door, but allow him to come in and then take him for a walk? What!? Second, Tobel seems to endanger everyone around him. Leaving the secret bombings with ingenious scientists. Leave the note with his fiancee. What did he think? He endangered them all. I thought he was a great scientist who wanted to save England? And is not the whole concept of "applying it to them before they apply it to us" a bit hard. Obvious propaganda. Third, how, in God's name, should Holmes fit under that breast? It is really small! In fact, the whole execution of Holmes, which Moriarty finds in the ex-con disguise, really does not explain so well. I've seen this movie over fifty times, and there are still parts that I find to be very confusing. Fourth, okay, so Holmes finds out that the first three scientists are dead, and immediately assumes that Moriarty could not know the name of the fourth man because he was not dead yet. If Holmes did not know the name, how could he suspect it? The guy could have been lying very well in a lake. Fluke. Fifth, again with the confusion. If Holmes is supposed to die on Moriarty's operating table, how can he recover so quickly? He certainly acted as if he had lost a few liters of blood, but not enough to keep him from saving the day. Despite these shortcomings, this movie is very entertaining. The disguises are well done, the puzzle of the dancing men is well done (in particular the scenes of Holmes and Moriarty, who each find out they have reworked them) and Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade is always a plus. As a final comment, the query scene still bothers me. I always thought that this is one of the best-made sequences in the entire movie. Overall, this film has a special status with me, since he has consolidated my Rathbone as Holmes obsession. A classic. 10.7.
