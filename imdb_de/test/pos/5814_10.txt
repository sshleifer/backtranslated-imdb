I would recommend it to anyone who admires the late John Cassavetes. And for those who have never known of Cassavetes. It's an excellent movie. I really do not have time to go into details of why this is in my opinion, but if you are looking for something brave, with many scenes to think about, then this is for you. Cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film as well as the story itself. This "review" does not do the movie justice. It's an experience that you have to see for yourself. MUCH CHARACTER. Very real.
