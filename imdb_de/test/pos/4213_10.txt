I must have been around ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to watch this martial arts film at DRIVE IN on the Long Beach Circuit. The title was "HAMMER OF GOD", which I can never forget, but what I remember are the different scenes that forever mark me. <br /> <br /> My brother always reminds me Although the movie was forever, it seems since we saw the movie. From time to time, I would look for the years in the rental shops and occasionally check the Internet, and for some reason it seems like it's never available or nobody knows what movie I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If only I knew if and if it was available, I would like to buy this movie. If anyone knows of its availability, please let me know.
