This movie worked for me because I see this movie as the exact opposite of Gone with the Wind. Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and understands what she wants; Ada gets depressed and turns around until Ruby (Renee Zellweger) arrives to save the day. Somehow in a way. Deserters instead of officers trying to return to their families, the lists go on and on. Even the love story was the opposite. If that was what the producer and the authors were trying to convey, it was a success for me. <br /> <br /> There are only two things I did not like about the film, the rest that I thought was good, and I liked enough to recommend it to friends. First, I could not consider the attraction between Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) to be strong enough for Inman to rely on to return to her. Inman said he only wrote her a few times where Ada almost always wrote to him. Second, something or someone who was killed or died in almost every scene was a bit much. I have to say it was full of action, but after about the second scene I knew something or someone would die in the next scene. I like being surprised by the next scene, not knowing what's going to happen before it happens. She earned the credit she got for it. I thought she played the role of the hillbilly girl very well. She must have done her homework. Zellweger even said in the film that she was smarter than people thought. I think that was true. Law did his thing with everything he had to go through to get back to Kidman. It must have been a much stronger love to go through all this than I thought. Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his exams. Kidman's part might have something to do with me choosing her performance after the other two. Except when she was depressed, she did not show much emotion. I do not know if the part was written that way or if it was so perceived by the part. She still did a good job, I just thought the other two would be better. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene with the Zellweger, Kidman and the Rooster, although it was one of the above scenes. I thought the 'Home Guard' was just like it was then. Although we do not hear much from them, they were part of that time. I found the landscape beautiful. The film had everything to be a good historical romance.
