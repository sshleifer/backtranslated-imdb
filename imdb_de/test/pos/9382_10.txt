Seeing "The Bed That Eats" is like waking up in the hospital, two days to see suicide, <br /> <br /> watch, disorienting but strangely stimulating. This disturbing but often humorous lesson in mythology, morality and surrealist ideology offers few cinematic equivalents. Cocteau's "Blood of a Poet" and Maya Deren's experimental work evoke a taste of the strange atmosphere in DEATH BED. A close comparison is the dark fairy tales of adults by literary genius author Angela Carter, the short disturbing stories of Unica. <br /> <br /> Zurn or E.T.A. Hoffman <br /> <br /> DEATH BED has many identifiable elements of the past of <br /> <br /> but shows a totally unique and original plot. <br /> <br /> As a story, DEATH BED is an amazingly simple yet original vision that can only reach a thousand independent releases. This unobtrusive film has its technical flaws, but overcomes them all with a cast of beautiful non-actors and lost creepy locales - a true independent classic of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED also shows a unique, subversive, 3-dimensional personality - a deep and continuous layering of dream images and ideas that give it a kind of "fun house" construction. The passage of time betrayed in flashbacks and historical time travels, the bed with its eerie black humor, the rich but unobtrusive symbolism used in its imagery. Most enjoyable is the image of Aubrey Beardsly, the suffering artist who is forever trapped in his own painting as he comments on and caresses the murdered sacrificial offerings given to him as a love sacrifice to the spirit of the bed. - A sick refrain and a wonderful element / metaphor for the "trapped artist" - Nothing but the strangest thing in POE or MALLARME can match that. Anyone who appreciates the spirit of independent cinema and longs for multifaceted symbolist experience or longs for the surrealistic concept of "spasmodic beauty" and gothic horror inclinations Producing low-budget films will unearth this totally unique vision. A simple and funny movie with wonderfully deep psychic currents. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. *****
