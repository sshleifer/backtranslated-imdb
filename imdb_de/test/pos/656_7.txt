This is an interesting, hard-to-find film from the early '70s, starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man in the lead role who does not cut as a Marine. Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them when they are sent home, the failed recruits are taken away. Vincent stops at a bar and meets a very young Richard Gere, who has just returned from a Pacific tour as a hardcore naval raider. Gere's character is already dull and considered desertion. He takes advantage of Vincent's innocence and steals his 'baby blue' uniform after he drunk and hit him in an alley. Vincent's character, whose name is Marion, takes Gere's outfit and suddenly turns into a Marine 'Raider'. Marion tramples on Wyoming and stops in a small, Norman Rockwell town. At the local caf√© he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches the eye. Marion attracts the attention of the townspeople from Hudkins' parents. Mr. Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a naval raider could be so innocent. The story also appeals to the Japanese internment camps, while the city's residents make 3 escape hunts. Marion is accidentally shot during this hunt. But there is still a happy ending that confused me a bit. I would have liked a bit more drama! Anyway, this is JMV at the height of its 70s. By the mid-70s, BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER were amazingly good JMV performances. He was both action star and palpitation at the same time !!! He has made many quality films throughout his career and continued this until the mid-80s with the great television program Airwolf. He does this very well as a hedge and quietly watches people treat him (in his uniform) on his journey through the country. He must also have done some of the stunt work - at the end of the film there is a shattering river scene - and it looks like he's going to be the guy thrown down the river! But at the height of its popularity, this movie could have accomplished much more with JMV's talent and looks. Innocence can only be so interesting. Evil is much more dramatic, as described in "Buster and Billie"! Anyway, Glynnis O'Connor is adorable as a rose. The whole look of the film is like a painting by Norman Rockwell. The outdoor shots are beautiful - they must have been filmed in Canada.
