Back then I was 19 or 20 years old and I lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I still remember the new Dome Theater, the 21st Century Century Screen and the fully populated theater. We were thrilled with a new preview of a movie. Ta da da da da da da dada dada ... I can still hear the opening music trumpet ringing and pelvis crash. I loved the interaction of characters and the filmed prospects. I know that Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some problems with the lip sink, but hey, that was a good feeling. What I regret is the way they cut out the meaningful heart, showed the cut version and then called it a flop. I have seen the cut version and can see that she has lost the vision of the vision she had in the preview edition. Yes, I cringe at Peter's efforts to love through music, but, I did not see it that way when I left the theater. If you examine us when leaving, I regret any comment that has changed the original. I liked it then and still see it while listening to the music on my LP. Most of my family has heard that I sing a lot of the soundtrack, and I can use the film monologues in our games "What movie is this". I wish a director's cut on DVD would be available. It's available on VHS, but it's not quite the same thing. I would especially like to wish a complete, earnest commentary by Lord of the Rings on its origins, struggles and achievements. Picky people should leave things alone enough. Bring it back !!!!
