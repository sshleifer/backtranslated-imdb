It seems to me that many people do not know that Blade is actually a superhero movie that resembles X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the like. All these heroes (and in the case of the X-Men Hero Group) have in common that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who had hunted vampires for a personal grudge and eventually faced Dracula himself and was bored for lack of a better word. So boring indeed that the character was no longer used in the Marvel Universe. At least until he was reinvented. <br /> <br /> David Goyer made a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather dark knight. He can not accept all of this, and much of it has to go to Stephen Norrington, who creates the best of character with his distinctive visual style. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is quite amazing in this movie, mixing martial arts with Batman like the Dark. Snipes is pretty good as a title character and expresses the figure's duality and inner demons. However, he is a fairly rigid actor both in terms of voice and posture, and is interesting enough for just one movie (which is clearly evident in the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson is also good and awakens Whistler's agonizing character with energy and sense of timing to life. N'Bushe Wright, however, is pretty weak as a senior lady and makes her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a secondary character. The German, Udo Kier, should also be mentioned as he gives the vampire race a lot of finesse and style, probably because of his experiences with Dracula. Stephen Village offers the best drama in the movie and its horrible performance, because Deacon Frost is considered one of the best screen villains I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story is good and the vampire is in my opinion renewed genre (something that has not been done since Dusk Till Dawn since Robert Rodrigues) by adding many contemporary elements and maintaining the comic feel , To say that the film has a comic feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. Much effort has gone into making the film as real as possible. Including the effects that are pretty good for their time. I found the vampire dust very nice. Instead of inflicting much blood when a vampire dies, Norrington has decided to let the vampires melt spontaneously, which looks great. The fact that the overall effects were done well adds credibility to the film, which otherwise would have been flat. As mentioned earlier, Norrington has a very different visual style that sets him apart from the other directors of the following Blade movies. Del Toro is almost as skilled, but I prefer the style of Norrington. His style gives the film a very special look and feel, but above all, it gives the film atmosphere. A very tense, dark atmosphere that fits perfectly with the main character and story. Along with the visual style, the music also works well and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, Blade is a very entertaining movie that would probably have an 8 of mine, but a few annoying bugs (which can not be masked without spoiling the movie are enough to say that many of them are close to the end of the film): The film has to settle for a high score of 7. <br /> 10
