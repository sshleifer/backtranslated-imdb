I loved this show but I can not remember ever having loved anything, starting with "Americanization of Emily". A city sheriff who keeps trying to blindly steal the city and travel to Mexico, I have to love it. Like everything he does, it has a tongue-like cheek taste called the Garner product. James plays the same character in many of his shows and films, but somehow he never fades. <br /> <br /> P.S. re: Killing the main character <br /> <br /> If I recall correctly, the "good" brother was killed and replaced by the "evil" twin to increase the ratings, ie. H .; Do it anytime on TV like any other western. I think this show was too far ahead of its time and I still miss it. TV without Jimmy G show is missing something.
