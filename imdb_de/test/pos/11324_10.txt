I just wanted to say that my favorite TV show was night the night I was young. I loved the characters and the plot of the show. I thought that it was an excellent show and is still going on today. I like to watch the repeats and I'm a big fan. I love the way the characters play each other out. I would always stay up late and see my favorite show with my mother, who was also a big fan. Now I can watch my show again and listen to the title song. What I thought was a cool song for the show. My favorite characters were Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott.
