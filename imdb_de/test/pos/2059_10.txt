This movie is a great action and comedy, it's from the beginning, there is no boring build up. The chemistry of the lead roles adds to the excitement and expectation of the end, even though my suspicions were not satisfied. The special effects worked perfectly and were believable! I would have liked another end, but I still had emotions. The plot is going well, but it's a movie that you have to watch carefully from start to finish to capture, fully understand, and maximize all the details. <br /> <br />
