30 years after the original movie, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" was reworked as a musical. Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke played in this wonderful remake of the beloved schoolteacher Chippington, whom his beloved wife calls chips. O'Toole was honored here and received another Oscar nomination. One has to wonder what Peter O'Toole has to do to win an Oscar. He has now lost the coveted award eight times. You must also wonder that he lost to John Wayne in 1969 for "True Grit," which was a testament to his long career and popularity. This year was also marked by great performances by Richard Burton, "Anne of the Thousand Days", as well as Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight for "Midnight Cowboy". Petula Clarke was surprised as Mrs. Chippington. However, since this was a musical, a beautiful voice came into its own and it also played a nice part. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the scene, when chips go on despite the news he plays in class? Mistress was killed in a bomb attack. He could never tell her the wonderful news of his upcoming promotion. <br /> <br /> The wonderful camera and music only enhanced an unforgettable experience.
