How his charter developed as a human and a monkey was excellent. Not to mention the scenery of the film. Christopher Lambert was amazing as Lord of Greystoke. Christopher is the soul of this masterpiece. I was so fascinated with his performance that I felt my heart pound. The entirety of the film still moves me today. His portrayal of John was worthy of Oscar; how he should have been nominated.
