First of all, I would like to say that it is a refreshing start to see a British drama that finally looks and feels credible. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart plays the role of (Ian Hood), the government's science adviser, with his constant and unwavering views on authority and thought about the future of "real" science and how he feels about others be used or misused. <br /> <br /> Not only is the casting thoroughly sustained throughout the series, but the characters are more credible than most other British dramas. <br /> <br /> Ashley Jensen also delivers a first-class performance as a dr. Hood's appointed bodyguard (Rachael Young). It brings a refreshing view of the unscientific, uninterested everyday views of science and their constant struggle with Hood. Some very funny and memorable moments between them. <br /> <br /> The way the series makes all the scientific elements more realistic is something I find more positive and appealing than the psychobabble we are used to in other fiction or science fiction television series. <br /> <br /> However, there are remarkable disappointments with the series. Every time an episode ends, I am disappointed that they did not cover all aspects of the plot and sometimes left open stories. <br /> <br /> Although this is still the first series, I hope that in the near future we will see a return to form where these open stories can finally draw an important conclusion that they deserve. <br /> <br /> For those who prefer slower scientific storylines, this is the ideal show, as it always manages to remain credible and important.
