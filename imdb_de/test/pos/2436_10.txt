I almost missed it. When I visited friends in Philadelphia in the early eighties, I surfed the canal after everybody else had gone to bed. It was not just Bogart he was obsessed with; Rather, the whole era of those old flicks that my age group knows so well is good. Add to this an action that is comparable to the Maltese Falcon - where so many different characters interacted with Sacchi - and you have, as far as I'm concerned, a work of art. About ten years later it appeared on television and I recorded it. >
