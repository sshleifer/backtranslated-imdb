It was Showtime the other day and I thought it would be another video crap festival like Earth vs. the Spider or one of the other HBO horror shorts. Instead, I found a comedy / gore classic. It was justifiably funny and surprisingly the acting was pretty good. Even my wife, a total horror hater, agreed and laughed at parts. Besides, the FX were of high quality. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie felt like a parody of Joy Ride / Jeepers Creepers, and the two main characters reminded me of the pair of Shaun of the Dead. Definitely worth a look, but do not take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The end.
