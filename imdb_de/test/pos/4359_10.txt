We see in the beginning of Little Dieter must fly - Dieter Dengler, the theme of the film is a compulsion. At least it seems to be by constantly opening / closing doors and having a large supply of groceries in the basement. Director Werner Herzog is sort of a central question why Dieter is like that. In fact, he is not necessarily compulsive because he is simply well prepared. And why should not he be after the life he lived? Apart from the juiciest, darkest and most exciting and frightening and downright haunting survival story that is at the heart of the picture, Dieter's backstory is also fascinating. Dieter's own childhood, for example, was an attraction right from the start when he was in post-war Germany, was poor in a family without much food or prospects, and had wallpaper for "the blue in the walls". But enter into a passion, a relentless desire (which, of course, belongs to Herzog's bread and butter and the love of man in his films) that flies, and for Dieter there was nothing else to do but fulfill it. What comes next, after becoming an American citizen, is more than he expected. Dieter is one of Herzog's most persuasive, quirky, and compassionate personalities in his entire career, a man whose memory of brutal memories of his time as a Vietnamese prisoner of war is drawn is at least one of the most exciting storytelling stories of all the documentary films of the last 20 years. Ironically, unlike in The Wild Blue Yonder, storytelling is usually featured in many, many dozen portrayals of some of the most minute details of his time in the various detention centers (torture tactics, beetles, brutal, miserable) violence and threats Wedding rings), and lead with his best friend Duane in the most interesting and sad parts. They escaped the prisons together, but found that their trip to Cambodia would not be easy. Well, most of it makes talking something that is intriguing, namely that Dieter goes through his stories and occasionally makes adjustments (in fashion, Herzog could only, with Dieter being handcuffed in middle age) through the jungle) you can imagine it all in your head. It becomes all the more vivid to try to combine these small details and their intensity into a form of reality. That Herzog keeps these parts simple and knows when to hold Dieter back in his answers makes him even more a key figure of interest. He's not always "normal," but unlike a Timothy Treadwell, you'll never think about laughing at him. <br /> <br /> So, along with his hero (whether war or not, is hard to say.) While Dieter denies the contention that the deceased are the true heroes (typical, but perhaps quite true), Herzog stylized his film with a mix of old footage when describing Dieter's early life (the historical footage of the scenes of World War II and German rubble) is always a captivating sight, and with Duke he rises a bit in terms of timing and assemblage with music ) and recording Vietnamese footage in aerial photos of jungles and fields. Duke is also very wise if he does not bring politics so heavily into the process, there is no "I was used by the Americans" or whatever was thrown into the mix. There's even the feeling that with all that has happened to him, Dieter does not have that much grudge, that's exactly what happens in wartime (and of course it was that he dropped bombs on people off his plane ). Well, through many of these horrors - and even in the smaller areas that have been going on in prisons, bathrooms, and leftovers - it's always harrowing - luckily, Herzog also keeps a degree of humor under control. One of my favorite scenes in the film, in which Herzog breaks away from Dieter for a moment, is when he shows a "Trainee" movie for American soldiers to show what should happen if left alone in the jungle. .. with all the equipment they could possibly have, including a knife, a flare gun and a very fast helicopter to come by (and this will turn into weird deadpan voiceover work). <br /> <br /> But even the moments of laughter remind only of moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis, and how one can never really imagine what it is like to be alone in a foreign territory to be surrounded by people who do something to keep this person safe in wartime. Aside from the knowledge that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever have (and Herzog finishes the movie with a wonderfully bleak, elegiac touch flying over a large airfield), he knows what to expect survive at all costs. But just as in many films driven by Herzog's protagonists, there is the almost unchanging spirit that persists even when one is strong enough, even through terrible moments (the fate of Dunae) and problems to the rescue of the helicopter (he is American or a spy, ask the helicopter). Dieter is such a man with a ghost and he has given a terrific, tragic, creative, well-shot, though too short, tribute to his life through Herzog. And of course, it pumps me even more for the upcoming dramatization of Rescue Dawn.
