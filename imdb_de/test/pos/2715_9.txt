Comeundone, I love you! I could not have a better conclusion than you can find about this movie and its end. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know it too well; They will hate it. But this time, I saw it alone and found that it really affected me. Although the film is long, I was bound to history and excited about the end. At first I thought it was weird how she had just disappeared, but in a way that makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> But as comeundone said, this movie makes no sense of reality. Instead, it challenges the viewer and the viewer to think hard about what the word "normal" means. It also gives you the insight to personally think about what the end means. I can say that I loved it, and I am glad for Mithi.
