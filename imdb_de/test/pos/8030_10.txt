I'm a big fan of the spy and this is one of the best of these movies. The mission is based on a true story that has been embellished for the big screen and really makes it a fun ride. The film has a great cast, with Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br /> Naval officer Quinn is recruited by Sutherland after a fortuitous meeting with Kingsley, who believes that Quinn is the famous terrorist Carlos, reluctant to recruit Jackal. Because Quinn resembles Carlos so much, Sutherland does not stop at nothing to recruit him because Sutherland is obsessed with the capture or death of the terrorist. <br /> <br /> The training sequences are fantastic. Quinn is being put to the test by Kingsley and Sutherland as he has to withstand attacks from remote-controlled snowmobiles, from eating the same food daily to a hallucinogenic drug. He even has to learn how to love a woman as Carlos would have done. <br /> <br /> The film has some great action scenes in which Quinn eludes allies because they think he is Carlos and in his last mission, if he is to kill the jackal fight with the new personality he has achieved against his own. Does he remain merciless and free like Carlos or does he return to the life of a good man and father? <br /> <br /> If you like the genre spy, this is a must. The action only serves to advance the story of this thriller; no unnecessary explosions or fight scenes. Rating 10 out of 10 stars.
