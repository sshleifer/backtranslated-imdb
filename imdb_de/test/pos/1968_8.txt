Fair and nimble little science fiction / horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), whose latest game - "eXistenZ" not only attracts the attention of people who volunteer the game but also who almost kills her (and also her game). Forced to lose sight of herself, Allegra remains with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing trainee ("PR nerd") who is her bodyguard, even though he has only one weapon made of flesh and bone Bones and the balls are teeth. Director David Cronenberg has used some pieces from his earlier films ("Videodrome", "Scanner", "The Fly", etc.) and inserted them into certain parts of the story with good timing. Law and Leigh are fine here, and some of the other visitors (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston, etc.) have an international twist. Dafoe is anything but devilish as Gas, a fraudulent repair shop mechanic. In one of the best scenes of the film, Wed witnesses how Ted (fish and frogs) eats and builds a weapon and admits Allegra - "I can not help myself." "eXistenZ" shows that he (Cronenberg) is up to his old tricks and still looks like a charm.
