What is the most violent film of all time? Rambo III? Command? Robocop? Add these three very violent units, and you will not be able to compensate for the carnage in The Stabilizer, the wildest, dumbest, craziest action movie I've ever seen. Things go on for a hundred minutes and people die in dozens of strange ways. It will make you laugh and cheer, and when it's all over you're more than a little tired. This movie is a buried gem, a cult classic that unfortunately lacks cult. <br /> <br /> The stabilizer is the nickname of our hero Peter Goldson (Peter O'Brian), a tall, oily man with a curly mullet. He follows in the footsteps of the villain and Greg Rainmaker in Indonesia. We know that he is evil because he is only called by his full name ("I hate SCUM like Greg RAINmaker!") And use a killing method that is so terrible that I can not even voice it here. Wait, yes I can. He steps on people in spiky shoes. Greg Rainmaker: Cleat Killer. <br /> <br /> If Greg Rainmaker does not add alcohol to women for their sexual pleasure, he abducts important professors and leads a huge underworld empire. It's up to Goldson (a Jewish action hero, Gevalt!) And his colorful crew from Sidekicks to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and blowing up a lot of stuff. Perhaps "stabilizing" in Indonesia has another meaning. <br /> <br /> And the violence, oh the violence. This is a movie that is unwilling, no, not able to pass five minutes of screen time without any kind of explosion, knife, car accident or squib interrupting the dialogue. The violence is extreme; not graphic and bloody, just really weird. For example, The Stabilizer & Company invades one of Rainmaker's warehouses (naturally through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle). When the stabilizer sits on the balcony and a heavy fire comes from below, he does what he can do. He drives from the balcony into the guy's head, his front tire bouncing off like a basketball. Amazing. <br /> <br /> Of the excessively free love scenes (the two tall female characters do not jump with the hero of their choice two minutes after talking to them alone for the first time) to the poorly dubbed dialogue ("Victor, du talented bastard! ") The stabilizer has everything. This is a movie for eternity, topped with Citizen Kane and Gymkata. It is not widely available in the publication. If you find it somewhere for any price, buy it and enjoy the madness. <br /> <br />
