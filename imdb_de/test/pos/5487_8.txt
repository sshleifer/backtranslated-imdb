Back when I was working, I remember that I had a really disgusting customer to deal with, who insisted on doing everything on a personal basis. I told him things that my agency could and could not do, and he firmly believed that I was personally out to make him out of what was rightfully his. I swear, but I thought of this guy as I watched John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their fight of jokes. <br /> <br /> In The Line Of Fire, Clint Eastwood throws an experienced intelligence agent who was at work in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Since then he had doubts and was drenched, and his life was a real mess at one time. He has now gone back to the White House details, and when the landlady of a potential assassin invites her tenant to the Secret Service, Eastwood and its partner Dylan McDermott draw the case. He is a professional in his job, trained and deployed by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich received a deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to The Fugitive to Tommy Lee Jones this year and I'm not sure, but I thought Malkovich would be better. Oddly enough, Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as an agent. The person in charge broke into his apartment during his working hours and insisted on doing it all in person. He calls and ridicules Eastwood throughout the movie. And after a while, what Malkovich says and does, makes Clint really personal. <br /> <br /> The presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs, unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the murders. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with real or imaginary resentment, is the most dangerous kind of enemy. <br /> <br /> Others to note in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as Chief of Staff of the White House (and would do so) to be president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent working for the masculine charm from Eastwood, John Mahoney as head of the Secret Service, Gary Cole as the White House intelligence chief, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent, and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as president and first lady. <br /> <br /> But when Malkovich is around, he owns In The Line of Fire. The highlight with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.
