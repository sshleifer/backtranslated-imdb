This is a fairly faithful adaptation of Masuji Ibuses novel Black Rain. Like the book, it is very moving and thought-provoking. The story revolves around a couple's attempts to see his niece successfully married. They have trouble finding applicants because they have a rumor that they are suffering from radiation sickness after leaving Hiroshima on the day of the bombing. Well filmed, well played, moving, tragic, frightening and funny.
