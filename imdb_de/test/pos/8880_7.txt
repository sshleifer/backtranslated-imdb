I'm surprised people, after such bad movies were in the top 250 or just in the 7.0s, I thought more people would kick "Momma from the Train". This was a great comedy by two great comedians, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a great duo of madness and obsession. Billy is a man who has just lost his million-dollar history to his ex-wife, repeatedly wishing she was dead. Danny has a crazy and senile old mother who just abuses him. When Billy gives Danny a "misunderstood" advice, Danny offers a suggestion. If he kills his former wife, Billy must kill his mother. This is a crazy and funny story that can always be laughed well. Please sit back and enjoy this movie, folks! It is a good one! <br /> <br /> 7/10
