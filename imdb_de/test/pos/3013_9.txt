It must be said that the director of The Cell, Tarsem Singh, has become quite well established with his first feature film, considered one of the most visually stunning films in contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a movie. As a thriller, he rises above most of his peers, competent editing and a terrifying score make for an exceptionally exciting atmosphere. However, it is Tarsem's fate for sophisticated and disturbing sets and images that bring the jolting feel of the horror of the film. <br /> <br /> As with some other films, I was shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who did so, negatively commenting on The Cell; To defend the film, I will address some of these issues. The plot seems to be the main concern, and although it is not revolutionary and borrowed heavily from the silence of the lambs, it should never be the most important aspect of the film. The storyline itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision is presented to the public, both frighteningly and wondrously, much as the storyline of The Silence of the Lambs is subordinated to the intriguing study of its two protagonists. Lecturer and star. While The Silence of the Lambs is clearly the superior film, it is irrational for humans to condemn the conspiracy of the cell, and praises in the same breath that of The Silence of the Lambs. <br /> <br /> My final concern is the mention of "MTV Style" director. It hurts me to see the condemnation of directors using innovative camera and film techniques. A camera can be much more than a tool for recording events. Angle, panning, color matching, etc. are used in The Cell to the fullest extent to create a sense of dream-like state that otherwise would not have been possible. This is essential to the film, since the entire premise behind it is the visualization of the subconscious of a serial killer. If you just want a bunch of static shots, stay tuned and let the movie go. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, The Cell is absolutely entertaining, scary and breathtaking in terms of both speed and design. Anyone who can stop by the - perhaps unimaginative, but never boring - screenplay will find one of the best films of the year 2000.
