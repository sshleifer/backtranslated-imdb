I thought this was a really great movie, especially because it was just a filler for me. I was bored, I got it from the library and it was really fun! I've seen it twice in the two days and the more I see it, the more I like it. I thought that the conspiracy would really go crazy, but in the end you could really say it was true. I liked the main characters and thought they were well staffed and you could see real friendship. I thought that they all did a great job. The end was good. And you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys. That's the way a movie should be.
