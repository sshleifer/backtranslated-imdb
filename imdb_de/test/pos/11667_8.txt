"It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human." At St. Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans, "Dead Man Walking" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a Louisiana nun who became friends with Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a murderer and a rapist who was hired for a deadly injection machine for killing a teenage couple? Sister Helen agrees to help the condemned man and stay with him until the end. An act that has never been attempted by a woman. <br /> <br /> At her first meeting, Poncelet swears the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both children and asks them for help in a new process to convince the hearing of the pardon board of his life to spare? <br /> <br /> The film urges the public to reflect on the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives the angry bereaved a voice whose children were shot, stabbed, raped, and dying in the woods alone ?? <br /> <br /> As Poncelet's execution draws nearer, is his character perceived as deceptively complex and doubts the accuracy of what they did to him? One moment we hear him being asked sensitively to a polygraph test to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him angrily playing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, black people, and children , that you are here? Poncelet has never understood that he robbed the Percys and the Delacroixs so much and gave them nothing but grief. You will never see their children again, never hold, they love, laugh with them? <br /> <br /> In the scenes before his execution, the prisoner on death row drops his horrible facade and reveals his identity. Fortunately, both Sarandon and Penn are exceptional here. They successfully perform an exquisite, tangible harmony of souls. When Sarandon looked at Penn, she projected merciful eyes full of tears. She asks him to visualize her while he dies? I want the last thing you see in this world to be a face of love. At that moment, we truly believed that she would be the face of love for him.
