This is a television movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid-1970s. How much of the truth is hard to say is hard to say. That's for sure. It is based on the book that Mark Fuhrman wrote The Crime in Flashbacks and Its Consequences, including the arrest of a suspect, about 25 years later, who was never considered a suspect at the time. In the film, of course, Fuhram is largely responsible for the arrest and closure of the case for Martha's surviving family, especially her mother. The narrative of the film comes from the mind of Martha Moxley, who converses in the first person. This is a very effective device in this movie. For me it adds more influence to the movie a human face on the murder victim (if only an actress plays the part) Maggie Grazie plays Martha, and I was really impressed with her. There is no way to know the motive of Mark Fuhrman in investigating the crime of a sense of justice, and perhaps he really cared. Or maybe he's just a dollar sign from a future bestselling book. In any case, it's an interesting movie. It is well played and pretty fast. I do not think there were many extra unnecessary things in the movie, just what was needed. Tell the story. One could argue that they have omitted things that would have brought a little more light into the process, and you would be right. You could also argue that the end was abrupt and you were right again. But as I said, for me, I believe that they have told the story with at least the most essential things. Everything else would probably have needed a miniseries. Incidentally, there is a mini-series entitled "A Season in Purgatory," which appeared 6 years earlier (1996), to which this film has some parallels, even if he just faints. However, if you like this movie, "you may be interested in" A Season in Purgatory. "I believe that" a season at the Purgatory "is actually a fictionalized account of the same crime, anyway, murder in Greenwich is an 8/10 for me
