Felix watches as an actor repeats his lines: "A ham, a ham! My kingdom for a ham sandwich !!!" The dramatic guy who tells Felix to "sacrifice my art and go to the movies". He has tears in his eyes. Felix just looks at him like he's crazy, and shrugs. The old man tells Felix to "go" and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood. Felix thinks, "How does he expect me to get the money?" <br /> <br /> In a few minutes (this is a caricature) he discovers a shoe store owner who offers a "bankruptcy" offer for him business. Felix has a plan to release him, and the man promises the cat $ 500 if it works. <br /> <br /> Well, but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home. In an outrageous scene, Felix turns into a briefcase, and so he comes to Hollywood and turns back into a cat when they get there. <br /> <br /> We will then witness Felix trying to get into the show business. His audition scenes are very funny, especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin. In addition, there are cartoons of some famous silent film stars and executives. Overall, there is a lot of material in this 9.5-minute cartoon. It's amazing how much more you can get in 2.5 minutes, assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes long. <br /> <br /> In any case, there was a lot of laughter here and more crazy things you could do Only in a cartoon to see how Felix has a sword duel with giant mosquitoes! Crazy stuff.
