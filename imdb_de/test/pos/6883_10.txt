It's pretty simple that those who call this movie "decent" do not know their cinema. "The Doll Master" creates a sense of fear and tension that is rarely found in films outside of Asia. <br /> <br /> Think of a mix of "manga" and "ringu" in a movie <br /> <br /> First-rate acting, first-class directing, first-rate sets and effects. <br /> <br /> This is right up there with the best Asian horror movies. Ringu, Dark Water and a story about two sisters. <br /> <br /> An absolute must. <br /> <br /> Take it from a guy who knows his movies.
