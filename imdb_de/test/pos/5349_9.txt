My only problem with The Curse of the Were Rabbit is that the movie does not need the time to introduce Wallace and Gromit to those who are unfamiliar with Park's short films. Strangely enough, "A Close Shave" does this with much less time. Still, I loved seeing the guys back in action, and I loved all the new characters, people, and others. I especially loved Ralph Fienne's voice as the up and coming Victor Quartermaine. It's also interesting to see the series on the big screen. The processing with the clay figures really stands out. It's a scream and great for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs, but I have all Wallace and Gromit and I will gladly add them.
