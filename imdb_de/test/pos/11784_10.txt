Nothing is sacred. Just ask Ernie Fosselius. Nowadays, everyone has a video camera, and a movie has barely come out before the parodies fly, are quickly written and filmed, and often posted directly on the Internet. Spoofs are hot these days, and we make every effort to make sure that filmmakers do not lose their own importance. When the first Star Wars movie came out 25 years ago, it was a different world. Filmmaking was the playground for a select few and parodies were very rare. Then God gave us Hardware Wars. It was filmed to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) And the sound was obviously recorded after that. Does that take the experience away? NO! That's great! It was raw and unpolished and met relentlessly some of the most demanding moments of the original film. From Fluke Starbucker, who waved a flashlight (I did when I was young!) Instead of a lightsaber, to Chewchilla, the Wookie monster, to Auggie Ben Doggies, "just a little headache," remark, this movie short is also part of the phenomenon as one of the current Star Wars movies. Rent it. Buy it. Lend it from a friend. And may the farce be with you. Always.
