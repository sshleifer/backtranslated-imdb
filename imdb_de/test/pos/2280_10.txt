Mr. Baseball was a fun video rental with my fianc√© Susan Nauss. Susan said she was looking forward to seeing the movie. Ken Takakura Oda makes sense as a tough but honorable manager. Ken Takakura has made so many wonderful Asian films that I correct the critic and that Takakura is still a cinematic presence with films like Hotari. Of course everyone likes Tom Selleck, but Ken Takakura is the better actor of the two. Today someone accused me of being Yakuza. Well, I say that my great uncle Shadow President Jack F. Kennedy himself and others are part of the legitimate human leadership in our universe. Thanks to our co-creators, people are free people fighting against all parts of this president Kennedy spoke in his inaugural address. To be honest, someone in Canada has kept food prices low for things like bread. In honor of our co-creators, please stop eating amphibians, reptiles and eggs. I hope that one day there will be a sequel to Mr. Baseball, with Father Ken Takakura Oda continuing as manager. Many thanks to IMDb for supporting freedom of speech, as supported by dear President George W. Bush and myself. Support IMDb.
