The 80's were overrun by all these HALLOWEEN / Friday THE 13TH horror movies, so this is a relief. <br /> <br /> Ten incredibly annoying teenagers (would you like to hang out with these idiots?!) to host a Halloween party at a former former funeral home called "Hull House". During a "past life session," one demon is accidentally released, and everyone is possessed and kills the others. <br /> <br /> It all sounds very evil / demon-ish, but Tenney gives a directional style There are some good one-liners, the music is excellent, the Steve Johnson prosthetic make-up effects are scary and Linnea Quigley is a lot of fun as a young crazy woman who bounces her eyeballs with her fingers and does something amazing with a tube of lipstick! <br /> <br /> Great fun on a very simple level! After reviewing the breakdown of the vote and the other reviews published, I do not understand how it got only 4 out of 10 (?!) Points. <br /> <br /> I give it, 8 out of 10 points.
