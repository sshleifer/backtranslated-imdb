The story is about a working girl (Ann Sothern) who has a rather thoughtless friend (Paul Kelly). This friend is so busy setting up his own business that he keeps forgetting appointments or turns up too late. The last straw is when Sothern's birthday and Kelly says he's too busy to take her to party. Not wanting to stay home, she enters a blind date with a very wealthy young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks fly, but it also becomes clear after Sothern has broken off her relationship with Kelly that new friend Hamilton is a guy who "loves and leaves". How all of this is finally resolved is not difficult to predict - suffice it to say that in the end everything will work out perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a very modest little film from Columbia Pictures - with a relatively small budget and second-tier stars. It is clearly a "B-movie", although Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell played small roles, as both had first become famous. That does NOT mean that these are bad actors or the production is not good. Considering the production values, this is a pretty amazing movie, because everything seems to work so well, although there is a fairly ordinary and reasonably predictable storyline. Actors and directors did a really good job and conveyed the story. In addition, the authors humanized the characters and made them look after them. Especially the end is really cute and my tear ducts were practically flowing! Because of these factors, the movie earns 7 out of 10.
