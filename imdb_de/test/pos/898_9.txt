I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X. Fortunately my hopes have been fulfilled. You have a lot of action, comedy ... stupid comedy and surprises. I think newcomer Edison is really a hit in the movie, but I find Sam's 'alien' really stupid enough to annoy English. Although the film had some shortcomings in robot graphics and stupid dialogue, the action always remains strong. The action setup is much stronger than the first movie. <br /> <br /> This film gives an American feeling, as 60% of the film is in Cantonese. This movie will not disappoint. I recommend it for young people who love pure action. <br /> <br />
