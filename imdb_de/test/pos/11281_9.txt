God cuts himself with a razor, then he gives birth to Mother Earth, who then gives birth through the gods seed, Son of the Earth. <br /> <br /> This is an hour and a half movie that is a dark version of how God created the world. It is surreal, dark and poetic. The most important aspect of the film for me is the look. It was shot in a very grainy black and white film, using both slow motion and normal shots. Sometimes even faster movie and stop motion. The scenes are long and drawn out, which creates a very strange mood. No sound was recorded while filming (I think), sound effects were added, such as criccets, water and other ambient sounds that were repeated over and over again. Since you may understand that this movie is certainly not for the impatient person ... <br /> <br /> I often felt like David Lynch's Eraserhead, only this is even harder to understand and still But that's okay for me, I like stuff like that. It's definitely not entertainment (at least not the Hollywood way). So, if you look, I recommend that you prepare for it. Be open minded and save something like the end of 2001: a space odyssey.
