Check out this great classic movie by Greta Garbo and find a great performance. The German film version with English subtitles, however, was her biggest achievement. Greta Garbo even mentioned to the press that German film was her favorite film, where she had to switch from silent films to sound. Greta had a high voice and had to take lessons to lower her voice for her future roles in movies. This story was very sad, as Greta Garbo (Anna Christie), "Ninotchka" (39), was abused on a farm by little boys and her father had left her years ago as a sailor and then captain of the coal fleet. There were many scenes of Old NYC, the Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and the Manhattan skyline. Charles Bickford (Matt Burke), "Days of Wine & Roses", a classic veteran acted a great supporting role.
