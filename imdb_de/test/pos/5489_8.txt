Wolfgang Peterson's "In the Line of Fire" is torn and occasionally a really white ride, even though we feel once or twice as if we've been on similar roads before. How could you not do it if Clint Eastwood, right after closing (allegedly) the book on his Western legacy, probably closes that on his grainy detective pictures (do not you count Blood Work in it)? But there's more to it than that, because Eastwood's character, here a hardened, demonized and stubborn intelligence agent, has a somewhat charming side, even the more romantic side you've never seen in the pictures splashed his hallmarks. There are some complexities that do not rely solely on the usual boaster, and it is remarkable how a possibly invented backstory (which did not save Kennedy from the assassination in the year 63) is credibly credible among the rest of his person most likely hides his wounds. Eastwood goes to town to get a big presence in the film, and under the circumstances, the character seems tailor-made for him. <br /> <br /> However, there is a risk that his role in the film is marginally conventional (we still get the 'Harry' -like scenes in which he is smarter - and smartie over everyone else in the room and, by the chief blowers, here a chief of staff, insulted and called upon to retire), including here to protect a president whom we (really) never really see or even know. Even the romantic subplot, which is somehow overcooked in a machismo laugh, would make the picture a little inferior if the other quasi-filthy Harry aspect does not come into the picture: an indelible rogue. This time around, there's a bit more Hollywood excitement, but brilliantly intelligent suspense (almost smarter than the rest of the movie deserves it), with the "John Booth" character performing in an Oscar-nominated performance by John Malkovich as someone more likely is called a predator, is played as an assassin. There are ways in which this could go wrong with the character of Eastwood, but Malkovich may outdo some of his former baddies by being extremely cool and un-collected (there is this devastating, scared scene in which he kills the bank employee and their roommate ) And while revealing his past, there is still the element "What the hell is with this guy" that keeps Eastwood audiences and agents guessing and extra paranoid. It's a classic Malkovich performance that is utterly scary through and through and is always judged in the degree of madness and professionalism. <br /> <br /> Apart from the conventional dots, this is just a lithe picture of Peterson and Company close to Don Siegel's spunky pulp realism. But Peterson also has some cinematic tricks up his sleeve that sometimes make me grin; Every time someone makes such a blatant but exciting homage to Vertigos - jumping from roof to roof, the hero from the edge down, the "twist" - there are still a few showers in my back. There are also the phone calls between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game, probably another kick in the ribs of Hithcock. But in spite of all the excitement and the brutal danger and the crisp formalism at its peak, it is, in a sense, also a character image, and everything is pretty much realized, at least in the meantime, to give the audience a lot of thought. Suspense movie Sense. Eastwod is a great head start, Russo plays the sincere and mature female love interest, and Malkovich is at the top of the pops. There are also some notable supporting roles and a good studio score. One of the better films of 1993.
