Fans of Gerry Anderson's productions will spot several UFO actors and vehicles (made after doppelgangers) as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. Barry Gray's excellent music (mostly unique in this film) adds to the feeling of familiarity. I think for all these reasons, every Gerry Anderson fan would be worth the double. <br /> <br /> Simply judged as a movie, you have to say that doppelganger is flawed. It's well known that there were big problems during production, and I suspect that this is a time-consuming plot thread that ends abruptly and does not seem to matter to the rest of the story. Presumably, time and budget restrictions have prevented the emergence of relevance! <br /> <br /> The special effects range from excellent to good - better than any movie I know from the 1960s - to disappointingly bad ones. <br /> <br /> Despite these shortcomings, the main story of doppelgangers is well told and keeps the viewer (or at least this viewer) in touch. The end may not be what you'd expect from Anderson, but at the same time it's typical of Anderson, and it's certainly appropriate. To find out what I mean, you have to see it for yourself. :)
