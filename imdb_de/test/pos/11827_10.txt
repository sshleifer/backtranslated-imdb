This is one of the best and funniest comedy series I've ever seen! All characters are brilliant. <br /> <br /> Mr. Slatt (David Bamber) is a very irritated man who is irritated by everything and everyone. <br /> <br /> He wants to do things and handle situations as well as possible, but he will never understand it properly and only get himself deeper and deeper in trouble. Not supported by his wife Janet, who is just trying to get him deeper and deeper into the trouble he gets himself into (and really does not need any help!). <br /> <br /> All characters are played / presented brilliantly. Imagine sending your children to a school like this. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable that people do not like it (maybe some do not get the many puns that often happen). <br /> <br /> It is also unbelievable that there is no DVD of it yet. There are only 2 series! <br /> <br /> So please let go, let go! So the fans can and will enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Try it, you just like it! <br /> <br /> Just a few names and words from the series: Pumpman, Man Helmet, Hot Bitch, Mount Suzy, Travis Fellatio, Cockfoster, Arshead (and many more).
