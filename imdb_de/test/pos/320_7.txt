Bollywood's epic melodrama about a 10-year-old girl who finds herself adopted and determined to find her birthing mother. The biggest success of the film is the performance of P.S. Keerthana, who plays the girl. The first half of the film is very good. There are also some really good songs, especially the number that introduces the protagonist. Unfortunately, the second half of the film, which takes place in war-torn Sri Lanka, feels like a completely different and disappointing film. Explosions and special effects are huge as Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels dodge shells, run from fireballs and are pulled by stunt wires. All that the film can offer is cheap platitudes like "Sometime peace has to come" and "Maybe the kids will find a way". The last sequence, in which daughter and mother are reunited, is good, but so exaggerated with the music and a timely downpour that it feels like a scam. I know, I know, it's all in the style of Bollywood. But this is a story where big moments just distract from the simple, powerful central story. Bollywood could sometimes be a bit reluctant.
