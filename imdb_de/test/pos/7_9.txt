Our family (and the entire sold-out preview audience) enjoyed "The Guardian". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher made compelling appearances as the fictional helicopter lifeguard characters Ben and Jake. After watching this movie, you can easily imagine how difficult it is to complete the USCG helicopter lifeguard school and one day participate in real rescue operations. <br /> <br /> Although this is a fictional film, it has delivered quite compelling virtues, such as team spirit, dedication and courage, demonstrated by all members of the US Coast Guard. <br /> <br /> The special effects that created the rescue scenes were incredible. They actually felt that they had participated in a real salvation. <br /> <br /> I think the movie could have been made without the Hollywood bar scene (if you see the movie, you might agree) The Coast Guard does not tolerate such behavior. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, very action packed, definitely worth seeing. Thank you, the US Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter lifeguards "So Others May Live." I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
