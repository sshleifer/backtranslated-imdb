I was thrilled to see my husband rent "Labyrinth of Passion". I love Almodovar's films. We both loved the movie. We could not stop laughing. We particularly liked the scene in which the transvestite shoots a photo novel, and although he is allegedly threatened by a killer with an electric drill, he is asked to pick up the phone and say, "I can not talk to you now, I 'll be attacked by a sadistic serial killer, if I survive, I'll call you back. "(That would make a great answering machine message to think about it). We also loved the lady who told her new lover, "I went to an orgy after the concert, but I could not stop thinking about you." (I'm waiting to use this line on Twitter). "Labyrinth of Passion" is an exuberant farce with many high jinks, funny dialogues and eye candy for everyone. The film has aged well: the costumes and hairstyles of the 1980s add to the craziness. I'd rate it at 10 out of 10, but I'll give it an 8 for two reasons. The first is the scene where laxatives are used, which includes a woman who pollutes herself: completely unnecessary, and she lets the sound of the movie go down for a moment in Hollywood's total comedy. The second is the suggestion that Queti sleeps with her father: shocking, yes, but that too ruins the tone of the film. Nevertheless, I would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated, spicy and fun time.
