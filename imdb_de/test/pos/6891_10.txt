Although Promised Land has not been in the air for 6 years, it's one of those shows that occurs once or twice in one generation. Good cast, minor cast (including Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and crew. The conspiracy is credible. McRaney gathered his family together and said only "To hell with everything" after experiencing so many disappointments and incidents since his return from Vietnam years ago. I think that many Vietnamese veterans, myself included, could really be linked to McRaney's thinking process when they decided his approach. Many of us did the same in real life after they returned from the war and found that America was not the same place we were. The show not only conveys values, but also an insight into the life of a veteran. In this respect alone, I think that this is one of the most moving television series of our time. Why this program ran only 3 years is incomprehensible to me.
