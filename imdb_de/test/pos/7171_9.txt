This movie has just been shown on Channel Seven - Australian TV - today. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was a very interesting approach to how the Nazis treat Russian Jews as ruthlessly as anywhere else. <br /> <Kellie Martin has done a really great job, and her tears and Frustration as "Frusia" were pretty convincing. <br /> <br /> The Holocaust is part of our story that we must NOT FORGET. Schindler's cunning was not the first - and it will not be the last - of survival and courage in this five-year-old nightmare. My family is Dutch and I will always applaud any filmmaker who wants to keep the candlelight alive, by encouraging someone to stand up and help those who have been abused, injured and murdered for being "a Jew" ,
