After watching the film that Kieslowski filmed from this episode of "The Decalogue" years ago, we came back to that viewer when we saw the full ten vignettes. As with the other films, this film is loosely based on the fifth commandment, or "Thou shalt not kill." <br /> <br/> Kryzsztof Kieslowski wrote a young man, Kryzsztof Piesewicz, a man who committed a heinous crime when he murdered an innocent person to vent his own frustrations. This episode has a Dostoevsky character that keeps reminding us of "crime and punishment," or at least some of the novel's characteristics are passed on to the aimless youth, who apparently has no redeeming qualities. The story shows the young man as he roams the streets of the city without a clear idea of ​​what to do or where to go. The only tender moment he shows is when he visits the photographer's place to restore an old picture of his sister. Kieslowski leaves it up to fate to put the killer in a taxi to rob the driver, but it is his anger and frustration that make the best of this youth kill a man who does not deserve to die. The last moments of this criminal are one of the most thrilling sequences in a movie, in the past or in the present. The other element in the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal. Nothing prevents the court from sentencing the young man to death. The lawyer ends up with the feeling that he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he was wrong. All he is required of the young man is to retrieve the picture and send it to his mother. Kieslowski's account of how he interprets the fifth commandment makes a startling film that will be long remembered by the viewer after this episode is forgotten.
