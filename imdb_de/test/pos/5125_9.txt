The story is unbelievable, she starts with a new kid named Roy, while on the bus to school, he notices a kid walking without shoes, and on the same day he breaks the big nose that wants to fight him. Roy soon discovers that the child is an outlier, and he and his stepsister try to create a structural sight that could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. Roy decides to help him fight there. Can they win this fight before the clever but plump policeman Dave Delinko (Luke Wilson) bumps into them? A funny movie, funny and adventurous. I admire Luke Wilson for assuming this role. I do not think his brother Owen would take on this role at all.
