Corbucci, the iconic filmmaker, is the rarest of his thirteen spaghetti westerns (of which I have nothing to catch but WHAT I AM IN THE CENTER OF THE REVOLUTION [1972]), about which I recently knew about Marco Giusti's "Stracult"; is an atypical grimy genre gem in the style of director THE GREAT SILENCE (1968)'s own masterpiece, complete with lonesome snowscapes Johnny Hallyday, the French Elvis Presley, whom I first saw in Jean - Luc Godard's DETECTIVE (1985) a curious but highly effective choice for the single-player hero Hud (who, like Clint Eastwood's "The Man Without a Name" by Sergio Leone's acclaimed "Dollar's Trilogy") is armed with a steel plate armor to protect him!) By the way, I had Hallyday's stunning daughter Laura Smet "hit" at the Venice Film Festival in 2004, but was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director Claude Chabrol! Gastone Moschin is one more a curious addition to the fold (which pretty much fulfills the same function as Frank Wolff in THE GREAT SILENCE), but is in a good mood and is amusingly awkward in the presence of a bathing Francoise Fabian; the latter, then, plays a greedy nymphomaniac of a widow of a banker, who seduces everyone to reach their goals. Sylvie Fennec has the other big female role as a Hallyday farm girl. She is once asked by Apache Gabriella Tavernese (hippie) in Free Love (with that in mind, though, it's noteworthy that the movie is surprisingly welcome nudity by Fabian and Tavernese)! Incidentally, the anachronistic addition of a group of long-haired adolescents (who also engage in doping and revolutionary conversations) is a semifinished attempt of contemporary relevance. But after all, everything contributes to the fun (in addition, even the black barmaid wears an Afro hairstyle!). <br /> <br /> Mario Adorf also enjoys the small role of a larger than life Mexican bandit nicknamed "El Diablo"? who keeps a young biographer at his side (an element that might have influenced Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN [1992]) and at one point challenges the captive Moschin to a head duel duel! After that was mentioned, does the film contain a very unusual "death weapon"? Hallyday has an opponent by kicking the box of salons in his face! The pleasingly fake fistfights are, as always, accompanied by overwhelming sound effects; Just as typical of the genre, the wistful score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino is an extremely important asset. In fact, does the ambiguous ending match the generally gloomy tone of the movie? after Fabian's enthusiasm from the locals, the hippies (who had previously worshiped Hud) suddenly turn on him when wounded, and terrorize the city (forcing everyone on the street and undressed), but the unshakable gunman manages to rise They face their challenge (but they are scared of looking him in the face!) And then ride out of town to leave Fennec behind. <br /> <br /> Finally, I acquired this through high-quality widescreen printing in Italian, albeit with French credits and occasional downtime? about a minute total screen time? into the French language (where the original soundtrack did not seem to be available).
