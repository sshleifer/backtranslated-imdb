PINK FLAMINGOS is the undisputed classic. Sure, the camera work is wobbly and not in the middle, the story is confused and slow, and every character in the movie is abominable and despicable, but PINK FLAMINGOS has a playful charm and a brilliant satirical joke that no other movie can offer <br /> <br /> Even though this movie is indeed offensive, reading descriptions of what's going on in the movie is far worse than actually seeing it. Only John Waters can make absolutely rancorous rape, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophagy, and almost every other form of human debauchery known to man. This movie has to be seen to be believed.
