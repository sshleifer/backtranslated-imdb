This two-disc set is incredible! If you are like me and never had the opportunity to see the band live then this is the next best thing. Jimmy Page, who in my opinion is the second best guitarist ever to live on Earth (only Slowfingers himself), shows an amazing show in every movie. John Paul Jones, though not as far ahead as Page, shows a damn show. Although it is in the live atmosphere, its rhythmic bass lines are not as defined as on studio recordings, except, of course, in songs like Dazed and Confused or What is and What should never be well displayed on these DVDs. John Bonham is John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison, his beats stand out like no other and this DVD is the proof. Last but not least, Robert Plant complains like nobody else. If you've ever read Hammer of the Gods, you'll wonder how Page was when he met Robert Plant for the first time. Why is not this guy already famous? And so concludes my review, apology and spelling or grammatical mistakes, Zeppelin rocks.
