I've been interested in this movie for a long time, especially after reading a few online reviews of the DVD issue. However, I have postponed the purchase because of the excessive price order and the lack of relevant additions. When it was no longer printed at the beginning of this year, I eventually gave in, but the entire order (which included a number of other coveted titles) was lost during transport! Luckily, the DVD was reissued at a bargain price - and I am sure glad I picked it up! Anyway, this is a curious movie and a real sleeper: at first confusing but eye-catching occult story that manages to hit Bullseye both in terms of the forbidden small-town atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the eerie happening -on. A small cast responds perfectly to a tight, gripping and intelligent script: Especially with Strother Martin, the dialogue sounds better than it actually is with his differentiated performance as city doctor / director of the Witches concert. L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (both have also produced the movie!) Provide solid support as a no-nonsense sheriff and his comic strip fan. <br /> <br /> The plot combines elements from various past films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural, and not just the obvious titles: the fact that the city is under a spell, for example not at first can be identified, immediately recalling the similar suffering of a particular bourgeois household in Luis Bunuels surrealist surrealism THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)! The angle "possessed children" was perhaps taken over by VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960). There have been many films - most notably a recent vintage - showing the satanic rites of a witch-circle: from THE CITY OF THE DEAD (1960) to THE DEVIL RIDES OUT (1968), but since the modern American method (albeit in secluded surroundings) and revolved around older witches (in search of a "renaissance"), they especially remember ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968). The occult scenes (accented as misty outsides, like the shadowy lighting of the garishly decorated house where the devilish events take place, are presented in a completely matter-of-fact way to make them unsettling and extremely effective - especially the opening sequence with an army tank crushing a car (!), the robbery of a devil doll (a concept that has been killed over the years but causes an indisputable scourge here), a surreal dream sequence (in the ice chamber where everything is located) being sacrificed as it is can not be buried!) The witches attack a dubious member of the Coven, a beheading committed by a medieval knight (!) and the long final of the black mass (with the witches who are accompanied by each child) in dressed in red - except for a black-robed Martin, who presides the ceremony), the ritual Massenselbstm ord leads! <br /> <br /> The film also has the courage to deliver a downbeat curtain. It's so refreshing to find a title (albeit a low-budget production) from a major Hollywood studio in Columbia that goes so completely against the grain (as I said, the movie is pretty weird - it also extends to) the editing) and the score)! It is also strange that such a classic - and cinematic - horror offer {sic} should come from a TV director who is mostly associated with Western and other family costumers! Incidentally, the same theme was dealt with almost simultaneously in the collaboration of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (1972, Lee Produced!) - a film I missed about 20 years ago when it was shown on local television, and that was MIA since then !! <br /> <br /> P.S. This review by THE BROTHERHOOD OF Satan will surely contain spoilers, but the summary and artwork on the DVD cover still manage to betray everything!
