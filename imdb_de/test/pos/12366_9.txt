Not as well-known as English, American, German and French cinema, although the Swedish cinema of the 1920s was also quite good, interesting and revolutionary. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is made great by its quality story. The story is told in a kind of "Christmas carol" in which death itself confronted the deceased with his past, present and what could have been. It's of course a story that focuses on morality, and it does that very well. The message is very powerful and effective. This, of course, is definitely due to the effective direction of the father of Swedish cinema; Victor Sjöström. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the novel by Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf. The story was adapted by Victor Sjöström himself, who may have taken a few more elements to make the story and the movie flow better. It may take a little too long for the movie to take shape and make the story clearer, but when the movie takes shape and pace, it becomes a truly wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> The movie not only has a great story, it looks good too. The film uses some early and effective effects and uses different color filters to create the right mood and to show what happened in the past, present and future. <br /> <br /> He also plays the main character. Of course, the drama in the film is at times exaggerated, but not as bad for today's conditions as in, for example, early German films. And finally, this movie is more about its history and morality than about acting, so it does not matter or distract. <br /> <br /> A really big and effective underrated silent movie classic from Sweden. <br /> <br /> 9/10
