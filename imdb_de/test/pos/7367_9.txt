Campfire Tales (1997) <br /> <br /> Excellent job security. Everything about this movie is just perfect. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great cast, as you can see in IMDb. The reason I brought the movie was because of Christine Taylor and the love of horror movies. Let's get to the main parts. <br /> <br /> 1. There are 4 teenagers in this movie. After smashing their car, they decide to tell some scary stories. 2. There are 3 stories and the main presentation (the 4 adolescents are the main presentation) 3. The best story is "People can also lick" in my opinion. The least frightening story may be "Honeymoon" or the 2nd story (I can not remember the name). <br /> <br /> 4. "People can also lick" is about a guy pretending to be 13-year-old girl (He starts chatting with a girl named Amanda and then enters her house.) Very scary stuff, this story makes you think twice about chatting online with someone, basically a pervert enters her house and the Things get scary. <br /> 5. The main action is cute and simple, the teens crash, tell stories, try to chase each other out, but in the end there is a very cool twist. <br /> <br /> The only bad one In this movie, the teenagers crash their car against another couple, but the kids do not care if the couple is okay, they just talk about the couple they crashed into. <br /> <br / > The M men and women who have made this film have managed to scare the people, not to make money. Unlike "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer," this movie was made to scare you. "Scream" and "I know what you did last summ He was made to make big time cash. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was not as public as Scream, it's still ten times better than Scream and "I know what you did last summer." <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are great and have realistic features, the characters who play these characters are great, Christine Taylor makes a fabulous one Job with Lauren does not go too far with acting, and the guy who plays Eric (Lauren's younger brother) does a good job of showing that men or teenagers can be freaked out, too, and Screams is like a parody movie the murderer is a joke and the kids are stupid <br /> <br /> Unlike Scream and "I know what you did last summer", this movie has realistic people and not a jerk of a movie, should have attracted more attention his.
