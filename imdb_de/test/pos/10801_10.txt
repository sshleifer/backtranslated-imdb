Cinema, entertainment is best. If you want to question every aspect that leaves room for disagreement, and much of the recorded story is based on contemporary opinions - often biased - then you should leave the cinema because their prejudices always destroy their enjoyment. When I was in a film of 33 v. Chr. A plane flying over it was amused. The background scenery in "Casablanca" is absurdly wrong. Do I have to groan and say that the film did not convince? Fiona, relax and enjoy excellent spectacles. Wajda's decision to cast the protagonists as French and Polish was inspired. One knew immediately which side the main characters represented. No need to deal with the authenticity of wigs. This is a strong cinema. If there is a political message that is still relevant today - a dinner party - a Ch√¢teau d'Yquem with the foie gras; a Puligny Montrachet with the main course; a few Polish vodka sorbets and maybe a 1961 beefsteak Lafite-Rothschild - and discuss the political aspects of Danton until you drop from exhaustion. Danton would have agreed to that?
