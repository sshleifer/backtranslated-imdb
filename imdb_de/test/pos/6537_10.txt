This movie has moved me to tears. I have to say if I did not have a nice husband at home, I would ask this beautiful piece of art to marry me. Aaron Carter gives a masterly performance as a confused young pop star, while Timothy Barton writes a quick and witty dialogue that only promotes the genius of Carter's performance. Kyle is pretty gay, but his performance was no less than spectacular. He is also very pretty and sweet. I'm thinking about asking him about a date and giving him a sweet treat for a good night Nick Burrell Vassar Class 2012 Malibu, California Malibu West 310 924 0126
