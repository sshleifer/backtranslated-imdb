The curse of the Monkey Island has always been my favorite of the series. A vivid visual look, superb soundtrack and brilliant voice cast create an unforgettable and humorous adventure. <br /> <br /> The game is definitely not a flop. Although some corners have been trimmed, the overall feel of the game is reminiscent of Disney Feature Length Animations. The gameplay is simple and even a novice will understand it soon enough. The game also offers a bit more experience for experienced players with the Mega Monkey mode. <br /> <br /> The voice cast is one of my favorites. Dominic Armato's sympathetic voice makes Guybrush complete and Alexandra Boyd is simply charming as Elaine. Earl Boen makes for a wonderfully scary but exaggerated villain, LeChuck. The charm of the game is added by memorable characters like Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my personal favorites, Haggis McMutton (Allan Young, voice of Scrooge McDuck). My hat also goes to the late, great Kay Kuter and his memorable supporting role as Griswold Goodsoup. <br /> <br /> Michael Land's tropical and wonderful soundtrack once again graces the adventure of Monkey Island, one of the best in the business. The game is not perfect and some venues are not as detailed as others, but I had no problems with the simple end of the game, which I found very satisfying.
