I bought it in the household department last week. I already had Halloween and Halloween II. Since I wanted to collect every horror movie, I chose this movie. After all, the first two were good. This movie is pretty intelligent to tell the truth. It seems to create the right atmosphere and has a nice "story of Michael Myers". It uses the old places from the original, and the main character is the child Laurie was celebrating this fateful Halloween in 1978 ... The climax is also quite satisfying. Anyway, it's MUCH better than H20, which, frankly, is absolute crap.
