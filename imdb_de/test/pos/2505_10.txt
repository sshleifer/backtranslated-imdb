This is one of the better 1999 feel-good films in which Kate Capshaw leads an all-star cast about a small town and a love letter. First of all, the scenery is beautiful and anyone who sees this movie and does not want to move to this place is crazy! For the cast, Capshaw plays a stunning role as the lead actress, captivating the emotional roller coaster ride. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the "author" of the note throughout the movie, and the ever-adorable Ellen Degeneres is weird! Also impressive are Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the bookstore's shop assistant. Although it failed, the film is great because it is both short and sweet and very romantic. 10/10
