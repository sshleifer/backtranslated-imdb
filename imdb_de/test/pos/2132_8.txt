I really liked this movie, though this movie seems so hated and I think it's even better than The Deer Hunter, which was overrated. Both this movie and Year Of The Dragon are underestimated, though I could see why someone would not like this movie. At three and a half hours, the movie is just too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken argue about Isabelle Huppert, but she can not decide who she should be with. Sam Waterston is the villain who has a list of 125 people to be killed and who are anarchists and thieves. There is a great cast that includes Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and a young Mickey Rourke.
