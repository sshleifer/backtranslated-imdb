I'm watching this train recently on the Encore Channel. What a great movie, a great cast. Flatliners are very exciting and unpredictable. The film has a great opening scene by the sea, then a series of scenes setting the questions of life after death, which provide a strong involvement of the story in advance. Therefore, Nelson, played by Kiefer Sutherland, was the first who went through the test to die and was brought back to life. Then it becomes very dramatic, bringing his wrong doing from the past back to life. Then all of the above characters went through the same experience, with the exception of Randy Steckle, played by Olliver Platt. Then the story unfolds into a resolution and a basic understanding of the life and the present and meaning of God. David Labraccio, played by Kevin Bacon, an atheist, questions his own belief in God. It's fantastic to see Julia Roberts together with Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland at such a good time of their careers. One can ask why we can not produce such a great movie anymore. This is one of Joel Schumacher's best productions. I really enjoy this movie.
