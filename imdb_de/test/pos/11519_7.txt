Fascinating and amusingly bad: Lights of New York is the first all-talkie feature that almost never saw the light of day. <br /> <br /> Two naive barbers (Eddie and Gene) from outside get involved in bootleggers and in the end speak a word. When a police officer is shot by one of the bootleggers, the police approach and the Hawk (who shot the officer) decides to attach the murder to Eddie, who instructs his follower to "take him away". But it is the hawk himself who conquers the globe in a turn that few will surprise. <br /> <br /> In one week's shooting for $ 23,000, "Lights" was originally intended as a two-wheeler, but Foy took advantage of this, leaving Jack Warner wanting to expand it to six. When Warner saw it, he ordered Foy to cut him back to the original short. Only when an independent exhibitor offered $ 25k for the film did Warners actually look at the film, which then netted a staggering $ 1.3 million. <br /> <br /> Now this is an extremely hokey tune he does with it. The spectrum ranges from passable (Eugene Pallette) to trance-like scenes (Eddie's grandma in a particularly eye-catching scene), and much of the game plays at the level of vaudeville. Since it's an early talkie (4 part talkies preceded it), all characters are very slow. The script feels improvised, the visual style is absent (apart from the shooting scene made in Silhouette), and the scenes keep on going. Title cards are intercuts that redundantly announce characters and locations. Despite all this, "Lights" is a captivating experience as we watch actors and crew struggling with alien technology and forever changing the cinema /> <br /> Catch it, though you can
