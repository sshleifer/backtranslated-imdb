totally awesome movie from the CKY crew ...... (not the Jackass Boys ..... Johnny Knoxville, Chris Pontius, Steve-O etc. are not in this <br /> <br /> movie). OK, maybe they are not the best actors, but it's not what you would call a serious movie ... but hey, it was fun and it's so funny to watch it. Who does not want Don Vito dressed as a Roman emperor! <br /> <br /> An absolute must if you like Viva la bam or CKY ... an amazing soundtrack from the almighty HIM, CKY and others ...... check out the additional features on the DVD, especially Bran's Freestyle <br /> <br /> Chinese rap number two ...... really funny ..... ...... watch this movie ........ you will Do not regret it ......... 10/10
