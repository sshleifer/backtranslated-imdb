This was undoubtedly one of the best half-hour horror / suspense / fantasy shows of the eighties. Granted, the show had a barely capable cast with each episode, and it stank of production values ​​(ie H. The Sets), but damn it, I have to give some credit for being brave with the plots. I mean, the plot of each episode was so nervous that even I, a hardened horror movie, a shock movie, and a 70s towing house buff, got a bit sick and crawling. Great show, just great, regardless of what the other reviewers said here. My favorite episode was Bug House, yes, that was the title I think? Nevertheless, I still have the will to think about it today, almost 20 years after its premiere. Other shows such as "Tales From The Darkside", "The Outer Limits" and (of course) "The Twilight Zone" were definitely better production values, but in my opinion, they have nothing compared to this sick little show in terms of plotting lines! It definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon "Tales From The Crypt".
