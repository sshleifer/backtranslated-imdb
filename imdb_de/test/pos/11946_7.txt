I love this movie as much as anyone who loves to see everything he saw in his youth. It was one of those movies Home Box Office showed every other day in my youth. This movie is forever in my brain. For someone who has not grown up with this film, you may have been spoiled by the ADD cycle we've been in since the mid-'90s, and you may find it harder to appreciate this gem. Cool that's when my sis was spiked to "better off dead" before I saw that (which I was raped and loved) - and nobody, no one can deny the hug of awkward teenage humor in American cinema in the 80s - That's how it came to be everything that we found boring in teen comedy ... because all the excitement of slow motion, the current soundtrack and the new technology. I wonder if the cinema will return to these roots ... THIS IS the teen comedy ... YES!
