One can only be impressed by the intelligence and scope of this film and at the same time disappointed by the disappointed possibilities. <br /> <br /> I found the script outstanding and the singing talent of Edmund Purdom impressive. As an artifact of his time, however, the film suffers from too many Hollywood isms, especially bad casting, too much lavishness of the sets and too much presumption. Edmund Purdom (who plays the title character) is so obviously awkward with physical drama, I suspect that he had previously been mainly in the Shakespeare Theater. When film people read this, I suggest this as a movie an excellent candidate for a remake, especially if you use real Egyptians as Egyptians!
