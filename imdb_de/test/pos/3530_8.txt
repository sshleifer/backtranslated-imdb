September 29, 1990 was a small but important milestone in my appreciation of horror film. On that day, BBC1 (for the first time I knew) sent Jeff Lieberman's super-scary 1981 shocker Just Before Dawn, and he made a big impression on me. Almost twenty years later, I'm pleased to announce that I've finally gotten hold of the special edition of the two-disc series Shriek Show / Media Blasters, and it's just as scary and disturbing as I remember, if not more , <br /> <br /> <br /> The storyline that is common to genre-flicks (and this was Lieberman's first movie as a director for distribution), even though he has at least removed all religious cult humbo jumbos from the script) a bit thin - five sympathetic twenty-year-olds (including Chris Lemmon, son of Jack, in a pair of uncomfortable, tight white steps) venture into the dense forests of Oregon to camp and explore a piece of land that's one of their numbers leave. But before dawn stands out from a lot of imitators, because Lieberman shows no time to show how confusing things are on this particular mountain section, with a completely innocent skewer and a drunken truck that has crashed down a hill and sunk in flames is minutes of movie start. The teenagers roll into a snappy Winnebago, Blondie's 'Heart of Glass' pounding on the soundtrack and before you can say, "Texas Chainsaw Massacre!" They beat up an innocent deer with the front bumper and got the first impression of Aggro from the hard-nosed maniac who was responsible for the inaugural catastrophes. Forest Ranger Roy (George Kennedy) warns them that things are likely to go awry if they go any farther, but they still continue the journey and refuse to take the swaying preacher with them, although he understandably is scared and eventually miles behind them leaves from everywhere. Needless to say that it goes downhill from here. <br /> <br /> While this film lacks bloody horror and well-treated action scenes, the outstanding moments for me are those in which Lieberman slowly dows out his camera, from seemingly innocent shots of the fun-loving kids that appear in the Romp wilderness, or just settle down for a while on the dense, imposing, man-made forests. He makes the outside of Oregon as threatening and as threatening as Kubrick made the spacious interiors of the Overlook Hotel in Shining, and Brad Fiedel's score (minus the terribly distorted racket that runs over the titles) remains the right side of the intrusive menace and underlines the slowly increasing threat with subtlety and flair. There are many surprises along the way. Nod to salvation with the discovery of a backwoodsman and her crazy, disturbing family and a truly bizarre killer technique used just before the end of the movie. I will not ruin it for you. I said enough. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to identify why this underrated horror fell through the cracks and became a cult object, but hopefully it will come back to life for years to come - and it deserves to be.
