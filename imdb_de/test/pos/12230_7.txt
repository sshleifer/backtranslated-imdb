"A Fare to Remember" is a totally distracted, almost ridiculous film, but with a warmth that makes it a very effective and optimistic holiday movie. Challen Kates is a top-notch recruiter who has to rush from LA to Seattle just before her wedding to keep a customer who has rejected all other presentations. She has transport difficulties from the beginning and apparently no money. This is the first stupid thing - was there no ATM anywhere? She has to make a fortune. In any case, she meets a taxi driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless person, and he drives her to her presentation, and when she shows up with a huge box of beef (the customer's product), he's there to take her away to the airport. All flights will be canceled. To get her to LA for her wedding, she hires him to bring her there. On the way they tie and learn from each other. It's a very sweet movie, although absolutely nothing new in it - it combines "Six Days and Seven Nights" and some other movies. But the chemistry between the stars is good, they are sympathetic and the acting is good. Look for Jerry Springer as head of the Beef Jerky Company and a cameo by Karl Malden. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie you can take over the Christmas season. It is for life.
