Wesley Eure is the young inventor Brian Foster, who created a new crime prevention system in the form of a robot dog entitled "C.H.O.M.P.S." invented. (It stands for Canine HOMe Protection System). C.H.O.M.P.S., modeled after Brian's real dog Rascal, can do almost anything; He has increased speed, power, X-ray vision and the like. It's just the thing to save the security company of its boss Ralph Norton (Conrad Bain). A slimy competitor, Gibbs (Jim Backus), of course wants to have an advantage and tries to get his hands on the secret. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that is easy to resist. It has a lot of slapstick (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons playing a great pair of bumbling idiots), an optimistic attitude, a engaging cast and enough good laughs to entertain you. The energetic disco music becomes repetitive, but is undeniably catchy. The story is straightforward and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. In a totally strange but exciting touch there is another dog ("monster") in the movie whose thoughts we actually hear. Both his dialogue and the performer who plays the voice are invaluable. In fact, he even uses a mild profanity, and his last words end the film with a very nice-looking final note. Yours and the cute Valerie Bertinelli are very likeable young leads and their veterans, the casting games support the material with all the energy they can muster. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis and Regis Toomey are also co-stars. <br /> <br /> A rare theatrical live action action for the cartoon team of Hanna & Barbera ("The Flintstones", "Scooby-Doo", "The Smurfs" etc.), "CHOMPS" is enjoyable nonsense. I know that I have a smile on my face. <br /> <br /> 7/10
