Penelope Spheeris (famed by "Wayne's World") made a strong debut on LA's punk scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the documentary "The Decline of Western Civilization." Most documentaries include interviews with the punks and footage of concerts (which often get violent). Overall, we can see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: while the hippies were natural, the punks wanted to have as much of a change as possible, with spike hair and so on. But we also see how they really are dissatisfied and sometimes become skinheads. Anyway, this is a really great time capsule. We are not really sure if we are longing for it or want to feel repelled by it. However, this is definitely not documentation that will make you neutral. Really worth seeing.
