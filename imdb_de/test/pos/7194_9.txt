I saw Asterix and Obelix in Operation Cleopatra, which was my first encounter with the live action version of the classic comic. Like the comic, the entire movie is full of jokes based on puns, anachronistic jokes and slapstick jokes that rarely fall flat. Asterix and Obelix are Gauls who use a power potion to fight the Roman legions in their homeland, Gaul. Here they land in Egypt to help a friend build Cesar's palace (yes, its wobbly) in three months to prove that the Egyptians are as good as the Romans. <br /> <br /> The reason I found that was Monica Belluci is Cleopatra. She is good, but the role is little more than a cameo. Although she's rarely in the movie, I do not care, since it's so smart and the jokes are so weird that I was hysterical. I loved it. I loved it so much that I can not understand why the films were never released in the United States. <br /> <br /> The import DVD has the film in English - which is especially good, given that when you see it in the longer French version, the puns (and jokes) are not always obvious because they are audible. So if you misread the names, the jokes will be lost. Most of the jokes between the French full version and the shorter English dub seem to be exactly alike, though some have sometimes been changed for the better and a few times for the bad. Personally, I stay with Dub when I look at it again, as it's easier to take the jokes and enjoy the humor. <br /> <br /> You'll really want it if you love puns and a low brow. but clever humor This is a great comedy
