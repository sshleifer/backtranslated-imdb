Fulci is one of my favorite Italian directors. He is also a very good storyteller who mixes horror, the supernatural and psychedelic themes altogether very well. This movie was really his last great story before he staged disappointments like "Voices From Beyond". The story is simple as Fulci plays himself as a horror director. After years of filming Splatter and Gore films, it seems that Fulci is collapsing, beginning to hallucinate about slaughtering people. He decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse by convincing Fulci that he is killing people. <br /> <br /> Fulci used Gore scenes from several pictures of the same time. I do not think he filmed these films, but certainly produced them. Some of these films are "Massacre" by Andrea Bianchi (burial place), "Touch of Death" by Fulci, "The Murders Secret" and I can not remember the rest of the movies. <br /> <br /> Nightmare Concert is a very underrated movie, even by Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and saw it many times. It's sad that Fulci had no chance to do anything about it, but it's still a great movie and I can recommend it to any Fulci fan, whether he likes it or not. 9/10 stars
