One of the two best films of the year. A well-filmed, well-written, well composed film with excellent cast. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun and Cheung Man Tat) had great chemistry in their performances before the film and their friendships. Theresa Lee plays her comedic role very well (although she resembles a female version of Michael Wong, her gag seems to be the foreign-born Chinese, surrounded by native HKerns) since the 1st fanboys took alt.asian-movies and 2 John Woo's hardboiled. Sure, the end was expected, but I feel better than police cheer as a couple of young gang members. Very nice.
