Imagine the most depressing winter you'll never experience: gray instead of white, no snow fights, and certainly no wonderland. This is Finland, as represented by Frozen Land. This film shows a number of people whose lives are linked in an unusual way to each other, with results that go beyond the nightmares of every human being. Yes, most characters are flawed in the way that only celluloid characters can do - annoying and frustrating to look at, but for some reason you want their luck to turn. <br /> <br /> With some randomly placed humor and a cast that brings together Finland's somewhat mainstream faces, Frozen Land offers a glimpse into the Finnish mentality that, despite its depressing, downward spirals, manages to believe to restore humanity. More than Kaurism√§ki, to say the least.
