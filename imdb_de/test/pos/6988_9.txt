If you are a sci-fi fan and have only seen this movie once, please PLEASE and treat yourself to a second visit. I just did it and I was amazed at how well I found the movie, unlike when I saw it for the first time three years ago. The first time I was certainly impressed by the astronomical perspectives that we deal with in this film, but on the whole, I did not think so much about the movie as a whole. It was an alien rip-off, and I took the description of the monsters as a case of really bad science. That they were allergic to light, I found particularly ridiculous. After watching it for the first time, I recently rated this movie as 5. <br /> <br /> Now that the sequel Chronicles of Riddick is out, the movie poster for this movie looks amazing, I thought I should refresh Pitch Black again, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I am so glad that I did it. There's so much of what I remembered when I first looked at it that turned out to be very inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died early in the movie. That was not so. I thought that Claudia Black's first character died. That was not so. I thought Riddick was the only survivor. That was not so. <br /> <br /> I see now that the movie works extremely well. There is no excessive, tiring focus on the monsters. It is much more of a human drama. The main characters are appealing and can be convincing. And there are so many small details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and believable, such as the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet it bounces on, and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet and themselves turn on each other. <br /> <br /> And I have to mention again the astronomical prospects. I mean, we're starting to see the spaceship go through the tail of a comet, with a few inches zapping through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just when the shipwrecked think that it will soon be dark, on the opposite horizon, a blue sun rises and everything is immersed in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the giant, adjacent, surrounding gas giant rise above the sky, and in the final scene of the movie, we see the ship slipping just above one of those rings. These scenes are made with a sense of beauty, wonder, and detail, and I do not think I've seen another SF movie that really brought these things to bear. I hope we see a lot more of it in the sequel. <br /> <br /> Pitch Black now gets a rating of 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You bet !!
