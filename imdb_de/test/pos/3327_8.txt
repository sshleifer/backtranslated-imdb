Side Show is one of the craziest horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. In some places very bloody, but not as shocking as the trailer makes it (The trailer for this film shows all the bloody parts). The acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this one should watch Puppet Master, Skined Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures movies.
