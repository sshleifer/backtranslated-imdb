When I saw this movie, I was in my youth, and I was impressed with the beauty of the young stars, as well as the loving cinematography and simple sweetness of the story. I'm surprised to learn that Alvina has recently passed away, that Bury seems to have been out of the movie business for almost 30 years, and that both will be in their 50s. The soundtrack of Elton John is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence that the characters experience in seclusion. I've seen the movie poster and charged it as a "Deux Enfants Quis'Aiment", which seems like something like "Two kids who like each other" - the English-speaking dealers were wise to cut short the title! <br /> <br Paul, the ignored 15-year-old son of a Paris-based English businessman, meets Michelle at the zoo, an orphan. The two of them take what they plan as a full-time vacation to the country house of Michelle, the deceased father, whom they spend a year with, isolated from the outside world. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home. After the birth of the baby, the police come to Paul's workplace and take him away. <br /> <br /> "Blue Lagoon" is reminiscent of another movie that captures almost the theme of innocence that is sheltered in a secluded paradise. So sad that "Friends" has never been released on DVD.
