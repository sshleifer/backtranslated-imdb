This movie gets a 10 because there's a lot of gore in it. Who is interested in the plot or acting? This is an Italian horror movie, so you know you can not expect much from acting or acting. Everyone knows Fulci I took footage from other films and added it to this movie. Since I did not see any of the movies he had taken footage of, I did not care. The Italian godfather who finished this movie is one of the goriest Italian movies you'll ever see. No Gore Hound should be in his horror movie collection without this movie. Buy this movie, no matter what it is, a dream come true.
