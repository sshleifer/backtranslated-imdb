I found this movie very enjoyable and quite entertaining. Good characters, good actors and enough excitement to keep your interest. The plot changes were perhaps a bit much, but overall a decent thriller. If you liked this movie I would recommend The Spanish Prisoner, The House of Games and No Way Out.
