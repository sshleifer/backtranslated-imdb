The crew of an American submarine discovered that it was HELL DOWN when he fought on the Adriatic in 1918. <br /> <br /> Although he is almost forgotten, this excellent war movie still offers good entertainment action scenes thanks to a script worth reading, excellence and credibility. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery & Walter Huston play under the pressure of war submarine officers who quickly clash with each other, with dramatic and tragic results. As Montgomery loves Hughon's daughter Madge Evans in a well-played role, the situation on both land and under the waves becomes even more complicated. The viewer is torn between the two strong characters, one dominated by his heart and the other by the rules. Robert Young effectively appears as a Montgomery buddy. Sterling Holloway creates a short, vivid portrait of a damn sailor. Eugene Pallette as Torpedomeister and Jimmy Durante as U-boat cook make for a very funny comedy team and provide the story with a lot of laughter. Durante's nose bumps into ribs and his obsession with amateur dentistry leads to some chaotic encounters with British tars. <br /> <br /> Movie lovers will recognize Babe London as an obese Italian miss. Maude Eburne as wife of a British Admiral & Paul Porcasi as Italian Admiral - all uncredited. <br /> <br /> MGM has given the film absolutely top-notch production values, with the undersea sequences being particularly well produced. Both the claustrophobic compactness of the ship and the unavoidable tensions associated with the underwater warfare are accurately represented. Other moments of the unexpected drama (Montgomery & Miss Evans caught during an air raid on a stalled Ferris wheel) and amusement (Durante at the kangaroo) are expertly threaded into the fabric of the film to provide a completely satisfying visual experience.
