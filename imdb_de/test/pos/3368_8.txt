I was not sure what to expect from THE BOX. I'm a big fan of Darko, but I also saw the chaos that came out of Southland Tales, whether it's a studio or not. I was pleasantly surprised with the box. It was a retrospective of classic sci-fi paranoia films that point to much bigger vile events but are based on an intimate character base. <br /> <br /> The slow processing and the creepy suspense had a very positive effect on the sound and the theme from the whole movie. Any change at such a pace would have led to a typical Hollywood or MTV style that simply did not do justice to the story of this story. Everything, from the weird-looking extras scattered all over the low score, to the minimal explanation of what was going on, added a whole focused thread of underlying fear and the shrinking sense of hope for ours greedy, albeit well meaning, main characters. This was something that Richard Kelly had thought through and set in motion from the first act to the very end. The short story by Richard Matheson on which this is based, NOT the Twilight Zone EP, which was another version of the story, was one of morality and greed that were still the central elements of THE BOX. With only 8 pages in length, it would not have been an easy task to expand it with substance. However, this was done with style and originality, leaving the viewer with long thoughts about the movie. Many have and will compare this with DARKO, whether it is so profound or not, but I found it a completely different film, thematic and emotional. The tone is completely different, as are the messages and intentions of this film. Where Darko questions us internally, THE BOX leaves the viewer with other external questions that involve the world around us. Would the test of the BOX, if he knows human nature, ever be over? Subtle actors, great scary visuals and up-and-coming atmosphere contribute to the slow driving feeling. It's not for everyone, but for those who get where they come from, it's a treat.
