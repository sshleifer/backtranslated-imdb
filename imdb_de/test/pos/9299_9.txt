I know you do not want to comment on other users' comments, but I'd like to say that many of the negative reviews come from people who already know a lot about the Manhattan Project and are annoyed with things that have been left out. (From his book "Smoking In Bed", the original screenwriter Bruce Robinson seems to be different.) However, I knew very little before I saw the movie and found it fascinating. Dwight Schultz is absolutely fascinating as an Oppenheimer - a truly magnetic, charismatic presence, an inspired piece of casting that makes me wonder why he does not get better roles and more lead roles. John Cusack and Paul Newman are as always excellent. You could argue with different scripting or directing options, but since the film is sometimes extremely intense and horrible, I give it a total of four out of five stars.
