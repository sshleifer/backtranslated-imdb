A Jane Smiley novel based loosely on Shakespeare's KING LEAR about the Cook family and their dark secrets. Director Moorhouse seems to be tamed in their approach, so the characters can take a step forward and bow. And how could one be wrong with the talents of Pfeiffer, Lange, Leigh, Firth, Carradine and Robards?
