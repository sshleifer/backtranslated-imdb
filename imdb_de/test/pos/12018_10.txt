This is one of those movies that just clicked on me for some reason. Everything is correct. Eric Roberts laconic, nice investigator, his spokeswoman, the twisted plot, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb have given good roles, the scenes, the paintings in the artist's studio scenes, the end credit sequence and the wonderfully haunting theme music that sets the mood perfectly expresses the whole movie. If I have reservations about Beverly D'Angelo as Femme Fatale, she plays her final scenes beautifully. I think that director Matthew Chapman has been trying to create some kind of Chinatown feeling for the whole thing. It did not work. But as a murder mystery it is a gem.
