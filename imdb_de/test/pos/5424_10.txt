Richard Condie's mad movie "The Big Snit" is a journey through Qwerkyness, Madness, Hillarity, Pleasant Backgrounds, Melting Characters, and a Conclusion that brings me to tears of happiness almost every time I see it. > I have seen this short piece over and over again and I will NEVER mature it (luckily I have seen it on tape from a TV show) !! It never ceases to make me laugh out of control and then reach the depths of my mind and emphasize the greatness of the human condition. <br /> <br /> If someone says, "Come on, let's end the game," everything in the world is fine, and the problems we face every day suddenly make us realize that everything is just fleeting things you do not have to fight anymore. This film may seem like a simple exercise in comic slapstick humor at first glance, but it is much more than that. This film has a greater significance for the spiritual meaning of humanity when everything seems so bad and trivial. <br /> <br /> It's immaculate ... in every way. AND DAMN FUNNY TOO;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
