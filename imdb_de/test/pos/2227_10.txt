I've seen this movie since 1972 and still remember one of my favorite movies. I would buy a copy if it was on DVD and it's too bad it is not. One would think that something was brought with Peter Sellers. Much better than "Being There" and as good as the Pink Panther series. Uschi Digard had a small part for such a well-equipped actor. She is bonus in this movie. I think the medical profession may not appreciate this movie because it really makes fun of the profession, and it is also clear that Sellers was never available to treat her as bedridden and his Analyze urine samples.
