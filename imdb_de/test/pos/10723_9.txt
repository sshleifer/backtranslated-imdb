Life was great for New York artist Ted Kramer. He had a great job and a loving wife. No, actually his wife was not so loving, because when Ted came home from work late at night, his wife Joanna had packed a suitcase and went out the door. He tried to stop her, but she was just getting in the elevator and leaving Ted's life. Well, in addition to his job, he now has to think of the house as well as her 6-year-old son Billy; Ted assured his boss that his wife's departure would not affect his job in any way. However, it influenced his performance as a father. He was blown up when Billy hit his customer graphic! Well, some time later, Ted and Billy receive a letter from Joanna, and it became clear from their letter that she did not come back. Ted was disturbed. Well, he came home too late from Billy's birthday, which hurt Billy. <br /> <br /> Ted was one day late for work and his boss shouted at him for missing a very important customer meeting. When he got home, he called Billy to eat ice cream during the meal. Later, he told Billy honestly that the separation between him and Joanna might have been his fault, not Billy's. Ted invited a good friend that night, Phyllis Bernard, and now Billy saw a naked woman for the first time. When Ted brought Billy to the park the next day, he dropped out of the climbing frame and landed face first on his toy plane. Ted literally took him to the hospital where they had to manage tricks. After that, Ted started a downward spiral. Then, out of the blue, he received a call from none other than Joanna! They met in a corner cafe. At first they talk pleasantly, but then Joanna informs that she has returned to pick up her son and take him along. Ted had none of it and stormed out. Life got even worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, took him to lunch and fired him abruptly. Not only that, but Joanna decided to sue Billy for custody, and without a job, Ted had no chance to win. He hired a lawyer, John Shaunessy, who billed a nice penny: $ 15,000 in exact change. And that's when they win. <br /> <br /> Ted also found a new job. It was indeed a step back from what he used to do with a substantial salary cut, but he accepted with great determination. At last the day of the Tribunal, January 9, 1980, had arrived. Judge Atkins presides. Joanna took the stance, and Shaunessy asked her why she had left Ted and what her other relationships were and how they failed. The next day Ted took the stand and Joanna's lawyer grilled him like a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend Margaret also took the position and she really did not help with it. Well, the judge needed some time to think about it, and one day Shaunessy Ted informs that he has lost. Joanna was given sole custody of Billy. How typical! Always in favor of the mother. Well, Ted and Billy were just devastated. They had a tearful farewell when suddenly Joanna stopped by. She and Ted talk a little and well, instead of just telling the end, I want to assure everyone that everything is fine for everyone! <br /> <br /> This was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He received the Oscar. I also saw him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, for which he also won an Oscar. Meryl Streep was good. She also got an Oscar. Justin Henry was good too, so where was his nomination? I suspect the Academy had a ruling against awarding Oscars to children, but this rule was lifted when Haley Joel Osment came. This movie has a great drama, light comedy and is very subtle. It's a good job to keep your attention. I saw Rain Man on TCM the other day, then it came down and I could not help but watch. And you should do that. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies of this genre, then I recommend Kramer Vs. Chandler! A gripping film about the pain of two divorced parents fighting over their child. I liked Ted's little speech about having chosen mothers all the time. What makes sex good parents? Actually, they have the child. But seriously, he's right. Why always rule for the mother, because she is a woman? Also in the cast, George Coe, Howard Duff, who died in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain, who died in 1984. See also Kramer vs Kramer today !!! Good movie !! <br /> <br /> -
