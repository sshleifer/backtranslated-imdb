Allegedly a story about the child of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. The kid is kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. They know something about the intention to assassinate the ambassador of an unknown country during a performance at the Albert Hall in London. <br /> <br /> The film is full of incidents in Hitchcock. A friendly but obscure Frenchman seems to cook the innocent Stewart - an Indiana doctor - a bit too intense to be just curious. Later, the Frenchman appears in Arabian disguise, a knife in his back, and whispers some information to Stewart about the murder plan. Stewart tells his wife - Doris Day, who looks very naughty - but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son's life. Instead, the couple tries to track down the killers, buy them up and get their son back and take him from Morocco, where Hitchcock has brought us his usual tourist look into the customs, places and food in London. There is a funny wild goose hunt between Stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop. The staff are more concerned about guarding their half-stuffed specimens than anything else, and they protectively mix with the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish. In the course of the run, Stewart manages to save his neck from cutting the swordfish, but is bitten by a stuffed tiger in the hand, which is stimulated by Bernard Hermann's bold score. The scene ends with Stewart storming out the door. Hitchcock kills him with a shot of a lion's head gaping at the slammed door. There's also a running gag, well done, about some visitors waiting around the couple's hotel room in London, waiting for things to be explained. <br /> <br /> There are two serious issues that are easily addressed. One is the relationship between Stewart and Day, which is not as rosy as it should be, and is considered a bourgeois ideal. She has been a stage musician for several years and is known internationally. And she has given up everything to marry a common man who happens to be a doc. This is understandable, for example, for a nurse or flight attendant or for almost any other woman as an international star with a promising career. It will not be discussed further, but the intransigence is conspicuous since it was not in the original version. It reminds me a little of an exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his then wife Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from talking to the troops in Korea. "Oh, Joe," she enthused, "have you ever seen ten thousand people standing up and cheering?" "Seventy thousand," muttered Joe, the former hero of the New York Yankees. The second problem is loyalty. Who is of greater social value? A own little son? Or an unknown ambassador. Do we endanger ourselves or our nationals for national stability? The day is facing this dilemma at the height of Albert Hall. Their solution decides to respect political stability, although their motives are problematic. Is she crying to save the ambassador's life, or is she just doing it to release the fear that overwhelms her? (See: Alec Guiness falls on the detonator at the end of "The Bridge on the River Kwai.") The photography is extremely good and the attitudes can be menacing, even on a quiet street in a residential district of London. It's noon, and Stewart is alone and determined, but also scared. There are footsteps that are echoed somewhere on Gulliver Street. Is he persecuted? Is his life in danger? And where the hell are all those who live in this street? Hitchcock pays close attention to the location details so that we can see the garden wall bonding of the bricks next to him. The director had a rare disagreement with Francois Truffaut while being interviewed for Truffaut's other eulogy. Truffaut argued that the earlier version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" lacked the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied, "It seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience," she finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version of a professional. No dispute. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock is pretty close to his zenith.
