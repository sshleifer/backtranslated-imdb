ccmovieman-1 must be, as the reviewer of the New York Times, who preferred the album "Janis Joplin Big Brother" and "Holding Company" to the Beatles' recently released "White" album, either evil or crazy. National Velvet is a great movie. Elizabeth Taylor's performance is fantastic, and I can not even recognize accents, let alone too much. Her performance is very natural, authentic and incredibly charming. The rest of the cast is outstanding, especially Rooney and Revere. <br /> <br /> As far as the dialogue is hokey or sentimental, I suggest that cc has eaten too long on a diet with irony and has lost the ability to detect real direct emotions and human interaction. There was a time when people actually thought and talked like that. Not that this movie does not have a touch of magic that permeates it. That is the reason to tell the story. One could also criticize the Wizard of Oz, King Kong, the Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, the Black Stallion (the other great horse movie) or a thousand other films for having action and dialogue richer than real life. No, my friend, National Velvet is holding out because he is close to his body and his tongue is stuck to his cheek. Something that today's jaded filmmakers can not find is almost impossible to restore.
