In fact, Cynthia Watros is in this movie when Elizabeth talks to Desmond. Although I'm just wondering how she landed as a "rehab patient" (?), Where Hurley is also in and trying to reduce his weight (as seen in previous episodes), the last episode is really exposed. The end is not so understandable. I think the author expected the audience to see a third season coming. <br /> <br /> I just hope the next season will shed more light on unclear / hanging events that have happened. <br /> <br /> Can not wait to get on Season 3.
