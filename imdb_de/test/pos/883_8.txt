Good movie. At the beginning, I thought it was a kind of detective hi-fi movie, but the end totally surprised me. I think the whole movie covers too many topics, each one of which may be the main theme, for example: Revenge, friendship and dream. But it mixed them all, without focusing on any of them. I think it would be a great movie if it was built around the end from the beginning. <br /> <br />
