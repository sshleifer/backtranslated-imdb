Interesting cartoon included on the DVD of "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra". I especially like the way the color was used in the background art - very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like that!). <br /> <br /> I wonder, Anyway, a certain ... um, finger gesture ... has passed the censors. Admittedly, in 1937 the gesture in question became much rarer than it is today. You'd think someone else than the animators would have noticed - especially because he was seen three times in the scene in question! And because of the context, I suspect its inclusion was intentional. Something the animators jumped into, just to see if the censors would notice!
