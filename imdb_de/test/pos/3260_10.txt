Many years ago I saw this movie (maybe on TV?) And was thrilled. So I decided to rent it on DVD recently to see if it still holds up to my assessment. It did <br /> <br /> In Sydney's famous King's Cross neighborhood (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex shops thrive), it tells the story of "Jimmy" (played by Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man ... maybe a late teenager who did not yet have a stable family background. He is on the margins of society and works as a tout for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). He knows an underworld figure called "Pando", a local Bigwig in the cross. It's Jimmy's hope that he's on Pandos radar and "joining in" with him ... he's an acronym for social mobility, he hopes. <br /> <br /> One evening Jimmy meets the beautiful young woman Alex (played by the charming Rose Byrne). They only know that a love story will take place between them. Also this night, Jimmy is first contacted by Pando (played by Bryan Brown). Pando has a 'job' for Jimmy. It's the "foot in the door" that Jimmy was waiting for! <br /> <br /> Too much to reveal would destroy the many surprises this movie holds for the viewer. If you like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie movies, you should stylistically agree with what you have to expect ... twists and turns and black comedy -ness'. It's not just a throw off of Tarantino or Ritchie, but a real Australian contribution to the genre. <br /> <br /> A fascinating aspect of this film is how it all hangs together. Sometimes you become familiar with characters who wonder what the hell they are doing there. In the end, all these "loose ends" are beautifully connected. It's a bit like a celluloid Moebius strip. <br /> <br /> A highlight of the film is Bryan Brown's character of Pando. Pando likes puzzles and it's fun to play with his friends. It's the little details that have been revealed about him that are so pleasing ... his taste in music for beginners! <br /> <br /> From the Heath Ledger movies I've seen (The Dark Knight, 10 things I hate about you) This may be his best role. Was not recorded with "10 things". If you're a fan of Heath Ledger (Ledger recently died of a tragic accidental death), this is a chance to see him in his biggest Australian role, I think. There's great chemistry between Ledger and Byrne in this movie. On one level, it acts as a beautiful love story. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have the horror of the underworld movies of Tarantino and Ritchie, However there are some adult themes, scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty. In that sense, it's not an ideal movie for the very young audience, but it's not a movie that Gore-Hounds will look forward to as well. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to say that Australia can make great films. Usually, the kind of movies that my homeland does is uninteresting. This film has strengths where many Australian films have weaknesses ... d. H. It has a great story, great acting and a great script. We need more popular, high-quality films to be filmed here in Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. Other Australian films I've loved are: <br /> <br /> Breaker Morant (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My brilliant career (not rated here by me yet) Proof (s) The Devil's Playground (nr) The Year My Voice Broke (nr) Bad Boy Bubby (No. A Great, Dark Comedy) The Dish (No. A Great, Charming Comedy)
