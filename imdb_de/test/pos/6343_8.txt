I was reluctant to see the return to the lonely pigeon after seeing and enjoying the original so much. Without Tommy Lee Jones, who portrayed his role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara, I thought it was simply not authentic enough. When I see 'return', I can honestly say that it is a worthy successor. The actors really do the show with Jon Voight, Rick Schroder and Oliver Reed. I admit, the story may not be quite as compelling as the first one, but "return" definitely has some of the excitement and captures the romance of the Old West like no other movie. Anyone with reservations can rest assured that The Return to Lonesome Dove will capture the "feel" of the original and will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and check it out, Ol 'Gus would be proud!
