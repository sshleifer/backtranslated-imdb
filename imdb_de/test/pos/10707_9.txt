For once, a story of hope emphasized the tragic reality of our youth. Favela Rising draws you into a frightening, insecure and unfair world, showing through beautiful colors and moving music how a man and his dedicated friends do not accept this world and change it through action and art. A fun, interesting, emotional and aesthetically beautiful movie. I also showed this film to many high school students, all of whom live in neighborhoods with poverty and gun violence. They were in love with Anderson, the protagonists. I recommend this movie to all ages over 13 (due to subtitles and some death images) from all backgrounds.
