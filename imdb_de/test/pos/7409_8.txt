This is one of my personal favorites, a rare little gem that the population does not seem to discover. Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson form the heart of the piece in a well-chosen cast. Few films have ever captured the true animosity that led to civil war, but it seems to capture the right notes and moods. If you're a fan of Cold Mountain, try this movie and see if you do not think it's a good companion.
