I received this as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs. I did not know anything about the story of the series. Season 1 of the series includes the episode 1 episodes and then 3 more episodes for Season 4, total 2, which lists 5 episodes, with the last part being "Beyond Good and Evil", with an original broadcast date of December 7, 1998. The other 4 episodes The second season was aired from December 1997 to Febrausry 1998. This is what Beyond Good and Evil looks like the third episode of season one, except that there are no more episodes in the third season. <br /> <br /> spoilers here. The two main characters of the first eight episodes, dr. Iain McCallum (John Hannah) and dr. Angela Moloney (Zara Turner), missing in this episode, by Dr. Dan Gallagher (Nathaniel Parker) and dr. Charley Fielding (Eva Pope). I recognized Nathaniel Parker from the series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, which began in 2001. They planned a season 3, but only one episode was aired. <br /> <br /> It seems strange to continue a series named after the main character McCallum, when the main character from the series has disappeared. You may have had a return from Dr. Iain McCallum planned, but when this failed, the series was canceled. I do not have inside information, but I see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker were involved in other projects back in 1999. Does anyone have information about it?
