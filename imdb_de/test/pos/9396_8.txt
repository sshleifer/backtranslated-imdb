I'm not sure what I can add, which has not been said in some other subtle and rather funny comments, but I'll try. <br /> <br /> So you know the plot: There's a bed that has a demon that "picks up" the bodies of who (or whatever) lies on top of it with its orange soda-filled body and selectively dissolves. We have the man who in some scenes looks like Robert Smith of The Cure and hangs on the wall to comment on the goings on, and we have our various victims who just can not resist the comfort of this mystical bed. <br /> <br /> This is not an ordinary bed. No Sir Bob! It not only eats people, but it cleans itself, withdraws the covers and even makes it yourself. Who does not want such a bed? It can even use its leaves as a rudimentary "lasso" to beat back escaped victims (especially if they claim half of the film to try to escape). <br /> <br /> Our "main" story (if you can call it that) is about those three girls who go to this remote area to sit there (??). I do not remember exactly, but it does not matter, because there are many things that are beyond convention that you just have to give in and accept. The dialogue in the film is like no other; The characters seem to speak telepathically, as their mouth never seems to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls thinks she is not liked by the rest of the Gang, and she makes sure that she communicates to us all her feelings about the issue through an echo of her voice, but we do not care. The character development was thrown out of the window long ago in this movie. So why start now? There are scenes in which the bed laughs, snores, crunches, and makes various other noises that we think will make our cast respond to those sounds that can not be heard. This and the telepathy make the Diegesis problem very hard to pinpoint ... but that's fine ... that's the deathbed: the bed that eats and it contradicts logic, so it's fine. This most bizarre movie offers a lush dreamy quality. If you buy this DVD (hehe buy ... did I say "buy"?), You should watch the introduction by the director. He explains that the filming of this "film" began in 1972, was completed in 1977, was shopped for a few years without success, and then was quickly released on DVD after 26 years until 2003. Probably someone somewhere had a printout of it in another country and made bootlegs after bootlegs of it and it was quite by chance on a message board that our director found evidence that people knew and gasped for! took care of his little-known movie. From there he decided to try and publish it. I'm glad he did it. If you've heard the title of this movie before, you MUST see it. I will buy this and I will preach the gospel all over the world ... starting with this comment
