The story of The Milkwoman is a simple story of unfulfilled love that is still strong despite decades. Now, 50 years old, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and works two jobs. one as a cashier in a supermarket, the other as Milklady, who was traveling daily on the hills of Nagasaki. One of their stops is the home of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a government official who looks after his terminally ill wife Yoko (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita used to see themselves as school children, but after the death of Minako's mother and Kaita's father, who apparently had an affair, their own relationship was destroyed. However, Yoko, lying in her bedside, knows that her husband's feelings for the Milkladie have not completely vanished, and for Kaita's sake after she dies, she tries to find a means to reunite her. <br /> Although the story is simple, the emotions and the means by which they express it are the heart and beauty of the movie. The film takes time to show the simple everyday routines of each character. Her actions are recorded by an old lady writing her story for a book while looking after her own husband, who shows signs of dementia. It shows the social circumstances of people from different walks of life, how they interact with each other on a daily basis, how relationships develop and how past and present can collide. The director masters this wonderfully with a strong structure and a visual style. Later in the film, the story follows a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if it were actually designed to fit into the narrative structure of the book being written. All this is confirmed by the emotional depths that touch the film, which is best expressed in the extraordinary performance of Yuko Tanaka.
