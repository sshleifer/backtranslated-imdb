I first saw "Death in Venice" about 15 years ago, it was deeply moving and thought about it many times. When I saw it again a few days ago, I realized that it was close to the top of the big works of cinema. With hardly any dialogue, it captivates a beholder with the beautiful cinematography, the fine acting and above all the Mahler music, without which the film simply could not exist. <br /> <br /> "Death in Venice" is an overwhelming impression Luchino Visconti's adaptation of the Thomas Mann novella on a famous composer (in the novella he was a writer, but in a movie to make a composer was one great idea that works wonderfully). Gustav von Aschenbach (loose after Gustav Mahler), who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures. His search for beauty and perfection seems to be over when he sees a boy of unbelievable divine beauty. Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy everywhere and never tries to approach him. The young Tadzio belonged to very rare creatures that have a mysterious and unimaginable power that fascinates, charms, vanquishes, makes you a prisoner. Ashenbach became one of the captives of Tadzio, the fascinating charms. He became addicted to him; he fell in love with him. Was it a blessing or a curse for him? I think both. He died of an unattainable, impossible and yet beautiful love whose purpose was perfection. The last image that had captured the eyes of Ashenbach was the silhouette of the boy, surrounded by sea and golden sunlight. Nothing compares to the beauty and charm of the scene and it is the death of which one can only dream. If he could, Ashenbach would probably have said, "I could testify to one of the faces of accomplishment, I could not stand it, but I was chosen to know that it exists in this world and I can now die in peace because of myself that happened. "<br /> <br /> Unforgettable music. Gustav Mahler's haunting adagietto of his Fifth Symphony found its perfect place in a perfect film. It reflects every feeling of a protagonist - it is sobbing, longing, it is asking for hope, and it summarizes the idea that once one is blessed to face beauty, one is condemned to death. I have hundreds of films that perfectly complement classical music, but nothing is compared to "Death in Venice". I dare not say that Mahler's music is his main character - it would change and sound different depending on what happened on the screen. It sounded triumphant as Ashenbach returned to Venice, which he thought was his luck, but his death became. It sounded bleak when he first entered Venice from the sea. You can hear so many different feelings in it - tenderness and worship, confusion and self-hatred, worship and melancholy, but always - LOVE, which gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts (literally). The movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was to the aging composer / writer / artist. We are enchanted and fascinated by his strength and beauty as well as Achenbach by the mysterious charm of the boy.
