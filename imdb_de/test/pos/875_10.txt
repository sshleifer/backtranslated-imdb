This is one of the best movies I have seen in recent years. Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles. He's a na√Øve plantation owner, and she's an enigmatic trickster saying that this is a movie that explores the dark side of love and the pain, humiliation and self-deception associated with it, even though it is dressed as a film noir. Forget about this faint remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the real thing instead and indulge in moments of great cinematic beauty.
