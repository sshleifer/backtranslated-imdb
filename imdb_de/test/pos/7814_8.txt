I first saw this on TV a few days ago. I expected that I would only turn on for a few minutes, but the film fascinated me. In the end I looked at everything and it was surprisingly convincing. The show of the three American leads was pretty good, especially Alex Cord's. He plays a gunslinger with a degree of vulnerability. Quite unlike most of them in Western. He landed in various situations in which he was at the mercy of the bounty hunters. The last shoot between the three leads and the bad guys was very good, as well as the scene where the doctor digs out a ball from Clay McCord. Something cruel, but realistic. I have to admit that despite my initial reluctance to see a "spaghetti western", I have quite enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns.
