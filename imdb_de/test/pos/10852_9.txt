I loved this movie. Not because of the romantic action between women, but because of the representation of human strength, despair and liberation. This movie is a must. Entertaining! Emotionally! Captivating! All characters are very well written and presented by some very talented actors. This story is a story of self-discovery and sexual awakening. A journey of mind, body and soul. You identify with the characters and in some places even the plot. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I recommend to watch the movie first and then read the book. If you read the book first, you will easily be disappointed. The script adaptation has cut a lot and some things have changed. Some for the better and some for the worst.
