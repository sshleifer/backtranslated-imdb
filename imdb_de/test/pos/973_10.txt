This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. A 14-year-old boy, Jason Shepherd, wrote an English newspaper called Big Fat Liar. When his skateboarding was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to college on time and bump into a limousine. When he got into the limo, he met a famous Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. When he left the limousine, he forgot one thing: his newspaper! So Marty Wolf took it and turned Jason's English newspaper into a movie! When Jason admitted that he had left his newspaper in the limousine and Marty had taken it, his parents and his English teacher did not believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood so Marty could admit that he'd stolen his story from Jason's parents. When Jason asks Marty to call his father that Marty stole this paper, Marty tricked him and burned his paper! Jason got so angry that Marty burnt the paper, so Marty called for security to get Jason out of his site! Jason and Kaylee realized that Marty would not admit the truth. To defeat Marty in Phase 2: The Takedown, Jason and Kaylee permanently filled the pool with blue dye and when Marty breaks in, his body turns blue and the body does not turn blue! Then they filled Marty's shampoo permanently with orange dye, and when he uses it, his hair turns orange and it would not fall off! Eventually, they stick a lot on Marty's earphones so he can call Jason's dad, and when Marty uses him, he sticks to his ear! It was funny when Marty's hair and body turned completely blue and orange and his headset was stuck to his ear! Then she cheated on Marty, telling Marty's assistant to Monty that Duncan had moved into a house where a party was taking place. When Marty visited Duncan, he was in the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! When Marty was in the house, Jason and Kaylee changed the controls of his car. When Marty drove his car, he knew that all the controls were switched and he did not know which button to press. He's stupid enough to fall for it. When Marty hit the back end of the stamper, the rammer destroyed his car! It was so funny. So Marty starts calling Jason's dad and resubmitting him! He phoned, but it was not his father, he called security! After the security guards brought Jason and Kaylee from Marty's website, they suggested they go home. Monty would be on the side of Jason and Kaylee because she knew Marty was a liar and a jerk, so she told Rocco, who is one of the security people, that she will take care of the children. Jason told his father the truth about what he was up to in the last two days and his parents came to LA. When Monty came to the children, she would help the children get into Phase 4: The Payback. Jason splits the crew for Phase 4 into 3 teams. A team will distract and deceive Marty until Jason's parents come to the set. Marty rode first with Frank Jackson, but his car collapsed, so he drove with Jaleel, but he took him to the desert and left him there. When Marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. Then one of the blades is jammed, so Marty and the pilot have left the helicopter. After that, he was on his way to the set and when Jason saw him, Marty stopped and saw what Jason had: his monkey! So Marty went after Jason and Kaylee and when they saw Lester, he let go of the water and when the water came, Marty was pushed away from him. Marty was still after the kids, and when Kaylee took the other path, Jason led Marty to the top of the apartment building. At the top, Jason challenged Marty by making him admit the truth, and Marty will never tell the truth. When the crew met Marty in surprise, everyone, including Jason's parents on the set, knew what Marty was doing. Marty would kill Jason, but the only way for Jason to escape is to jump from above! Afterwards his parents believed that Marty had recorded his story. When the people who were on set left, this is the end of Marty. In the end, Jason's story Big Fat Liar was a movie. I can not get enough of it.
