This is both a fun and touching version of the classic story, and quite intelligent, not by the "Me Tarzan, You Jane" school at all. <br /> <br /> It is the famous story of a child who has been educated to masculinity in the jungle of monkeys. A titled British couple (the pregnant woman) is stranded after a shipwreck in the wilds of Africa. After the death of the parents, the baby is raised by monkeys in the jungle. Twenty years later, this young man (d. H. Tarzan) rescues a wounded Belgian explorer and nurses him well. The Belgian discovers evidence that his savior is the young Lord Greystoke, and returns him to his rightful ownership in Scotland, where he must adapt to civilized society. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. In the first half we see Tarzan in his jungle environment. Not being an expert, I do not realize the realism of his portrayal of the monkey's community life, but it's certainly entertaining. For me, the more moving part is the second half, where Tarzan has to get to know his real family, develop language skills, and adapt to aristocratic British society while wooing Jane (Andie MacDowell). He is portrayed as a "noble savage", whether in the wild or in elegant Edwardian salons. In contrast, the upper crust is often rendered more barbaric than the jungle left by Tarzan. Christopher Lambert is fantastic in his sympathetic portrayal of Tarzan in both the jungle and the civilized environment. It gives a real sense of its confusion and conflict, torn between the two very different worlds, its original monkey family and its new human. As always, Sir Ralph Richardson, one of the ancient British legends, is brilliant in the role of Tarzan's grandfather, the Sixth Earl of Greystoke. <br /> <br /> The film focuses more on Tarzan's struggles in adapting to civilization and his inner conflict than in his jungle outbursts. This unusual interpretation of the old classic makes it a typical dramatic adventure, but above all a moving personal story. I was not surprised to know that the director is the same person, Hugh Hudson, who also directed Chariots of Fire, another brilliant film.
