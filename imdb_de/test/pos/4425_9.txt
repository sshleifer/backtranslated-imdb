On the other hand, I like Rachael Ray. It's fun, sweet, fresh and such a pleasure to see. I have to change almost everything she does because I'm a vegetarian ... but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a TV personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still looks down to earth. The studio audience seems to be rather small, but that only provides for a cozy environment. Some people have posted that the show is shitty. I think it depends on your own interpretation and on it. If you notice the early episodes of 30-minute meals, you will see a completely different personality than in the past few years. I am sure she will find her comfort zone with this show as well. Good luck, Rachael!
