I really loved this movie! One of Drew's best. I'm also a fan of Michael Vartan, so I thought he was so hot in this movie. Why all the bad reviews. I would want to watch this movie again and again if I could. I loved the end, too. This movie clearly showed a smile on my face! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba were there. I love both, so I also highlighted this movie. In the end, when Drew made the big commentary on the truth, he really did tell the truth about what sometimes happens in high school. Again the movie was amazing. Defiant a 10/10. I hope this comment was very useful for every IMDb reader.
