What a tribute to his father! He set out to find out more about a man he knew little about, and at the end of the journey I believe that Nathaniel Kahn is satisfied with what he has learned and personally felt. The film is five years in the development phase and a quarter of a century after his death. Louis I. Kahn's unrestricted commitment to his work - a consistent effort to build buildings that are significant to humanity and timeless to the entire world, with insight into His life, becomes proud of his son Nathaniel in the documentary "My Architect: The Journey of a son ". The film is by no means an anthology of Louis' work. There are many books and archive materials containing records of Louis Kahn's projects and buildings. This documentary looks like a mystery. The author and director Nathaniel Kahn searched for the man he briefly knew as his father. <br /> <br /> The film is in chapters. In "Heading West" we are at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. It's a sight to behold - Kahn's integrated approach to building and the environment, as well as the optimization of light for the scientists at work, is amazing. From a former colleague who worked with 'Lou' 35 years ago, we learn of his meticulous attention to detail and how 'rambunctious' he might be - in any case he has not lost words in his criticism. A memorable scene is when the camera was pulled back a long way and we see Nathaniel running around the Salk Institute Square - a tiny character who plays like a child happily playing in his father's bowl. <br /> <br /> The Immigrant segment led us to a meeting with Anne Tyng, the architect who worked cooperatively with Lou and gave birth to a daughter, Alex. Now, at the age of 80, Tyng's return with Nathaniel's crew on the Bath House project in Trenton, New Jersey, was nostalgic. In "Go to the Sea" we see the barge of the American Wind Symphony Orchestra - all made of steel - and meet Robert Boudreau, who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally told him that he is 'Lou's son'. Boudreau was touched, he said he saw Nathaniel when he was six, with his mother (Harriet Pattison), and he was not supposed to tell anyone that Lou had a son. It was a "stifling" emotional moment of reunion. <br /> <br /> Like his father, "The Nomad", Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem and learned about the synagogue's project that his father started but was not realized. He visited the Wailing Wall, and when he saw his Jarmulke fall / "blown off" his head, I felt he did not have to be "totally" Jewish to be his father's son. We continue with his two half-sisters in the "Family Matters" segment. We also hear him talking to his mother in Maine, and from conversations with former employees at his father's office, we learn how his father worked there intensively and practiced. He sleeps on a carpet on the office floor, on weekends and in all other places. <br /> <br /> "The End of the Journey" took us to Ahmedabad, India, to the building of the Indian Institute of Management. The conversation with the architect B. V. Doshe was a revelation. In the end, Nathaniel found a very lively Louis Kahn, his father - his spirits live in him. This documentary is a pure jerk for me. I had tears in my eyes most of the time - it was very touching and awesome about the man, the architect and his son, and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to give his love to the "whole world" juggling work and three families (one could say he has three wives in his life to keep his inspiration). As Shamsul Wares, the architect of the Capital of Bangladesh complex (nine years after 'Lou''s death) remarked, "Louis Kahn has given the people of Bangladesh plenty of time to stay in Bangladesh and understand the culture of the place and the people - they give not only democracy through what he has achieved, and for such a dedicated man, as a rule, the people in his vicinity, he often misses. It seems that the price for the best is great, with inevitable personal sacrifices. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of King Vidor's "The Fountainhead" 1949 (a good black-and-white story with Max Steiner's music) based on Ayn Rand's novel, with Gary Cooper as an uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals and Patricia Neal as the parallel supporting wife in his life. <br /> <br />
