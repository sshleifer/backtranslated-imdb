This interesting movie Noir offers three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming as a detective is unfortunately not that good. He lacks the intelligence, strength and cynical worldview of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played that role, we could have had a classic. Tempo, location (a library) and atmosphere are all good. But there are some action holes. Sanders fears Blackmer and the reckless organization (Nazis) he represents. After accidentally killing Blackmer, Sanders does not seem to experience fear or remorse. Sanders then confiscates the library and its inhabitants with the cunning that he and his men are detectives investigating the murder. However, Sanders' hitman later attempts to kill Demming by shooting at him (without silencer), although many other prisoners could be expected to hear the noise and be alerted. Finally, Sanders's hit man tries to kill Roberts, who has discovered the truth, but if she faints, he does not do it inexplicably. <br /> <br /> What bothered me the most, however, was wasting the chance of a great and unexpected conclusion. Throughout the film, Patrick is portrayed as a smart sociopath who is not afraid of anything. But in the end, she flees in panic from the last surviving Nazi, a brutal thug. When the cops find him, he killed her. And in the end, she's just another weak, stereotypical victim. What should have happened is this: The cops find the Nazi bat, but he is dead. She deftly killed him and then disappeared - to continue her evil ways.
