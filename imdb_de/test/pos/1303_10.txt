GLORIFYING, NOT THE GLAMORIZING WWII. <br /> <br /> We had some documentary series about the Second World War in regular television programs. Without looking up information in an encyclopedia or movie book, it seems that this old reminder might recall most names all by itself. <br /> <br /> There was CRUSADE IN EUROPE, which was the title of the War Memoirs of a General of the Army and later the 33rd President of the United States of America, Dwight D. Eisenhower. It told the story of the conflict in Europe from the point of view of the Supreme Allied Commander. Then there was a CRUSADE IN THE PACIFIC (self-explanatory topic) that I do not remember very much. Jim Bishop was the presenter / author of BATTLELINE. <br /> <br /> And there was the excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIANT YEARS. * The series was a coproduction of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Corporation. It aired here in The States for the first time in the 1960-61 season and boasts of letting Richard Burton speak the words of Sir Winston. <br /> <br /> It's the production of our current topic, the VICTORY AT, of the 1952 SEA NBC Television Network, which wins the cigar, no doubt. <br /> <br /> First, the production had to have cost several years of careful and literal sorting through thousands of hours of filming. The footage referred to here was the official recording of the members of the US Army, the independent weekly film, the filming of our other Allied partner states, as well as Axis images from Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and Germany Imperial Japan. <br /> <br /> Once this was done, the film had to be cut and cut in 1/2 hour rates. This was done with great skill, since there were so many scene changes, whether abruptly or as a crossfade. The look of each episode looks as smooth as if it had been a single film project. <br /> <br /> Writing the spoken word to this best movie of real life was no less amazing and unique. Highly polished and meaningful eloquence does not waste a word, and sometimes even underestimates the description of the plot instead of exaggerating it. The narrative goes to Mr. Ralph Graves, who was a talented actor for stage, film, radio and television. He certainly attained a degree of immortality through his golden intonation of written episodes. <br /> <br /> Finally, VICTORY AT SEA has the luxury of having an original score, both the opening theme and the stage music of Richard Rodgers of Broadway (Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein) His compositions are complicated, full, variable and in the true sense even "classic". <br /> <br /> The classic arrangement was played by the NBC Symphonic Orchestra under the direction of Robert Russell Bennett and as a soundtrack / cassette / CD it has been constantly available and in demand since its first release 55 years ago! And really a little wonder, because it is this music that fascinates the viewer / listener so much. It really makes the icing on this cake. <br /> <br /> * SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIANT YEARS also had a beautiful and memorable original score. This was also written by Mr. Rodgers. <br /> <br /> ** We also had in our house "Ace in the Hole" in the person of our father, the late Clemens J. Ryan (1914-74). , Dad had been in the US during the war and was shot in 1943 or 44. Our pop was always available to explain and explain the situations presented in the series. He and our mother, the now 90-year-old Bertha (née Fürst), already had my older sister Joanne (1942-90) as an addict.
