John Wayne's first starring role just blew me away. In AMC's TV mailbox style, I had to see if I had the right date. Of course, this movie was made in 1930 using 55mm widescreen technology. Apart from that, it contains some of the dirtiest and most realistic footage of the Trek West I've ever seen. Cart, men and animals are really lowered by a rope from a cliff. Trees are chopped by burly men - and burly women - so that the train can go another 10 feet. The Indians are not the "pretty boys" they later portrayed. They are the real deal. A river crossing in a heavy rainstorm is so realistic that it has to be real (in fact, I understand that director Raoul Walsh almost lost the entire cast during this sequence). I could smell the wet canvas. Every day is agony. The various negotiations are forgotten, but the film as a whole is not. I can not think of another title that can beat The Big Trail by evoking a sense of living history on the way to Oregon. Bravo.
