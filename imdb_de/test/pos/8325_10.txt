This BBC series is excellent. I'm not a paleontologist, but this series offers the best historical account of dinosaurs I've ever seen. The 3D animation and animatronics are very good and let you think you have traveled back in time. The BBC deserves a hit on the back for such a beautiful series and Tim Haines, who had spent a lot of time sending this series.
