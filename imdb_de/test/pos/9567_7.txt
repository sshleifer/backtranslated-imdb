Well, in 2002 I still have some catching up to do. Looking back on a lackluster year, Best In Show shone. No great action. Small Action Just a cavalcade of great characters. Special reference to Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as a rattling pair of TV commentators. Well done. Worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Ron (24Mar2001)
