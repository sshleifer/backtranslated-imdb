OK, I did not read the book ???? And maybe the book was better ????, WHO KNOWS ??? // But I loved the movie. It was entertaining, not boring, pleasant and above all heartbreaking. The friendship between the two children was so pure and innocent. These children have done so well, especially the son of the servant. Oh my God, that's like the form of God on the face of EARTH. ARGHHHH he steals our hearts so easily. ********* Spoiler ****************************************** ************************************************** BUT I got mad when he gave up and ignored his friend when he needed to be comforted. Anyway, he was just a kid and a bit stubborn. I wish the movie had also shown the older version of the poor kid. I'm sorry to think only of the end. This movie is sad. I was terribly sad at the end. Tears came to my eyes. Yes, the background notes are fantastic, the scenes are WOW. The dragon scenes are fascinating. And well, it will be a bit of adventure in the middle. Wonderfully played and superbly staffed. The kids have done so well. BIG direction. I do not know why this movie did not bring the critics WOOO. But I'm sure WOO. 10/10 Do you have to see ??????
