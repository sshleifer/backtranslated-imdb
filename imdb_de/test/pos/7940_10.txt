A stunning work of art. You can see every image of the movie and see the beauty in it. First, I would like to say that when I saw the German military helmets, I understood that it was "Star Wars Wars" from here, the scene in which they kill the baby is scary, and when I was I saw it, I did not like it, but when the movie was over I thought about the scene and I changed my mind and thought in World War II that was exactly what the Germans did. <br /> < br /> The Ice Battle scene is one of the best war scenes I've ever seen (if not the BEST), so this movie combines music and is so breathtaking! Visual images are truly outstanding. "The Prokofiev score is one of those History's most famous soundtracks, and I thought it would be one of the best. <br /> <br /> What can you say as a work? art.Eisenstein has created an impressive masterpiece, a propaganda film, and a beautiful work of art happy, because I ger had stopped the criterium collection of Eisenstein.
