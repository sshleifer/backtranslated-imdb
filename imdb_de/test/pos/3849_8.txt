"The Aristocats" is classic Disney at its best. It's not considered the ultimate Disney classic alongside the more popular Disney movies, but it's a well-made and entertaining movie that definitely deserves a Disney classic. "Aristocats" is certainly a safe children's enjoyment, because it contains all the components for a funny children's film. I will really like it as a kid. I'm not sure if this movie can please the adults who might benefit Disney classics for its nostalgia, but I enjoy watching this movie as a young adult. <br /> <br /> Storywise, "Aristocats" may not be as complex or innovative, but it does not matter. This film originated from the time when the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were history and vice versa, which certainly shows "Aristocats". The characters do the movie; They are all sympathetic, fun, have great lines and a great interaction with each other. The voice actors are also part of making the characters so convincing (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley, etc.). The dogs Napoleon and Lafayette may have been a misunderstanding since they are showstoppers and do not have much to do with the actual story, but luckily they make fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold. <Br /> <br /> "Aristocats" is both entertaining and cute, but it's also a very funny cartoon. The animation style and look are perfect for the French environment of the movie (especially the city of Paris looks great). The character animation and the design are great. And the songs are also very catchy. My favorite is "Scale and Arpeggios," but the theme song is a sweet song, along with "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and the memorable show stopper "Everybody Wants To Be A Cat." And the score of George Burns fits perfectly with the funny and emotional situations of the movie. All in all, "Aristocats" is, in my opinion, the best Disney cartoon from the 70s and a movie that deserves to be seen and remembered by both. So, what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor and share this Disney classic with your kids. It deserves to be in her memories.
