It would have been expected that Hitchcock's return to the big studio movie films would be on the side of tentative caution. Surely only a few expected his rebellious, unbridled film, a happy blend of vicious black comedy, exciting excitement, mocking manipulation, and amazing imagination. But that's exactly what they got: CREATOR ON ONE TRAIN. <br /> <br /> It is remarkable how much the transgression of Bruno disturbs the world of the film. The masterful cross motif has much of the goal, but its immediate effect is to block the straight line of progress that Guy makes from his life, and thus the society he represents or likes to do. Guy is the archetypal American, the working-class boy who moves well in influential circles, athletic, successful, and handsome. Bruno is his destructive opponent, gay, decadent, "European" (he lives from his father, in a big house and only as a lounge when he dreams of murder). Bruno's life consists of repetition, circularity, while Guy goes straight. It is Bruno's achievement to put Guy into his realm (represented by the merry-go-round) and force him to break the law (breaking the law, hoping for murder (Bruno's)). Bruno is literally fighting the patriarchy. All the authority figures in the film are being criticized - Bruno's father, a man whose brutality we can guess, but the real horror that is constantly being referred to in the film (especially in the pictures of Aunt Clara), must create this incredibly intense negative energy somewhere); Anna's incredibly Machiavellian, selfish father; the insensitive judge who does not care about lunch after an execution; the tennis commentator whose smug authoritative comments are always wrong. Hitch is far from being the mother's legend, and Hitch, as Robin Wood perceived it, is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy. <br/> <br/> Bruno's transgression turns the world upside down. This is the most unreal movie by Hitch. Whenever Guy is in his action, he is filmed directly with conventionally romantic music. Whenever Bruno invades, the atmosphere becomes carnivalistic, bizarre and more fun. This is Hitch's first truly American film that enjoys the primitive detritus of Americana. Adult men prick the balloons of little boys or try to throw them off carousels. Excellent math professors sing in trains about goats. Older society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees. Washington is filmed like a series of backup lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like a haunting Dali painting. There is one of the greatest and funniest scenes in all cinemas when we see a motionless, smiling Bruno in a sea of ​​spinning heads during a tennis match, a picture worthy of Magritte. Just look at every scene with Bruno in it and watch as she derails into the bizarre. There are phalluses in the most ridiculous permutations - check all those balloons (Hitch had obviously seen THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in a quieter environment: Washington will never look like that again. STRANGERS, despite VERTIGO, is also Hitch's most open sexual film - in addition to the phallus, there is the persistent homoerotic, the remarkable riding horse game; the shabby fellatio joke when Hitch's daughter showered the policeman with powder. <br /> <br /> And yet Hitch does not stay at the good old suspense. In the actual attempt to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to overlook what made him famous. Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates, and Hitch plays happy destruction over the identification of the audience and wants to murder Bruno. There is a weirdly painful sequence in which Bruno loses the lighter with which he wants to frame Guy in the drain. The exhilaration of tension and the sighs of facilitating the audience in which I participated in support of an insane killer is inherently funny, somewhat disturbing, and reveals our true responses to conformity and success. And Hitch milks it with dizzying joy - listening to the mocking music and exaggerated compositions and even acting to take everything so seriously. <br /> <br /> STRANGERS is one of Hitch's top five films and thus one of the best things in the cinema. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant that I can not believe that Chandler did not write it. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful goblin who fights for her cheeky father when she cheats on Guy. The fairgrounds are a remarkable, dizzying mix of exciting, tense set pieces, black comedy and symbolic location. If Bruno's final words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic rules that Hitch is to embody: compare this to a similar ending in THE KILLERS), we welcome his integrity, which is infinitely preferable to Guy's self-abandonment.
