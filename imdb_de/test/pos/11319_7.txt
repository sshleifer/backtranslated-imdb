I lived in London for most of my adult life before I changed clothes. I missed this movie when it came out and saw it only at HBO. I can not agree with the one who thinks this should have been a Hollywood production. The British team gave a daunting and deterrent atmosphere from day one. I spent the last 30 minutes on the edge of my place wondering what would happen to my home city. And of course it comes nine months after the release of the film 7/7. Yes, the truth is stranger than fiction. Having lived in both countries, the likelihood of this happening in Britain is much greater than in the US. Muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the UK. In the US, they assimilate much easier.
