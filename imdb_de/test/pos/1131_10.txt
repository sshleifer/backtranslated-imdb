I have to say, I thought the show Greek would be really ridiculous and stupid. Since I'm part of a student club, I did not want Greek organizations to look bad ... <br /> <br />, but I find that Greek is funny. Yes, they have the stereotypical connections and fraternity, but it's not fun, just cute humor. All the characters are pretty likable without Rebecca Logan (I just can not stand them), Casey and Rusty good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there is Cappie. Who does not love a man like Cappie, haha ​​His character brings so much to the show. Rusty's roommate Dale, played by Clark Duke, is also funny. <br /> <br /> It's definitely fun to watch Season 2. I can not wait to get it going !!
