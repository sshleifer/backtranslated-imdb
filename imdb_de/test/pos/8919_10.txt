This is really an Australian cult classic. If you're lucky enough to see it, you're in luck. It was released in most countries, but not in Australia for some reason. I have a DVD on DVD from the UK. Not a great transfer, but I bought it after seeing it at a movie festival before. The direction is perfect and the performances rocking! This is a dark movie that is scary but often very funny. I urge you to watch this movie. There is a coolness that you do not see in 99% of the typical Australian fare. The script is very well prepared and will send you on a journey that you know will end badly, but until the last ten minutes you can not decide how bad it is. Great work from the four leads, especially Lachy Hulme. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done: Great work!
