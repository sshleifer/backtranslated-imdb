I am very happy to have the chance to not only watch this movie, but also to learn more about this fascinating person and time. Lumumba is an outstanding performance that gives a full sense of history without falling into the usual Hollywood traps - yes, he is shown with his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his politics and that of his still emerging independent Congo. The film is brilliant and moves at a pace that is consistently stimulating. I'm looking forward to more Raoul Peck movies as well as more movies from Eric Ebouaney!
