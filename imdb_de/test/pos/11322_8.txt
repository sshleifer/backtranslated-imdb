Well, this film was certainly the current time. No happy ending, superheroes or wonders here. Just a down to earth fiction to stimulate our thinking in terms of terrorism and what-ifs. Kudos to Percival and Mickery for a great script and excellent director Percival. Films like these are necessary to keep us up to date. If every peace-loving man and woman on earth reported obvious suspicious activity, terrorism could not thrive. This film showed how difficult it really is to infiltrate these terrorists themselves with good intelligence. Although the film is a bit anti-Islamic propaganda (the use of a Muslim policeman as the main character), I believe it was completely realistic. The bombing should be shocking. As a very subtle instrument to convey the humility and humiliation of people involved in such an attack, they showed the full nudity of women who were decontaminated after the attack. It was not long before I realized that this should even bring this idea closer to the viewer, d. H. We do not have everything under control in such a situation. Although this took place in London, with the usual high-level British acting, it makes a statement for every part of the world. Great movies do not have to be epic productions, and this movie is well worth seeing.
