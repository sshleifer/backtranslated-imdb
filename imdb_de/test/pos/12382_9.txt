Where to start, I like the scary snow monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for us, we thought he was back and it was him. Changing the local to a tropical resort works. See old friends and meet new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job as Jack Frost. You can say that if an actor enjoys playing a villain, you can see it or, in this case, hear it in the performance. Yes, Jack Frost 2 is a welcome sequel that is better than the first one. I have a complaint, the little boys or the jacklings, as I call them. They looked like hand puppets. I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings, the mouth could have opened wider, but the CGI was good and overall the whole movie is worth a look. If you liked JACK FROST, then you will like this sequel. No questions or debates, 9 BIG STARS.
