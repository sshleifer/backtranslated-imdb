Hey look, you do not see this movie to change your life! But if you are very feminine and have always had something for Richard Gere? This movie is right in your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have a long chemistry on the screen. "Nights in Rodanthe" is not an Oscar-winning movie and will likely be forgotten sooner rather than later, but if you want a moody, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED handsome people (they will not twist your guts, nor will they.) Gere is "on top", he does not look too funny. Then this is the movie for you. I loved the theme of the story and was very relevant in many ways. Of course, the whole thing was superficially presented, glossed over and not really treated ... I mean, I would have liked to know more about the father / son relationship between Gere and James Franco, but the story was really about the idea that a great love of you can change for the better; Whether it's a lover, a kid, a friend, etc. The theme of the film is about love and its mysterious ways. I was kind of surprised that James Franco played such a small part in this movie, but he's always good for a few minutes of screen time. I really liked this movie because it was moving and cute.
