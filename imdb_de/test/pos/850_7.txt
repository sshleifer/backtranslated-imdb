I like remembering this movie when I saw it in the theater. I recently found a copy on VHS that withstood my memory. Of course, this is not a "big budget" movie, but the acting is pretty believable and the sets, scenes and costumes are very well done. I just wish the mammoths were more in the picture, but if you see them, they're also well done (remember, SFX was made without a computer at that time), a poor devil had to use all those hair and fakes on tusks on real ones Elephants!) ... the same effect has been applied to the elephants in "Quest for Fire". An above-average adventure movie and a chance for the star, Rod Cameron, to play something other than a cowboy, which he has done well over the years.
