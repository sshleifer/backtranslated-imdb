Michael Poland's hypnotic film "Northfork" is a film that will be remembered for a long time. This exquisitely crafted film, written by Michael and Mark Polish, is one of the best things that has come out of the world of independent films in the last year. The film was photographed magnificently by M. David Mullen with a compelling score by Stuart Matthewman. If you have not seen the movie yet, stop reading here. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​making the film in Montana was a big coup for the Polish brothers. Never before has the majestic view of land and mountains been as alive as in "Northfork". We do not need color! The beauty lies in the dark tones of the film, which highlights the story of the devastation in this remote outpost. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the story is Irwin, the sick child under the care of the mysterious Father Harlan. This boy is seen in his bed, where the friendly priest administers the medicine for his body. But is he really there? We observe him interacting with the weird group we first encounter in the cemetery. There are two freshly opened graves. Will one of them be for Irwin? <br /> <br /> Parallel to this first topic another plotting line will be played. We see the six black men who came to remove as many people as possible from the area. This is the bed for the artificial lake that is created. Their reward is one and a half hectares of land on the lake shore when they move a certain number of people. <br /> <br /> The third story focuses on the mystical group consisting of Flower Hercules, Cup of Tea, Cod and Happy. They are tracking the possibility of connecting to an angel who has been injured in this area. When Irwin meets her in the cemetery, he offers help if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here. We watch as the quartet examines the feathers the boy has put between the pages of his Bible. Could Irwin be that angel? <br /> <br /> The final sequence shows us all parties leaving Northfork in different directions. The men who used to drive in black cars might drive home to enjoy the newly acquired properties as a reward. The mystical group is seen climbing a plane and reaching a higher place. We also recognize that the child in Father Harlan died, despite the medicines and the care he received from the holy figure. Michael Polish got one of the best actors of all clients. Nick Nolte, as Father Harlan in his portrayal of this nice man is an inconspicuous performance. James Woods does a good job as Walter, one of the men working for the developer. The biggest surprise is Duel Farmer, who leaves an excellent impression as Irwin. This child actor shows, with the right guidance, promising. <br /> <br /> The mystic group is brilliantly played by Daryl Hannah, Robin Sachs, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, the funny eyewear man. Peter Coyote, Mark Polish, Ben Foster and the rest of the cast are immaculate under Polish leadership. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie is based on its simplicity. Mr. Poland's vision will trace his memory. The images of Montana as perhaps unreal landscape have long been one of the best things in American films.
