I do not understand where these bad comments come from. The movie has put you on the edge of your seat and you're a bit scared to go to your car at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> The part that gets you there is that this could all happen. Not to the extent that it is perceived in the film, but the whole idea is reality. This movie has turned this reality into a Dee Snider nightmare. Three thumbs up (the third is from the body in my freezer).
