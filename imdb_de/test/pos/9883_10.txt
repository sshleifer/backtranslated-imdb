This film shows sweet irony, shaggy tours with subtle cultural references, classic parallels, masterful use of rich colors, and fabulous rendition of Keystone Cops chase scenes. <br /> <br /> The ensemble work of the cast and crew is Charming. Literally. How else could I go on like this? <br /> <br /> This movie speaks to everyone. The skillful and poignant use of so many universal archetypes: that's what makes this movie so profound. <br /> <br /> As a mature film student, I find that Checking Out contains all the important elements. Safe and Bergorra, it's not the GOTTPATHER, but would serve as a perfect successor. The obligatory satyr play of tragedy binds our collective cathartic wounds. <br /> <br /> Get into a theater and watch this movie.
