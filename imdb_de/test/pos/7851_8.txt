I was amazed at this early concept of Clint Eastwood. I did not read a summary of the movie when I decided to watch it on TV. Due to Mr. Eastwood I expected some nice shootings and no deep story. I was wrong. I found some topics that were unusually explicitly addressed, and I could not decide who was good and who was bad until the end. This movie is definitely not typical of Eastwood, but it's certainly worth watching.
