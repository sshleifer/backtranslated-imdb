An orphan named Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for two dodgy chimney sweeps, is falsely accused of stealing the villa he works in from Mr. Grimes (James Mason) - the true thief - and storming. Tom's only alibi is the niece of the owner of the villa (Samantha Gates, a slender, blue-eyed blonde with long, wavy hair, which was certainly the main reason why I've seen this as a boy again and again). He and his dog jump into a river and a witch turns them into water-breathing cartoon characters! Under water, he befriends and rescues a group of water-breathing children, known as baby water, from a shark. <br /> <br /> A very interesting and always fascinating fable from the year 1850, which should appeal to all children. The animation (42 minutes of 85-minute HBO VHS printing) is just average, but it's preferable to most modern animations - even computer animations! My only real criticism is a plot hole caused by a deleted scene. At 42:06, after the first verse of "High Cockalorum," the film cuts off a scene with octopi swimming, followed by Tom and Jacques meeting with Terence. This leads to a scene in which the killer shark (voiced by Mason) leads our heroes into a trap. The shark then greets Tom with, "Young Tom, it's nice to see your ugly mug again" - but this is the first time HBO's pushing Tom meets the shark! In most reference works the running time is given as 92 or 93 minutes. So far she was available at Sultan Entertainment and Nelson. Therefore, HBO printing is likely to be processed and / or time compressed. MGM published a 76-minute DVD print in full screen in 2002! Let's hope that a restored version will be released in the near future. <br /> <br /> The film is copyrighted. Ariadne Films 1978. "Ariadne" is the water baby voiced by Samantha Gates. Bernard Cribbins, who is Mason's partner in crime, also speaks electric eel. A.k.a. Slip Slide Adventure.
