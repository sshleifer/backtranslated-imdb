Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), a dissatisfied teenager who seems to have murdered a backward colleague, the brother of a girl he was with. The question is not whether he did it or not? Leland gives it immediately? But why. Interestingly, Leland does not look like a detective story, but a character story that explores why people do what they do? It is not necessarily the easiest way to cash in. <br /> <br /> And Leland offers the required group of masked people. Apart from the title character, there is also Pearl (Don Cheadle), who is his teacher in the juvenile detention center and directly sees that Leland is different. We meet Leland's distanced and selfish father (Kevin Spacey in an extended cameo), who in no way seems emotionally touched by what his son has done. The real flavors, however, come to light when we immerse ourselves in the Pollards, the family of the backward child. First, there is Leland's girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), a drug addict who can not keep herself clean. her sister Julie (Michelle Williams), perhaps the most normal person in the film, just trying to escape from everyday life; and Allen Harris (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with the Pollards and is Julie's friend. Finally, there's Ryan (Michael Welch), whom everyone else calls goofball. He can not communicate and hardly seems to be aware of his surroundings. <br /> <br /> Leland focuses mainly on his eponymous protagonist, but the movie gets slow ?? occasionally too slow ?? digs into everyone's life and asks the main question: Why do people do what they do? While Leland openly talks in a magazine about what Pearl allows him to test the notions of good and evil and personal responsibility, all the characters in the film sometime stand in the moment of making the basic choice of their own happiness or another , perhaps the most basic choice anyone can make. And the film examines exactly what goes into those decisions and what the consequences are. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, you are simply impressed by the depth of the cast. Spacey Cheadle goslings. Michelle Williams. Even Chris Klein? These are people who tend to improve every movie in which they find themselves, and when they are all put together, it creates an intoxicating brew. For a room in the middle, the film seems to stand and stutters as it unfolds; For a while, it looks like it will be only content to ask questions and give no answers. But as we arrive on the home stretch and the movie starts to move, Leland becomes a quiet, powerful piece of film. Leland's explanation of the world and its actions ultimately puts every story at the center, and any investments you make in the movie pay off in a sunny day is beautiful. At this point in his career is it superfluous? This is one of the best young actors to work today, and it's a pleasure to see him turn an unusually effective character into a thoughtful protagonist. Gosling is so subtle that it hardly looks like a spectacle; He has to face most of the movie to Don Cheadle, who we know has the goods, and not only does he keep himself, he also raises Cheadle's game. Cheadle herself is in first-class form and gives Pearl a plump humanity. for good and bad. Spacey is a kind of one-note, but that's the character, and he's great with it. I was surprised by Chris Klein. With this acting level, I thought he was buried in the mix, but he's probably turning his back on his career. Great work all around. <br /> <br /> Leland is a bit of a downer, and here too it's a bit worn. However, it ends strong and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer (at least on this). There is also a subtle commentary on racism in the film (in Leland's first day in youth class, he is the only white person in the room) who, like much of the film, is handled very effectively. I would not go so far as to call this a required consideration. Some may find it too slow or too odd? But I thought it was one of the better movies I've seen in a long time, much stronger and more satisfying than most of the others out there. I would recommend it. with the above limitations? though for no other reason than seeing Gosling continue perfecting his craft.
