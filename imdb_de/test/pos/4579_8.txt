This movie is funny and sad enough, I think it's somehow true. If you love Office Space, you'll love this movie because it's another hit by Mike Judge, but it's not Office Space. I told everyone to watch this movie. I just wish it had been in several theaters so that it would have received the recognition it deserved. I love this movie and would like to see more of Mike Judge. Luke Wilson also makes this film what it is. I am so glad I will not be alive in the year 2505, because if this movie turns out to be true, we all have a lot of trouble. I just hope more people see this movie because I know that they will fall in love with it too.
