It is a very sensitive representation of life with unsatisfied or limited wishes. What do you do with the desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? A husband finds a way out of the immigrant - because immigrants are not or will not be accepted, they do not have to adapt and reduce their desires. The other husband seeks comfort in spirituality and tries to turn his desire into nothingness. It fails of course - and it collapses in the last scene for several reasons. Sita was still interested in finding this moment to let him know that he was not responsible for her deviant behavior towards her blocked wishes. The mother in her still could not find the strength to destroy his myth. She sees him as a child, glorifying herself in his lust control, but should she give him the opportunity to grow up? Both wives find courage and cohesion through the common rejection of their husband. <br /> <br /> But the last act of rejection was the grandmother - she could not break away from her rusted mindset to accept Sita. A decade and more of care was not enough to break the shackles of their culture. <br /> <br /> It seemed the easiest way for the home help to let his wishes flow - since he was damned by his culture anyway - at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is no respect or expectation anyway, sin might taste just as good.
