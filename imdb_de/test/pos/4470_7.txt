This is another movie where the camera is the best to recommend. That would be good if the movie was a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in the film art, that's not good enough. The topic of cross-species respect and cooperation shyly ventures into the forbidden world of cross-species love. However, the approach is stereotypical and indicates a lack of understanding of the behavioral motives of both species. As with many films, the question arises again and again of what a more innovative director and a more creative scriptwriter could have achieved. Unfortunately we will probably never know.
