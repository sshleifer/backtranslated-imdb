These extremely entertaining shorts are considered to be one of the best shorts ever, and I certainly will not disagree. Even in a country that regularly produces top quality animated shorts, this movie can still stand out. If you ever have the chance to watch this movie, please do so. It's only ten minutes long, yet it contains a man obsessed with sawing, a woman vacuuming the bathtub, and a nuclear war. What more do you want in a movie?
