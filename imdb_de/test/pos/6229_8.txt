A group of young adults sits in the back of the beach, where the only place nearby is a museum full of wax figures, and the only form of help is the local Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors). When night falls, the children are picked up in record time. <br /> <br /> A strange, crazy B-movie that combines the eeriness of the backwoods settings with the plotting device of all-too-real mannequins Updating the genre "Body in the Wax Museum", this is an intense shocking festival Meaning of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". (It should come as no surprise that TCSM art director Robert A. Burns repeats this duty here, and his eye for great set decoration is always an advantage.) Pino Donaggio's score is downright chilly; Accompanied by the gloomy photography of Nicholas von Sternberg, the film is steeped in a depressing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> plot rotations vary in the degree of success; There was one I saw one kilometer away, and one that actually surprised me, and I was all the happier for it. One of the best moments we share almost directly with us, since the first scavenger is trapped in a room in which objects fly by itself. The capper is a great whistling sensation with blood dripping at the end. <br /> <br /> Star Connors offers an appealing performance as our good old enemy as an enemy, while the younger co-stars are expected I can not play at the same level, although Jocelyn Jones is a sympathetic woman who is undoubtedly a lady is that has enough appeal to be considered sympathetic needy. Co-star Tanya Roberts (a brunette in this movie) is fine. (If I had a problem with this movie, then the victims are just a bit too stupid, but that's not very different from many 80's horror movies.) Future names among the credits are future directors Ted Nicolaou, who was the publisher here, Ron Underwood (who debuted "Tremors" almost a dozen years later) as an assistant director and the veteran makeup artist Ve Neill, who has made many films and since then won three Oscars. <br /> Although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, this is a nice little surprise that the debut director David Schmoeller delivers with conviction and enthusiasm. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
