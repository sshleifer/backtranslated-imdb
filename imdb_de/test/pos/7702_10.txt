A great thriller thriller that is first-rate to actors and action that will make you guess. This well-performed and staged film is based on a true story and is worth while Joe Penny is extremely well-staffed and convinces Ann Gillian as a worried and frightened sister. Joe proves once again that he is an actor and that the end is well done. It's worth it to see it. I hope you will repeat it on every channel soon. I will definitely record it. It is well worth your time for Penny and Gillian fans. Rent it if you can still better try to buy it. Perfect thriller of the early 90s. <br/> <br /> Film is great.
