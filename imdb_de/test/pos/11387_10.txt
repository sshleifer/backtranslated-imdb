Some time ago I watched a video by Paul Thomas Anderson in which he expressed his great interest in pornographic films and how this industry could have produced better films and consequently a complete genre and not just sex on videotapes. Paul Thomas Anderson believes in the porn industry in the form Burt Reynolds played in a great way. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose biggest dream is to shoot a "real" movie that will keep viewers awed by the awesome dramatic storyline and at the same time exciting with the beauty. and with the "big cocks and tits". Once he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he believes he has found the new star for his films. And so begins the story of young Eddie in the porn industry. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a sequence in a nightclub where we can see all the people who belong to Eddie's life and later we can see them outside the porn industry and live their daily lives. But soon we can see her in the porn industry and after just one party begins the story of the new Eddie, the story of Dirk Diggler. Everyone will enjoy true success with Dirk as the star, winning prizes and helping Jack make his biggest dream come true with a series of films about Brock Landers, Dirk's new character. These types of commercials are an amazing success, and for Jack are his first "real" films. But this is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "terrible 80's" when there will be $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and his friends. But we all know that the excesses can destroy anyone and erectile dysfunction can destroy any pornstar. Here, the film focuses on the total success and the question of how it all really bad, with many problems due to the bad looks of the society porn industry and at a time with many excesses. In the decadence of Dirk, after the attempt and failure in the music industry, there is a brilliant sequence that perfectly reflects how things are going for Dirk and his friends. This sequence is the first of his drug deals, with the demise of Alfred Molina ending in a total mess. It's funny for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and friends, but there's always a solution if you get back everything you know, and when Dirk returns, Brock is back. <br /> <br /> Well, I have not mentioned most of the characters in my art summary, but I have to say that all are amazingly well-developed. The cast is just great with the best performance I've seen from Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a strong performance in a really moving figure; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman etc. are just memorable, all their characters with funny and sad moments. <br /> <br /> Finally, I love Anderson's amazing film style here with a unique view of the porn industry of the late 70's and early 80's. I always said that "Magnolia" was my favorite from Anderson, but now, after seeing all but Sidney, I can not say I have a favorite because I love them all! <br /> <br /> PS: somewhere I read that this movie is Anderson's "Scorsese movie". So, I'm sure if you love "Goodfellas" and "Casino," you'll love them too. I love to love "Boogie Nights"!
