George Barry is a genius. "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a prototype for much of the "slipstream" fiction and camp surrealism that is so fashionable now. Really innovative, stubborn and just brilliant. Hyper-strange acting, subtle nightmarish atmosphere. I recommend reading Stephen Thrower's book "Nightmare USA" (there is a chapter dedicated to Barry and "The Deathbed: The Bed That Eats"). Available from FAB Press. In a similar context, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" and "Beyond Dream's Door" make a perfect double count. In addition, it is banal and tired - and ultimately stupidly ironic - to criticize a low-budget cult film as "badly made" or "technically incapable". The aesthetics of the B movie are part of the charm of these films. No amount of CGI could repeat the cumulative effect of "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" on the viewer with an advanced palate.
