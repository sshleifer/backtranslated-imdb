My cousins ​​and I have watched this movie since we were little. I do not know exactly what this movie is about, but we got used to this enchanting movie and it has become a special part of our family memories. <br /> <br /> I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good, healthy family movies, because that's what it is. The things the four kids get involved in are absolutely funny. It's an old movie, but do not be fooled. This is one of the best movies in the world, showing such a strong bond between siblings.
