This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs (though I'll admit I have not seen many others yet). It is very stupid and thoroughly funny, there is little more than a few minutes during the entire two hours in which you will not be entertained. Almost all jokes seem funny, only a few fall flat. I immediately saw this movie after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard and comparing those two spoof movies. I know exactly how high quality this movie really is. It's funny from start to finish, none of the comedies is overblown or boring. The music is wonderful, as well as the choreography of dancing and fighting. Acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this kind of movie ... Elwes is a great comedian and makes a good Robin. The plot is typical of Robin Hood, more or less everything from the legend fits into this movie (and mainly manipulated). If you like Mel Brooks or just a fan of silly humor or just want to see a good parody of the legend of Robin Hood, this is definitely the movie for you. The film's HBO first-look special is also worth seeing, so you may want to watch the full credits. I would recommend it to any fan of Mel Brook's films and to people who like stupid humor. 10.7
