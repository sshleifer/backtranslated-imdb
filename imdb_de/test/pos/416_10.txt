"Ahh ... I did not order a great hit show" ..... "We'll have you" Hack is just the greatest TV show ever made. A bit of me died when I struck in the TV series. to catch a small hack on a friday evening and it did not start. The show has gone deep into the most important social issues of our culture. I found that at the end of every episode I saw; I left after being entertained as well as informed. I've actually become stupider since Hack left. I do not want to help the needy and the unfortunate. Since Hack's gone, I see her as a stain and an unnecessary burden on taxpayers. For the love of God we have to bring back Hack!
