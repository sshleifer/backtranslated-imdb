I saw The D's new movie tonight at a special screening show, and I was so overwhelmed by its sheer size that I felt I had to come to IMDb and get the word out. Granted, I've been a big fan of D's work - I've loved the HBO series and listen to their music weekly (there's nothing better to sing along to), but that appreciation really made me more worrisome for today's show (for us, we were all Once disappointed with something we love when trying to jump onto the big screen, Tenacious D's "The Pick of Destiny" is not. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie rocks harder than anything I've ever seen, and is funnier and more majestic than anything else, Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell could produce together, telling the story of the D before we met them, and providing fascinating stories about Kages and Jable's upbringing on how they came together and how they were inspired to write songs about things like Lee, Sasquatch, and Dio, but most importantly, they are the true inspiration for the great te song in the world, "Tribute" and how it happened (which is different from the version of the HBO series) reveal. After seeing it, you probably will not be able to remember it (hence the tribute), but your mind will be changed forever by its genius. <br /> <br /> I do not often go to film because of the high ticket price and the effort to park a car, pay high discounts, etc., but I usually make exceptions when it comes to someone I do really love, or something of the same variety. "The Pick of Destiny" was so good that I have no qualms about seeing it again when it's released nationwide, and I intend to convince all my friends. Last week we saw "Borat" and loved it, but that's honest with goodness. For anyone who loves rock music and comic brilliance, watch this movie. The talent of these guys is so great that you should not hesitate to support their cause. You will not be disappointed, and the Rocklords will smile at you positively.
