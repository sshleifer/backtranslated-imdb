I think that this film has become an important record of the most terrible aspect of the East German regime - the imprisonment of its people by what the regime has called the anti-fascist defensive wall. It is a document of despair and courage that should not be missed. However, I would like to comment on the actual location of this escape. This did not happen in or around Berlin, as some respondents suspected, and had nothing directly to do with the Berlin Wall. The flight balloon was flown over the Iron Curtain, which split not only Germany but also all of Europe at that time. The balloon started from PÃ¶ssneck, 170 miles southwest of Berlin in the GDR, and flew 14 miles to Naila in Bavaria and to freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall in the same year. While the balloon ride has created an entertaining thrilling cinema, it should remain as a memorial to those who have lost their lives in an escape attempt from East Berlin, other parts of the GDR or other controlled by the Soviet Union states.
