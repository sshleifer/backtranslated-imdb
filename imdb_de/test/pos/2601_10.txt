Again, Elmer faces the dilemma of who to shoot. Error from Daffy. He's not sure what season it is, and Bunny and Duck argue it does not help. Although Bugs proves that he is the smartest again, using Daffy's reverse psychology more and more subtly. And when that ends, he makes his mark in cross-dressing. Daffy freaks out and demands that the hare be shot. Although Elmer is too stupid, he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer is really to blame for all this. If he was not so stupid, he'd know that it's REALLY the Duck Season and just Daffy blast. But poor old Daff can not believe the complete untruth of the situation. His cruel plans of misdirection were thwarted by Elmer's stupidity. Daffy is so shocked that he even goes home with Elmer to be beamed in his living room. <br /> <br /> Poor Daff. He governs!
