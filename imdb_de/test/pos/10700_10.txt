This could be my favorite, so bad that it is a great movie of all time. Like many early childhood children of the 1980s, the repetition of revenge on Ninja has produced a ninja phase of my childhood. Man, I thought Sho k. was angry at the time. Jet Li could spoil him with both legs in a plaster cast! This movie has insane crossovers that include Flashdance, the Exorcist, and the Lee Van Cleef Ninja television program. Pooh. But as a friend of mine says, anyone can make a good movie, it takes a true genius to make a movie that starts with a ninja who survives 17 shotgun pistols to take over the body of an Arobics teacher to take revenge. Impressive. While former commentators let the sword fly out of the closet on the string, no one has yet invented the powerful love scene. Where the sexy police officer takes off his shirt to reveal a backhair mane. The fun never stops. Rent this !!!!!!
