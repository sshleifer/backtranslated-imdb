This game requires stealth, smart and a steady hand. The gameplay is simply the best. On top of that, there are the interesting extras - bullet holes remain in the walls, enemies respond to certain points hit by bullets, there is a plethora of moving animations that make the enemies look very real (for example, looking through them) at a window he will stand guard there and flies fly away, sneezing or scratching himself), the list goes on. This is the best movie / movie conversion ever, putting you in the position of the best superspy. This game is the best reason to own an N64.
