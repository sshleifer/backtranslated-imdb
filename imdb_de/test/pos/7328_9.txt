I can not say that this movie deserves a ten because I would be lying. I loved this movie when I saw it! It has the unique bond of a friendship between a teenager and a dolphin. Although it does not show the sweetness of Jesse and Willy in Free Willy, it offers an exciting movie that the whole family can enjoy! If you love sea animals or just love a perfect family movie, this movie is for you! Pinball definitely shows us how adorable dolphins are, and they are playful and could easily be pets if everyone had a large enough pool! I love whales and dolphins, so this movie obviously works for me. I think the producers should have chosen a different shark instead of the hammer head to underline the antagonist part in the story. Maybe a great white? FLIPPER IS MAGNIFICENT! So look at it!
