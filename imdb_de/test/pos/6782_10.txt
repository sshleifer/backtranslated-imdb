This game is an action / adventure with fight. There are fairly long periods without combat, but at other times you have to eliminate different types of monsters. The monsters are not like anything you would see in real life, and they must be eliminated to continue your search. The whole game is a search. You play Adam Randall, whose father contacts him from the hereafter and asks him to save him. The game is from the mid-1990s and must be played under DOS. I used Dosbox and was able to play the game pretty well. The graphics are not always as good as some games, especially because the resolution is not high and some scenes seem pretty blocky, but others look pretty, but do not let that distract you. The game is very resourceful, it's long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear from nowhere. Not for young kids who probably would not be interested anyway, but over 13 or 14 might like this game. It's a horror, mystery, action, adventure and combination combination. It had to be found now. maybe Ebay. But remember, it's a DOS game and you could not play it on today's faster computers. would be hard to play on fast computers if you do not use Dosbox. Oh, and the acting is also very good.
