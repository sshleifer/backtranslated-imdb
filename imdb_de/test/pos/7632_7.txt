A surprisingly good movie made after the exorcist about a young woman who is possessed by a ghost after going to a desecrated church to restore a life-sized and life-like crucified. The play consisted of Christ and the two thieves, but Christ was already sold out. The problem begins as soon as the figure is removed from the cross and it seems that the woman is brought to life. From this point on, it will be a fight for the girl soul. Creepy, scary and much better than you think, the movie works because its cast sells the events that are very mature. It helps that these are real people who are flawed so it is easier to connect with them. I really enjoyed that movie, and when I saw it again for the first time in at least ten years, I was shocked to see how good it was. Definitely better than all his innumerable fluffy titles.
