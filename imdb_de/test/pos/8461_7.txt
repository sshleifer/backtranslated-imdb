Christine Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with soapy materials, Ted Danson did his best with a thankless role from Chip Davis. The premise was that the two ladies were a friendly married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her clocking biological clock. I found the relationship that Ted Danson's character had to the single woman who was played rather dirty by Christine Lahtis. He behaved awkwardly, but he made two "widows" roar over him. I found it outrageous when Sandy told him she wanted to break it off after meeting his wife. He calls her and says he misses her (did he call his wife, there was no sign). He behaved like a heel. It might have made a more interesting movie if it had not been killed. Maybe both ladies would have woken and thrown him. I liked the friendship between the two ladies, but it was spoiled by what they had in common: the cad of a man.
