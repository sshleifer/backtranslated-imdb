"Strangers on a Train" was one of those movie classics I'd always heard of, but somehow never got to see. I finally looked at it a few weeks ago, and as always with every Hitchcock movie, it has not only passed the test of time, it has far surpassed most thrillers made today. The inspiration for future action films can be seen here - the highlight of the endless carousel and the two villains dueling me reminds me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bonts "Speed". "Of course" Strangers "is more than forty years older than" Speed ​​"and does not have any modern special effects, but the thrill is there - Hitchcock was a true genius. <br /> <br /> The not so subtle gay side of Bruno ( Robert Walker in an amazing performance) has taken shape in many other Psycho-Stalker characters in future films, consider him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female." He knows about Guy before he even gets into it Zug meets - we almost feel her contact is not accidental - and soon becomes obsessed with him. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock loved the Oedipal elements in his films (see also "Psycho" for crass undertones Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother, his treacherous ways and his obvious homosexuality just slipped off censorship in 1951 when gays were not allowed to be "screened" on screen - but Hitchcock effectively transmits the message when we see Bruno on the phone in the lounge on the phone wearing a non-male robe, flirts with Guy and responds to his mother. <br /> <br /> The deep layers of this film make it a fast-paced thriller to which you can return time and time again - unfortunately this is made as new Hollywood production on a big budget, but after seeing the original one can I honestly can not think of anything better than the horrible thrill of this movie.
