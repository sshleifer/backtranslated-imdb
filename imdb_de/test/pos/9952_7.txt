William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice portrays 16th-century Venice. Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish loan shark who is seeking revenge on a Catholic who looked down on him. The movie is a slow plot at the beginning, building up over two hours. The film gives its characters, especially Pacino, a very good and credible look. When you hear Pacino playing a Jew, you might think that seeing Pacino's former gangster roles would not work. Nevertheless, it works very well, the costume designer and the director of the film must be recognized. The look of all characters fits well with the time the game is playing. The costumes look like a renaissance appearance that you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The film shows a very anti-Semitic atmosphere. From the first minute to the last minute, it shows how Catholics try to use the Jews in every possible way, even to the point where they are locked up in "ghettos" and are not allowed regular jobs. Compared to The Passion of Christ, another recent film people thought was very anti-Semitic, the Merchant of Venice makes the Passion like a Jewish holiday. The film shows how the Jews, or at least Shylock, wanted to avenge the mistreatment the Jews received. The shots are also very timely and the scene is sometimes very beautiful or very ugly depending on the film scene, which makes them even more realistic. Showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti-Semitic, since the ugly is usually shown around the Jews and the beautiful around the Catholics. <br /> <br /> Although the film clearly tries to give certain areas a serious aura, it adds a little humor to it. The oh so serious trial between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds a touch of humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) come to the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated. That in itself may not be funny, but when you see that they are women dressed as men, you can find that pretty amusing. The entire cross-dressing scene, however convincing it might be, would have been even more memorable if the make-up artists and director Michael Radford had noticed that the two women still look and are easily identifiable as women. The director could also have recognized that the women speak with their regular voices instead of listening like men, which partly distracts from the scene, but does not completely kill them. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie gets 7 out of 10 points
