Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy seaside town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, Helen has a young daughter who will camp for the summer and gives mother a little more freedom. Helen's store is run by manager Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a crazy village gossip girl who has eyes for handsome firefighter George (Tom Selleck), and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) , One day Helen stumbles over a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects Johnny has written it for her. Helen and Johnny throw caution into the wind and start a little "thing". However, the letter later lands in the hands of others, including Janet's, who believes George sent him to her, and Johnny, who imagines Helen has written it for him. And on and on the letter goes. But in truth, George may have eyes for Helen and Jennifer has fallen heavily for Johnny. Even the museum curator of the city may have a secret love. Will complex matters like this ever be aligned? This is a sweet movie with a beautiful backdrop and capable stars. Each of the leading actors performs well, including the addition of Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart to the aforementioned. Then the coastal landscape is the most beautiful, the costumes are well chosen and the photography is very beautiful. There are a few surprises, including a subtle gay plot development that is unlikely to please all viewers. But for those who love romantic comedies, this should be on any good selection for the genre.
