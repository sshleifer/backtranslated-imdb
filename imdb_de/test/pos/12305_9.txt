"The Dead" is truly a work of art. Obviously John Huston wanted to show that he was still "in the full glory of a passion" by doing it, even when his body failed him. This film has a strong impact on the mind and stays in the mind for a long time. Reading the Joyce short story certainly gives the characters more depth, especially Gabriel's inner uproar, but the essence is present in this film. As an artist's statement of his joie de vivre and his craft, "The Dead" stands alone.
