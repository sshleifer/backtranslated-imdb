The reason why this film is not well-known and more appreciated by me seems to be because of its theme. Because of its controversial theme, this film was never published properly and is still a fairly unknown film. Not that it's an issue, though it's more controversial now. <br /> <br /> It's basically a movie about a white man who befriends a black man. The friendship does not seem to be enforced or unrealistic, but the way it is portrayed in this film feels very real. We see how these different ethnicities merge together, as if it were completely normal. Unfortunately that was unfortunately not considered normal at the time. Seeing a black guy talking to a white girl and just having fun with her as a friend has been a difficult affair, for example, for some proportions of the 1957 audience. <br /> <br /> You really can understand why Sidney Poitier was and is always highly appreciated by the Hollywood society and the Black community in general. Of course, this is one of the reasons why he received an Oscar at the 2002 Oscar. In his films, he often fights discrimination and biased themes, with "In the Heat of the Night" as the best example. A true role model that has certainly inspired many African American actors to this day. But he was also a great actor. Yes, he is still alive, but he has retired quite a bit from films, now it seems that his last role dates back to 2001. <br /> <br /> This movie was Martin Ritts directorial debut and he was not given too much movie for his movie either. The studios were probably also a little reserved, mainly because of their concept and / or because it was Ritt's first film. Or maybe it was simply because MGM just was not that big anymore and left its best days behind. Since the 1950s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has been reputed not to make good and cheap movies, while in the early years it was truly one of the largest studios with many stars and acclaimed directors who made many award-winning classic films. Fortunately for her, her reputation changes again and again, and when the MGM logo appears in a movie, people do not expect a movie anymore. <br /> <br /> Despite its limited budget and limited resources, it made a great movie out of it. The movie is very simple, with only a few characters and a simplified storyline. However, the film still manages to captivate you with its story and its themes, without ever preaching or becoming anything about it. It also makes the film an effective one with its motifs. <br /> <br /> Really a movie that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
