I watched Linda and it's a top-rate movie! The life of Paul and his wife Linda, whom he adored as a young man and eventually married. They meet another couple, Jeff and Stella, and the fours become very good friends. But her friendship takes a twisted turn after vacationing together in Varona Beach. ! The acting of Virginia Madsen is acceptable. Richard Thomas steals the film, however, with his incredible acting ... and the emotions he shows. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie! "Lotta honey"
