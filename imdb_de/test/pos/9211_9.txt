I recently joined the TV program for the first time - the 2-hour kidnapping program. Do not know why I was not earlier? James Caan is eminently credible in the role of chief honore in the featured 5 * Vegas Complex. or appear to have been selected because they must be related to the producer or director. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not the case with this program. Together with Caan, all main and minor cast are attractive and believable. The guest actors are well chosen. <br /> <br /> The stories I saw are interesting and the show also offers a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining program and I hope it will stay that way. I do not know how I've missed it for so long, but I plan to make it TIVO from now on.
