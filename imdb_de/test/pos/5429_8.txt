If you watch this movie, do not go into this movie. The expectation that this film is absolutely scary will disappoint you. Yeah, sure it's funny sometimes, but I would consider it a political thriller disguised as a comedy. The services are very good, especially by Jeff Goldblum as chairman of the electoral society. Although he only has a limited screen time, he makes a lasting impression. Of course, Robin Williams is excellent. Laura Linney is also very good, what a surprise. She's one of the best actresses in Hollywood, and one scene shows it especially. This movie makes you think. What if a comedian ran for the president and actually won? Would the country be better or would the country break into millions?
