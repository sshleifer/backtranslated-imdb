When "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" was released in 1968, it came out of nowhere and hit like a psychedelic thunder bolt. African-American actor and filmmaker William Greaves wanted to change the documentary's 'news-reel' style forever, and until now there has never been anything like it. The film is a film about "making a film" that is intentionally written and staged to create as much controversy and contradiction as possible. The action and the sparse dialogue in New York's Central Park concern a couple who deal with homosexuality and abortion. The woman wants out of the relationship, and the man wants an explanation. At the end of this interaction, a drunken homeless person interrupts the process, offering his commentary and personal story behind him. After the main material has been shot, the film crew adds its own views of the filmmaker and senses that it treats the film inappropriately. Throughout the film, multiple cameras are used to record the action within the scene, and commentary from cast, crew and spectators. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone interested in avant-garde filmmakers like Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves tries to show that a thing can not really be observed and understood, because viewing itself would change reality. "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" can be seen as a cinematic presentation or application of The Uncertainty Principal. This is just one possible explanation, and Greave's true intentions are certainly open to speculation. Above all, this film tries to confuse, to confront. and stimulate, and undoubtedly succeed admirably.
