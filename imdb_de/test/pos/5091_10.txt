This is a really wonderful love story. I really like the songs, but even if you do not, you have to love the story. Peter O'Toole is in great shape and Petula Clark is fine too. I saw this for the first time when I was about 13 years old, and I loved it. Now in my forties, I still enjoy it, probably even more. Still to cry and laughter and well-being. It's a movie that you can only look at with a new age or alone, because it's a chick movie. But what's wrong with that? If you need a bit of romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie. <br /> <br />
