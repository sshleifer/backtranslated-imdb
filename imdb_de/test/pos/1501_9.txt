In the late 1940s, there was a short film series titled "Flicker Flashbacks," in which excerpts from silent movie dramas like Mary Pickford and Blanche Sweet were laughed at. Scratchy clips from outdated old films have been rearranged, projected too fast and provided with janglyer music and lame jokes. The attitude expressed by this brutal treatment summed up the turn-of-the-century view of Hollywood quite early: silent cinema was considered hokey, flowery, a little embarrassing, and only good for a giggle. In the fifties, this attitude began to change gradually for various reasons. James Age's famous 1949 essay on the silent clowns for Life Magazine was one factor, but television played an important role in rediscovering the audience with silent films. Although TV broadcasters sometimes treated the material as roughly as the "Flicker Flashbacks", higher-toned series such as "Silents, Please" treated the films with respect. Another milestone was Robert Youngson's compilation film THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMEDY, which turned out to be a surprising hit when he came to the cinemas in late 1957. <br /> <br /> I do not know if Charles Chaplin knew about Youngson's movie or his success at the box office, but around this time he decided to re-release three of his best short comedies, A DOG'S LIFE, SHOULDER ARMS (both 1918) and THE PILGRIM (made in 1922 and published the following year). These three films worked well as a trio, as they provide a nice contrast in plot, theme, and setting. In addition, all three have familiar faces of the Chaplin Corporation, some of which play multiple roles in each short. At the time of its republication, the films had not been shown to the public for over thirty years. That's why Chaplin might wonder if he should have a good reputation with a new generation of moviegoers, especially since his best work has rarely been shown on television. The beginnings of the new medium. Unfortunately, Chaplin apparently came to the conclusion that the movies were moving too fast with the old silent projection speed. Therefore, the decision was made to "stretch" them, which meant every other frame was printed twice. Maybe he wanted to avoid the 'Flicker Flashbacks' look, but this was not the best way to do that. Aesthetically, the results were terrible and virtually destroyed the action flow of the films. Nevertheless, THE CHAPLIN REVUE was released in 1959. This version was transferred to Play Video in the 1980s and made commercially available by Playhouse Video. I bought a VHS copy of the movie back then and was terribly disappointed with the jerky stop-and-start rhythm of the films. <br /> <br /> It is a special pleasure to see that David Shepard's restoration has been restored from Chaplin's compilation (originally produced for the laser disc format), which is a huge improvement over the Playhouse video version. In most cases, the projection speed was corrected. The "stretch-print" has disappeared in any case, although the action sometimes seems to draw something. For example: In A DOG'S LIFE, while Edna & Charlie's awkward dance at the Green Lantern Cafe, Edna's bare arms appear visibly blurry; At another point, during the trench scene in SHOULDER ARMS, when Charlie is released from guard duty, the action seems strangely slowed for a few moments. However, this could be the result of a film restorer maneuver that covers a bit of decomposition. Overall, the picture quality is fantastic considering the age of the films themselves. <br /> <br /> Other bonuses: The REVUE begins with rare backgrounds recorded at Chaplin Studio. These include shots of an obviously staged, witty rehearsal session in which Chaplin throttles the tiny actor Loyal Underwood, as well as Charlie's scenes on his make-up table, which puts on his make-up and trims the famous mustache. These scenes are accompanied by Chaplin's story, which is shown in a short clip. Chaplin also composed a new score for the compilation, and I think his REVUE themes are among his best compositions, especially the pieces used during the caf√© sequence in A DOG'S LIFE. The only exception is the song written for THE PILGRIM, a 'fifties-style' pseudo-singin 'cowboy number called' Fifties-style 'by Matt Monro (which sounds more like Gene Autry), which is distracting Anachronistic and inappropriate. Otherwise the music is perfect for the action and the atmosphere during the rest of the REVUE. <br /> <br /> It feels as though the image release of THE CHAPLIN REVUE has long since debuted the debut of presenting these classic comedies as they should be seen all the time. In this form the REVUE is one of the most consistent and entertaining works of Chaplin.
