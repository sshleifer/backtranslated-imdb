I found this movie absolutely funny. I already knew it would be a fun movie, but it was funnier than I expected. Sure, there were a few lame jokes, but they tricked me. I thought the actors would turn out to be pretty bad, but the actors were good at playing this comedy. I have to give Amanda Bynes some kudos, she surprisingly looked like her brother and did a great job as a boy. The other actors were also funny. Of course, there were moments when you could not tell on the screen "How can you say that?" Screaming, but that's all part of the fun. In the end, the plot was pretty good. There is a happy ending, but what do you expect? <br /> <br /> All in all just funny.
