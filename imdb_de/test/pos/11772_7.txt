This is the kind of movie that could cause a nightmare, and it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Hardware Wars is the only good parody on Star Wars, other movies like Spaceballs have failed. This is the only good parody movie I've ever seen, it does not tear off Star Wars, it makes fun of it, and that's what parodies are supposed to be.
