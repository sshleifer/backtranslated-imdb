This was one of the most powerful movies I've seen lately. He was absolutely flawless, amazingly original and thought-provoking. The story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very powerful. It's about a guy who kills the retarded little brother of his ex-girlfriend, and since he's being sent to a juvenile detention center, many flashbacks can get you through a story and not let it through to the end. The murder he commits changes the CV for each member of his family and family of the deceased. If you watch and realize that everyone has their own story and their own dark side, you appreciate this movie even more, and it's a total tour de force, these actions can not be described in simple terms. His murder motive is explained incompletely and makes the audience to think. The drama was pretty flawless and the cast was very good, with many familiar faces. If you like the thought-provoking and thought-provoking films (such as 'Donnie Darko', 'Mulholland Dr.') then 'The United States of Leland' is an excellent choice for you. Otherwise, you should have passed. Watch this movie and watch it when you're in the mood to make a serious movie thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> 10/10
