My family keeps watching this movie. Even our 3-year-old loves it. I like the "goodness" in the movie. Give the stranger a chance ... show a goodwill that obviously needs unconditional acceptance. The film gives a feeling of goodwill and victory. Another aspect of the film that makes him so attractive are the personalities of the Velvet siblings. The bird lover. The bug lover. The young lover! Very sweet and happy movie. One thing is irritating. So, Mrs. Brown often makes Mr. Brown look stupid or unwise. She sometimes comes out as an omniscient, and he as a fool that he is not. Too bad to bring that into such a beautiful story. Nevertheless, we will continue to enjoy this beautiful old movie!
