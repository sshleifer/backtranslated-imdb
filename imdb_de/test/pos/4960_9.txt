I really wanted to write a title for this review that did not seem silly or bubbly, but still described my feelings for the show. I can see now that it is not possible. "American Family" is one of the best shows I've ever seen on TV. Several reviewers here on IMDb mentioned the word "beautiful" when describing this show. Never before has a word been more appropriate. The cinematography for this show is breathtaking. Every scene and scene looks like a masterpiece. The lighting, camera shots, scene composition and colors ... I always have to remember that I watch a TV show and not a masterpiece in Motion Picture. The score of Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang brings tears to my eyes. And above all, the acting of the all around amazing cast is honest and sincere. I do not feel that I see performances ... I feel like I'm looking at real life. If only real life could be so beautiful. <br /> <br /> "American Family" has raised the bar for high quality entertainment on TV. I highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to see you. I could easily blame CBS for sharing this show, but I have to say I do not care who it airs. I'm just glad it's for everyone. That's why I want to thank PBS for making sure that this show has not disappeared into nothingness. <br /> <br /> I have to give special recognition to the end of each season. The first was pure creative brilliance and it moved me to tears. I was waiting for Season 2 to end in a creative way, and so it did. Tears again. <br /> <br /> Thanks to everyone involved. They really did make a special work of art with this show, and I really mean that. It's a shame we only had two seasons, but a miracle that we have anything at all.
