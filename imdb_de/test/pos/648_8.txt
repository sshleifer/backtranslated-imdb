I found this movie on Netflix and had to add it to my queue. I was not disappointed when I got it, as it is as funny now as it was when I saw it in a local drive-in theater. <br /> <br /> It becomes a highlight when you get a glimpse of the city getting different characters as they begin their journey across America on the "Honky Tonk Freeway, America on wheels". This was a curious comedy for William DeVane when I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 television movie "The Missiles of October". I had the feeling that no one could break down this dramatic character as well as he did. <br /> <br /> It reminds me a bit of Dick Van Dyke in "Cold Turkey", where Van Dyke played the local minister. The role of DeVane as mayor, minister and activist was typical of small towns, making his character amusing and real. <Br /> <br /> Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as a spoiled family in the motor home were also at this time at the finish: Anyone who has traveled with small children across the country (are we already there?), Will appreciate these scenes knowledge. <br /> <br /> The scenes of a small city struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the little town I grew up in, but they have mastered it with the charm and humor that is often found only in Small cities have seen cities disappear due to the highway system and there is a realistic, if humorous look on what they need to do to survive. (Did zoo animals need anyone?) <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a light comedy with no particular message, but a humorous look at America in the early '80s. It's worth seeing if you just need a bit of good humor.
