The whole abbreviation for supposedly more awareness in this strange time is that you are "blue". The Blue State mentality. This is to keep us from the hook, what happened / was in recent years in our country (the USA). It does not offend anyone, but it makes us feel better, as if we would in no way benefit from living here and getting all the good that a US citizen gets by being a US citizen. <br /> <br /> But I'm so tired of complaining about it. That does not do any good. I have not done much lately and I wonder how many people did it. Maybe I just go down because my job was "outsourced" last month, and now I'm looking for work in the shrinking tech support area, where most jobs go to India quickly and overseas. I think that soon it will not pay to be here citizens, with the disguised infrastructure and the shrinking labor market and war obsession. Nowadays, it seems that everyone who speaks out jumps over his "patriotism" and is questioned. Anyway, back to this review: USA The Movie is an obscure DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken action, be it through politics, protest or art or media. The filmmaker is obviously passionate, knowledgeable, willing to go beyond the norm, frustrated, unique, perceptive, and so on. <br /> <br /> I've reviewed the entire site linked to the DVD and got lost in all articles and essays, etc that are there. The DVD does that as well, it has references to different times, views and historical points. Sometimes someone is doing something out there.
