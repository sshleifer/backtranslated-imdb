I like Armand Assante and the summary of my cable company sounded interesting, so I've reviewed it twice and I'll probably do it again. <br /> <br /> The early part is hard to follow, but later it clears up. I think the script writer tied the loose ends well. <br /> <br /> Part of the acting is not convincing, but maybe it's because I always counted on a double cross. In that case, the bad drama would be the insincerity of the characters interacting with each other, so it fits very well. <br /> <br /> The important issue is that the carnival owner (Assante) washes money for a local casino & his wife with snake charmer (Dagmara Dominczyk) wants to steal it. She complains to "Archie" (Reedus) how horrible her life is and how he could help her get out of it. <br /> <br /> There are 3 or 4 changes of action (which is probably the reason for everything) these loose ends), and if you think you have solved the puzzle, something else will happen. <br /> <br /> My 8/10 score is mainly for the plot. <br /> <br /> I did not win any more - I do not like spoilers, so I do not want to be one, but I think this movie is worth your time.
