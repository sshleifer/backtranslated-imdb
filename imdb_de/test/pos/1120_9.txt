One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and I'm glad to have a great movie like this that reminds me why he was so wonderful. Take a look at it with your children (or your horse). <br /> <br /> The story of an old hardboat horse trailer with children and its luck. If you have ever had or appreciated horse racing, you will appreciate the history of rich rags. It may be a bit below Seabiscuit, but not much. The story is the same except that it is the quarter horse version. Well-maintained, correct racing conditions and equipment as well as beautiful racing scenes. Do not take my word for it, get it and decide.
