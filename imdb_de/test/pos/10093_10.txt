If you're a horror movie fan, you've probably seen Hideo Nakata's Ring and Dark Water. They are great and Ring goes on seamlessly in Hollywood (maybe Dark Water will be adapted soon?). While Ring is almost 100% pure heart pounding and nerve wracking, a story of two sisters is both nerve wracking and mental. <br /> <br /> Together with The Other, I think this Korean movie is a brilliant and smart horror movie. The only flaw that this movie has is that some consider the first 20 minutes rather slow. It's actually typical of Korean and Japanese films. I think it is planned carefully and not as slow. I think it is "quiet moment before the storm". With a thorough introduction of the characters, the Imho viewer will focus more intensely on the character, one of the strengths of Korean and Japanese film. <br /> <br /> Like Ring, a story of two sisters does not exaggerate a ghastly performance. Rather, they let our mind do the intimidating work itself. In this way, it is scary and at the same time terribly chic. It would not surprise me if Hollywood makes this movie again after passing Ring and Grudge / Ju-On (by the way, this movie is not that good, I rate it at 5.5). Do not miss it!
