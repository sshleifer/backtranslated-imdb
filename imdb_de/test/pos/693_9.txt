Any film made by a British production company during World War II, in my opinion, has no respect for today. The confluence of so many things that are close to my heart lies in At Dawn We Dive: descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and a disciple of all aspects of World War II, and especially the Sea War, I prefer subs and action in the North Atlantic and above all those who include the German side of things. For those unaware of targeting, an attack on an enemy warship is the biggest event a submarine can hope for, and such a rare opportunity would be surprisingly similar to this one. The tempo is conscious and typical of the works that were created at the studios Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont at the time: To be honest, I prefer a calmer, more cerebral approach to his humanity and his realism, which works far better than any over-produced Hollywood Movie could be. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger The 49. Parallel, thanks to the compelling Eric Portman, a favorite of mine. John Mills receives a second billing and a smaller font in the titles. This is clearly the film by Mr. Portman, but the whole cast shines. As for the title sequence, am I the only one who is absolutely enchanted by Gainsborough Production's pretty pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl?
