It was no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and exhausting movie. It's all about the effects of the war on the civilian population AND about the "king of depression", Ingmar Bergman. In other words, so many of Bergman's works dive deep into human misery and fear, and so this movie does not seem so extraordinary from that director. The film may offer more insight into the deeper depths of humanity. This is because the main characters (Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow) initially try to overcome adversity, and are essentially decent (if somewhat stupid) people. With the withdrawal after the withdrawal, however, they become (especially by Sydow) less and less human and animal - they do EVERYTHING to survive. But, an interesting insight into human nature. <br /> <br /> PS - 1 What I loved so much about this movie is that it avoided a dumb movie chiche. When the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine, the wine was perfected. In most movies they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched. It drives me crazy, because I would NEVER leave a $ 4 alcoholic drink without drinking it, unless it tasted terrible or had a flaw in the water! BRAVO!
