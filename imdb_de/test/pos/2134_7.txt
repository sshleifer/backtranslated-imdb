This great movie was never shown in my city, so I did not actually have a chance to see it until the late '80s, when I saw it on German television. I expected something from a disaster and instead found a well-functioning Grand Western with excellent site work. The small tube could not really damage it, and in this 4-hour movie, there is almost no boring moment. I hope to see him again on the big screen. What a spectacle that would be! Do not miss it if you ever have the chance. Unfortunately, the harsh treatment of "Heaven's Gate" at its opening ruined Michael Cimino's career and he switched from the passable ("Year of the Dragon") to the boring ridiculous ("The Sicilian") and the screeching stupid ("Desperate Hours"). ). ,
