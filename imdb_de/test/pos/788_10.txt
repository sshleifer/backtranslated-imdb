This is a wonderful comedy - one of Keaton's absolute best. Through a long line of stupid mistakes Buster is considered a wanted killer. Therefore, most of the film consists of him and the police, especially a detective. While I'm NOT a fan of movies with many chase scenes, this is the absolute best in terms of athletic and acrobatic skills. I've seen some who had wilder stunts, but none where the star was supple and could move with amazing grace. In particular, there is a scene in which he runs across a table, jumps on the shoulders of a man and jumps as brutally through the rear as humanly possible. Plus, so many jokes are funny and perfectly tuned, as he really believes he actually killed someone. By the way, this movie is very similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make both worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This movie is brilliant and the only Keaton short movie I can think of. What I probably liked more was THE PLAYHOUSE - where Buster plays every role in the theater.
