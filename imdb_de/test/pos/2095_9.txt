The third movie I saw at the philly film was this outstanding drama from Japan. After nine prisoners escaped from prison, they planned to find the "key to the universe", from which a tenth convict who had not broken out told them. On the way, we get to know each of these men pretty well. Everyone has their own dreams. For the most part of the film, it usually seems to be a comedy, but there is a shift in which the film becomes a tragedy. All actors give great performances. I can not say much more without spoiling the movie, but suffice to say that in the end you have a feeling for some of these people. With 2 hours, this movie is a bit too long, but still good. I have no qualms about recommending it with the warning that there is a bit of disquieting violence for the affectionate. Toshiaki Toyoda was at home this time, and I want to track down his earlier films and look forward to seeing his future. <br /> <br /> My grade: A
