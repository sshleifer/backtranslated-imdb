This is undoubtedly the most exciting and satisfying movie I have seen in years! The plot you see in print is almost banal - a ship crashes on a desert planet with three suns, the survivors have to adapt to the landscape and each other, then it gets dark and the monsters appear. After a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere as she nearly threw the passengers overboard, Pilot Fry takes over the group and claims the help of the convicted killer Riddick, who leads her through the darkness to the escape ship - he's the one who operates surgically improved eyes that can see in the dark. But it really is not that easy - each character is complex, three-dimensional and has contradictory features, so you never know exactly who is good and who is bad. <br /> <br /> The performances are uniquely outstanding - Radha Mitchell shows how Fry armed herself for leadership, overcoming her own fears and trying to prevent further bloodshed while Cole Hauser, as the man who Riddick has taken back into custody, showing that he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. But the movie belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen in years. For most of the movie, his face is in the shadows, and he does not say much, but he still attracts your attention. Sometimes he attracts your attention by not talking or moving. And Diesel does not trivialize the character as it would easily do by giving him a "heart of gold" - Riddick is still a mean and vicious man as they approach the ship - he only lets us take the first cautious steps Recognize care only for the self care for others. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is very good. The light effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - the triple sunlight with overblack and the dark in pitch. Special effects that show both the views of Riddick and the monsters add to the suspense, as do the sound effects of the flying monsters and the use of ultrasound to "see" (the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and reasonably scary). Editing is so tight that sometimes it's almost uncomfortable - in this movie there is literally no padding, no fades, no time to reorient. <br /> <br /> From the opening to the end of the credits to keep your wits about you. Every scene, every line of dialogue, every camera shot is important. Look at it three times to understand everything. <br /> <br /> My only limitation concerns science - the solar system shown in the model is impossible (planets revolve around suns, not the other way round). This has no impact on human history, so I have not taken any points for it.
