By no means a film that revolutionizes the industry or introduces new techniques of film making, this is a beautiful and solid production. It's a miracle that we can enjoy it today on DVD in excellent quality - most of the viewers probably had a black-and-white copy about 100 years ago because the stencil-tinted luxury edition was only available in the best theaters. Even if you are not fascinated by this movie or its theme, you can admire the copy published by Image Entertainment (along with another gem, From the Manger To the Cross, 1912). It is virtually impossible to see a movie that is over a century old and does so little damage. The process of stencil dyeing was very effective, and in comparison to the occasionally blurry and smeared images of hand-dyed films, the colors are crisp and clear. The static nature of the scenes filmed during the filming, which was known at the beginning of filming in 1902, can today be considered as almost deliberate, meditative and solemn. The tableaus move with a uniform paste, so the film never gets boring. You may not be fascinated by this film as a work of cinematography, but it is quite substantial as a work of academic, painterly art. If you are a religious person, the fact that you observe anonymous, long-dead people playing long-dead characters is a mystery. A proper visit for Christmas or Lent. <br /> <br /> P.S: I ticked the box "contains spoiler" just for fun. As you can see, I did not announce the end.
