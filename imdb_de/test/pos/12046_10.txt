This movie is such a good movie. Shah Ruck Khan does a great job like the crazy crazy rogue who's totally obsessed with <br /> <br /> the girl. The story is fantastic. The acting of all <br /> <br /> characters like the girl and Shah Ruck and Sunny are all fabulous and I love the first song very much, especially as he comes back in the end and it's so emotional if you're a real shah Ruck Khan fan, then you have to watch this movie because he is the best shah ruck khan movie he always plays an excellent role and i wish he had done more crazy man roles, but you have to look at that, which is always one really good movie is. This is a really good movie you have to see, it's really amazing I have to see it, it's fabulous, I can go on with this movie because it's a fun, weird, cool and totally awesome movie in the world
