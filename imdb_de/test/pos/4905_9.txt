"Four Daughters" begins as another clone of the melodrama "Little Women". A single father with four gifted, musically talented daughters has his hands full to keep them in line and guide them in their court rituals. What turns the movie is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star. Some critics say the first anti-hero long before James Dean graced the big screen. From the time that the dark, unsuspecting figure of Mickey Borden (John Garfield) appears to Ann Lemp's (Priscilla Lane) Gate and his self-pity and doomed philosophy spills over to the rest of the cast, "Four Daughters" becomes much more as just a chick flick. <br /> <br /> Although Garfield is the main reason to see "Four Daughters," there are other highlights as well. Hungarian-born director Michael Curtiz, later responsible for jewels such as "Casablanca" and "Mildred Pierce," displays certain images with his camera (with the help of cinematographer Ernest Haller of "Rebel Without A Cause"), in memory the viewer stays. For example, the screeching gate on which Ann's first admirer Ann, Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), swings so merrily, becomes symbolic of the mood shifts and affections of those who use him. <br /> <br /> That Garfield delivers the outstanding performance is obvious, but the rest of the cast holds most of the way. The undervalued Jeffrey Lynn plays his role in perfection, as the neglected worshiper whose love for his beloved Ann never wavers, even when she is with another man. Claude Rains, who has become a bit old-fashioned as the father of the four young women, gives a beautiful depiction of a sentence about meeting a family head who gets lost in the shuffle. The three Lane Sisters, already known for their musical abilities, become accomplished actresses who play their roles well. A number of supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson and Eddie Acuff, make it all believable. <br /> <br /> How opposites dress is part of the trick to touch the imagination of the audience. Ann is the eternal optimist, even if she and Mickey are down. She always looks good and, like so many who were trapped in the depression of the Great Depression, saw her prosperity just around the corner. Mickey lists a whole list of bad things that happened to him as he sought companionship in Ann's misery, which Ann does not want. Mickey assumes that he has to be hit with a bolt of lightning that kills him as he walks around the corner of life. Mickey has a weak talent as a composer. Ann has talent as a singer and musician. Ann is big on beauty. Mickey has a great personality in a confused sense. And the differences go on and on. How it all ends up with each other is an important part of the film that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> See "Four Daughters" for John Garfield's doozy of a big-screen acting debut. The only time he felt better came seven years later, when he once again mesmerized moviegoers with one of the greatest performances of all time, when Frank Chambers in "The Postman Rings Twice Twice" approaches the equally charismatic Lana Turner , But also check out "Four Daughters" to catch important elements that may be overlooked if too much focus is placed on the star of the show.
