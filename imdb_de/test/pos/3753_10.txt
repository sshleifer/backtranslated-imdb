here in Germany it was shown only once on television. With everything becoming mainstream today, it's absolutely impossible to see such a movie back on screen. Maybe it's the same in the US or especially in the UK. The message is a brutal truth: find friends to get your ideas closer to reality, or you'll become a loser, if not an asshole. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is not that easy it may seem here. Every little scene, every sentence, every behavior of the characters shows exactly what could happen if a person in a sadistic crowd is not accepted, which describes himself as normal. <br /> <br /> Very well played by all This is a must. Who is the main character? John (not Cox, people, remember?) Or Niles (who's still Bimbo) Decide and you'll get the action as intended. <br /> <br /> A bitter look at what society is going through in a repressive system. Art of Salingers Catcher in the Rye and Goldings The Lord of the Flies thought to the end. <br /> <br /> The final may change his own opinion. word
