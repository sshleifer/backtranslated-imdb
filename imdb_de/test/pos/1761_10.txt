"Hoppity Goes to Town" was the second and final full-length animated feature by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a parallel universe to Disney. While Disney's films are well remembered today, the two butcher films are "forgotten" by Gulliver's Travels. <br /> <br /> "Hoppity" is a fascinating original and no adaptation like the first picture. That's a big plus, you'd think. No, the critics, who were rarely on the Fleischers side at first, tore themselves into it. Yes, the story is not as close as "Gulliver", but how can you hate a movie that shows itself so happy? <br /> <br /> It's full of great musical numbers and a very poignant story to uncover a crime. The characters are gracious and charming, and this movie has a heart. <br /> <br /> The Fleischers really outdid themselves and never again. Most of the time would work for one-reelers, after they were crammed at the box office. It's a shame that they do not continue to create features. Who knows? Her next attempt may have become a masterpiece they sought. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
