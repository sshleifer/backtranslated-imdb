*** SPOILERS *** This film shows the brutal massacre caused by the resignation of Johnny Carson to determine who would replace him. The imitations of David Letterman and Jay Leno are performed satisfactorily by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, although the performances were not great. Reni Santoni is the best performance of the "Execs" (he plays John Agoglia of NBC), and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) is just behind him. I was shocked by the way Littlefield was busy debating dropping Johnny Carson. That was Johnny Carson! This scene bears witness to the world of television, in which the world of television is located. Kathy Bates delivered the best performance of the film as Jay agent Helen Kushnick. Another commentator claimed that Leno was portrayed as a rogue in the movie. I do not agree. The relationship with Kushnick bordered on a kind of domestic violence. She orders him around, and when he finally rebels against her, she tries to pronounce the sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); But when Jay ends their relationship, she becomes violent again and screams: "Do not leave me, you two-fingered bastard!" before a picture is smashed to the ground. Overall, the movie is hilarious and I wish he was shown more often.
