"Oppenheimer" with Sam Waterston in the title role and David Suchet as Evard Teller are an example of the finest docudrama. Well written, well played by actors who have a credible resemblance to their historical characters, very informative and very entertaining. The sets and costumes reflect US sentiment during World War II, and plotting and dialogue give the viewer the feeling of being truly present in Los Alamos and getting into the excitement of the Manhattan Project. The only downside is that it's a British production, and some of the actors lack a convincing American accent. (It's amazing how Australian and Irish actors nowadays deal with non-native dialects.) The plot is fully in line with Richard Rhodes' final history of atomic bomb development. Unfortunately, the mini-series was only shown a few times on PBS in the early eighties and then apparently disappeared into oblivion. Oppenheimer is compared to the recent Fat Man & Little Boy 'movie with Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (the chronically overweight and more homely general would be flattered through and through) and Dwight Schultz (alumnus from TV's A team) as Oppenheimer. As a mini-series, 'Oppenheimer' is about four times as long as the Newman feature, but uses all the extra time to its full advantage.
