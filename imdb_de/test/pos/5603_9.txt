While the camera was certainly "funky" - perhaps a Dutch role just before "stoned" - the premise of the film was fantastic. The view of God, Jesus and the devil was really incisive satirical (in the true tradition of Hal Hartley). The interplay of Jesus and Satan offers some funny scenes ... Even the monologues of Jesus were great - this was by far the best Jesus I have ever seen. So relaxed, Zen-like, son of God, but still such a nice guy. On one level, this is a very general view of the paradoxes of Christianity, but there is still a personal level on which you can refer to Jesus Christ without a God complex (thanks to Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley).
