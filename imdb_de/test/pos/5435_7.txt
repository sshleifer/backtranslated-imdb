Robin Williams shows his stand-up talents and enhances his status as a comedian in this movie titled "What's wrong - in American politics and how can Hollywood try to exert influence without boring people". Of course, Hollywood uses movies with hidden or non-hidden agendas. I think this movie is for people who like stand-up and political discussions. The trailers of this movie were meant for everyone to ensure that as many people as possible will see it. Everyone knows that Hollywood is more liberal / democratic than the bush & co, so they have to shoot these films from time to time ... but this may have been too obvious, at least I thought so, to make a real change. Nevertheless great stand and new political issues and conversations ... I enjoyed it and thanks to IMDb.com reviews I was positively surprised when I went out of the cinema and yes, I often laughed , Sometimes you just have to let go and forget all seriousness. Watch this movie if you like good and smart stand-up or politics, and you will not be offended by the various hints that things are not good at the moment. Rent it if that does not suit you.
