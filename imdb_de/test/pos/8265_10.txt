I am fortunate to have a good quality copy of my VHS on DVD, so I can watch it again and again. The characters are so well played that I can not find any faults in any aspect of the casting. OK, so there are a few differences to the book, but the old clich√© of love that conquers everything is portrayed so powerfully that it makes no difference. Country life in rural England in the early 19th century is beautifully contrasted by the changing seasons, from biting winter to glorious summer days. This is reflected in the different characters, from Prue's bullying father to Kester's all-embracing love. A story that changed my life.
