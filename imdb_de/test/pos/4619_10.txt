I showed this movie in a preview this evening and it was fantastic. It is well suited for depicting topics that an average high school student is exposed to. <br /> <br /> I left the film dumbfounded and sad, but grateful that this film will have a chance to raise awareness of these issues (bullying, rape, suicide and depression). It's a fantastic Aussie movie , <br /> <br /> Go see. <br /> <br /> Support him. <br /> <br /> Learn about it.
