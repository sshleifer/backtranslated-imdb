I will not go into a generalization and say that it is the best love story ever, as some have said. That's okay, people feel very deeply about this movie, either you love him, I think ... or you just hate him. I do not want to say, best of all, because that's just too wide to make such a statement. However, I feel very passionate about The English Patient, as do millions of other people. <br /> <br /> The awards say it all. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the critics, on many levels, but I could not agree with those who opted for them. <br /> <br /> 9 Oscars. <br /> <br /> 41-wins. <br /> <br /> 37 more nominations, make this love story at the top. <br /> <br /> From storyteller Anthony Minghella, the story that storms the screen, and when Mr. Peterman (by T. V. Seinfeld) said, "Elaine, I just can not look at it!" In that case, I do not agree with Elaine's answer. But history is building up and needs the right time to make her case beautiful. The cinematography (John Seale) was also awarded several times, as it should be. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche so far. Well, not quite right. I loved her performance in "Sabrina". Nice story of a slightly complicated relationship alongside Harrison Ford. But that was just an incredibly diverse character for her, and as talented as she is, she simply shined in her subtle and graceful way, she was exactly what this movie was looking for had and no other actress. Ralph Fiennes was also spectacular in the performance of Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability after seeing them! What can you say except to see this picture again. (*****)
