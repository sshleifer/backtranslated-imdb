This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I've been on the water since I was 13, so I got a lot of humor and also recognized many landscapes near the country. The film was filmed in and around Virginia and filmed around the San Francisco Bay), most notably the fleet of mothballs east of Benicia Bridge, where the character of Kelsey Grammar was first unveiled in the USS Stingray, and the piers of San Francisco at End of the movie (including a boat I worked on)). As other people said, the actors seemed to enjoy making this movie and making it entertaining. The line "We are approaching the ground, sir! I hear a few lobsters who laugh at it" is invaluable, at least to me. <br /> <br /> I'm one of many people eagerly awaiting a letterbox DVD from Down Periscope.
