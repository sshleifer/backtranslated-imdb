I had waited so long to see this movie, and finally came to yesterday. In summary, I am glad that I finally made it. The humor is funny from the wall. The conspiracy is so incredibly believable that it has to have at least some truth. If anything is noticeable in this movie, this is definitely the coffee shop scene. I was where each guy was. You are unloaded. They find out that your ex was playing around with a guy you're sure is an asshole. Well, every time you see something in the next few days, you get terrible thoughts in all the wrong areas. She messes up everyone and everyone knows it. I could probably watch this man licking his wallet all day, fingering, looking back on myself and laughing because I was there too.
