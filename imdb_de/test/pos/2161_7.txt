Look at the first 20 minutes, even if the tension has not yet arrived. Only a few years after the great bombing attempt that contributed to the end of the Second World War, we get a glimpse of the most secretive Los Alamos. Apart from the strict security, it seems safe enough. Note that it is a TV joiner, an obvious normal guy who guides us through safety. Once through, it's like any other city in the US, beautiful houses, quiet streets, kids going to school, and family TV flashing. Later we see little Tommy and little Peggy walking through streets lined with impressive structures separated by closed gates. The movie seems to say, "Okay, we're tough just because we have to, but basically we're still people." Well, I think that was reassuring news to the Cold War spectators, who are still not used to the government's "doomsday" research. It is a clear attempt to reassure the population. The one dark note is when Tommy's mother (Clarke) worries about her son's mental condition. He does not say "When I grow up"; Instead, it says, "When I grow up." These doubts reflect not only a Los Alamos reality, but also a national that had seen in 1952 just taking pictures of the apocalyptic H-bomb. Also note how professionally FBI agents are portrayed, a standard feature of the McCarthy era. If brute force is needed, it is not them, but the private citizen Gene Barry, who throws out the information - an early version, I think, of the "era of modern times". Once the kidnapping occurs, the tension will not let up. The intrigues are handled well with colorful locations in LA that advise us. The climate scenes around the cliff houses are not plausible as hiding places, but the view of the north of New Mexico is great. Even the ancient stone apartments are one of the more exotic settings of the decade. Also note the extensive deployment of the police helicopter being used as a law enforcement tool. Nancy Gates continues to be an oppressive role as a teacher, Ellen Haskell. Never Hollywood glamorous, she was still a beautiful unsung actress and winning personality. I also expect it to be one of Director Hopper's more successful films, and although people have become accustomed to the nuclear threat, the film remains an enlightening and intriguing document of its time.
