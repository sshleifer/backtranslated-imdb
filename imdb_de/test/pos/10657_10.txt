Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest movie I've seen, and it's also the first silent movie I've seen. I heard a lot of good things about this movie, so I brought out the tape at home and watched it. In the end, I thought that this is a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the real Russian battleship Potemkin. They would not think so, but some of it was sad and disgusting. Sad is that the mother dies and the stroller rolls down the stairs and it is disgusting that they have to eat rotten meat with maggots. <br /> <br /> Today it is considered one of the best silent films ever made in Russia. I think everyone should see it (if they can find it). You will be surprised how good it is. It is a must classic. 5.5.
