Feels like an impressionistic film; If there is such a thing. <br /> <br /> The story is well told, very poetic. the characters well developed and well played by the performers (or interpreted by the actors :)). <br /> <br /> The film sometimes enjoys its own voluptuous emotions and works well unless you hate such emotions in movies not so in my case. <br /> <br /> It's a very humanistic movie. <br /> <br /> The landscape and even the exceptional situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in themselves. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> A good classic for any good movie collection.
