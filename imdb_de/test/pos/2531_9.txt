That was really a "nightmare" of a movie; I saw it on cable television about nine years ago and have not forgotten it since then. Pixote is a 10-year-old boy who lives in the streets of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and leads a criminal life accompanied by his teenage friends Lilica, Dito and Chico. They steal, pimp, sell drugs and murder to survive every day ... In the first half of the movie, Pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic nursing home, where he witnesses every kind of abuse by elderly inmates and witnesses guards for the rest of the children; One night, Liliya's friend is killed after a flogging, so Pixote and his friends decide to flee during an uprising. The rest of the film shows Pixote's descent into a criminal life; he does not show any feelings or regrets after killing someone, perhaps because he knows that good feelings in the world he lives in are of no use ... But there is a gentle scene in the middle of the film; Pixote and his friends are on the beach and miss (and wish) that one of his friends from the reformatory was there. I thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the midst of all these terrible events ... The boys obviously yearn not only for their friend, but for a better life. Director Hector Babenco's "Pixote" is a brave and depressing film that does not shy away from showing the hardest reality that many people - myself included - tend to ignore or misunderstand. This movie will probably open your eyes and make you a better and more compassionate person.
