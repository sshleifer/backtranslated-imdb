Kennedy-Miller could hardly have accomplished a very challenging task: shaping dry political events as human drama and providing an equal representation of explosive controversial issues. The key to success is, in the first place, a brilliant spectacle, though Max Phipps' performance as Gough Whitlam was less impressive than other commentators. The clear standouts for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the simplest casting decisions in history - Hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. Secondly, the series avoids the "myth of objectivity" by a narrator who articulates the sympathy of the director (Phillip Noyce, who has recently demonstrated his left-wing credentials in the Rabbit Proof Fence) while being carefully balanced and sympathetic in his dramatic portrayal of all parties , Sticking to the Lady Kerr / Lady Macbeth theme popular with Labor partisans might be a bit biased, if not ruinous. It is, above all, thanks for the sympathy that Kerr has shown, and perhaps not entirely to blame for the extraordinarily difficult position in which he found himself, whatever one might think of his actions - the account of Jim Cairns / June Morosi -Affair. Those who come to this series without background knowledge have the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a dirt campaign in a hurried rain gutter press. Producers may have been held back in this regard by stinging defamation laws in Australia, and Cairns' and Morosi's recent demonstrated willingness to use them against those who said their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually admit a year before his death). However, more could have been done of the bizarre manner in which Morosi ran Cairn's office as Treasurer. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Defamation: There are some confusing occasions where the dialogue is obscured by violations of dispositions Principals - by a beeping on one occasion and a very loud phone ringing in another. Another curiosity: The DVD release features a line from the comic scene in which a customs officer (played by Paul Chubb) serves Tirath Khemlani on his arrival at Sydney Airport. The next in line is a ruffled-looking hippie, who now only gets a disapproving look from Chubb when he submits his paperwork. In the original version, Chubb said something like "drug abuse in Bali, what?". Obviously, this line does not seem to be true after the Schapelle Corby case, which dramatically shows that those who are being hit for drug abuse in Bali can be far worse than deportations.
