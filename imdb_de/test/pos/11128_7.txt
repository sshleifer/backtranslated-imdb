In New York, a group of undergraduate students enter the High School for Performing Arts after their audition has been successful. Her dreams, deceptions, achievements, love and personal dramas are revealed for four years by the insecure Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), the gay Montgomery (Payl McCrane), the aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), the hopeful Coco (Irene Cara) ), the ambitious Ralph Garci (Barry Miller) and her friends until graduation. <br /> <br /> 28 years ago, "Fame" was a great success, with the story of teenagers having a place in show business, and I loved this movie and the soundtrack on CD. I've just watched "Fame" on DVD and now I would say it's a good movie that has a lot of potential, but with too many flawed subplots. The story follows many characters and leaves many situations without an answer. I do not know if Alan Parker had problems with the edition to shorten the running time of this movie, but what happened to the ballerina going to a clinic for abortion, for example? What happened to Leroy and his teacher? Did he fail because of his grammatical problem? What happened to Coco after she took off her blouse in this rogue's apartment? The musician playing synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot. Nevertheless, "Fame" is still an adorable conversation and a cult movie for me. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fama" ("Fame")
