After reading so much negative press on the movie in recent years, I had always avoided it, but the advent of the cheap public domain DVD encouraged me to finally see it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it was transferred from a bad copy. The modern prequel, recorded with tinted shaft, is blurry and the contrast is absent. Faces are sometimes hard to spot. Nevertheless, the actual story is entertaining and Lou acts more than in many films of the guys as an accomplished actor. <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie changes to the "Jack" story, the movie goes to 'color' and I use that term loosely. Most shades are orange or brown. The greens look particularly bad. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Ford as 'Polly', the maid of the giant, was a big plus for me as I enjoyed her in an early "Andy Hardy" performance. <br /> <br With so many negative comments due to the actual print quality, I'm still happy to give this movie a 7. It made me laugh a lot and that's more than the majority of the comedies I've watched. Decades can do it. <br /> <br /> One that you can watch if you get the chance.
