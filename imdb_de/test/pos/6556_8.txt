Uzumaki is a visually stunning movie, but I felt that part of the story was being sacrificed. There is hardly any character development that personally liberated me from the film, which is ironic as all puns are put aside. This film really attracts you with its many light spiral effects and stunning transitions. At first I was thrown off the overall cinematography, but once you got used to the big picture, start seeing the beauty in this twisted movie. This is a great movie if you are looking for a viewer with too much substance or deeper meaning. It's a great horror movie that's not really scary or exciting, but somehow ... scary.
