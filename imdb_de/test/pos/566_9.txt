Thus we carry the same dark weaknesses that we all unfortunately have: lies, deception, laziness, the list goes on. <br /> <br /> As an American, however, I was shocked that corruption and racism nowadays exist in police service, as the terrible detective and police action of the Duval County Sheriff Department accused of murdering a white tourist and a 15-year-old black teenager , I shook my head that detectives were protected from their abusive work, while a young man's LIFE stood in the blatant balance of justice. <br /> <br /> However, there is also a history of hope with our judicial system and how poorly paid public defenders stayed with their weapons (irony intended) and urged the detectives the truth. I wanted to fly to Florida and tell anyone with influence what a great team of public defenders Duval County is. These lawyers take care of the "little" man and above all justice. <br /> <br /> The other story is about faith and family. Praise for the family of the defendants and their strong Christian faith and wonderful family values. I hope they win their lawsuit against Duval County Sheriff Division. Bravo for justice !!! Bravo for the little guy !!!
