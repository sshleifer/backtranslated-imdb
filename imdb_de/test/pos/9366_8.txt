Edward Dmytryk's "Crossfire" is a rare 1940s Hollywood movie. This was a groundbreaking area for Mr. Dmytryk and the studio because of what the director and his adapter, John Paxton, had decided to do with the novel in which the film is based. <br /> <br /> If you do not do this I have watched the movie, please stop reading. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks novel was about killing a gay soldier. The film was about prejudice against Jews, a topic that was taboo in American cinema at the time. It is thanks to Mr Dmytryk that he had the courage to even participate in this film project. <br /> <br /> The film is an outstanding piece of film because the director presents it. Obviously influenced by the film noir style, we are brought to Washington in post-war Washington life. The opening scene of Samuels brutal murder shows how unusual cruelty is inflicted on a decent man we do not know or who was killed but who did not deserve to die in such a terrible way. > <br /> The basis of the murder are pure and simple prejudices. We see how in the consciousness of an ignorant man the mere fact of being successful and different plays in the consciousness of the assassin. Samuels stands as a sacrificial lamb just as the gay soldier is the victim in the novel. The parallels are well drawn. <br /> <br /> This film makes a fascinating view due to the brilliant star turn of Robert Ryan, as Montgomery. Mr. Ryan was an actor who always played interesting roles but was never as good as Crossfire. Gloria Grahame also has a great appearance, because Ginny, the prostitute, with her heart in the right place. The rest of the cast plays as an ensemble. Robert Young, the police officer responsible for the investigation, is a decent man who has known first-hand prejudice in his own family and loudly speaks against it. Robert Mitchum plays a cool Sgt. Keeley, who is deeply touched by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing him. Sam Levene is outstanding in his small role as Samuels. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to watch, probably the first to loudly speak against ignorance.
