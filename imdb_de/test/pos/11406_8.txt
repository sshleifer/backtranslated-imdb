People say that this movie is a "typical teenage horror movie" ... Well, it's a horror movie with a teenage girl in it ... what do you expect! It's a good movie, I counted 3 real screams during the running movie and it was a very scary, scary movie. I was never bored in the movie and I was even on the edge of the seat sometime. The only thing that was a bit bad was that it was a bit slow to dive into the story, but it made her find herself where she was and why. The acting was good, the scenery was good and the story was good as well, I hope to see a "When A Stranger Calls 2" in a few months! Good movie!
