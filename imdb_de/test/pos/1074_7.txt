It's not really about wine. No, Nossiter's real goals are those that would rationalize and assimilate the peculiarities of local (wine) production for business purposes. For this purpose he has made an excellent, objective film. Spiritual, offended, emotional and faulty independent wine producers face media-refined, anodized Americans and Auld Europeans: the art of winemaking versus market-oriented, laboratory product manufacturing. It's an open show that does not lead to a conclusion. <br /> <br /> Nossiter's film is sometimes annoying - cameras are neither hidden nor used in any way. There are also many captions and subtitles that are often too short on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, Michael Moore outperforms the game, which Moore can not play anyway. The characters speak for themselves and therefore condemn them. Well worth a visit 7/10
