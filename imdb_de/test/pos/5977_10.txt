Even if Voskhozhdeniye is your favorite movie, you can only see it every ten years at the most. It's just too emotionally exhausting. Widely referred to as Shepitko's finest film, THE ASCENT is the story of partisans operating in the middle of winter in the White Russian Forest in the occupied Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The sheer physicality of the war experiences, especially the deprivations of cold and snow, the actual struggle for survival, both against nature and against the fascists, always has a subtle, barely derived subtext of the moral Judgment and the question of whether a man can do that morally or immoral in one context, but otherwise in another. <br /> <br /> A partisan group hidden in the forest is attacked by a German patrol and loses its food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish teacher, have the job of going to a small village to eat. They find the village burned down with nothing edible and nothing more than charred woods and foundations containing a children's mirror in a single hole. The overwhelming feeling is that the one who brings the brutality of war into a country and one people is really cursed. I thought about the war that the Americans and British brought to Iraq and what it's like to bring the horrors of war to people, as if they were a degenerate nation. <br /> <br /> The two move to a nearby larger village where they live procured under duress a lamb from the contributor. The Germans arrive and the two partisans flee under fire. Sotnikov gets kicked and keeps the Germans away when Rybak gets away with the lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that he is ready to not be taken alive, he takes off his boot to put a bullet in his head. At this moment, Rybak returns and pulls Sotnikov out of the line of fire. <br /> <br /> Rybak pulls Sotnikov through the forest, bloody meter by meter, all in a long shot. Every meter is a torment, and yet he pulls him through deep snow, over ridges, over depressions, over black bush stumps that crack under the weight of men. There are a number of similarities to Tarkovsky's cinematic vocabulary-the long steps that document a process, the repercussions of repetition, and the resulting emotional stress that builds up as the shot lasts. In the background, unnoticed because of the action, hangs a question: Has Rybak committed an immoral act by returning for Sotnikov? Whether under the moral standards of Marxism-Leninism or just the common imperative of survival of the group, was it not his duty to bring the food into his hungry gang and leave Sotnikov to cover his escape? To sacrifice a man for the group to survive? What leads to the question: Can one be morally moral to a man who is immoral under a philosophical system under another moral system? The partisans, like another war-curse, enter a farmhouse where there is a woman with three small children. She is embittered by the scourge of war and barely hanging out with her three children. They are hardly rested when more Germans turn up. They set out to go and are led into the attic to hide. Sotnikov's cough gives her away. When a German looks at his head to take a look and no one answers, he threatens to shoot at the attic and break Rybak's nerves, and they are captured. Who has the moral responsibility now? Sotnikov for coughing or Rybek for cracking? The two partisans and their mother are crammed together and taken to a nearby town, which passes under a wrought-iron arch at the entrance. They find the boss and a little girl already in custody. They are interrogated by a white-tailed turkey played by Tarkovsky's darling Anatoli Solonitsyn. Sotnikov keeps his head during the interrogation and the torture and asks only what was the profession of the interrogator before the war? He does not answer, but from his ease of standing behind a desk, the probable answer was "teacher." Rybak, however, asks for his life and even offers to join the police. The previously unnoticed character defect that makes a "wrong" moral decision whose ambiguity (sentimentality) it covers in court is now becoming obvious, disturbing and very ugly. <br /> <br /> The five are sitting in a dark cell. They should all die the next day. From here, the elements of a Christian parable become stronger. Genuine Rembrandt lighting and compositions are used, while other Old Master poses of Christ are depicted. He decides that he can save anyone if he takes the blame for all. He has to stay alive until morning so he can save everyone. He begs the mother's forgiveness, and the leader, who knows what's going on, does not feel so desperate because he died as uselessly as he did before. The morning is coming. The Germans do not care if Sotnikov takes over all the sins of his companions or not. They are all hung up. You trudge along a steeply sloping street that is a virtual Via Dolorosa. A bank is brought to the place of execution, which is the gateway to the city. There are five ropes hanging from it. The bench is only three, so Sotnikov stands on a tree stump that Rybak pushes out from under him. They are all hung up. <br /> <br /> As Rybak walks down the street with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him a Judas, an unnecessary allusion, Shepitko's only misstep. Rybak imagines several times being shot in the back to escape, to die an honorable death, and tries unsuccessfully to hang himself in the shithouse, but leaves the Germans as the beaten dog that he is. But if Rybak was morally right to save Sotnikov's life, is he wrong in trying to save his own life?
