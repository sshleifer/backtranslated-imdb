As with Rififi, the most convincing scene in the movie is the perfected silence of the jewel robbery. The scene is masterful in execution, each of the robbers has his own specialized job, everyone has successfully brought his unique talent to the goal and everyone until a month before strangers. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are very slow. In fact, the opening scene is a long introduction to the characters of Corey and Vogel. We see Corey released from prison and Escape Bird on his way to captivity. The two characters are then brought together by a fate in a roadside snack bar when Vogel hides in the trunk of Corey's car. After this unlikely slump, the two strangers agree to become partners to make a perfected and accurate jewel robbery. <br /> <br /> However, to avoid this robbery, a third man named Jansen must be present. Jansen is hired as a safe firearms man. His involvement in the mix was an interesting and desperate decision. At the time of his hiring, Jansen is in a full fight with DTs and spent most of his day on his cot hallucinating about lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the disheveled and hallucinatory world of a William S. Burroughs dream to the safe and sober sniper is a very fast and perhaps the only real wrong moment in the movie, but that's just me very picky. > <br /> Another slightly false comment was that of Police Inspector Mattei. Sometimes he seemed brilliant when he armed the right people or gathered information and waited for his prisoner to escape. At other times, he appeared to be 10 years after retirement, especially at the beginning of Vogel's flight through the forest. <br /> <br /> I wonder if I had too much hidden meaning at the beginning of the movie. At the beginning of the film, as the police car drives through the city, the first image we see is a red brake light. My first thought was that this could be the "red circle" and that if I'm to find a deeper meaning in the movie, that car or the people driving through the red light will be those who stop the jewel robbery. Hmmmm? <br /> <br /> Maybe the red circle refers to the theft ring of the triumvirate? Maybe it was the burning sled? No matter. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it does not feel like it. The end is a bit disappointing. It seemed too hurry for a movie that felt like a delicious slow fire. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Clark Richards
