This story has had a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories about miners and the wild. Books like Call of the Wild, White Catcher, The Border Crosser, and My Side of the Mountain influenced me enormously. I wanted to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be exactly like "trapper". However, as I grew older, I was too domesticated to live that way. Nevertheless, I still romanticize how one lives like that. I agree with some of the other reviews in this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that's quite common in Disneyisque-style films. However, if you look past the mechanics where it was made, and see the gist of the story, the true issues are Then I find you feel pleasantly touched. I take care to watch this movie once a year. After thirty-one years, I can still smell as I see snow falling down the hillside and hear the echo of the trapper higher. <br /> <br /> - Good luck, vintage and stay free <br /> <br /> PS If you want to know more about the true story, I found this link on the Mad Trapper by Rat River: < br /> <br /> http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/NWT/madtrapper.htm
