I gave these 9 stars out of a possible 10th. If it had just a tiny bit more plotline, I would have given it 10. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a very interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey, who played a sympathetic, old crush, would have received the Oscar for her performance. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace (who portrays Alice), whom I've never seen, does a great job and has the sexiest body I've ever seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> Alice was recently inflamed for Florida, where she has a girlfriend (or maybe it's her sister, I'm not sure, and that's my fault, not the movie) and high hopes for one College she and her family really can not afford. <br /> She seems to be quite vulnerable on the road alone, and in fact she meets some rough-looking characters, and soon after she discovers that there's a hole in one of her tires. <br /> <br / At the time, she's at a rest area and is assisted by a woman named Sandra and her husband, Bill, an elderly couple traveling in a motorhome. <br /> <br /> You drive south to Florida and take her under her wing, but is everyone the way he presents himself? Flashbacks and paranoia appeal to the story as our young heroine learns new lessons about life.
