I've crushed my brain for another movie that reminds me of it. I really can not come with one. I think it's because most of the films that deal with this topic (war, peace, violence) have a solid documentation style. There are some great movies that are all better known than USA TM. They should be informative and bring your emotional response to the surface in an intellectual way. This DVD may seem more intellectual in some ways, but it is not. It may be philosophical, but it bypasses information mode and goes directly to the same place as a piece of music. You feel it, but sometimes you do not know why. They are just put somewhere on a wave of feeling. When you see it, notice how well it's put together. It may not be for everyone, but for anyone looking for a rare cinematic creation that respects you.
