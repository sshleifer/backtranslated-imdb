Pat O'Brien had his best role as Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne. From the humble beginnings, Rockne joined as a student in 1910 in Notre Dame. He is an avid footballer and hero. Upon graduation, he teaches chemistry at the school, but has the football fever that tugs at him, forcing him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of training the game. Too bad the school has lost a great chemistry teacher - certainly much better and more beautiful than the one I had in high school. (Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn, to be exact.) <br /> <br /> He motivates his students. He will not tolerate academic underpayments. He is a coach for all seasons. <br /> <br /> O'Brien captures the familiar kind of touch. One of his students, George Gipp, is memorably played by Ronald Reagan in a short supporting performance. The years pass and the successes are high - but Knute remains the same coach who testifies before the Congress when football is being challenged. Donald Crisp is an outstanding Notre Dame priest who knew that Rockne should train football. Albert Basserman is appropriate, but his Jewish accent in depicting a priest is unpleasant at best. Basserman was nominated this year in the category "Foreign Correspondent". <br /> <br /> Rockne's tragic death in a plane crash robbed the world of many more years of a perfectly professional man. The movie is great.
