Just see! It's a smart movie, but hard to understand the first time around. See it more than once. Everything seen or heard on screen has been purposely designed to evoke a feeling, a feeling or a sound. The clarity of certain images and the sharpness of certain sounds are purposely contrasted with blurry images or pops, crackles, hisses, and barely audible sounds. The structure is not linear and cyclic. Motives repeat themselves as time runs clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations of "plot" and "character" are broken, indicating a non-traditional use of the film to tell a story that is both contemporary and old, like humanity. This is part of a review: "USA The Movie is emotionally intense and intellectually intriguing and profoundly disturbing, in a surprising and unconventional way." Dion Dennis, PhD
