That's great for a kids movie. As an adult and mother, I enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter. There is a lot going on in this film. The following * could * be * considered * a spoiler * ... Barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this film. She also learns not to give up hope and master her anger. I loved the feeling of teamwork as you watch Barbie and her sister and friends solve the puzzle. There is nothing in the movie that I found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. In fact, I found the moral messages of the film excellent and well done. <br /> <br /> The entertainment was pretty good. I really enjoy the skating scenes and think they were done very well. There's a lot of action in this movie, so I guess most kids would enjoy it ... not just those who really care about Barbie. My daughter actually picked it out because of Pegasus. She loves horses. But she really enjoyed the movie. My daughter is an autistic and could play through the whole movie and enjoy. She liked the action scenes and all the parts with horses. <br /> <br /> One thing that I thought about was that many people reject Barbie (and Ken) because they are so beautiful. However, I think that children as well as adults look at beautiful people and things. It is natural. As adults, we also like to watch beautiful movie stars. It's wonderful that the Barbie character and her "friend" have a lot of personality. It's fun to see pretty people, but it gets old when there's no substance behind the pretty face. All in all, I would say this is a great movie for kids, and parents will enjoy it as well. :)
