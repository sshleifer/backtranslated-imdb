This short film certainly does not take any punches. The story is about a butcher who wrongly kills an innocent man he believes has sexually molested his backward daughter. The film continues to show how the butcher spends his time, and he lives with his caring daughter back to life and has to accept a life without a future. <br /> <br /> Slaughtering the graphic opening scenes of a horse, and the full frontal birth of the Butcher's Daughter puts you in a brutal mood that accompanies you throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The biting flow of the movie is very direct and increases its brutality. Consequently, much soil is covered in the 40 minutes. They are fully involved in the non-life of the butcher - especially after losing his daughter to social services and his business. His story continues in the excellent film Seul Contre Tous
