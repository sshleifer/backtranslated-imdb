Swift's socialism and pacifism prevail in this successful remake against all odds. (Did you know that there is no hyphen after "good"? Fact.) He encounters warlike miniatures, socialist giants, (literally) philosophers and pacifist horses that rule over Yahoo's - almost Neanderthal humanoids. (Is that where "yahoo" came from?) We also meet with the insidious Dr. Bates, the devoted Mary Gulliver, the sweet and devoted son of Thomas, and the full cast of a truly dreadful nineteenth-century madhouse. The suspension of unbelief is easy, and our 7- and 12-year-old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and I did. (Sorry for the length, IMDb needs 10 lines.)
