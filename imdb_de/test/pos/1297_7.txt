This film was shot only 48 years after the end of the Civil War - most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film there are replicas of battles and the people of this time, which look quite impressive and realistic. It also offers a different and more balanced view than just the contemporary BIRTH OF A NATION - an obviously absurd and racist film. That's why this short film would be great for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man who runs away to announce himself as a drummer. The boy does well and is a hero, although the film ends rather melodramatically - a certain convention of the day. Not a great movie, but a decent storyline, decent acting, and little over-the-top acting that you've often seen in other films of the day. <br/> <br/> One annoying aspect of this movie was the overuse of title cards to describe the things that were really obvious. It got annoying from time to time.
