One of the macabre, depressing but eye-opening doctors. I watched for a while. There is no narrative or story to tell, just a "third-eye" camera that follows around two pairs of heroin addicts in NYC during the seasons. I watch them pop up on the floors of public washrooms and then "clean" their needles in the public toilets ... sometimes it's a bit too much and you have to take a break just to take a breather Anyone who's watching is in the recovery of alcohol / drugs, should observe this when he longs for it - it really shows you what you could go back to! Having seen this, it is a wonder that anyone could even try this medicine. <br /> <br /> The only thing it needed was a follow-up at the end to say where these people are today. Judging from what is shown in the document, there is no hope for any of them. They mention that they want to get better and stop, but it seems that the only end to their habits is dying. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not for every audience. I felt like I saw a car crash - after I started watching him, I just could not turn it off. I kept watching with a dark / morbid fascination with what it looks like in the lives of these addicts.
