This is another jewel written by Daniele Thompson - in fact, she wrote in the same year (1999) La Buche, the first of three authors / directors. Belle Maman is first and foremost "French", whatever that means, which of course is different from other people. The premise is simple: on the altar where he marries Mathilde Seigner, the groom Vincent Lindon gets his first glimpse of her mother Catherine Deneuve and suffers from what the French call a coup d'etat that we love at first sight. Theoretically, the story is either 1) over and then assuming he has canceled the wedding, or 2) just the beginning when he goes through the wedding and lives a lie until it is solved in one way or another. Thompson goes to # 2, but not without meeting us with the weird subplot, such as Deneuve's cigar-smoking lesbian mother Line Renaud (in real life, if anyone cares, Renaud is in a long-term relationship with Stephane Audran.) That's here plays the lead role) and throws a brilliant offset at the wedding reception in a luxuriously appointed men's room, which takes the form of a fun song and dance. Perfect writer that she is Thompson leaves comedy with drama like the brilliant climate scene in which Vincent spits out his feelings for Deneuve at a family reunion while ruining the joint. That is a pleasure. Again and again.
