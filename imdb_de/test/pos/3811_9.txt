Little Gus is a ten-year-old offender. He runs away from his parents and decides to make a road trip. To reach the petal is a bit difficult for him, so he creates a tool to help him. His goal is to win a card game called Motorama. He must find all eight letters to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. A dark laugh follows as it turns from hell into a journey. He meets some confused Lynch characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who sets his image on a dragon in the hope that God will see it. Later, Gus gets a tattoo and eye patch for his injured eye. He becomes one of the most unruly tithing you can ever see on the screen. This is not child's play! Look for cameos from Jack Nance, Flea and Drew Berrymore. Be warned, though Drew is on the front page. She only appears in a dream sequence in the movie for a few seconds. The film also becomes confusing towards the end when it reaches the David Lynch territory. You might want to see him a few times. "Motorama" was written by Joseph Minion, best known for his screenplays for "After Hours" and "Vampire's Kiss." So enjoy this damn surreal road trip!
