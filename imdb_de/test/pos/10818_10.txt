I saw bon voyage 2 days ago and found it to be an excellent production. The film should entertain and do it too! It mimics the style of the American screwball comedies of the 30s, but voyage is more sophisticated. Adjani and Depardieu are just great people. The plot is simple. The film begins with people who are involved in many situations between which apparently nothing has to do. It's very funny how these situations are linked together during the movie. It's nice to see a French movie with this humor. I think it's mainly a movie where love is the main theme. Peter Coyote as a German spy in France once again proves to be an outstanding actor.
