The 1990s movie starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger is rightly praised and I enjoyed it very much, but this original TV is just as well and in a way more appropriately cast. Claire Bloom is no cheeky Joy, but she is still confident and tosses her cap to her favorite author (played by Joss Ackland in one of his best performances). Quieter, calmer and less emotional than the Attenborough movie may be, but it does justice to a wonderful game full of meaningful dialogues. You're still going to scream for this version, but maybe you do not have the musical prompts to let you go. <br /> <br /> There's room for both - and if you've seen this on stage, I'd say the Ackland / Flower is a bit more faithful. But they are both excellent.
