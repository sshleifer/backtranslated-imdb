Since I'm not a movie lover, I do not know the names of the leading directors, screenwriters, producers, and the like, but I can spot a great movie when I see one. The creators of this beautiful movie Could now be at the top of their fields or maybe soon be there. I know that the actors are already there. <br /> <br /> Talents are brought closer to the genius, to show how realistic a national tragedy like Vietnam has affected the everyday life of a typical American average family and let us see it up close, why there are so many homeless Vietnam veterans? /> The dialogue is particularly poignant and gives us an idea of ​​what has happened in so many families to Vietnam. <br /> <br /> I wish there were more good movies like this here. not only about Vietnam, but also about other social conditions.
