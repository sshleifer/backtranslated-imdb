In this tense and character-driven romantic tragicomedy we get an insight into the intertwined life of four Parisians from the thirties. In the center is Vinz Cassell's portrayal of Max. A star-eyed Romeo who falls head over heels in love with the beautiful stranger Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his exasperated best friend Lucien (Écoffey, in a subtle but effective performance), he wins her heart and they live happily ever after ... that is, until the scheming, neurotic and obsessive Alice (the versatile novel Bohringer) , becomes very involved in the life and love of the other three. <br /> <br /> The rich conspiracy is condensed by a curious chronological jumble, and the movie appears as a complicated puzzle, the eye-catcher of the Parisian postcard in the heart of everything. The use of color does not go unnoticed, especially in Lisa's spectacular apartment (probably responsible for the film's title), in which red and yellow provoke the fires of passion and lust. The audience can refer to Max: He really carries his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstances. In a memorable scene, our destiny lovers (agonizingly separated by a "choreographed" misconception) miss the chance encounter that they would surely reunite. Independently they travel to the same destination: they in the metro, he in a taxi, practically tête-à-tête. But fate seems to be, and the audience is fascinating. <br /> <br /> The performances in this movie really make L'Appartement. I still can not understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside of France. He has presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's real spouse at the time of writing) has recently gained fame in the anglophone film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - she is of divine beauty, but behind it stands a talented actress who can dominate a scene in the classic "leading Lady "style that many British and American actresses reject in favor of the all too simple" subtle "approach. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch this movie! I doubt you will be disappointed. It's enthralling, satisfying, amusing, sad, lavish, and a lesson in artistic filmmaking.
