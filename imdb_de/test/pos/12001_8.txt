or other stories reminiscent of the Leopold and Loeb case, you'll find this movie entertaining. Performers include Robert Culp, with Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as college students. Peter Falk is his ordinary self and pretends to be tricked by the precocious students. Caffrey ("Longtime Companion", "Buried Alive") is excellent and should take on more of these menacing roles. Basically, the two comrades of the demanding parents are tired, who expect nothing less than academic perfection. The visit of the best schools is only financed if it adapts. There is an excellent scene in which Culp rubs Caffrey over the coals after he gets a bad grade, threatens to cut off his trust funds, and Caffrey later tells his friend, "I hate him, I want him dead"> <br /> Beverly Hills is not all good. This is always an excellent topic. I believe that this film appeared in 1990 right after the Menendez murders. If you see "Menedez, a murder in Beverly Hills" and then compare it to this movie, you may find some interesting parallels.
