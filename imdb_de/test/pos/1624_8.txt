As I sat in the theater almost crying with consternation at the cruelty that Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel, Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> Hanks and Company are back for the Sequel Prequel Angels and Demons, and they have learned their lesson. <br/> <br /> If you are wise, everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra is very good and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is as always very good, but he is better at it because he works hard to make the film feel like a thriller. I think Ewan McGregor does the best job of an actor. He might even earn a nomination in March, but he's doubtful. He convinced me until the end. He is dynamic and faithful, but rational, and recognizes that the church must leave its past behind. The little actors also do very good jobs. Technically and visually, the film is greatly improved. The camera is much better, and the visual effects are superb. The final explosion sequence at the end is excellent. Howard does a masterful job and guides you through Rome. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard is doing a great deal this time around keeping the story moving and not boring us with a history lesson denouncing Christianity. The film also gives the feeling that more is at stake. Discovering in our weak minds whether Jesus had children or not is not high on the list compared to a catastrophic explosion that killed thousands, including the Roman Catholic Church. Part of the reason why I think the story is so fast is the excellent score. I can not say enough about the score. It was sometimes epic, like Lord of the Rings, but sometimes it felt like a Bourne movie, which is a nice mix. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this film is that it's ridiculously far-fetched. The chances of the Carmelengo being someone of the age of Ewan McGregor are highly unlikely, and the odds of having a cardinal adopted with one Son is elected Pope, are even more ridiculous. Not to mention the whole Antimatter thing that has not yet been created, and Dan Brown wrote the book in 2003 ... <br /> <br /> Overall, Angels and Demons are much more tight-cut, fast-paced, and excitingly important movie as the Da Vinci Code. This is a must for anyone who loves history and mystery.
