I realize that many people have called the nature of this show racist and homophobic, but I do not think that's what this show is about. <br /> <br /> The show is about parents who were not ready for children and not for teenagers. This show helps to bring humor to a very hard topic that is sometimes overlooked: parenting. <br /> <br /> Yes, we had all shows with families, for example: Family Matters, Step by Step, Family Ties, Full House ... but it would always have the same old recipe for its consequences. "Steph" breaks off the school and gets caught by her father. They have a heart for heart conversation and music is played and it's over with a two-week justification that after a "aww, dad ..." a smile comes and the show is over. Where is the comedy in such a situation? Where is the realism? With The War at Home you get real situations from a real father figure. Most parents watching this show hear some lines that bring out the parents, and they either laugh (because they know they said it!) Or they nod (because they know they thought it) Say it!) The war at home has situations in which a great comedy arises when the father thinks his son is gay. Does not sound weird, most people think the father is becoming homophobic, but the comedy comes from the limping father trying to talk to his son to open up. Which parent knows the right thing to say, especially in a situation like this? I can only recommend this show to anyone I know has a sense of humor, and especially anyone who is a young parent or was young when they had children. They refer to a show like this, if you are either.
