<br /> <br /> 'The Last Frontier' is a superior west that overcomes numerous shortcomings in the history of the trapper Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relations with the army in particular Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, the wife of Colonel (Anne Bancroft). Jed, Gus, and Mongoose, who were hired to the Indians after losing their supplies, are preparing to live the "civilized" life in a fortress on the edge of the "last frontier." Jed, who was educated by Gus, inspires and looks up to the "older" Gus and Mungo and has a particularly hard time dealing with "civilization". His real problems begin after he has strongly attracted Colonel Corrina's wife. Colonel Marston is a reckless man who threatens each of his surroundings with his dreams of merciless victory over any opponent. Corrina, a woman repressed by her position and sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is. In the middle is Captain Riordon, a brave and likeable man exposed to his duty to the army, his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the supreme's likely catastrophic consequences of recklessness. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so interesting (and entertaining) is that in most cases the weaknesses and strengths of "The Last Frontier" are EXACTLY the same elements (forget the threadbare title and the dated one) Music)) <br /> <br /> First the script. Almost all subplots (especially the reckless colonel) were bettered elsewhere, but were rarely compiled with such eccentricity. Just when you think you know what will happen next, it will take off in a different direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: "The Last Frontier" is a "Production Code" movie (formerly the word "virgin" was taboo), it is very surprising that the adultery factor was treated so well and tolerantly. I expected that either Jed or the wife of the Supreme Retribution would reap their sins. I was surprised and a little disappointed that the film did not exploit this expectation to create an unpredictable end. <br /> <br /> Second, the casting. Mature is at least ten years old to play the Jed, the wild innocent who grew up in the forest. James Whitmore, who plays Gus, the man who raised Jed, is actually five years younger than Mature. Nevertheless, Mature is very gracious to play a character who is innocent of civilization, but by no means stupid. Although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time (especially Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), no one could have played any better. Preston (also known as Mature's Junior) plays Colonel Marston and misses the tics and affections one would expect from such a driven man. Preston, however, perfectly captures the sense of honor that someone in Marston must have seen to bring such a reckless fool to the rank of colonel. Bancroft is a particularly wise choice as Corrina. Bancroft's dark hair has died blond, and this has the same effect as Winona Ryder ("Edward Scissorhands") and Christina Ricci ("Sleepy Hollow"). That is, I felt confronted with the character without knowing exactly why; I think the answer is that blondes and brunettes have distinct skin and eye colors. In addition, Bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on the hardness (here it makes the blonde hair a little softer). This allows 24-year-old Bancroft to compete with both 40-year-old Mature and 37-year-old Preston; yes, she could be the wife of a colonel. Madison goes through a cautious balancing act like Riordan's, which dominates a complex role and sometimes a devious dialogue. A role similar to that of John Wayne in Fort Apache Madison plays a more skillful work. <br /> <br /> This movie has a fellowship of the type "Silverado". That alone makes it worth seeing. It also has unforgettable performances, beautiful scenery and great action and direction. I just hope that a letterbox version is available (many have been lost) as this movie takes full advantage of this format.
