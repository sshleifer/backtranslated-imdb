After seeing Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning blog as a link from YouTube, I used the same sources to see a remake in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit animated by the same man - Ub Iwerks , Compared to the previous black-and-white colors, the colors here are really imaginative, and many of the new gags are similar when one of the skeleton band players constantly beats a wrong note or when you lose your head and lose another or when dances are with the other with a part of the other - just as funny as the previous one. It gets a bit repetitive in the end. However, Skeleton Frolics is well worth seeing for any animation fan who wants to compare this with the previous Silly Symphony.
