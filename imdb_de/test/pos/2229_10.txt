Although it is often considered the worst film by Peter Sellers, it is indeed an excellent award of corruption in the company commission and abuse of power. Often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for. satirical farce. This film had great performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (from Happy Days and the Karate Kid films), but was marked by its versatility, disrespect, and total demolition of the medical industry of the time. It was his time (1972) to go the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would go to the movies some time later. As such, it was unacceptable to the traditional Peter Sellers fan who considered the sharp barbs in this humor to be something they were not used to. At the moment, Peter Sellers films are in high demand by fans, but this effort, "Where Do It Hurt", is by nature almost impossible to find.
