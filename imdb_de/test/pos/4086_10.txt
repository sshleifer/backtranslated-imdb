Dozens of real thrillers are screened every year on television. You can watch 3 or 4 on Lifetime every Saturday and on Court TV you can count on a couple every weekend. So I started to look at the Morrison Murders. I thought I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautiful-looking drama that captivated me from start to finish. Both brothers were totally convinced, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every setting. If I wanted to complain, it was Gordon Clapp as sheriff. He just does not look or behave like a small Southerner, Byron Calhoun. He looks and sounds like Medavoy, and Medavoy is not right for this part. <br /> <br /> But that's a minor point of criticism: The Morrison Murders is well worth a visit, and not just on a rainy Saturday afternoon. When you go out, record it. You will not regret it.
