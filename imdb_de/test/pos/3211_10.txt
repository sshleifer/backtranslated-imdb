People have to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few) are clearly people who have not seen many episodes. You really have to sit down and watch this show to appreciate it. All characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is unusual on television today. The play is for the most part excellent. Lauren Graham has been abused by an Emmy for six years. Someone has to give this woman the credit she deserves. The same goes for Kelly Bishop, who plays so well for Emily Gilmore. It's also nice to see a show that a young girl in the middle can have and not be filled with teenage fear. Rory is a smart girl who is not much on TV today. If only other shows could capture the entirety of this show ...
