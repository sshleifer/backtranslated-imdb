I know that the film was pretty rough by the critics, but I have to say that I really liked it. The real star is the fantastic Dylan Moran. In all his different disguises he is always funny and convincing at the same time. He also manages to radiate a sweet charm that disproves his impudent pratfalls. Also worth mentioning is Michael Gambon, who plays in the city center with a brilliant accurate yet comedic Dublin accent. The only weak link is Caine, who, while obviously making a big laugh, plays the least interesting and unlikeable character. It's probably not played that well overseas, but it's still worth a clock.
