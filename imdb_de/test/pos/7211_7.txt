Can this really be a Troma movie? Some scenes have almost an "A" movie. Acting is generally proficient (the two lead actors and the nursing surrogate were especially good and I liked some confrontations between the young capulets and the ques). The scenes were processed smoothly; The plot is coherent. It's funny. It has a hip, original soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It has the usual gross gross outs and a low sense of humor, but I do not think Shakespeare had so much against it. I think maybe he got some good laughs. <br /> <br /> It's a good DVD. There's an alternate soundtrack with a very informative commentary from the director, several deleted scenes, and the usual collection of Troma's self-ironic stupidity, but it's a pretty inspired low-budget filmmaking.
