Tracy and Matt, Michelle and Sebastian: These are the two couples whose lives of addiction, crime and misery are captured in this unadulterated and honest HBO documentary. They are alternately eager, charming, repellent, remarkably stupid and devoted: the drugs and each other. They are also very different: Matt is a working-class boy who clearly enjoys his infatuation, while Tracy supports the couple with Western Union money from their money-bag dad, who makes a surprisingly sympathetic cameo towards the end of the film. Meanwhile, widow Michelle (whose husband died of an OD) earns her daily bread by posing as a NYPD cop ready to deal with her would-be Johns to avoid imprisonment. They are drawn into their stories and wish the movie to be twice as long. Unlike most documentaries of this nature, there is no coda that provides us with an update on their progress (can Matt and Tracy really keep the flat in Brooklyn, will Michelle return to Bellevue to get more detox and Sebastian gets a little pathetic become?). As a result, the film seems incomplete, but that was perhaps the point. Consideration as long as you are not completely averse to scenes in which people appear.
