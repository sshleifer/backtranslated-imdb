I just looked at it and it was fantastic. Was in serious doubt whether he should borrow the DVD or not. So if you ... and like to see other than brainless action movies, do not hesitate any longer. Do not let the blunt ceiling stop you. The script is one of the best ever. Smart, witty, original, touching and keeps you at the seat edge throughout the movie. I had seen another movie before and was really tired. I usually get bored one night when I watch a second movie, but it really woke me up and did not have any boring moments. It also made me rethink many things in life and made me feel really good. <br /> <br /> Acting is great as well (one of Kevin Spacey's best roles). The visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen. If I have to come up with something negative ... well .... I really can not find anything ...... Have fun! 10 out of 10
