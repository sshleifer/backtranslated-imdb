This is an amazingly well filmed, early talkie adaptation of the game by Eugene O'Neill. Its main drawback is a static camera, and as a result, the filmed game is mostly distracted, which is a pity, because it's a good deal of primitive filmmaking done at a time when the sound of all kinds worked most of the films were experimental whether this was the intention of their manufacturer or not. Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as in her silent films, and her performance is still classic. Her voice is strangely deep and almost boyish, which only adds to her seductive eccentric personality. As her friend, Charles Bickford is correspondingly male - he was apparently brusquely born - and a perfect counterpart to the divine Garbo. His Irish brogue is not bad at all, and he always seems to be a natural man of the sea, very O'Neill-like in his independent, brooding nature. George Marion, as Garbo's (very) confused father, seems to come from another time. He has the kind of face and voice - open, unmanned, totally false - that has disappeared from the earth. Marie Dressler is also in the O'Neill scene. Her expressionless expression and intense intensity around the eyes speak volumes, as she sometimes borders on psychosis as a woman. Poetic license maybe, since this is not in the script, but we can forgive Miss Dresslers excesses; she's too good at not doing it. The story ends with a move to the next thing, unlike the dissolution, which is not the author's cup; And those who want to finish their films properly will be disappointed if there is no real surprise. In Anna Christie, we are in O'Neill Land, a place of sea, storms and fog, a sense of all-pervasive and damned insecurity that we would now call ambivalence or fear neurosis. Instead of analyzing this mood, the author introduces it simply and wisely. When weather, land, sea and people connect and appeal in a unique language, we feel privileged to be heard.
