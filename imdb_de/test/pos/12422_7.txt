Two townspeople drive through Hicksville USA when suddenly a rusty monster truck appears and repeatedly tries to run them off the road. After finding a mysterious blond hitchhiker, they stop at a truck stop with Redneck amputees, one of whom warns them of 'the demon out there'. But they do not listen. Big mistake! "Monster Man" by Michael Davis mixes comedy surprisingly well with horror. The film is heavily borrowed from "Duel," "The Blair Witch Project," "Jeepers Creepers" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." The story is pretty stupid, but there's plenty of thrills and violence to make splatterfreaks happy I especially enjoyed the performance of Justin Urich, which makes the movie easier to comedy, and the total lack of tension is still hard to forgive. This is a chance if you are wasting some time.7 of 10. Did I mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy is?
