I was privileged to be one of the still photographers on the set of "Grand Champion" and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the film. I have been working in photography for 25 years and have worked on 16 films. I can not imagine a time when I enjoyed my craft more. It was wonderful to work with the children, and little Emma Roberts has so much energy that she is a real journey. She even grabbed one of my cameras during the stock-check rehearsal and started shooting. Some of her pictures were used for PR. I could have made more money working for a production with a bigger budget, but I doubt I would have had the fun and so many great actors and the great people of West Texas.
