I love everything about Family Guy. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in the family are Brian and Stewie, and I like the episodes very much, when they mainly interact in their interaction like "Road to Rhode Island" (Season 2). The comments they make just sewed me together. Peter's behavior is also very funny, as some of the things he does "are so brilliant that they are left behind". The voice output is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane, as he provides the voices for half of the Griffin family as well as for their perverted neighbor Glenn Quagmire and how he creates that range (especially with vocals), I just do not know. He earns his two Emmy's for the voice of evil baby genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his funny and totally crazy regular character, the mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (voiced by Seth Green) are the things he says show that he goes after his dad when it comes to intelligence and common sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I found annoying is that The UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase the DVD sales, which in no way reflects the program itself, but rather the marketing. <br /> <br /> If you like Family Guy, I would highly recommend the other American project by Seth MacFarlane Dad, who uses a different sense of humor, but is still extremely funny.
