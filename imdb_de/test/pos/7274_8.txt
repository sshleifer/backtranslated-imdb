Ah, how refreshing it is to see a eighteenth-century vision of England with mud, smallpox and gibbets ... plus a wonderful techno soundtrack. This is the story of the run-down street artist Plunkett (Robert Carlisle) and Captain Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), who fell in difficult times, and how they come together and rob the aristo pigs. Plunkett is a tough nut to crack, but MaCleane is way too polite to become a gentleman highwayman. He falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) (who, frankly, is the only weak part of the whole Shebang) and wants to impress her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are fantastic. Big, colorful, historically unsightly, beautiful shawls. Alan Cummings gets the best threads and the best lines like Lord Rochester, who wears an 18th century eyebrow piercing. The music alternates between stormy glorious choirs and thumping bass-heavy techno, which does not scratch as one would expect in a historical movie. The script is fast paced and peppered with modern colloquialisms; Merchant Ivory, that is not the case. There are hilarious parts, disgusting parts, sitting on the edge of your seat and nibbling on your fingernails, but the whole thing goes along and is wonderfully entertaining. This is jubilation in the cinema. Not to be missed
