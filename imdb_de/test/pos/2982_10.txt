Michelle, Anic√©e Alvina, was so nice and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The "Seasons Reprise" by Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings forever in my mind ... Please, if you know where I could find a VHS of the movie, email me !! My 26 year old husband and I saw this as a junior in HS. Yes, he was my friend at the time and still is. I think we both cried. I think we were drawn into the movie by Elton John music, but then were carried away by the teenage fear. Paul and Michelle were about our age when we saw the movie - so easy to identify !! It is wonderful to hear that Sean is fine, I am also in the "helping professions" (an RN). I found his performance good and very credible. "Michelle" looked very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think the main topic is that if they do not have to deal with the "real world", they could be happy and still be in love. How many times did we all just want to have a "calgon moment"? If we all had no external worries and could only cope with our "basic needs," it could be a little easier. I have a 15-year-old daughter and would have no problem seeing this movie. Children look so much worse these days that it is very tame. For those of you trying to find the CD, my husband (a big Elton John fan) got a 2-CD set that was released in 1992. It's called "Elton John-Rare Masters" Polygram Studios. This has all friends songs as well as many others. As far as we know, this is the only CD with the music "Friends". We also had the LP years ago and were thrilled to find the CD. Good luck. I can recommend this movie to anyone who loves the theme of "Young Love". I just wish it was on DVD now!
