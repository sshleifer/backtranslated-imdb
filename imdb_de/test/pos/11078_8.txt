This anime tells the story of the battle for Mamodo King. Every 1,000 years, 100 Mamadan children are sent to Earth to fight who the next king will be (in the original Japanese, the creatures are Mamono, which literally means "magic / evil object"). Each Mamado is paired with a human partner and receives a magic spellbook. Man can use this book to unleash unbelievable powers in the mamodo, and when a mamodo is defeated, his spellbook is in flames (alternatively a mamdodo book can be directly caught and burned). After that, the Mamodo returns to the Mamodo world. <br /> <br /> The title character is Zatch (Gash in Japan), a 6-year-old Mamodo with electrical energy. He is paired with Kiyomaru Takamini and a 14-year-old genius. Zatch initially hesitates to fight, but when he finds out that some Mamodo are evil and decides that the fight for the king is wrong, he decided to fight to become a "friendly king", but a better comparison is Digimon , Like Digimon, Mamodo and man have a one to one symbiotic relationship. Unlike Pokemon, both shows have an actual plot. <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell offers character growth and developing relationships as well as some pretty adult storylines (like love against racism, slavery, mind control, etc.). It even has some decent twists and secrets.
