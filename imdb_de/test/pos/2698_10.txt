Here in Germany "King of Queens" has a great cult status! Almost every teenager (and adult) is watching this sitcom. It is really great !! Better than the other dreadful American sitcoms like "Full House" or "Set by Step" (the only series that's still alright is "Al Bundy"). There was no American sitcom in Europe that was as effective as this really funny show !! Kevin James and Leah Remini as Doug & Carrie Haffernan are the craziest couple I know, Jerry Stiller as Arthur is the funniest "grandpa" I know, and Victor Williams and (in particular) Patton Oswalt as Deacon & Spence are the most diverse but funniest guys I know. I watch it as often as I can and still do not have enough good mood!
