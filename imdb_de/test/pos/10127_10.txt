Radio was a very good movie, and honestly, I never cry in movies. But it had brought me pretty close to tears. It really impressed me when the mother of Radio died and he just did not come out of his room. I was really sad that you would not really understand death if you were mentally retarded. I really liked the movie and it has to be seen.
