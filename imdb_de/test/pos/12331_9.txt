You have to watch this movie ... I saw it at the age of 13 in the theater, on my very first date ... Fast forward over 20 years and I'm gay now (Thanks, One Dark Night.) !! LOL!). This movie has fucking swallowed me as a kid (mausoleums yet!), But as an adult, the thrill of this movie is not in the storyline, but the hysterical laughter that he calls ... the names the teens call "nerdlebrain." "(my personal favorite) to" turkey ". Keep your eyes open for the scene where Carol (the blonde head nurse) tries to hang up her phone on a soda can (can not believe they did not pick it up!) Dramatic bursts and sticky bodies. If you're a fan of real horror, I'd suggest this movie just because it's almost a horror parody to me. There are def. a scary factor and the plot is a good one, but do not pay attention to it if you want to be frightened out of your mind (unless you are about 10 years old or something).
