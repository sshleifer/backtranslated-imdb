Synopsis: Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) sits alone in a coach and is dropped off on a desert land, apparently the last stop of his journey. He does not know how he got there, but a welcome sign was set up for him. After briefly considering his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who kidnaps him into his new life. Then he enters another world than the one from which he came. <br /> <br /> As Andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant, he senses that his environment is a bit too consistent for his taste. In the first lunch break, he immediately notices that everyone in the city is walking around in gray suits. On this day, he sees a colleague dead on fake pike, which looks like a suicide. The strange thing is that the city dwellers pay no attention to this terrible act and go on as if it had never happened. It is easy to see that these people are genetically desensitized and lack the ability to distinguish between human and inhumane. <br /> <br /> To help Andreas settle in, he is invited to join his colleagues in a local nightclub. The club seems a step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night. And when Andreas drinks his troubles, he realizes that the alcohol, no matter how much he drinks, has no influence on him. While he is telling these remarks to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a toilet cub begins to utter words that Andreas has always remembered. When he realizes that this man thinks what he is, he follows him to his house and notes where he lives for future reference. The plot evolves predictably with Andreas, who wants to escape. He's looking for the man he once followed ... hoping that he could make him become human again ... but is it too late? My thoughts: This Norwegian film is something everyone should see, as it contains the answer to the big question! What's the meaning of life? (well, close enough). The film sketches the dark realities of what has become of today's working man (or woman). Their sole purpose is to make people realize that life is too short to be materialistic. It tries to show that small clich√©s, such as the noise of playing children, should not be taken for granted because the moment you stop hearing that sound is the moment you are one step away from it To become a robot. The end of the film repeats what happens when it's too late to escape routine. You start taking the saying, "If it's not broken, do not fix it," and make yourself too comfortable to take a risk of change. <br /> <br /> Even though this film should not be included as a piece of realism ... its message is more than real. The lack of empathy conveyed by the film and seen by Andreas is a bold statement of what life can become. The director Jens Lien has put together a film that would have failed in other hands of the directors. This is a fine piece of film genius, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what he does next. <br /> <br /> The main role played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag is perfectly staffed. Trond represents the average Joe and is a good catalyst to make this picture darkly humorous. The supporting cast is also doing a great job, and for some reason I think Keanu Reeves would have been perfect in this film because most of the cast actors required their acting to be emotionless. The score because this movie was beautifully composed. The recurring theme was always a pleasure to listen to, and there was a very bleak but welcome feeling for the film to relive that experience on the big screen. This film has prevailed in my Top 10 and has now quickly become my Top 20! It has some shocking scenes and is consistently darkly humorous ... A MUST SEA !!
