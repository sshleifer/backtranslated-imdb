Treat Williams has achieved some fame with this film and really wasted it. Do not be fooled by his bad movie choices. This movie really stands out. "Hair" is a musical that really deals with the attitude of the famous 1960s peace movement and probably more with the persona. There is a lot of spectacular music that is played in a spectacular way. In contrast to the music videos of the late 70s, 80s and 90s, the video flashes match the theme of the music. In other words, the video makes sense when compared to the songs. So you know that MTV could never have come. The subject deals with drugs and hippies, but most of the time it's an anti-war movie that deals with the pointless tragedies of Vietnam. One of the protagonists is an Oklahoma boy who aims to make a difference. He believes in the patriotic dribble he feeds with a spoon, and he meets a gang in New York who is more or less glorified brats. Their characters are very unique and probably would not make sense today, but this bundle accumulates by burning their draft cards. What emerges in a spectacular scenery and fascinating scenes not only includes the three main characters, but also the other 3 gang members as well as a newcomer with a small child whose entrance is easily one of the ten largest entrances of all time in the cinema, in part because it is one of the biggest songs of this generation are singing. Despite their mistakes you will love these people, a cinematic triumph with heart and grand finale.
