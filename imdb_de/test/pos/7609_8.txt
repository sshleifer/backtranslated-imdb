I saw this movie for the first time years ago when it was new and I was satisfied. It's a great Hollywood story for teenagers. It is not lifelike. As much as you would believe it, these stories never happen. Therefore, it is irritating to watch such films. They play with the minds of teenagers, just imagine how many girls who are still in high schools believe in this magic and have been disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to my little sister or cousin. The director should have spent more time thinking about the plot than thinking about actors. Yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea is not worth 10. There are many films about teenagers. Why do not we make a better one?
