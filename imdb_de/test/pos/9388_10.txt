I watch a lot of films. Many movies. The completion of a film study forces you to see 2-3 times a day for years. It's going to be exhausting. Mostly because I feel like I saw everything. So rare is it when I am surprised by something, mostly I hope to see something as good as I have imagined. <br /> <br /> The Deathbed is so different from anything I've ever experienced DVD to complain about its genius. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the piece is psychotic. It is structured so that the viewer is outside the frame. It's not something like Halloween with all its snappy cuts and POV shots; The deathbed seems somehow dreamy. The most demanding way I can express it is: Samuel Beckett makes a spooky movie. I mean, it's a manic-depressive bed that eats people! And fried chicken! Outside in nowhere! And there are bone hands! I can hardly articulate my feelings about this film. If you stop liking this, you will open to ridicule. But things will be the same after a while. It's hard to be a cinephile and keep in touch. I can honestly say that this is an absolutely unique movie from top to bottom. From what it is, how it is put together. We need such films, films that shake our complacency. Think of it as an existential camp. It's fun and it's stupid, but also brilliant in its strange way. The worst horror villain of all time? Maybe, but at least it's not a man in a mask.
