This small picture succeeds where many big pictures fail. Because it was a small picture, John Ford was not bothered by the studio's wigs. He was happier with this movie than anyone else, because he could do it in his own way. He could also use his repertoire of talented character actors who had played such an important role in his successes in the past. Some of them, like Ben Johnson, had been discovered by Ford and had the opportunity to show off their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic Oklahoma cowboy who normally did his own stunt work. Years later, he won the coveted Oscar for his brilliant performance in The Last Picture Show. Ward Bond outshines even Ben Johnson in this movie. He is not the wagon master, this role Johnson plays, but due to this film, he later received the role of the carmaker in the classic television series "Wagon Train". Ironically, one of the bad guys in "Wagon Master," James Arness, starred in the hit TV series "Gunsmoke" in a rival network "Wagon Train." Ward Bond plays the leader of the Mormons who are wandering west, often falling back into his sinful days by just scolding that he was called down by his colleague Mormon Adam Perkins (Russell Simpson). Elder Wiggs (Ward Bond) yells, "Stop, sister Ledeyard!" The Mormon sister, perfected by Jane Darwell, then hits so hard and loud that even the devil must be shaken by the sound. Darwell and Simpson were famous for playing Ma and Pa Joad in Ford's classic version of the John Steinbeck novel The Grapes of Wrath. <br /> <br /> Another great character actor in Ford's company was Hank Worden, who played one of Uncle Shiloh Clegg's notoriously mean but not too bright outlaw sons. Worden became famous a few years later for playing Moses in Ford's The Searchers. Worden became 91 years old. He was still making movies when he died. <br /> <br /> The wagon master Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and his partner Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) are horse dealers who never accept their job seriously, have fun along the way, especially with the local sheriff. They mingle with a Mormon wagon train to the west. Ford's beloved Monument Valley is the setting for most of the film. The main reason for the teaming is a red-haired Mormon beauty, Prudence Perkins (Kathleen O'Malley), who attracts Sandy's eye. Along the way, the train picks up a Hoochie Coochie show, which includes a charlatan doctor (Alan Mowbray) and two polluted angels (Joanne Dru and Ruth Clifford). Along the way, the Clegg family, who is wanted for murder and armed robbery, also joins. Ford shows how cumbersome a trip by car to the West was. <br /> <br /> The songs in the movie were written by Stan Jones of the legendary Sons of the Pioneers. Jones's writing was almost as good as that of Bob Nolan, who had previously written a lot for the group. Jones' most famous song, not in this film, is the widely recorded "Ghost Riders In The Sky." The sons of the pioneers sing the background in "Wagon Master". This contributes to the overall influence of wagons rolling to the west. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that highly acclaimed Indian athlete Jim Thorpe of Oklahoma plays the role of Navajo leader. This was his last movie appearance. He did not die long after "Wagon Master".
