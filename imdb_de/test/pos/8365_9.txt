I'm a fan of Zhang Yimou and found this DVD title after a long search in many places on the shelves of a Shenzhen bookstore. <br /> <br /> This is a big departure from the previous work of Zhang Yimou, especially in style and locale. The director himself has said that this is the first and only time he ever tries to make a black comedy in today's China. It can even be said that this work is experimental in nature compared to its other known budgets and fittings. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a handheld camera and a wide angle lens throughout the movie. The fast processing, the high energy efficiency and the naturalistic tone never let go, as soon as you are captured from the beginning. It is a very realistic account of the modern Chinese urban feeling, which in this case plays in Beijing. If you appreciate and love this black humor, you will absolutely love this movie. Also, look out for funny cameos by Zhao Benshan (Happy Times) and director Zhang Yimou himself. <br /> <br /> One final note: I find the characters in this movie as in all the other films by Zhang Yimou. with similar personality traits - stubbornness that always tries to overcome the odds Let me know what you are saying. <br /> <br /> David Lee
