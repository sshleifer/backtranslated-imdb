This movie was played for 7 days in Lexington KY. I saw it on the last day of its run and regretted that I could not recommend it to others, as this is a movie that screams at the big screen. The aerial shot of the overcrowded ship pulling away from the equally overcrowded dock is a masterpiece, as is the scene where the two main characters flirt on deck - almost a ballet more sexually suggestive than so many explicit movies. I only shudder at the thought that not more people will have the opportunity to see this beautiful movie in a theater; The DVD experience will not be the same. Here's an idea: If you live in a university town, you can get a picture for a film festival on campus.
