For those who like their movies full of exploding planets and extreme violence, this is definitely not happening. In fact, there is very little conspiracy (or at least very little that could not be summarized in a few seconds): A strikes B. Mister A. falls on Ms. B. and has an affair with her, A and B then fall in love and wonder (in detail) if they want to have an affair themselves. <br /> <br /> This is the Cantonese Visconti. There is no story, but what you get is a sequence of wonderful images and poignant music that conveys the slow transition of the emotions of the central characters. There is also the chance to see one of the most beautiful women in the world in a series of stunningly elegant outfits. For my money it is worth seeing for that reason alone. How could this woman ever be an action heroine? She looks like she has just left the Vogue page.
