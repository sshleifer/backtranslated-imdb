I think that this short TV series was absolutely wonderful and gave a detailed and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at that time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. Personally, I thought this was one of the best documentary films of the last decade. This is definitely worth the money of the people! <br /> <br /> I also found the bit about the abyss and the deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was unbelievable to learn that the 'Blue Planet' team has discovered more than 10 new underwater species! <br /> <br /> In this documentary, Attemborough has almost certainly lived up to its reputation. <br /> <br /> This was a masterpiece and is always considered one of the best modern documentary films. <br /> <br /> Many congratulations to the 'Blue Planet' team.
