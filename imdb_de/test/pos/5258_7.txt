I'll gladly admit that I have not seen the original movie yet, but I've read the play, so I have some background to the "original". If you forget the fact that this is a remake of an old classic, this movie is smart, funny, fresh and hilarious. Yes, the casting decisions may seem strange, but they WORK. <br /> <br /> I am a convinced feminist and I have not been offended by this movie - even if other women say so. This is NOT a movie men can see (so please, ladies, do not bring your boys with you to see it with you.) Women get the jokes, the situations and the relationships. <br /> <br /> Me was pleasantly surprised by the depth Annette Bening brought to her character ... she did an excellent job Debra Messing was adorable and Candice Bergen was awesome I was less impressed by Meg Ryan ... She brought emotions to the table but her comedic stance was less strong, the female cast is strong and definitely a weird comedy, I really enjoyed this movie and intend to see it again with my mother, and women will understand.
