Blade is a dark, dark, but significant vampire movie and one of the best. A little blood, but nothing really bad. Wesley-Snipes played a powerful role in eliminating the vampires. Not really like Buffy, because that's too tame, but Blade does a decent storyline and it's the kind of movie you'd probably see on a dark, stormy night ... that's the best case! 87%
