An intelligent, tricky drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and was soon on the front page of every American newspaper (as life mimicked the movie). An employee of a nuclear power plant in Southern California is threatened by superiors when he decides to publicize the real story behind an accident at the plant. Seemingly a jammed valve problem, a television news crew's film shows it was a devastating accident - and worse, scavenging security conditions to save millions of dollars, a concealment that jeopardizes the lives of all. The film is sometimes too technical (especially in the second half) and could use more human interaction, but the appearances of Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (as a puff-piece news woman in the right place at the right time) and Michael Douglas (as a freelance Cameraman) is outstanding. The scrapped pieces involving nuclear protesters are both absolutely accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news business (with its corporate structure and the vapid yes-men) is vividly captured. *** 1/2 of ****
