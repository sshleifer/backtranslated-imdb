I watched this series after seeing the Naked Gun movies. I thought it was much better than the movies, and I loved the movies! This series literally sticks you to the TV in anticipation of the next wordplay, sight or comic situation (all night in the wickerwork, Club Flamingo). I do not think I laughed so hard at a television series in my life, even after seeing the films first and knowing some of the jokes. I am sorry that only six episodes were produced, but I agree that it would be very difficult for the authors to maintain this level of comedy for more episodes. Overall, the series is a must for anyone who likes puns, bad jokes and slapstick jokes.
