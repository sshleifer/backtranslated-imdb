As the 1970s came to an end, there were rumors in the entertainment industry about the possible return of Sean Connery to the role he had made famous in 1962 - James Bond - Cubby Broccoli was asked on location in Brazil during the production of 'Moonraker' from Barry Norman, as he saw the prospects. Understandably, the producer was reluctant to agree. <br /> <br /> When 'Moonraker' opened, the Bond fans were outraged by what they perceived as a deterioration of the character, and the jumping on the 'Star Wars' war wagon, as well as 'Live & Let' The 'had done a few years earlier with the blaxploitation madness. Many publicly expressed their hope that Connery would come back, if only to show Eon what a real Bond movie should look like. There followed years of legal battles. The original script titled "James Bond Of The Secret Service" (later "Warhead") was written by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton and Connery. It was never filmed and remains one of the big blockbusters of unmastered movies. <br /> <br /> A new script, closer to the "Thunderball" story, has been commissioned. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, best known as the man who moved the camp into "Batman". He also wrote The Parallax View, one of the best conspiracy thrillers of the decade. The feeling that the script required a British feel brought Connery to Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, authors of the hit sitcoms The Likely Lads and Porridge. The funny title was proposed by Connery's wife Micheline. <br /> <br /> "Never Say Never Again" was opened just before Christmas in 1983 for a critical praise. usually sensible critics were so excited at Connery's return that they ignored all other aspects of the film. Many used it to brutally attack the Roger Moore series, especially this year's 'Octopussy'. In fact, 'Octopussy' is superior in every way. "Never" lacks the excitement and spectacle associated with Bond, sometimes it looks like a TV set. Movie. The story had been made earlier and improved in 1965 'Thunderball', so that 'Never' always landed in second place. It was also hampered by the fact that it was not part of the official series, meaning that Monty Norman's "James Bond Theme" and Maurice Binder's sleeve logo could not be used. <br /> <br /> As Bond, Connery is great and effortlessly returns to his most famous role. Bond as an older, wiser agent to have played. Barbara Carrera got her best movie role as a vicious "Fatima Blush", a lady whose murder love she dances like after she killed Bond (she believes). Kim Basinger glimmers as "Domino". As S.P.E.C.T.R.E. The agent 'Maximillian Largo', Klaus Maria Brandauer, shows a deterrent performance. A big disappointment is Max von Sydow as "Blofeld". The posters gave the impression that he would be a main character, in fact, he appears only in a few scenes. With a stronger script, he could have been one of the very best Bond villains. <br /> <br /> "Never" promised to be relapsing on the early Eon bonds like "From Russia With Love", but did not deliver. The devices were there, but were used almost apologetically. Bond's anti-missile motorcycle was a tired gag even in the 1960s. The film tried to compete in humor with Eons Bonds. Bond, who saves himself by throwing his own urine sample into the face of an assassin, is a scary moment as you find him in Moonraker. But Nadir comes with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as a limping officer of the Foreign Ministry 'Nigel Small-Fawcett'. He gives a performance that is so amazingly awful that you wonder if he thought he was in a footlights revue. <br /> <br /> Michel Legrand's music is terrible, the man has never seen a Bond movie in his life. <br /> <br /> Although the film was a financial success, years later it is considered the weakest bond of the 80s. Connery himself was disappointed and did not play in a movie for several years. <br /> <br /> 1983 was a good year for 007 Maniacs, in addition to the films of Connery and Moore, George Lazenby made an adorable cameo on the TV "Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E .: The Fifteen Years Later Affair".
