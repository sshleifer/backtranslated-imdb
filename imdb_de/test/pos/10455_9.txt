Maybe this movie should only be funny. Maybe it should make sure that teens are aroused in all the nudity in it. But what I found out was actually something that many people believe. And that means: "Nice guys will finish last". <br /> <br /> In Angel Heart, there is a line from Lisa Bonet's character, "It takes a bad ass to make a girl's heart beat faster." Right. Most likely. Women always say that they want the flowers and the candy and courtesy and whatever. But (at least at an early age) they go for the handsome, slimy, irreverent, untamed man. The ones they know can not live up to their beliefs. And that's part of the attraction. What is exciting about a man who is the way you want him? I think that's what happened to Boaz Davidson. And what he has to say in this movie, which is disguised with sex and nudity, parties and everything else that concerns teenagers, is that you have broken your heart. It happens to everyone and it will happen to you. And that is a strong final statement of the film. Nevertheless, the movie is fun. It's funny and shows the antics of high schoolers pretty well. <br /> <br /> This is a rare movie that is limp enough to please the youthful crowd it appeals to, but also smart and poignant enough to show its image; May your heart get broken. No high school movie has ever done that better. As I said before, I think the authors must have experienced a situation like this first-hand. Maybe we all have. <br /> <br /> This is an old movie, but if you ever think of collecting dust on a shelf in your local video store one night, pick it up, you'll be surprised. It's a lot better than Never Been Kissed.
