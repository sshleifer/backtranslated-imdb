I enjoyed Erkan & Stefan? A cool and fast story that has not bogged down in detail. These two guys are great to see and can come up with new ideas all the time. The high image and cut quality supports the film very much. <br /> <br /> Erkan & Stefan show that the German film industry is able to transfer successful Hollywood concepts with local "satire" into our cinemas.
