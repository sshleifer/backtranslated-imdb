I looked at it because I have friends in Ukraine. but the film brought me beyond what I expected, and it turned out to be a perfect mix of laughing belly situations (alex 'strange handling of English), situational comedy, and depression-bordering severity. I loved the choice. I really wanted to get into an old car and drive to the Ukraine. Alex (Hutz) plays his leading role perfectly and is a great counterpoint to Elijah Woods' serious poker. The film shows the positive side of humanity when people of different cultures can connect and do the right thing when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even if they have entered into it with preconceived ideas and prejudices, and how this can open the doorways to the depths buried memories. There is a lot in this movie.
