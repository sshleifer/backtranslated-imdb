If you've been waiting for years to watch a movie you've heard on the grapevine, your expectations are obviously high, right? But when that baby fell through my door, I knew the damn pictures would adorn my TV and confuse my fragile mind. First of all, Karim Hussein is a film fan like all of us who grow up with a diet of Argento / Fulci / Lynch, etc. ... and this is shown in this film, but in a good way. Although I did not really know what the hell was going on in my first watch of this gemstone, I was simply fascinated by the visual elements, the lighting and, of course, the performances of everyone involved that Karim really believed he would do. Push the limits of filmmaking (and trust me that he does) and that he will have a hard job that leads the actors to do the same ........ <br /> <br /> So what can I tell you about "unconscious cruelty"? Well, without ruining it ... it's a deep insight into the human psyche with images of violent and sexual insanity getting tired in insanity ..... a truly memorable experience ..... .. <br / > <br /> Keep an eye on Karim Hussein, he can only focus on better things ..... <br /> <br /> I saw the full, uncut imprint of unconscious cruelty on a double DVD of Infliction- Movies loaded with extras ..... Please note that there is a censored Hong Kong release that avoids this release.
