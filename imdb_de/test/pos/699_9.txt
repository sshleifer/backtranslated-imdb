Glenn Ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and shaky stable owner Edger Buchanan to stage a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot. With Ford as a no-show, the two instead happily go second with a deduction and Ford remains on the hook for murders he has not committed. <br /> <br /> The first color of Columbia Pictures, The Desperadoes, looks fantastic with sets and costumes that take full advantage of the Technicolor process and highlight tons of well-crafted western spectacles. <br /> <br /> This has the irresistible combination of a young Glenn Ford (third, but essentially the star) and a top notch Randolph Scott performs an incredible supporting role with great character actors in colorful roles, including scene-hogger Edger Buchanan as a good-natured, but mild rogue jokel who is not as stupid as he looks and has some notable lines br /> <br /> A rather complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences, melodrama and comedy well orchestrated by Charles Vidor. This is one of the great westerns of the 1940's and highly recommended.
