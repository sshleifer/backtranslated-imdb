The first season pretty much revealed exactly how all elements of the Marine Corps would function as a team (eg ground, air, helicopters and jets). This is the season in which I get the high score! (True, there are still many "freedoms" in the first season, but the stories were more credible.) The following seasons were a terrible attempt by Melrose Place to hit Top Gun! <br /> <br /> I was based in Miramar at the time and I remember shooting the show in the San Diego area. I talked to Rod Rowland and James Brolin. Rowland's character was good to go. <br /> <br /> Brolin's character was good only in the first season. For some reason, he was dying after the first EP of the second season. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a little bit about how the Marine Air Ground team works, then the first season is just what you are looking for.>>> If you choose Melrose Place and soap opera plots interested in trying to merge them with Top Gun, then look at the last two seasons.
