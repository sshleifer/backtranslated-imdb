Try to look for another movie that is such a journey without having a story or a plot, and you will come under pressure. HEAD is a masterpiece of nonlinear non-structure, surrealism and experimentation. In less than 90 minutes, it not only manages to be a time capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time, space, and conventions in ways that were possible only underground movies of the sixties reflection of these films , No matter how one feels to the Monkees, this is a film that every filmmaker should see, as it tears the infinite possibilities of film as a medium of art. Had it not been for the film's unorthodox publicity campaign (and the fact that the Monkees were so oversaturated by the media at the time they came out that the public had grown tired of them and every critic was ready to jump on them), If this could be a much bigger effect. Studying how the movie was edited is far more important and exciting than what's actually in the movie, and there are some great things (great songs, great cinematography, etc.). Should be seen after midnight for maximum effect, as it is overall a dreamlike feeling. 1968 was a time of social unrest and a call for change (hence the working title of the movie "Changes"), and HEAD mirrors this time perfectly.
