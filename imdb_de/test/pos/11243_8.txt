Of course, it only takes about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode, but it's definitely fun to watch. You may crawl in your chair when the buddy sticks his foot in his mouth and gets shot down or giggles and shakes his head when a ridiculous line actually works. The moderator group has more of a good-natured, friendly (I would say Canadian) commentary style compared to daring US reality programming. I think the people who complain about this show do not understand the joke. They take the show more seriously than the show itself. Keys to the VIP is a great caricature of reality shows, sports TV culture and the club scene. I hope they play another season and I would like to know if a US version will be released. It's certainly a funny, original premise.
