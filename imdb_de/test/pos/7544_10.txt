Alistair Simms is a miracle. He makes such a good headmistress. The role given here for George Cole was made for him. Therefore, the casting was perfect for this movie. I think it was one of those rare occasions when everything was clicked. The plot was good, the comic dialogue a shout and the older prefect girl a pleasure !! Every character you love, even the bad guys. Why can not we make films anymore? Basically, this is a very English comedy with good movements and flowing effect.
