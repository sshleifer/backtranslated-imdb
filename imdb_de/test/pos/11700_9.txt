Crackerjack is not for everyone, but the tongue is firmly stuck in the cheek. The likeable figure of Jack Simpson, played by Mick Molloy, cheats the local "Bowlo" to park for free and make a few bucks on the side. He sells the parking lot to work colleagues. When the members of the bowling club have to raise some money to save their club, they call Jack to join their bowling team and play competition bowls. <br /> <br /> Filled with Aussie Charm, Mick Molloy's laconic wit is revealed (he also co-wrote the script) reminding this viewer of his earlier work on the radio. Perfect Aussie casting with Bill Hunter as Jack Bowling's mentor Stan Coombes, John Clarke (by The Games fame) as a ruthless businessman and owner of rival bowl club Bernie Fowler, with Samuel Johnson as Jack's roommate Dave and Judith Lucy as jaded journalist Nancy. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that only fans of Molloy would like this movie, but judging by the number of blue rinse sets that laugh out of the cinema, this is a movie for everyone.
