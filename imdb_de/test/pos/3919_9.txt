I usually give horror movies at 6/10, but I noticed that. House of Wax was by far the best horror movie I've ever seen ... even better than the Amityville horror. The Paris Hilton was pretty good at it and I have to say it has a bright future ahead of it. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'm just saying how she dies ... <br /> <br /> She gets a huge pole right between her eyes and those close-ups and everything. Gory, how? Brian Van Holt was very good, both Bo and Vincent (Vincent had long hair). He usually plays a nasty policeman or soldier, but he did very well. <br /> <br /> Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray have also done well as Carly and Nick Jones. Nick took the limelight in the first half of the film, then Eliza stole it back and suffered great pain in the second half, as if one had cut off the finger, tore the lips apart after they had been glued together, and received a straight stroke in the face of Bo. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give this movie 8/10. Fans of horror movies MUST see that.
