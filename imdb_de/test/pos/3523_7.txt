The mountainous forest, young happy campers, a warning from a park attendant and a lurking figure. The ingredients are for a horror treat and the director / co-author Jeff Lieberman makes an appropriate contribution to it. It's a formal forest horror, but for the most part, the execution is at the top of the game and the story (which is pretty basic in the simple sense) is effectively narrated in some realism. Perhaps a little more exposure would not have gone astray, but Lieberman's skill balances the deficiencies and typical details of the material with increasing tension, moodiness, and a suffocating atmosphere created by Brad Fiedel's very ominously sustained score. Whenever this very creepy whistling was used, it drew a truly disturbing feeling that settled in the beautiful setting. Cinematographers Dean M. and Joel King are also doing a remarkable job. There is plenty of style in abundance, even if the scope is minimal and the construction is slow. Sometimes the pace can become a stop-and-go affair. It's not particularly violent, but it's still a vicious impression, even if something happens on the screen. The final chases and escalating anxiety are well done as the darkness comes to life with their heavy killers and you see the actor George Kennedy riding in a light but wonderful turn on his white horse. There is a sympathetic series of performances; Deborah Benson is a strong, nimble heroine. Gregg Henry, Chris Lemmon, Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin and Katie Powell complete a modest cast of credible deliveries. The final climax is pretty twisted, but the end is one of the types that make you think. "Is that it?" <br /> <br /> A well-oiled hillbilly, who is probably a bit too sure to stand out from the norm.
