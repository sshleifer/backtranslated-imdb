Hello To read the entire drawing at "OZ" just look at IMDb to find it. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING SPOILERS INSIDE THIS EVALUATION! shows a little bit. From the American prison system, but I have to say (according to Discovery Channels program about jail) it's not really realistic. <br /> <br /> Although I have to say, there is no fear, rape, beatings. happens allotment. Nevertheless, it is television, so for you, think that this is realistically wrong. <br /> <br /> There is a good deal of violence and some exaggerated scenes here and there (plot about action) that can get pretty boring. But remember, the series is already almost old. So the times are changing and I think I should judge this in the timeline in which it came out. <br /> <br /> As the season extended to Season 5, it was pretty good! Until one of the drawbacks wins a $ 2 million lottery ticket because he spoke to God, it felt like, "Okay, that's so far that I do not want to see this show anymore." I continued! And now I've just watched episode 3 of Season 6. That's where Grain zapped his brain and then his "mother" holds him while he drools. Then you see O Reilly crying and seeing his brother like that (RL BROTHERS). This is by far the best scene from the entire "OZ" series, that was real for me! Still do not read the wrong thing that I am trying to burn. It's a really good series! And 2010 is worth a clock! I'm giving a 7 because the storyline is getting weaker with the season. But still a golden glove.
