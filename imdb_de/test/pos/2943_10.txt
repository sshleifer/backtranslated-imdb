I do not usually like watching movies, even though they're still in the movies because of the high ticket prices, but I've seen a poster for Some Things That Stay and thought, "This young actress looks smart and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS" , So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on the opening night. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this movie without expectations. I did not really know what it was about, but the harsh emotions and honest teenage experiences that Katie Boland expressed left me pretty happy with my decision. Alberta Watson has also done a fantastic job as Tamara's morbid mother, and I must add that I was very impressed by the comedic styling of Megan Park as Tamaras girlfriend Brenda. <br /> <br /> The film was wonderfully staged by Gail Harvey and put together in the tacky 50's style to make you feel warm and happy, even if the plot was not so exhilarating. I also thought that the movie was shot well, many beautiful images of a landscape from the 50s will be remembered for weeks. <br /> <br /> This movie as a whole was strange and great. I found it unpredictable and although the story ends up being somewhat open, I was still satisfied. Whether you are looking for a fun yet powerful coming-of-age story or just thinking about life in the fifties, I guarantee you that this movie is for you. Even if you have no expectations, you will still be impressed. Give this one try!
