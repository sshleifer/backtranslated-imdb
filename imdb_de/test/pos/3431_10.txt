This thing works on all levels - it's intense as a thriller, full of Lars von Trier's homages, but also very strong in his own movie - and it has a message: Happiness comes from within, best in the wounded soldier who practically personifies is (and believe it or not, humorous) crumbling member by member throughout the movie, while apologizing to others for having imposed it. They laugh at him, but they also envy him. The central character is a well-meaning but clumsy writer who spends the entire movie helping those he's friends with after the Second World War on a train from Stockholm to Berlin. He puts the parallel stories together and really misleads people. To say that things go wrong is an understatement - and structurally the characters are perfect. It's as if each of them has an opposite - just as if you saw antimatter collide. You will not believe the sick stuff you laugh at in the end. More to say would be a spoiler - I can only say it's a shame that this movie was not released in the US, not even on DVD. Probably some idiot told them that Americans would not get it - which is crap because we not only "get" South Park but produce it. When this movie is released in the US, it should be sold as a mainstream black comedy because that's what it is. Over-the-top, sick and twisted, but fuuuuuunnnnnyyyyy!
