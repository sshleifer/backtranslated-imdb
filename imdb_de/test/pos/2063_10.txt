This is a movie that in no way reflects the real world. Nothing in this movie makes a real world sense or has a real world logic. It works completely in its own little world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hatred for this movie. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the beginning, I saw the completely unreal premise that the woman in question regained her memory as the past pursued her again. There was a moment at an early stage when I remembered that this was one of the films in which the heroine would not know until needed, despite all the logic that this would not happen. "Oh, one of those movies," I said to myself and was thrilled when the movie launched a wild, two-hour chase of logic and you actually have to be careful to follow some of the twists and turns. I like it a lot and am pleasantly surprised when I come across people who feel the same way. People either love it or hate it if they even heard about it. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies, this is a movie you should definitely try. They may not like it, but it's definitely worth finding out. <br /> <br /> And as always, leave the reality at the door.
