George Cukor is and remains one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder. Take a look at his filmography. From the sparkling comedies "The Philadelphia Story" "Adam's Rib" "Holiday" Psycho-Melodrama's "Gaslight" "A Double Life" a great Western "Bright in Pink Tights", not to mention "My Fair Lady" or "Travels with my Aunt "He was in the service of his actors and never stood in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness as I watch the Old Master's "Rich and Famous" strobes, which are still very clear. Candice Bergen gives us for the first time an insight into the wonderful comedian she wanted to do soon. Jacqueline Bisset is a review of the days of Greer Garson and Loretta Young and Hart Bochner, which annoy us and promise something spectacular that will eventually be realized in 1989 with "Apartment Zero", Meg Ryan, as Berg's daughter is already Meg Ryan. As tired as the formula may be, it remains a Cukor movie and for what I find one of Almodovar's favorite films.
