No box office success; Nobody really knows why. Maybe it just failed because of the title. It looks like you need a two-word title to attract enough of the idiots. the long kiss "Good night" will not take you anywhere. But for once, Renny Harlin did a GOOD action movie. The reason for this is, to a large extent, that the central character Samantha deserves our affection and interest early on. When she becomes Charly again, we're torn apart: we definitely want Charly to thwart the bad guys and all that; But we do not want her losing contact with Samantha to do this - though we also like Charly. Geena Davis gives both halves of the central character all their charm. Samuel L. Jackson plays second fiddle for a change. It turns out he's good at it. That was a compliment. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, far better than anything in the "Die Hard" series - if I were more cynical, I would add, "It's not surprising that things did not go well," but I do not feel right really like that; It is surprising that things did not go well.
