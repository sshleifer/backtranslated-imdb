I just saw it at a preview screening. I did not read the book, but I heard a lot of good things about it. <br /> <br /> The movie was absolutely fantastic and very moving. With a roller coaster of emotions you connect perfectly with the characters. Shaun Toub was great, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his acting for those who understand Persian / Dari was incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing that points out that Khaled Hosseini really loved the movie was unusual for book adaptation films. Even after seeing the movie several times, "he sobbed." <br /> <br /> Also, the animation from the intro was exquisite, and the names were displayed as Persian calligraphy, very unique! At times, the translation did not clearly convey the message, but all in all this was a great movie.
