I played Sam (the gatekeeper, Lous buddy) in the movie "Dead Rail", which was later broadcast as "Alien Express". And I have to say that for my part I really enjoyed watching this movie. As an arduous actor, this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes that I could take on my role, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!). Turi (the director ) And Steve and Scott (the producers) were very nice when they gave me the opportunity to participate in the production. I have found many friends (Lou, Todd, Steven) and I am very happy to work with these incredibly talented people. There was not a day when I did not laugh at my ass. The real tragedy is not so much the special effects, it is that every single person who saw this movie could not see what was going on behind the scenes and all the talent that really helped. Craftsmen who build the set, props master, gazers, wardrobe, makeup artist, script supervisor, cameraman, production assistant, extras, craftsman, producer, director and actor. It is a fact that Sci-Fi has not spent much money on the film (2 million). But there was a lot of time, energy and manpower put into the movie. I now regard the film as a production that brought together many talented people for an entertaining project that was shot in less than two months without complications. It was a great cast and crew, and I'm just happy to be separated from her! In another message to those of you who do not know Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges and Steven Brand. They are fantastic people who are incredibly funny. Lou I'm still working on my Deniro impression and can not thank you enough for introducing me to the Midnight Run. Todd, every time I hear an Elvis song, I can not forget the story you told me when you were at home with him for dinner. "Can you hand me over the parents, please?" (IN A GIANT ELVIS FAN!) Steven, "Mr. Brand!" You are a true gentleman and all the advice and encouragement I have received from you is always appreciated. I miss you and hope you are fine. Thanks for the nice memories, stories, jokes and friendship. Oh and Miss Utah says hello! Wink. <br /> <br /> Joe
