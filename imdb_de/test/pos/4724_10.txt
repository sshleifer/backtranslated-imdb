I've never seen such a powerful, true story movie. I discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a Nobel Prize winner thanks to this masterpiece of cinema. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, you can not say that you have seen everything. <br /> <br /> A great lesson for courage, humility and life. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything good since then. <br /> <br /> TE Saturday, January 9, 1999
