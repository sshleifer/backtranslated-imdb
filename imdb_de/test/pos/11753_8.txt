Holden and Jones SIZZLE in this film, but not as we now think of sizzling - it's very subtle and sub-surface - and yet tangible. Especially Jennifer Jones in this movie is SO SEXUALL HOT (much more than a cartoon like Monroe EVER ever was) because she creates a real woman - with ALL facets of the woman: she is intelligent, intuitive and graceful. She wishes and wishes. <br /> <br /> There is a scene on this famous hill, where it lies in the grass and looks to Holden. The expression in her eyes is X-Rated, but in the context of the scene and the character. in makes perfect sense. Not everything has to be said in the dialogue - just like the crude obviousness of most modern films. It's all in her eyes - sexy yet elegant. What a stunning, undervalued actress. (I recently saw MADAME BOVARY for the first time and was equally blown away.) I'll bring her every day via Bergman, Davis or the two Hepburns.
