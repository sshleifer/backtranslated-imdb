1. watched 10.10.2009 - 8 von 10 (Dir - Billy Wilder): Spectacular presentation of the famous flight of Lindbergh by James Stewart as Lindbergh and director Billy Wilder. There are not really many backgrounds in this story, but that's fine, because Wilder makes the event really remarkable because it comes straight from Lindbergh's perspective, since he used his book as the basis of the film. This early movie about flying also has to be one of the best. When Stewart talks to himself during the flight and thinks about it, you get so much insight into what Lindbergh went through on this 33-hour solo flight across the Atlantic. And he slept the whole flight without sleeping the night before - which is unbelievable !! There's a little backstory about how he bought the plane and funding, and some flashbacks about his life during the flight, but the movie is mostly about the flight. The story is also beautifully done and photographed and is a joy to see despite its age. I appreciate that they did not throw in too much downy and let the story tell themselves. Well done. This is a classic movie that should be seen by everyone.
