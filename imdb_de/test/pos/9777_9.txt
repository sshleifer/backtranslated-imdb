I've heard a few comments, especially from prisoners of war, that CHANGI is historically incorrect and disappointing. Maybe it's for those who actually had to go through this stuff and much worse. But for the rest of us, who really have no idea how Prisoners were treated by the Japanese in World War II, CHANGI is a notable introduction. But CHANGI is not a documentary from the war - if that had been the case, the aspect of historical accuracy would have been of paramount importance. It's a mini-series drama with fictional characters and fictional situations (though loosely based on actual events I've heard and read about) - and at the heart of the story is the ideal of partnership. This group of young Australian soldiers, captured by the Japanese and held in terrible conditions for years, became adversaries through comrades, and the strength of their friendships continued their lives after the war. It is also a cultural study of the differences between the Japanese of the time and the Western world with music, games and entertainment: in Part 5, when it becomes clear that Japan will lose the war after the capitulation of Germany in Europe, The Japanese prisoner camp colonel insists that his country must study the culture of its prisoners - to defeat a people, you have to defeat your culture - and you have to understand that. All in all, Australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional mini-series on television, and is an unrivaled global leader in this respect: MY BROTHER JACK, the adaptation of George Johnston's novel, is a worthy winner for the AFI Award with CHANGI. Recent mini-series include the DAY OF THE ROSES (the story of the investigation into the crash of the Glanville train), KINGS IN GRASS CASTLES (the adaptation of Mary Durack's historical account of her pioneering ancestors), KANGAROO PALACE (about a group of friends a country town in Australia traveling to London and changing and disassembling) and the (somewhat disappointing) adaptation of Bryce Courtenay's powerful novel THE POTATO FACTORY. Less Lately: Nancy Cato's Sweeping Saga of Murray Life - ALL THE RIVERS RUN; Cusack & James' brilliant novel about postwar life in Sydney - COME IN SPINNER; Colleen McCullough's Outstanding Pioneering Story - THE THORN BIRDS; THE RIVER KINGS; Ruth Park's novel "The Harp in the South"; BODY LINE; EUREKA STOCKADE; ANZACS; etc ..., etc ... (Of course there were some not so good productions - for example, MOBY DICK, DO OR DIE, BEACH, DORN BIRDS: THE FORGOTTEN YEARS, etc ...) However, if an Australian miniseries in yours Direction, make sure you see it - and this goes for CHANGI, a superbly directed masterpiece. Rating: 9/10.
