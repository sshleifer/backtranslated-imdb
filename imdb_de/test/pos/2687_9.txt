With the whole world overrun by so-called sitcoms over the past decade or more (very few actually deserve this title because they are so predictable), King of Queens is a very original, unique and surprisingly amusing alternative. It's about the everyday life of a deliveryman and his wife, who works as assistant to a lawyer in Manhattan, Queens, NY. Living with them is Carrie's father Arthur, an extroverted picture book played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller, who steals the show from everyone else every time he appears. Other important people are their best friends Deacon and Kelly, a married couple, and their other friend Spence, who is almost 30 years old and still lives with his mother. What makes this show so unique and funny is, above all, that every single character seems so real and Carrie's cynical, sarcastic attitude is the total opposite of Doug's good-natured, somewhat stupid optimism. And Arthur is the one who makes it absolutely unpredictable his strange ideas and habits. He often gets into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to pull him out of the mud. Although in my opinion the quality of the show has diminished in recent years, it is still one of the best daily sitcoms ever made. It takes some time to engage with the characters and get in touch with them, but then you get unstoppable laughter. Although I believe that I could not survive with Arthur in a closed room without beating him, I really adore him on this show. Look and have fun, I give a 9 out of 10 points.
