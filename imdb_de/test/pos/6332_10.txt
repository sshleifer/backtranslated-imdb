I saw Buffy the Vampire Slayer and really did not start loving the series before the fourth season started. This episode "Hush" was seen by me alone in the dark shortly after midnight with open windows and the wind, which flows through an aftermath angrily. The authors of this episode did a great job and encouraged me. I was in awe of the entire episode I just finished two minutes ago. Amazing does not touch the surface of what this episode creates with almost no dialogue. If you've never seen this show before, at least watch this episode. If that does not impress you, there probably will not be an episode. <br /> <br /> By the way, my heart is still racing ...
