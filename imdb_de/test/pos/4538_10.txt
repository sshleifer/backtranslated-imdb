I do not know why all critics say that this was a bad movie. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are the perfect match. Tommy is the fool who spent seven years in college and eventually passed the D +. Richard is the smart kid who was hated by everyone in the school. How can you not laugh when the two "superstars" of The Carpenters sing passionately and suddenly the bonnet appears? In all of this is a great movie, I recommend it.
