I think there was too much action in the end? Do not you think so? There was romance, an adventure that told me to finish the film at 9, but the location of the action was too long. I liked Reeve a bit. I did not understand why he had to die. I thought that one of the girls would die as well, but my luck! No one else I liked did not die! What about you? What did you like? I actually saw the movie twice. And then I bought that too. It was worth it! Who did you like best (person)? The book was really cool. And also the actors and actors. Everything was perfect ... How was the song name in the end? Does anyone answer my questions ... PLEASE, please?
