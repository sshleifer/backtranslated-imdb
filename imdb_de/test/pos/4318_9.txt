A very good episode, though the finale is not as devastating as the end of season one. The idea of ​​making a Desmond flashback worked very well, and Henry Ian Cusick was fantastic. The only complaint would be the Michael plotting line, which felt very much like a subplot, and after three minutes of the previous episode, I thought it was would contain more. But the strength of Cusick's character and performance prevailed. As always, the plot developments left more questions than answers, such as who others are, what we still do not know, and where they take Jack, Sawyer, and Kate. What was the white light, what effects did it have? Are Locke, Eko and Desmond dead? as the hatch around them destroyed. If this is the case, it would be a big mistake, since these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them. Terry O'Quinn was fantastic in both series as Locke. A fitting finale for a better series than the first.
