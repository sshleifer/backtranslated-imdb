People have often felt uncomfortable with The Merchant of Venice because of its anti-Semitic theme. Fortunately, this film avoids this by showing instead how antisemitism has dominated 16th century Europe. The story, of course, is that Antonio needs money to help Bassanio to ask for the marriage of Portia (Lynn Collins). He receives the money from the Jewish usurer Shylock (Al Pacino), who demands a pound from Antonio Fleisch if he does not repay the loan. If Antonio can not repay the loan, Shylock is determined to get what he owes. It's another testament to a great actor Al Pacino.
