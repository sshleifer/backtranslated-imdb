I remember being so excited on Saturday night when I was a kid Who waited. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then I grew up, Dr. Who's gone out of the air and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I found out that there would be a new series. I was a little nervous. Would it match the expectations I had with a kid when I was a kid? Would you screw it up? Would the Dr. suck? Would his assistant suck? Would you have a closer relationship with Dr. Ing. and build his assistant? YES NO NO NO NO NO !!! This show is wonderful !! I love the new Dr. I love his assistant. I love the show. And I'm looking forward to the "new" episode on Fridays. I see 2005 episodes of how I live in the States, so I'm a bit behind the rest of you. I hope the next dr. is as good as this one!
