This is a good family movie with a few laughs. I wish it did not have as much schooling material as the Bully in it to fill the movie. It also seems a bit too easy to save a piece of land from building. I mean, it just flowed too easily. It makes you aware of the wildlife. It was a nice way to introduce the piece of land, but the fast runner was a bit slow for me. A bit too hokey for me and it reminded me to go back to school. Oh, the DVD is full of goodies, so do not miss it. 7 out of 10 for the movie 10 out of 10 for the DVD with the extras that should be seen. It's worth it to see this!
