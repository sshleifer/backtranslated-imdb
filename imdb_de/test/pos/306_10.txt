Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) was sent to Cambodia on a classified mission during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) for having gone completely crazy and stopped taking orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for Captain Willard to understand how Colonel Kurtz could go as far as possible out of the deep end without killing and taking the war into his own hands. What might have exaggerated this great man? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his destination, he tries to understand why, with some success. But what will he do if he finds him? <br /> <br /> Any movie that can start with The Door's "The End" is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and pictures that are shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does that perfectly. I can not imagine anything better than the Vietnam War and the madness in the minds of the soldiers it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through one of the hairiest jungles in Vietnam, whose ultimate goal is murder. Just by using music and score, we will enter a dark world full of secrets, violence and madness. A perfect example of the mood through music alone, this film is here. <br /> <br /> A great cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, from whom Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread in our movie wishbread. I just do not like Fishburne since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse. My contempt and hatred of this man have increased tenfold. I recognize the pettiness of it, but I just do not care. We have to make Gary Oldman sick because of him. Brando is excellent as Colonel Kurtz and I can not imagine another actor who could have made the good man go crazy and have such a screen presence. Sheen is also fun as Willard, and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie must be Robert Duvall's Colonel Kilgore. Before this movie, I never introduced Duvall as a war cowboy, but frankly, he's still my favorite of his role. He just nailed his character, who is one of the best in the entire movie, as the gung-ho Air Cavalry Commander, who likes to surf. Maybe a little over the top, but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple and it does not take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is simply to kill Kurtz. But it is the journey of the film, which really is his heart and also the bad situations of the war itself. In the Redux version, we are forced to sit through the expanded French plantation scene and the Playboy Bunny scene, which really does not contribute to the entirety of the movie except it makes a longer trip. I do not think they take anything, it's just a matter of whether you want to watch a three and a half hour film or the original. Through this journey, the film shows Americans the utter futility and irrelevance of the war and the massive impact it has had on the soldiers who fought in it. That's the whole point. In addition, the troops were not supported by the public, and that would have been a great help in making a character like Kurtz go completely crazy. <br /> <br /> A great war movie lover, this one is represented with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all classics. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre, but in my reviews it has gotten me into trouble in the past because I had to resort to what I said. All three have their own strengths and give the Vietnam War its own turn. To really say one is better than the other is pretty pointless ... Even though I last saw AN, I think it's a little bit better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in both versions and deserves the status it has. As another reviewer has said, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.
