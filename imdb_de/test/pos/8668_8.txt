At first glance, The Bothersome Man seems like several other movies / books in one. Kafka's The Trial, Melville's Bartleby, The fall and rise of Reginald Perrin and Groundhog Day immediately struck me. A man, Andreas, arrives in a nameless town where he immediately gets a job in an office and finds a nice new girlfriend. However, there is a catch: his colleagues are all friendly, boring and completely characterless, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation - interior design. Welcome to the hell of modern consumption, where people throw themselves out of buildings and nobody raises an eyebrow or spends their days reading furniture catalogs and eating something that tastes worthless and spends the rest of the movie on it in various ways escape. Suicide turns out not to be an option, and when he finds a new girlfriend she is just as callous as the old one. There is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to live with him and all she can say is "I do not mind". <br /> <br /> In fact, much of what The Bothersome Man has said has been said before, and after about 45 minutes, you begin to feel that you are actually experiencing some sense of Deja Vu. His point, however, is one that should probably be repeated over and over: an unchecked life is a life that is not worth living. Moreover, it offers a decidedly modern interpretation of the everlasting theme of how capitalism destroys our souls. More than one figure reminded me of people I knew, especially his furniture-obsessed girlfriend. If the filmmakers run out of ideas at the end of the film, that may be the point - there will be no end if you can not. Find other people who share your sense of alienation.
