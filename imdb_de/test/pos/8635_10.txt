I loved this movie since I was a little kid. I remember the night when my mother brought this movie home for me. I loved it and still do it. I find it very funny and original. There are also some very catchy tunes in this movie. Lou is also a surprisingly good singer. The actors portraying Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are okay too, but Abbott and Costello are the best. The former heavyweight boxing Buddy Baer, ​​also the brother of former heavyweight champion Max Baer, ​​is good in this movie as a cop and The giant. He is a better actor than a boxer. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this film is funny, as Lou Costello crashes the car and how he gets into trouble with Buddy Baer. The slapstick in the house is good too. I especially like the comedy in the giant castle. My favorite parts are: The role in which Lou climbs the beanstalk, all singing goodbye. Jack sings back to them that he will return. Lou Costello can sing very well. My other favorite part is the part when Jack fights with the giant. I like it when Jack explodes eggs and when he tries to make the giants an omelette, they explode all the time. Abbott and Costello are funny and the greatest comedians of all time. This is just one of her great movies that I will love and appreciate. The reviews for this movie are not very good and I can not understand why. This is a very good movie by Abbott and Costello. I also love how Lou Costello returns to reality in the end and thinks he's back in the dream when Bud beats him. He sings his song and walks with a shot as if no one pushed me around. Very good movie.
