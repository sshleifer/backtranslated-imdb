"They were on their way up and stumbled a skirt!" Gilligan says to Jim Leonard. This sums up the story of up-and-coming Leonard (a young Humphrey Bogart) when his dream is distracted by Dorothy Mackaill-born Bombshell heiress Carol. Leonard has been working on a new and improved engine, but now his love life and his car company have both ups and downs in this 68-minute shortie. Bogart had not yet developed the quiet, brooding style. Good performances of most secondary characters - their butler, his colleagues, a sister and intruders. Some adult topics, since it was done before they really got the movie code, but it's still tame compared to what's shown on TV today. Directed by Thornton Freeland, a year before Freeland staged the incredible "Flying Down to Rio".
