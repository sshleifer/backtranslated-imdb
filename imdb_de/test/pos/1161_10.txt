I really like the wind and the lion. It was a good movie. I thought, since I was young and it's been so long, I do not like it so much, but after seeing it, I was amazed at how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed it liked it. I liked it because it showed how Arabs and people in Morroco were treated in the early 20th century by the Germans, the French and even the Americans. If I was a high school history teacher, I would definitely show it to my student from a high school perspective. I give this movie 10 out of 10 points. My grandparents liked him so much that they bought him for themselves. My little 3-year-old cousins ​​even sit down and watch it. <br /> <br /> Systemoffell
