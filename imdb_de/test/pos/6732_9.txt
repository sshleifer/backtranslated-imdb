This film is one of those that can not be seen by its externality. At first glance, it seems that the story focuses on the desire for more money. But ... look at the other side ... What do you see? You see that money is just a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings that humans have: should I do the right thing, or should not I? And ... what is the "right one"? Le's carries out a deeper analysis ... - What does a small town on the border mean? - That means sometimes we can go too close to the limit to do something that we thought we could not ... - What does the dry soil in this picture mean? - It means the dryness that is sometimes seized by our troubled hearts ... - What does the expression of the character (KRISTEN) mean: "Now I belong to him"? - It means the loss of our free will due to unforeseen acts. In MY OPINION, this is the author of the story, and the director has tried to "tell" us. By the way ... do you remember what another character (JACK BARNES) said, "Nothing is so easy ..."
