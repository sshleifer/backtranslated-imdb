I had heard of John Garfield but did not know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I picked it up by accident. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life too, so he knew his part. He was a refugee throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He was charged. He is friends with a family that has questions and is not sure what to make of him. All possible smaller conspiracies follow. My favorite was the spooky swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and a Dead End Kid could not swim, and none of them could come out. John's character saves the day. The Dead End Kids were great as friends and followers. One of them to the end. Ann Sheridan played the daughter of the family and John's last love interest. It was believable, but in my opinion not endearing - the only weak link in the film.
