One of the best silent drama I have ever seen. The German Expressionists were as dark and shady as they were, but their performances were quite restrained and naturalistic for the day. No camera raids or inadvertent laughter from wild, arm-twisted histrionics. Sjostrom convinced as drunk, mean and scary David Holm. <br /> <br /> The film, mostly in the night in a weak Swedish slum, had a very claustrophobic feel, supported by the inconspicuous lighting and the widespread use of irises. <br /> <br /> There was a deep and typically Scandinavian sense of despair and hopelessness of the narrative: the movie begins in a rather gloomy present, and then we're told David Holm's story in a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks in flashbacks - a rather complex structural structure for 1921) in which his character is offered many opportunities for salvation, but he does not claim it, and we know he will not. Take 'em, because we've seen him drunk and miserable and mean as always has died in the present. The penultimate scene is as dark as I've seen in the whole movie theater. <br /> <br /> Writing and governing are tight and intelligent, even by today's standards. In several cases, Sjostrom cleverly puts the audience in the middle of something and then causes a surprise. The end may come as no surprise to some viewers, but I did not see it coming. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a full restoration and DVD release. Or even a shitty budget release. It just has to be out there for people to see and appreciate. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10, which rounds to 10/10
