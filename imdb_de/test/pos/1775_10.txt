I like the movie, it's the best pirate movie I've seen so far (forget the stupid Errol-Flynn stuff and the Pirates of the Caribbean). This movie is wonderfully melancholic. I compare it to "Johnny Guitar" on the seafront (but 3 years ago), two women fighting for a man where crazy love could lead one. <br /> <br /> Anne Providence, a heroine, is great and behaves like a child without compromise. She is alone in search of her own female identity in the world of a real man. She's a rather strange movie hero, not a funny pirate, because most of her companions in the genre are not joking all the time, fighting for the poor and good, killing only the stupid Spanish or British soldiers, or rather, governors, but they Murder all poor prisoners of war after conquering a ship (look closely at this at the beginning of the film), she is primitive (she can not even read), she is desperate and she gets alcoholic, she loses all friends as a consequence of her Tenacity and carries the bulk of the film rags. This movie shows a pirate "hero" a bit (!), Because he (or in this case "she", but there was a female "Anne" buccaneer, Anne Boney) could have been in brutal reality. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty short and the story is told breathtakingly. A movie from the 1950s certainly has no exciting special effects for today's viewers (the ships are obviously swimming in a bathtub), but this real drama about love (killing), trust, betrayal, revenge, hate and sacrifice drives you crazy , Perhaps Anne should even be Judas Iscarioth and Jesus of Nazareth in one person and betrayed by her friend (the French LaRochelle) as Jesus; after being disappointed by his friend and sentenced to death (as Judas); as repenting for it (like Judas, who commits suicide according to the gospel of Matthew); and in the end to sacrifice oneself for the salvation of the beloved enemy (as Jesus). But even if you are not interested in these philosophical issues of guilt and reconciliation, the movie brings a lot of (cheaper) action, like sword fighting and burning (plastic) ships, for a very short time of an hour and a half.
