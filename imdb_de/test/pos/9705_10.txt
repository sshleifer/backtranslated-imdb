Johnny Knoxville and the guys from Jackass go for "Jackass Number Two". At a press screening, the laughter was so loud and rough that it was hard to hear the entire dialogue. The stunts are exaggerated and the pranks are funnier and more monstrous than ever. <br /> <br /> All the guys use their limbs to make a great movie, and they've succeeded. If you like this genre, you will love this movie. If not, do not bother. <br /> <br /> Some of the funniest things are the pranks the boys play on themselves and they have no regard for what happens to them. They will do anything to create a stunt. <br /> <br /> Many critics have selected Johnny Knoxville for a less active role in the first film, but do not worry, he is in front and in the middle of number two and they have enough material in the can to go halfway to get through a Number Threee. <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of this kind of humor. <br /> <br /> Chris Sansone, Editor-in-Chief at Fort Bend Herald
