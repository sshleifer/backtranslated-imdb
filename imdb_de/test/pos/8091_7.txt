Great comedy by Charlie Chaplin. I've seen Chaplin's 4 big movies (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator), and I think it's by far the funniest of the four. This movie made me laugh more than almost anyone else I've ever seen. Even at the first disclaimer ("Any resemblance between the Great Dictator and the barber shop owner is purely coincidental"), the film is a short minute with a mixture of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor. At the same time, Chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution. Maybe a little bit short about the end and the permanent topicality of the topic, but easily a 9 out of 10 points for me.
