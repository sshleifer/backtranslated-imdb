The unconditional love is surprisingly entertaining. While the plot may go in too many directions, resulting in an overlong movie, it always fails to enchant and enchant. The various hand movements, one of which is warmly reminiscent of SHIRLEY VALENTINE, provide plenty of smile, laughter, wisdom and tenderness. It should not all work, and sometimes it will certainly come up, but forgive its disagreements, sit back and have a good time. It is a charmer!
