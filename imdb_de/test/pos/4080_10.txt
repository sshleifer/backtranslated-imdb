If you want to know more about these kinds of things that are found in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called Outlaw Seas or The Outlaw Sea. Story by Story describes how these things happen. The lawlessness of the high seas is reality for several reasons. For one thing, many of the freighters in the world are questionable (nationality) and it is difficult if not impossible to enforce international laws if the shipowners have no office in a real country. Two, many shipping lines employ crews from impoverished Third World countries. The crews are often threatened (such as illegal immigrants) and forced to comply with questionable or illegal practices. Third, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members. The crew is rewarded for their compliance and silence. After an unlawful act, the ships can hide in sight with something more than a fresh coat of paint. In any case, it is a fascinating read. <br /> <br /> Terrifying story, excellent movie. Has anyone else noticed how HBO seems to make the best and most important films? Hollywood is struggling to release enough Oscar-worthy films every year, so some of the top 5 rivals usually come from the UK. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema. <br /> <br /> I loved the thoroughly evil performance of Sean Pertwee. As always, I also loved Omar Epps.
