"The Honkers" is probably the best performance of Slim Pickens ever. When we were shooting, everyone associated with production thought that Slim was Oscar material. Unfortunately, United Artists released a James Bond picture at the same time and did not pay much attention to The Honkers. Personally, I think this movie has been underrated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's "Junior Bonner" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, a few months before our release, Cliff Robertson had released a rodeo movie that may have hurt us as well. It pays to be shot by James Crabbe just for the rodeo footage - some of the best ever made. The director and my co-author Steve Ianat died a few weeks after the release of the picture, broke off his promising career and left behind his beautiful wife Sally, his daughter Gaby and his newborn son Stefan. Please give this movie a chance. I bet you'll say it was worth it. I thank all those who have taken the time to read this. Stephen Lodge
