Lackawanna Blues is a very moving movie that depicts an era of shifting emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a small boy. The film clearly supports "it takes a village to raise a child" and recalls an important time in black history and culture. I have incredible respect for Macy Gray as an actress. Her character was a bit crazy and yet adorable. Of course, we all know someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as a nanny. I never realized that Epatha is such a great actress. Law & Order never showed the depth of the acting skills of Epatha like Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! The music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood ... it was a sweet nostalgic walk through memory. I really enjoyed the movie and I'm looking forward to the DVD release I'd like to add to my collection.
