The truth and reconciliation process in South Africa is an important and probably unique human experiment. This film shows the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I think everyone should watch this movie because, in my opinion, few people outside of South Africa understand their past and know what is being tried in the process of truth and reconciliation. Almost every country has a part of its own history that is still a source of enduring hatred and bitterness. We have to understand all ways to deal with the past. What happens in South Africa should guide us all. I found it believable, moving and sometimes disturbing. There were no outstanding acting performances, but this increased the strength of the narrative. Once again, the BBC was instrumental in working on a complex theme and producing a first-rate film.
