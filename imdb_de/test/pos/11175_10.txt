First, I played the second Monkey Island game, and I liked it despite the poor quality of graphics and sound. A few months later, I found out that a new game was being made. I tried it and I really liked it. The first thing you notice is the great graphics. The areas are huge, colorful and detailed and there is much to discover. The game requires you, as always, to work a lot with your brain. The game is challenging, all point-and-click games are frustrating. The jokes have not grown a third time. The animated cut scenes are also a great addition to the game. This is the best MI game on the market, maybe the best P & C game! If you like cartoony games that play like a movie, get this game!
