For a few days, I'm really excited about the "Female Scorpion" series and keep bumping into my head because I've been waiting so far? what is too long ?? before buying the entire box set. "Beast Stable" is the third brilliant performance in a row, and the unquestionable mainstay of this series is how the writers always found something completely new and new for each episode. Never before or after has there been a series of exploitation that offered so much variety in story lines, settings, themes and film styles. The original movie was more or less qualified as a so-called "Women in Prison" movie (but already atypical), but you can not categorize parts 2 and 3 as such because they hardly show material in the prison walls. And the overall sound and atmosphere change with each new episode. The first film was hard and hard, while the second was psychedelic and part three almost melodramatic. Do not get discouraged by the last description, because "Beast Stable" still offers more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing material despite the dramatic ambience. The opening sequence, for example, is downright fantastic. Sasori, still fleeing from the law, literally escapes to freedom in the subway, when there is no alternative but to cut off the arm of the stubborn policeman who has handcuffed her. Her run through the city with her arm cut off at her while the credits appear on the screen, accompanied by the well-known theme song, is a pure and real gold for exploitation! The story continues captivatingly with our heroine, who has desperately tried to lead an anonymous life in the big city, but the poor thing can not easily escape her past or even new torments. Sasori makes friends with a prostitute, but without changing the dialogue, and takes over a job in a sewing studio. Her own backward brother (!) Impregnates the prostitute while Sasori gets into trouble with the local pimping and underground crime network. She deftly prevents a thug from exploiting her body, stabs a former enemy out of jail, and furiously avenges one of the prostitutes when she is subjected to a barbaric abortion. Meanwhile, the one-armed police officer is obsessively wandering the streets, seeking revenge against Sasori. Our multi-talented director Shunya Ito impressively crosses all of these storylines into a powerful, healthy body, never losing sight of visual aspects or ingenious film style. "Beast Stable" offers some of the most amazing compositions and sophisticated camera angles imaginable, the cut is impeccable and the outward positions seem depressing. Those who know Sasori's character a bit know that the film is seriously lacking in memorable dialogues. However, this is compensated again and again with Meiko Kaji's wonderful charisma on screen and menacing grimaces. Apart from the incestuous sub-plot mentioned, there is very little annoyance, but the brief moments of extreme violence are terrific and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words. In fact, I think the third installment is the biggest (or at least my favorite) of the series so far. My only small and completely irrelevant point of criticism concerns the ridiculous sounds that a bird makes when Sasori is locked in a cage. This bird sounds like a ventriloquist doll with stomach cramps.
