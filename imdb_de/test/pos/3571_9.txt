"Bluff" has been in the cinemas in Bogota for several months, and today I finally got around to it. I was not sure what to expect, but was very surprised. It is a crime comedy of the same kind as Snatch, etc., and it succeeds in balancing the elements of tension with the comedy. The style of the film is established early on with cheerful music and the Argentine narrator, who plays the first time in front of the camera - odd, but of course fitting. <br /> <br /> With my imperfect Spanish I still found the plot and dialogue light enough to follow, and many of the comedies are situational. My Colombian girlfriend laughed a lot at the various depictions of people from different regions and social classes that I passed by a bit, but for example, a well-played depiction of a pompous idiot in a power position is funny in any language. <br /> I think it's a credit to this movie that it has something of a global flair: I was not often reminded that Colombia I was watching. However, it is important to note that many wealthy Bogotanos live like some of the characters in this film, and it is in no way a misrepresentation of Bogota or Colombian society, but only a * selective * representation - as every movie supposedly a "real" one "Representing situation / culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know how much of the comedy would get lost in subtitles, but when it comes to your country, have a look: it's a very smooth and enjoyable movie with great elements of that black humor. And all in a packed 90 minutes.
