This movie is a bit slow at the beginning, about the first 10 minutes. But once it starts, it can not be turned off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best roles and are great at acting. You would never guess who the killer is. I've given this movie a 9, because Adam Beach needs to talk a bit in some places so you can hear what he's saying. <br /> <br /> 9/10
