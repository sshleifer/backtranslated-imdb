I was not surprised to read a comment from the director saying that she made this movie as an antidote to all the "making of" DVD filettes, as I definitely liked that. I admit that I have a fondness for "Meta", but I find that this film is very accessible and entertaining, and not even hard-working, self-assured wisdom, which is certainly what you expect in a movie about filmmaking , It's very "French" because there are many fancy but sometimes compelling theories about how filmmaking (and even sexuality) "works", but since the director does not play himself (using an avatar instead), we have many options (as I'm pretty sure she's constantly contradicting herself). Apparently, Catherine Breillat specializes in hard-to-see films, but I would definitely say that this film does not qualify. I really enjoyed the dialogue, the balance between film and nature, the relationship between the director character and her assistant and actor. Highly recommended.
