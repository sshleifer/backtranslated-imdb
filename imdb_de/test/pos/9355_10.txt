Crossfire is a fantastic movie Noir, a product of its time and a timeless classic. This film achieves this by addressing issues that have not yet been brought to the screen before the 1947 release, and being a high-quality film that still has a good script, a great look, and fantastic performances by its actors keep up. Crossfire, the first American film dedicated to the topic of anti-Semitism, is cemented in the classical prestige. After the Second World War in America, after the murder of a Jewish man a flash of stuff takes place. <br /> <br /> The story is great, her anti-hate theme is wrapped in a dark thriller with several characters. In addition to anti-Semitism, there are also some great dialogues and themes after the Second World War. Unlike other mystery thrillers, the audience is alerted almost immediately to who the culprit is. The story of the film is still captivating, however, as all the great characters involved are struggling as they try to understand the situation. Aside from the great overall story and topics, the entire script is simply smart and contains meaningful messages and sharp exchanges between characters. <br /> <br /> The captivating story of the movie is wonderfully played out by the outstanding cast. Robert Young is fantastic as Captain Finlay, the leading investigator of the murder case. Finlay is my favorite character of the movie, he's just a cool character - dry as a bone and as hard as a two-of-four man. He will stop at nothing to bring the killer to justice. Robert Mitchum is also great in the movie, very lively in his soft spoken Army sergeant figure due to his excellent screen presence. Gloria Grahame gives a memorable performance in her small Oscar-nominated role. George Cooper also does a good job as the sick and desperate Corporal Mitchell; Paul Kelly shows an eerie representation of a bizarre character. and Steve Brodie, Sam Levene, Jacqueline White and William Phipps also provide strong supportive services. Robert Ryan is the most talked about actor in the film, a daunting performer as Montgomery, and also nominated for an Academy Award. Crossfire has a great look. Director Edward Dmytryk does extraordinary work on the film's execution and cinematographer J. Roy Hunt does a masterful job with his black and white image. The image of Crossfire is as dark and damp as its motifs, with an almost glossy overtone, but sometimes also very raw. Ironically, the movie's great look was not the result of hard work - or even intention. Dmytryk wanted to spend more time and money on the actors than on the lighting - he did. Less light, less preparation (around 6 hours of work) and a fantastic movie. Crossfire is not only a well-made piece of film art, but also an excellent example of a cheap movie that becomes a rich classic.
