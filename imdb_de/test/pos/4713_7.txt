A powerful film that gained much of its importance in this second half of 2007, following the new desperate movements of the Burmese people against their tyrants. I felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there, something like pity and admiration, along with a little bit of anger, because I feel that nobody, neither the countries of the world nor themselves, is doing any real thing Shame. I think that these feelings came straight out of the film and that they were intended when it was made, so it's a successful movie. The desire for peace, the pursuit of enlightenment, the respect for life sometimes leads to submission. In fact, it is Burmese Buddhist culture that has opened the doors for its dictators. But how can you be angry with these poor people?
