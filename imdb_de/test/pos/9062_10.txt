Quirky, vulnerable, raw, honest and enjoyable to look at. I am not here to give a summary or summary of the movie. I just want to congratulate this little movie with the GREAT BIG HEART. I give the filmmaker my hat and it's a great cast. If you want to know what's going on in the movie ... look at it. Michael Parness, writer / director, has treated a very sensitive and emotional topic, Suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a great career for Mr. Parness. This movie works. From the outrageous opening sequence to the tender, honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with any movie, we have to expose unbelief, but with MAX AND GRACE, I've found that I could be easily transported and completely convinced with its "surreal moments". I just wish they had pushed some of those moments even further. Mr. Parness has "pulled" some wonderful performances from this already talented cast. For example, Guillermo Díaz's performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical and moving. The colossus Ralf Möller, former Mr. Olympiad, as a frightened patient ... perfect. I can go on and on ... This independent feature has the star power of a big-budget Hollywood movie. However, you forget the STARS on the screen as you flow with this wonderfully written story. The real star is the brilliant script. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Writer / Director Michael Parness.
