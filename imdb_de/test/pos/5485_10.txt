I'm a big fan of big, loud, trashy, totally stupid action movies like The Rock, Con Air, etc. They're all very funny, but if you think about it, they're extremely stupid. IN THE LINE OF FIRE tells a story and tells it well. Plausibility, excitement, and excitement have also raised some important moral issues that are thought-provoking. The final shot of the film is Eastwood and Russo, who sit together on the steps of the White House watching the pigeons play soft, peaceful music, and I feel a deep sense of contentment. That was because I took care of the characters and I was happy for them that their story had come to a happy ending. It felt like a true story. Clint Eastwood is fantastic as the aging intelligence agent failed on that fateful day in Dallas to protect JFK. He communicates brilliantly his paranoia and his personal need to stop his opponent. On the other side of the spectrum, John Malkovich is a scary predator who tortures Eastwood for what happened in 1963, openly telling him about his plan to kill the current president. This Oscar-nominated performance really gets under your skin. Throughout the film, Malkovich talks to Eastwood as if they were friends. He does not threaten him, he does not lie to him, he does not laugh at him, but he torments him with his unbearable kindness until the last moment. In addition to this exciting action, there is an enchanting love story involving Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood. Despite the age difference, they have excellent chemistry on screen and the director does not let this dominate too much, but keeps it as part of the scenery that works well. In conclusion, I love this movie because it has a mind.
