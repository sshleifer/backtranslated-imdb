I really enjoyed seeing Hell to Pay. I've always been a fan of Westerns and it reminded me of many Westerns from the 1960s (though I was too young to see them in the first run). The only thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music. It was sometimes distracting. One thing I noticed, and I wonder how many other Gunsmoke fans noticed, was the name of Buck Taylor's character. It was a game named Doc Adams from Gunsmoke. Buck Taylor used Adam Galen instead of Gaylan Adams. I wonder if that was his choice or Chris McIntyre's? Anyway, I would recommend this movie to fans of Westerns. Do not expect anything too "deep". Just old conversation.
