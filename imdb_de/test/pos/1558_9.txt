Fantastic movie! Wow - that's really a treat. I can not believe that I discovered such a gem. <br /> <br /> A pretty young girl traveling south to Florida meets a friendly elderly couple with a camper after having a flat in a rest area. However, she learns that things are not what they seem, and the couple gets a bit scary after spending time with them. <br /> <br /> Everyone in her was just perfect for her role. I think you see how it happens in real life. <br /> <br /> The newcomer Emily Grace has done a fantastic job as the really sweet but a bit shy Alice. Emily makes you feel that you can understand what she's experiencing, and you can see how she got into the situation that develops in the film. I'm sure we'll see Emily in more movies in the future. <br /> <br /> Unlike other reports, lighting and photography in this area were just perfect. The editing has also been done well - just the right way to put together images of the highway, to make you feel that you are traveling with the cast. <br /> <br /> I did not see it on the big screen, but I can only urge everyone to go out and see it. Other films like this are * exactly * what we need. <br /> <br /> SF
