Rosie Perez is the lead in this very engaging affair cast as Mercedes, a young Brooklyn girl who has decided to become a movie actress, although she is not favored by her circumstances. She lives in East Los Angeles and struggles with a series of unsuccessful auditioning kind of part at all. Mercedes has teamed up with married and washed-out actor Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), who appeared in a television series in the Western West in the 1970s and has seldom accepted him as a lover, partly out of loneliness. and also from the hope that movie parts will come to them because of his "contacts", but these latter are of little importance, as Harry is simply maddened in his attempts to regain what he experiences as a filmic reputation. To support herself financially enough, Mercedes works as a taxi dancer in a skid row dance hall / bar in downtown Los Angeles as she continues her efforts to succeed in the film business, during the Dance Palace A Young Immigrant from Mexico Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo) falls in love with her, and most of the narrative describes his efforts to please the subject of his affection, even if they could mean losing her altogether. This largely traditionally rooted melodrama, despite the presence of a large number of well-known players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn, and Stanley Tucci, has a modest budget and has been kept in the can for about a year before it became quite unattractive. Sales and Marketing Efforts It's a shame in this name, as the sound production characteristics of Alexandre Rockwell's festively controlled direction, a consistent virtue of his work, are firmly completed. In this film, frames are already shown in his opening scene, which form a framework montage behind the credits with Perez in the fifth and main street of Skid Row. Rockwell has often shown that he is indeed working very closely with his performers. This also applies in this case, as it allows its actors to create their roles, while the ad libbing is well spotted by the editing process, which leads to an artistic success for the director despite negative comments by some mainstream evaluators. The film music of the film is aesthetically just right, and Tito Larriva, who also plays as a band boss for the taxi dancers, contributed much to it. The spectacle award must go to the increasingly important Perez, although only a below-average performance is delivered. A fair examination of the quality of a movie is given if a viewer sees it twice within a short time. To sit through this undervalued work will be a great pleasure for many.
