Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great TV movie for all ages. The film focuses on "Fizzy" (Alyssa Milano), who wants to travel in Alaska for gold. The only person she hires is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next is an adventure she will never forget. This TV movie was just great. Acting is No. 1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I have also received information about the Goldrush. I recommend this TV movie without hesitation. It is also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
