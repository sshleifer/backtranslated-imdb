John Carpenter's "The Thing" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. Unfortunately, as with most Carpenter films, it is also one of the most underrated films published by critics shortly after their release for an almost pathetic cause. It seems that people were overwhelmed by the idea of ​​the "good" alien at the time. An idea arose after the success of "I.T.". And even the idea that a movie dealing with extraterrestrials could deviate from this idea was considered heresy. Human ignorance is really a scary thing, people have to judge films for what they are not, for what they want. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" itself is an interesting study of human paranoia as a member of The US Antarctic Base discovers the presence of a strange being (which is referred to throughout the film only as a "thing"), that can imitate every form of life. Since we do not know who the creature may or may not be, we see how each character responds to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic, just a slow and gradual descent into chaos, as more and more people turn up to be ... not quite human. <br /> <br /> Carpenter manages to turn this movie into something much more than your average sci-fi / horror. There is no "What is behind you?" jumping moments here. Rather than relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre-apocalyptic desperation, as well as some balanced moments of visual terror that are not to be underestimated thanks to Rob Bottin's impressive creature effects, he gives us an experience that is unlike many other horror films. <br /> <br /> Instead of just throwing facts and action on our faces, Carpenter offers us a much slower and more filigree approach. By suggesting a sense of mystery, it gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret what has happened in certain scenes, while giving enough action to those who are not so familiar with films. Ennio Morricone's score works the whole way. The minimalistic and depressing sound fits perfectly to the overall sound of the film. Although I've always wondered what it would have sound like if Carpenter (he's known to compose all the OSTs of his films except this one) did it? Not so deeply developed characters are thanks to the good performances of the actors, especially Kurt Russel, the "down-out" apathetic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady. It's remarkable how his character changes through the movie. From his disrespectful attitude "Do not give ..." in the beginning, to a unifier and leader of the group of men trying to fight "the cause". But even though that is said, there are no false exploits, there are no moments of "laughter in the face of death" and there is certainly no kind of comic relief, the film retains its atmosphere from the first to the last scene. Speaking of which, Carpenter once again sticks to his tradition of creating a powerful ending. A quarter century after its release "The Thing" does not feel dated. And with the disquieting use of computer-generated effects, it feels even stronger than before because it shows the life and commitment of the human, not the computer. Combined with its openness to analysis, the viewer has many more reasons to consider it a second, third, or fourth, or ... time. A masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.
