To describe Stalingrad as a war movie may be a bit inaccurate. Sure, it's centering on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history, in the largest arena of the most expensive war in terms of life, money, and material ever. Yes, it contains action scenes that show bitter battles and terrible destruction. However, the modest storytelling and harsh images make it more than a war movie, even more than an anti-war movie. Stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and indisputable hell. <br /> <br /> The film is full of visual depictions of the worst kind of war, one that is very personal and close, where days are spent conquering a city block just to bring it back into a surprise attack. The early form of modern city war, which the Germans called the Rat Warfare, is brutal and uncompromising. The characters fight in tunnel tunnels, train stations and building to building in the hellish bombshell of the ruined Stalingrad, only to be defeated by the relentless Russian winter. The film deals with the topic of Nazism and the denigration of the Germans at this time, like many other films from Germany and the rest of the world. His characters are a group of soldiers who are carried away by the wind of war and simply try to survive with themselves and as many comrades as possible. The characters do not fight the Soviets against an ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet Communism, not because of a great dream of Greater Germany or racial superiority. They only fight because the enemy will not kill them, and if the enemy does not, their own officers will certainly do so because they reject the fight. This depiction adds another layer to the suffocating shell of trapped hopelessness that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> Stalingrad, a kind of ground-based companion of The Boat, framed the epic battle of World War II in a personal light the unexpected perspective of the ordinary German soldier as a kind of hero, tragically made by circumstances and a brutal government, which would pervert his victim.
