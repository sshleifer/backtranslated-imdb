Excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that really had teeth without feeling hopeless or worse, manipulative and artificially satisfying. Could also be a good double feature at American Beauty. The best performance I've ever seen from Anita Mui, and every actor seems to be a powerhouse. Hats off to Ann Hui for the director and Ivy Ho for the brilliant script. Truly one of the best dramas I've seen in a long time, especially if you have a taste for classic ALA poetry. Again excellent.
