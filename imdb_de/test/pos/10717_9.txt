KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1979. This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising man whose life is turned upside down when his eight-year-old wife leaves him and looks after his son to build a relationship with him he never had. Robert Benton's haunting script shows us flawed but real people with hearts, souls, and brains. In the scene where Joanna announces to Ted that she is leaving him, she not only storms the door ... She gives him the keys, her credit cards, the cleaning card and tells him which bills have been paid. and informs him that she has withdrawn from her bank account the same amount of money she had on her marriage, not anymore. That decision to leave was not a joke ... it was thought about and Joanna had no choice but to leave if she left, she would get it right ... and with no particular plan in mind, she I held it not right to take Billy with you. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing the bacon home. He had no idea that his life at home was shattering. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar starring Joanna, the unfortunate woman we feel sympathy for at the beginning of the movie, but who changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always get ripped off in the scene where he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar nominee) why his mother left and he does everything in a whisper or when he meets Joanna on her return and hits her drink against a wall ( a Hoffman moment, not in the script, about which Streep was not informed to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry meets all the right notes as Billy, the confused little boy who does not know why his mother left and does not know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also received an Oscar nod as Ted and Joanna's neighbor Margaret, who changed allegiance after completing the film. This is an intense family drama, but there is also laughter here ... Billy and the chocolate ice cream ... Billy sulking because Ted chooses him too late for a party ... Billy catches his father at a night stand (JoBeth Williams) on the way to the bathroom, naked, but these are the moments of human drama you remember ... Ted runs through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get into the emergency room after Blyly falls off the jungle gym. Ted Just before he starts his custody battle, he gets fired and instead of making a scene, he whispers to the guy ... "Be ashamed." And of course the finale, in which Joanna Ted says she does not take Billy with her, which I found difficult to swallow. Why should she bother to sue for custody, and then just change her mind? However, this is a small criticism of a wonderful movie masterfully directed by Robert Benton and flawlessly performed by a top-notch cast. Something you must have seen.
