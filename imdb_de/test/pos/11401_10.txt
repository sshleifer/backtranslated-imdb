Paul Thomas Anderson's stylish and compelling interpretation of the '70s porn industry follows Eddie Adams, aka Dirk Diggler, through six years of sex, drugs and disco. His chance meeting with porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) begins his career as one of the greatest adult actors of his time. Dirk's character is based on real porn actor John Holmes, who, like Dirk, was known for being extremely "well-endowed". Here Dirk finds first success. <br /> <br /> The main themes in Boogie Nights are the obvious ones referring to a movie of this genre. Pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. Boogie Nights treats pornography with some control. It is not dubbed and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they take place on the screen. Throughout the film, cocaine is massively abused, and the backdrop of the film, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the drug's popularity at that time, which perfectly captures the film. However, Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine, as there are some scenes of addiction and overdose. At Jack's party, for example, they find a girl who has recently been overdosed graphically. Blood drains from her nose and she begins to unconsciously sit. The movie before these scenes was pretty cheerful and weird, but from that point on he suggests the darkness that he will perform. <br /> <br /> The music scenes are performed brilliantly, from excellently staged disco scenes to a dirk singing terribly in his new music career. The soundtrack is also excellent and includes melodies from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the unforgettable sound experience. The outstanding scene in the entire film depends on the music. Dirk, Redd Rothschild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit the home of drug dealer Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina) to quickly earn money by selling counterfeit drugs, increasing the intensity of the scene incredibly and proving it that music can give so much depth to a scene. Boogie Nights is full of such scenes that make the movie even more fantastic. <br /> <br /> The outstanding performance in Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds as a puzzling but capricious film director. In the scene in which he attacks a young man to film his films, this is a total shock to the audience, because before that time he was pretty gentle and content. Other noteworthy performances include Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as the beautiful Rollergirl, John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg delivering the performance of his career. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original movie that uses common themes but filmed in its sharp and realistic way. Anderson's approach captured these characters at a time when nothing seemed to go wrong, or at least until the 1980s. From then on things get very dark and all signs of recognizable characters and situations from the first part of the movie have disappeared. However, this does not reduce the high level of responsive entertainment this movie offers. Boogie Nights was not box office and scored only Â£ 2m in the UK cinemas. But that's not the concern of the director or the movie. Anderson recognizes quality, not popularity, as shown in his other three films Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a simple parable with excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this movie, you'll find that Boogie Nights is a simple moral story, but it remembers days after watching it. Boogie Nights is both shocking, weird, devastating and both visually and audibly great.
