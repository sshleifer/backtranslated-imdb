After seeing many other films by Wong Kar-Wai (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Ashes of Time), I knew what to expect with the theater visit. The cinematography would be lavish, the use of space and perspective would vary, the spectacle would be superb and at least one of the characters would be claimed by an indescribable solitude. After all, these are exactly the techniques that make Wong Kar-Wai's art what it is. What I did not expect was the degree that I was drawn into a film that some reviewers dismissed as "unfinished" and forced by characters who seemed "bored with boredom". <br /> <br /> I find it interesting how people can do it from a film that is so utterly unmoved by the emotions and attitudes that many of us take for granted, so alive, or so passionately oblivious to oblivion: the overwhelming sense of grief stemming from betrayals; the guilt awakened by the thought of not becoming better than the traitor; the worldly but deeply intimate moments of relationships in which the need to express oneself verbally is completely superfluous. This is what Wong Kar-Wai tries to portray in the film and what he achieves so well. <br /> <br /> Too many Americans have been depleted of the need to fill every moment of a movie with stock dialogue; Funny banter, dissatisfied sarcasm and overused confessions seem to be the pinnacle of "best" American film. Wong Kar-Wai sees things differently. Instead of having the character keep the audience informed about every emotion, perception or belief, Wong's characters make their feelings and understanding clear through facial gestures, body positioning and, yes, silence. <br /> <br /> If Viewers only look at this movie from the point of view of character development and action, then they may be disappointed with what it has to offer. If you are willing to experience the feel of the characters, you can feel very different from what Wong has to offer.
