I saw this cartoon as a kid, a dad, and now a grandfather. It is my favorite cartoon. I love the characters, the great little pieces and the very good drawings. I love the main song that appears throughout the cartoon. I think it's a nice little cartoon. Everyone I've shown it just loves it. It's too bad it opened on a bad day (Pearl Harbor bombing). Without the bad timing, it would have been a great success. I hope I can find a DVD of it, because all VHS cassettes do not do it justice. You will just love it. <br /> <br />
