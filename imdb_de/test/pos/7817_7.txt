There are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this film. Suffice to say that Alex Cord has a strong lead over Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. What worries me is that many of you do not know (at least) two versions of this movie. In the US version, Clay McCord receives an amnesty from Governor Lem Carter and then leaves the city. I agree that the end is less than satisfactory. However, in the original Italian cut, Clay McCord rides out of town (without guns, as he has handed his pistols to the governor) and is beaten by the bounty hunters who have slowly depopulated the bandit town of Escondido. The Bounty Killers are thrilled with the prospect of sharing the $ 10,000 bonus, but are disappointed that McCord's amnesty agreement is found in the morgue. As they drive away, one hears a comment: "If this amnesty goes on, I'll start hunting buffalo!" , This alone takes a minute to pray ... A Second To Die and brings it to a well-balanced field with films like Keoma and The Big Gundown. As the credits in the Italian section "FINE" says.
