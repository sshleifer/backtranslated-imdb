I read the book before I saw the movie and it exhausted me emotionally, but I felt that it really brought me to Afghanistan, a culture I know very little about. I had high hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint me. I saw this with someone who did not read the book, and he enjoyed it too. They had to cut some things in the movie, but it was a well-made and well-shot movie. It lets you think about the movie for a long time. You feel for the characters and their plight. I warmly recommend this film to anyone who loves the drama in an emotional way and wants to experience Afghan culture. There are some disturbing scenes that are not suitable for children to watch. It is a heavy drama that represents the horrors of life under a restrictive regime.
