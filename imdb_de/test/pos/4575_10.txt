I was one of the few who looked around the theater. I have often thought about it since then. After two DVD tours, I'm glad it was kept perfect. As with any great comedy, I laughed more and more at each observation, both in anticipation of gags and after capturing things that were missing before. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge is very good at creating weirdly funny characters and putting them into their world to make sense. In Office Space, the environment makes the characters believable. The future of idiocracy gives him the freedom to write incredibly stupid characters and get them to work. I'll wait and see if they release a better DVD with some of the latest features before you buy them. But this movie deserves the support on DVD, which is not offered to him in the theater.
