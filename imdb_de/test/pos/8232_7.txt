After cleaning up Dodge City (with some help from Wyatt Earp), Bat Masterson goes to Liberal, Kansas, where a nice little war reigns. And a pretty interesting scheme of sharecropping. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and he's focused on the bad guys Billy House and Steve Brodie, who drive their farms from their farms. The homesteaders who leave are in a Robert Ryan funded sharecropping program. It seems like he is pledging the various farmers for one percent of the profits from their harvest to a property. Ryan is losing his shirt as a result of all the phenomena. <br /> <br /> As portrayed by Scott, Bat Masterson is a Western Western hero who has the passion to go east and become a reporter we all know he did later in life , <br /> <br /> Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith are involved in a romantic subplot involving Brodie and Ryan, which is a bit stupid and distracts the action. Anne Jeffreys is singing well. <br /> <br /> Of course, Gabby Hayes offers the great comic relief as always. <br /> <br /> A good addition to the Western collection by Randolph Scott. Also interesting because his later western films do not wear him as white as here. <br /> <br /> This review is dedicated to Kasey Hayes of the Professional Bull Riders, who is a proud resident of Liberal Kansas, a city with a great tradition of whether Bat Masterson has made Marshal there or not.
