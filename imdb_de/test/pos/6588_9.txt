This movie was a gift - a nocturnal offer out of the blue - so unlike other reviewers, I did not have any prejudices. I felt stuck to my seat as the movie slowly dictated its own rhythm, its own unfolding. I was tempted to acknowledge my own deep love and humanity as I wanted it to be "good" - but I also had to step into that sometimes I was on the side of the "bad guys". The movie is pretty beautiful - the word "elegiac" comes to my mind, and more than just because the movie begins and ends in an elegy. For me, the film is by no means depressing or confronting, but recognizing deep suffering - and then, due to its cyclical nature - with births and rebirths and deaths - that the film celebrates the fact that there is an Australian poet quoted there is "sometimes Joy". Oh gods, I feel like I just wrote a love letter to this movie - but there he is. Hello!
