Michelle Pfeiffer is ideally cast in this colorful black comedy as a frustrated mob widow. Matthew Modine plays a clumsy FBI agent who has fallen in love with her. Dean Stockwell steals the show as the big shot who continues to harass Pfeiffer; Mercedes Ruehl is as dynamic as his jealous wife. It's all very '80s, but that only adds to the fun. A nice little movie, but not for every taste.
