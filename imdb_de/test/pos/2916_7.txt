I'll start at the beginning and say, "I like this movie." It's great, great, exciting and fun. Sinhue, the doctor, sits in front of his small stone hut and writes his memoirs. And what a story that is! He is taken from a river and educated by an elderly couple concentrating on him, and becomes a doctor of the poor. He befriends Horemheb, who sees glory while Sinhue sees healing. And both are running into the future Pharaoh Anknaten (forgive me my spelling), who suffers an epileptic seizure. <br /> <br /> And this pharaoh has another "flaw": He believes in a god instead of a god pantheon. It was totally revolutionary at the time. Sinhue and Horemheb grow up. One night Sinhue sees a woman who makes him lose his senses. He gives up his practice, sells his parents' house and even their graves, just to spend a night with her. He does? I will not tell. Meanwhile, Merit, a tavern girl played by Jean Simmons with sweet simplicity, falls in love with Sinhue. It falls under its spell and the spell of faith in a god. Victor Mature looks perfect as Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is sincere as Sinhue the lost doctor (does he find salvation? Stay tuned). Even Bela Darvi, the woman who steals Sinhue's heart, is not as bad as anyone has said. The fact that she was the lover of Daryl F. Zanuck had nothing to do with the casting - right? Yeah, right ... but she was not so bad, I saw worse. I think she has done better in "The Egyptian" than many of today's young actresses. I already said it and I'll say it again - I like this movie. I recommend it. It makes you think in spite of malicious acting. Have fun with this movie; That's worth it.
