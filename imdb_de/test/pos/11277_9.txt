I really like this movie a lot. It is not very entertaining, but it is a celebration of bizarre and stunning pictures! There is no dialogue, just some background noise and sounds. If you like something completely different and original and enjoy the obscure and the bizarre ... then you might like this artwork. Ik looks like a movie shot with the very first camera of all time, in a time when alien, humanoid beings live and execute their bizarre habits. God killed himself with a razor and bore Mother Earth. Mother Earth impregnated herself with God's seed after a fellatie and gave birth to a son "flesh on bone". What follows are inhuman acts of ritual torture, rape and murder for purposes we do not know ... or do we?
