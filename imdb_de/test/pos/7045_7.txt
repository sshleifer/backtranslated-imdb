The quintessence "we get ready for the summer movie." It's stupid, stupid and maybe a bit old-fashioned, but my kids just saw it and they laughed as hard as I did when I saw it for the first time. In the style of all the "Little vs Establishment" movies, the storyline is very predictable, but warm and funny. And no, it's not Bill Murray with his Bill Murrayest, but he's starting to spread in his first starring role. Strange to see how few of the "fresh young faces" did much more in this film.
