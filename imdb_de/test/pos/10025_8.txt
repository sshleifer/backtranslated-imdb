Errol Flynn's mischievous charm really shines in this entertaining and exciting, but historically bankrupt biography of the famed (and some would say it's somewhat unexpressed), General Custer, who spanned his career from his first day at West Point through the Civil War to the west Following The Battle of The Little Big Horn, struggling all the time with rival Arthur Kennedy and handsome Olivia de Havilland. <br/> <br /> You could say that Flynn, who as a general delivers a great, extravagant performance, this is actually he plays Custer himself! <br /> <br /> A lavish production (which should have been in Technicolor), which is played by Raoul Walsh under the direction of They Died With Their Boots On, and some really well-orchestrated combat sequences. It's also a real pleasure to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse. <br /> <br /> Last year, Flynn Jeb Stuart starred alongside George Custer of Ronald Reagan on the Santa Fe Trail (also starring de Havilland), another action-packed Warner Brothers player who wants you in the History class fail!
