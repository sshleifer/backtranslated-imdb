I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen for Naruto. The action was much better than the first movie because it had a lot more fight scenes and it got faster. It was amazing, the choreographer was excellent, as were most of the visual effects. <br /> <br /> The plot is something new for Naruto. but it's basically the same as the first movie. In the series you can see how they fight against other ninjas, but in the movies (1 + 2) you can see how they fight against weapons of mass destruction. It's nice to see them fighting with something other than ninja, and seeing a power other than chakra was great. and how other people from other countries are fighting on the other side of the ocean. Sakura finally killed someone stronger than she. (she's really gotten strong) it was much better than the fillers of the series that I am now looking at. If you watch this movie, the fast action scene will surely make your heart beat faster. With new Jutsus and Garra in the movie you know that it's good. and the music was good too, but I'm missing something. But the final theme song was a plus. (dind dang dang) I think it was a really good song. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this movie a 10 because I just love it. If you decide to watch it, enjoy it. lol
