Recently, there was a documentary about filming that contained a long list of actors and directors who talked about making films. A common theme was that you can have a great script, a good cast, the best director and a lot of money, and still make a bad movie. Down Periscope is the proof of the inference of this theory. No original or poorly written script. A few solid actors, but mostly unknown, and this movie just makes you laugh! It would be easy to say that Kelsey Grammar wore this film, but that's not the case. Other character actors, such as Rob Schneider and comic Harland Williams, contributed significantly to the fun of the film. <br /> <br /> Casting dynamics or this mysterious "film magic" are really what happened here and made a movie that flows smoothly, has incredibly well-executed transitions and line by line of a well written and well executed dialogue , <br /> <br /> An absurd premise, a lot of technical inaccuracies and planning just stupid things that could not happen in reality, real world or the real marine, but you just do not care. As a merchant navy myself, I have found that the overall feel of the film, while not plausible, was not too far off in terms of life at sea. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny movie, a good family movie, and especially if you are a fan, lots of Kelsey grammar, sarcasm, and just damn comedy.
