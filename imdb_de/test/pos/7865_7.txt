This strange and hypnotic drama by Don Siegel / Clint Eastwood was left behind in 1971 and what a pity. A fascinating character study with some great women Squint has to deal with. Geraldine Page was one of our best actresses and she is perfectly cast. The young Jo Ann Harris is a flirty Minx, and Elizabeth Hartman (who died too soon) is undeniably suppressed. <br /> <br /> A of 10 points. The same year DIRTY HARRY released, it did not matter, except for a few good reviews. Choose this if you are not just interested in "explosion" movies. Very subtle and scary, this piece will stay with you.
