In Queen of the Damned, Akasha (Aaliyah) was sexy and had a bigger, more demanding presence. It just fell on your attention and attention. Now the film had mistakes, like the absence of Akasha's past. What I did not like was that the movie did not really explain or show how the relationship between Lestat and Akasha was / was, or how they did until the second half of the movie and then their death (akasha) quickly came to light Graduation. But I liked how Akasha struggled when the elders tried to kill her. The elders were quite boring (they killed Akasha in about 2 seconds). Akasha's head was knocked off in 1 second and Lestat became the biggest punk in the world. Aaliyah played Akasha very well and Stuart was perfect as a Lestat if they could not choose a better Akasha or a Lestat. "PEACE IN PEACE AALIYAH"
