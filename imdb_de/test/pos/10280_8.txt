Not all movies should have the predictable ending that we are all so used to, and it's great to see films with really unusual twists and turns. Nevertheless, I was really disappointed by the end of the apartment. In my opinion, the end did not really fit the rest of the movie and it essentially destroyed the story that was being told. <br /> <br /> They spend the entire movie exploring everyone and their emotions, but the events in The Last 2 Minutes of the Movie had a strong impact on all characters, but the movie ends and leaves everything too wide open , Overall this movie was very well done and unlike similar films like Serendipity. All scenes were believable and did not top the mark.
