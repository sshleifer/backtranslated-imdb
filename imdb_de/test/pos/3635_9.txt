In Northestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had been crying continuously for five years. As a young man, he falls in love with Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen-year-old teenager who dreams of seeing the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Northern Estonia, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates in a sensational television program and promises to travel for the next fifty years or die out of love with a deadly machine invented by him. Fifty years later, Antônio (Paulo Autran) tries to correct what was wrong on his journey. <br /> <br /> "A Máquina" is one of the best Brazilian movies I have seen lately. The refreshing and original story is a poetic and magical love story that will surely delight the most skeptical and strict observer in a unique romance. The direction is excellent; the script is great; the cinematography and the colors are great; The cast, led by Gustavo Falcão, icon Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes, is fantastic with wonderful lines. The soundtrack contains some beautiful Brazilian songs highlighting Geraldo Azevedo and Rento Rocha's "Dia Branco". If this movie is overseas, please hit me and lend it or buy the DVD, because I bet you'll love the story that will make you cry. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Máquina? O Combustível é o Amor" ("The machine? The fuel is love")
