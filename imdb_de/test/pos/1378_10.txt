It's very good on many levels. Considering that this is a British low-budget indie of a first-time director with a largely neophyte cast, this is a great achievement. I do not know how much it costs. The figure of Â£ 8,000 has been publicly publicized, but you never know how reliable such a figure is. The point is, this movie looks like it costs a few million pounds and it's a tiny fraction of the big special effects, great production design, effective props and costumes, excellent photography, good acting and directing, an impressive score and an absolutely stunning one sound mix. Still, the script was great. The characters were clearly identified and everyone had something to do. This is a movie about ten men, all dressed roughly the same in one place, and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless blanks, but these were ten characters - mostly through dialogue and the way in which how they reacted to it. During the middle nude as the story unfolded, the script narrated the story well and showed how it influenced the characters. If the whole movie was like the second act, that would be breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Before the ship blows up, twelve people manage to reach individual escape pods or "e-pods" that fly away from the ship. They are little more than automatic metal coffins and the poor soles inside are locked up, cramped and have no idea where to go - but that makes sense. I like the E-Pods - they are a great idea that has been made very well and makes more sense than a nice, spacious capsule. I also like the way we're later told that they're designed for a ship-to-ship escape, but in an emergency situation they can almost cause planet crashes - because let's be honest, those guys were damn lucky that her ship was blown up so close to a planet. That said, it does not look to me like there are 116 unused e-pods on the freighter, and you have to wonder how the prisoner can get into an e-pod - but he'll come in case. (And I just remembered that the captain did not have to go down with his ship instead of being the first one there?) The E-Pods all end up on a barren planet with only sand and sparse vegetation - or at least a sandy one sparsely vegetated part of the planet, which may have icy waste and lush jungles elsewhere. No, it's a planet in a sci-fi movie - it's going to be the same everywhere. We must accept that all e-pods are only a few miles apart, so that the ten survivors can meet and fire torches into the sky to locate each other. <br /> <br /> The Captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could make a pretty good career in action movies if he gets the right agent, decides he should try to contact 'Captain Behan' with the they wanted to meet. But they can not do this from the planet, they have to get into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the aggregates of two e-pods, they can probably give one of them enough juice to move high enough on anti-gravity Doodads to strike above the atmosphere. This can all be done automatically, but a "pilot" is needed to send the signal. The captain voluntarily volunteers for it, but in a remarkably meaningful move, the engineer points out that it's ridiculous to put the heaviest man in the somewhat dodgy E-Pod, and it must be the lightest member of the team. That's kid. I really liked the way he now points out that his name is David and the captain starts to use it and treats him with dignity and respect. That was good storytelling and good characterization.
