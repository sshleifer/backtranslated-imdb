This movie was really funny. The people who were expecting an Oscar-worthy comedy should get over themselves. This was a funny movie with interesting and funny characters, plots, dialogue quotes and keywords. I rate a movie at 10 when I bought the DVD or, in this case, videotape and watched it a lot and in this case still laugh a lot. I have about 12 films in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half have nothing to do with the Oscars. Again, this was just a funny, carefree movie. I hope that comes out on DVD. I strongly suggest you watch this movie if you fancy a crazy comedy.
