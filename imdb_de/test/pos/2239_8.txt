I just looked at the 100 bottom movies for IMDb users and found out if there was anything else to check that I have not seen yet and I found this little gem. One of these occasions when you consider a movie as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few who really like it. Damn, well, I think I'm being ridiculed and spit on here, but for me that was a pretty good movie when I saw him. It may have been a while, but I remember that HBO came earlier in the night, and I've seen it two or three times, and I have not really seen it since, and I'd like to see it now, if Jolie was there. The story tells of a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the claws of this corporation and some bounty hunters. I think that's basically all that goes with it, throw in some scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie. Some good actions here and there and also blood and violence. There is also a love story as well as the female cyborg and the man who trained her to fall in love with each other. Sometimes the dialogue gets pretty bad sometimes and is far from being a first-class movie, but it's really good for a B-movie. I do not know if it was a movie release because it does not seem to be high enough, but it's one of the better videos if it's one of them.
