2004 was the year of Biopics, with no less than four images addressing real events, real people, with different critical praise. Of the four images that made it to the Oscars (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA, and RAY) in early 2005, RAY became the big winner of the evening, when the acting prize was awarded to Jamie Foxx for his performance. B genius Ray Charles. <br /> <br /> And it was well earned, although Leonardo di Caprio came closer and Liam Neeson was not even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was the fact that the others played two relatively obscure eccentrics. Ray Charles still made music until his death in 2004. had written. It has helped Jamie Foxx rise above the movie - even a bit weak overall and often looks like he's not a TV biopic - and his depiction is detailed because it's wild. He has the delicate task of embodying a person down to the smallest detail, and once the crisis of Ray's heroin addiction hits a head, Foxx pulls out all the stops and it's not hard to imagine that the real Ray actually goes through such painful ordeal. <br /> <br /> The low point of the movie is that he spent a little too much time detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like THE AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford claims that Ray had this tumultuous life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when black and successful brought with it a large amount of luggage. Of the women, Sharen Warren as Ray's mother is the only one who can succeed. Her role is a difficult one, being alone on the screen and the actor playing the young Ray, but her facial and body language is uncomfortable, especially at the moment she has to give up her motherhood so Ray can navigate the house can. Such intense emotions to stand there and see your blind son crawl through a room, forcing him to bring this rude awakening to independence. A nice performance that should have been recognized. <br /> <br /> A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the music presented. Anyone who knows R & B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as well as his later ones, which would take him to the top of popular music, and Jamie Foxx practically steals the show while performing the songs as Ray. That alone will live on, even if the film itself is little more than a stiff biopic. However, I would have loved it if they had used their last Adult Contemporary hit from 1993 "Sing my Song for You" in the credits. After all, it is Ray Charles, a performer, who has worked intensively with his art.
