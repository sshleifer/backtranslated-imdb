Seriously, every movie with John Malkovich is usually very good. These include Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo, John Mahoney (Frasier), Dylan McDermott (The Practice) and many other great actors. <br /> <br /> Clint is getting old now, but thanks to him he's also a fantastic director (we're used to Wolfgang "water films" like The Boat, Poseidon and Perfect Storm - that was really something else, but equally sublimely addressed . <br /> <br /> The assassin's premise is as serious as it gets, the film is performing well, some of the violence is a bit ... but overall recommended (but not for kids).
