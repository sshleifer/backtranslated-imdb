The Ali G show was really amazing - he was as stupid as possible, rapper, but no one he interviewed realized he was just doing so. Sasha Cohen is actually a very smart guy pretending to be stupid so he could get really honest answers from the people ... and it's very funny. So I did not expect the movie to be good because everything was played - no real people or interviews. The basic point of all shows was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed the whole time, it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Sure it was stupid, but who cares if you can not really brake into the safe with a car battery, as someone said? It should not be a realistic documentary ... And it's not like the show, it's a different way, but that does not mean it's bad. When I finished watching, I was really impressed, but as time passed, I realized that it was not special anyway. But it still deserves a Nine - at least for what it should be.
