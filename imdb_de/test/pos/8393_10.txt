That's about as good as going with the wind. I love this movie, I could watch it over and over again. She loves him so much. This is a story of true love. She started with the wind and ended up in this movie. The only real way to end this movie for real love So it ended with them together with their daughter. What more could you ask for? There is no better end to this great love story than this one. What else can I say about this great movie?
