First of all, if you enjoy watching movies, I suggest you NOT watch this movie. Why? After that, you will not appreciate another movie so easily. <br /> <br /> Actually, I do not want to raise exaggerated expectations, but it's scary how perfect, intense and beautiful this work by Einar Gudmundsson is. If in most films at least one aspect spoils the whole thing, like good actors, but terrible dialogues or a beautiful scenery, but a cost-effective cinematography? "Angel of the Universe" there is nothing of this ambivalence. Really everything is just great, also (and not least) the soundtrack with the great Sigur RÃ³s. <br /> <br /> In this story about Pall, a A pupil who becomes schizophrenic after taking off his girlfriend, especially the dialogues (and monologues) deserve some attention: Along with (and sometimes in sharp contrast to) the They range from depressing and fatalistic to funny and totally absurd. Moreover, they are (with quotations from Hegel and Shakespeare) often of such poetic beauty that the film almost slides into a surreal sphere and is only rescued by its incredibly authentic actors in the real world. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments already referred to another point: this film is not a trivial entertainment to relax in the evening, and despite some comical reliefs in between, he is largely disturbing, sometimes cynical and bitter and above all sad a modern poetry about a life of madness with all its emptiness, anger and loneliness. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you saw the movie? look at it again. There are some great visual metaphors and allusions that you only realize when you look twice and connect them to the "moral of the story". And of course: read the book, it contains much more of the little funny stories in between and also makes you a lot better in the movie.
