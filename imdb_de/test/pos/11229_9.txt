It's a shame that this movie is rated PG13 - it's really for everyone - though young kids may not be able to follow the movie well. <br /> <br /> He belongs to this wonderful genre of serio-comic mind / angelic stories that would need to include everything from Capra's "It's A Wonderful Life" to Wender's "Wings of Desire". <br /> <br /> The photography is stunning, the acting superb and - wonder of wonders - the sound is uplifting. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. The two intertwined stories seem at first glance fascinatingly mysterious. but they dissolve a bit too nicely for my taste. As the director stresses in his commentary on the DVD, all the ingredients in Irwin's story are on his bedside table. The symbolism is just a small thing for me. <br /> <br /> But what a lark! My favorite scene has to be when the moving team tries to have breakfast in a diner. This is downright theatrical in his magic - a tour de force of witty drama - subtle, playful and positively rhythmic - paired with striking cinematography and a keen eye for the grotesque. <br /> <br /> "Northfork" is funny, touching, beautiful to look at, magical (with the above caveats) and does not have a single chase. <br /> <br /> A simple nine stars.
