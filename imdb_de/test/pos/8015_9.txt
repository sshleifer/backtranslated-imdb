These were two video films that Troama feared were horrible, and she was desperately transformed into this one movie. Maybe the bitterness on Troama's side helped spark the comedy, but for some reason that's a very funny stuff with an inspired piece in which "Oliver Stone" commented on a commentary during the movie. Many cameos, lots of use of the Lesbian Cannibal HoeDown song add to the fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain etc. etc ... <br /> <br /> One of the best Troama releases. Yes, it is the same everywhere, you know that entering, the quality of production or the absence of is one of the many jokes. Join us and you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> Backstage, the best things about Troama releases are often above average. I truly believe that the anger they felt about these two lousy films helped drive them, well, not great, but they drove them to "fix" this film better as if both films were as they were originally planned.
