I just discovered this obscure 70's horror movie while surfing on YouTube. For a budget on a budget, there are many compelling moments at the incremental pace that lead to a surprisingly shocking finish. While there is a woman constantly taking off her shirt, the fact that she's a nymphomaniac makes these scenes important to the story, and there's a scene with the curly young man trying to seduce her before he does retiring, she screamed angrily. The young sister who comes in and is hired is seductive and it's not surprising that she posed for the cover of Playboy. Some characters are very irritating and some scenes are ridiculous. But for the most part, "Do not Watch The Basement" (that's the title I've seen on YouTube) is enough drama and chill for a fun B-movie.
