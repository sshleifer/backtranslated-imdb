Actually, I admit that I'm a political junkie. That appealed to me a lot, but the unpredictable nature of Ms. Green (yes, I know what they did to her), but the end was such a copout and completely incompatible with the movie itself. <br /> <br / > Why can not Barry L and the crew just ask us what he would do? Let's debate about it. <br /> <br /> Instead, they have this "Oh, I do not deserve it" bullshit end and it just shows that if the chips are down, it's better to leave the table instead of doubling. Stop the Disney end and put a bow on it. Life is not easy, they should have had the courage to give the main character a backbone. <br /> <br /> We had to listen to the whole movie of rhetoric ... and then it sniffed and the stupid, inane behavior of Ms. Green (as the crap out of her system) just made for a ridiculous end to the movie that was the icing on the cake.
