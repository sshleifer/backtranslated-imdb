A lovely librarian, played by Playboy model Kristine DeBell, falls asleep and dreams into a strange world full of extremely unrestrained people. These people love to sing and dance and fool around. Alice has a series of sensual adventures among these characters? <br /> <br /> The film was originally shot as an erotic poem with a few explicit sex scenes that were ultimately cut off from the theatrical release. For video cassette versions, however, some of the original erotic encounters were eventually associated with them. <br /> <br /> For an extremely cheap picture, the producers of this film did an extremely good job. The cinematography is full of life and energy, the dances and numbers are very professional and the actors amiable. Without a doubt, is it one of the best fairy tales for adults?
