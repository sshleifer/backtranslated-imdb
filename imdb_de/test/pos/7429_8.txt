A young girl becomes the pen pal of a Navy, and at the end of the war, when he waits for someone more "available", comic complications occur. After all, everything works fine, of course, but not before everyone involved chewed the scene thoroughly. Errol Flynn's dead impression of Humphrey Bogart from "Casablanca" is a highlight, as well as various send-ups of his own washed-out image (the "jumping" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is an uprising). However, it is Tucker who "pokes" the film under his arm, lowers his head and hits the goal line. He demonstrates the comic flair that has developed 20 years later in "F-Troop" and gives a vibrancy and energy that Flynn plays again and again to increase his own performance. Eleanor Parker does a great job as a persecuted woman and little Patti Brady enchants as Tucker's friend, a pen pal. A fine, light comedy "Coming Home" in a classier environment that should entertain children and romantics of all ages.
