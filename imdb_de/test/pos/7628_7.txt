Stupidly beautiful This film embodies the genre "that's how bad it is good". <br /> <br /> The only two talents are Richard Boone and Joan van Ark, and only Boone is good. It's kind of sad that the man who became famous as a paladin should land in that ugly heap of celluloid. While performing in a fantastic performance, I can not help but feel that he trumped all the actors in this piece so much that he was not even there. The effects in this movie are ridiculous, but funny. The idea of ​​a dinosaur being buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly brought to life is B-Movie Gold. When the Triceratops are killed, watch them fall. It's clear the stunt performer in the front of the costume knows the timing best. He falls to the ground long before the back half of the dinosaur follows the suit. <br /> <br /> When talking about 'suits', there is nothing good about the purple tyrannosaur in this strip. It seems to have some kind of stealth technology, as Bunta (supposedly the best tracker in the world) does not notice it twice until it is within reach. I do not know how all the prints are, but in the version I own, the tyranno roar contains Godzilla's trademark. <br /> <br /> That's great fun if you like bad movies. I love them and especially bad monster movies, so I consider this the jewel of my collection. If bad movies are your thing, get this one definitely.
