No matter how much it hurts me to say so, the movie is not as good as it could have been. Maybe I've been misled by the myriad exaggerated reviews here on IMDb, but I expected so much more ... Sure, the idea is good, the violent scenes and the camera work are outstanding, the imagination of Genius Dario is breathtaking, but the movie is "polluted" by some mistakes that I find unforgivable. Am I one of the few who feels that heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes just tears the atmosphere ??? With a different kind of music (goblin ????) during the "needle" scenes it would have been SOOOO intense! ... Instead, the soundtrack destroys the chance for excitement ... Second, the final killer scene and the final moments of the movie are just stupid and uninspired. I do not want to say "amateurish" because I love Argentos movies. In the end, I felt empty. Talk about a last impression! This hardly happens in most Darios films! Granted, Suspiria also suffers from a lavish finale (though most of it is brilliant) ... <br /> <br /> In short, watch this movie, try to make the most of its good points But be prepared for some bad ones too. This is NOT a perfect movie by any means.
