A skilful director of Martin Ritt, in which John Cassevetes, a drifter and anti-hero, lands in New York to escape a tragic incident in his life that killed his brother in a car crash and AWOL army left. > <br /> Cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows sand in his movie presentation. I'm surprised that Montgomery Clift did not get that role. <br /> <br /> Ruth White is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes over the phone. <br /> <br /> Once in New York, he makes friends with Sidney Poitier as the two work on the docks. Jack Warden, a bully and villain in this movie, instantly dislikes him and a tragedy ensues as Poitier tries to defend his friend. Ruby Dee, plays Poitier's wife in this movie and is brilliant In a scene where she asks Cassavetes to reveal her husband's killer. <br /> <br /> This is definitely an interesting film about moral values ​​and the loners of society. Against the background of the apartment buildings, the right mood is shown in the film.
