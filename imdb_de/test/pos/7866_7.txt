Another successful moral ambiguity that makes it difficult for the anti-hero to decide whom to choose. At least in 1971. In this film, there were four outstanding roles for actresses, all well-staffed and well executed. Pamelyn Ferdin did a good job as Amy and would play "Wanda June". , This was probably the first time an adult male box office star shared a lengthy kiss with a twelve-year-old girl in front of the camera. I wonder if there was much controversy at the time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Given the fate of Amy's turtle Randolph, it is no surprise that Ferdin became a hardcore animal rights activist. Geraldine Page was also excellent and played a complex character with just the right amount of restraint. It's interesting that she died just three days after Elizabeth Hartman's death (throwing herself through a fifth-floor window), as they had also worked together in "You're a Big Boy Now." Hartman (who looks like she could be Blair Brown's sister?) Was wonderful, because Edwina should have won an Oscar (there had not been another performance this year) trouble and how much was coming from inside her. Edwina shows such raw pain, which is difficult to observe. Like Marilyn Monroe's incredible performance in The Misfits, the viewer will likely see a number of his own demons in the character she plays. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Jo Ann Harris, who is amazingly perfect flirty Carol. For my money, Harris was the sexiest actress of the 70s and combined sensuality with intelligence and humor. It was the best reason to watch the television series "Most Wanted" and the only reason to see "Wild Wild West Revisited". It's hard to believe that anyone who could put that on the screen never became a big star.
