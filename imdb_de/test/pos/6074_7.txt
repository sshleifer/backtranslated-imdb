The English patient is one of the films that most deserve the highest praise. I say most of the time, because this film, though very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, has some drawbacks. First of all why, oh why are the modern films so long? It will take more than two hours and from time to time it will be very difficult to concentrate and pursue the most serious conspiracy. I say, if the movie was an hour shorter, that would be fine. But we have what we have. The winner of several Oscars, The English Patient, is still very good. It is a deep, revealing treatise on human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and valor. Ralph Fiennes is a stunning great actor. His neurotic and dumb hero is an enigmatic person, ready for anything, only to save the life of his beloved. He's great, though half the time he's a deformed cripple. He is the strongest member here. Juliette Binoche is as always very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot to her excellent playing and love story with this Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth and Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all enormous and all very strong. And then there is a desert in Egypt, then there is a deep, cloudless sky and green groves in Italy. Nature is here, even as people die, bombs roar, land mines explode. War is here too. It's obvious, terrible and bloody. Then there are corpses, terrible bloody bodies, then naked bodies, adultery and so on. I do not know what to say. So much of a great work of the actors, so much realism, so much brutality that comes with the war. This is not a movie for relaxation. That makes you think.
