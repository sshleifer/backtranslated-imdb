I first saw Nightbreed on TV a year ago and was pleasantly surprised with the results. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker is said to have revived the horror with Hellraiser, but this is a movie that has finally brought his movie career to a halt. What an unfortunate event, because this film seems to be misunderstood like the inhabitants of Midian. <br /> <br /> Barker has created a mix of genre staples in this story - it begins as a traditional horror movie but soon becomes a fable about man's inhumanity over man. To arouse sympathy for the devil is hard at the best of times, but if the characters are as demonic as in this movie, it becomes almost impossible (to address the child!). The virtually clan-like human uprising (pitchforks and holy wrath!) At the conclusion of the film is doubly exciting given what has gone before. As a parable of ethnic tension and white superiority, this film can be quite evocative. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for those who will not see the movie from this perspective, and remember that Barker's fantastic forbearance went too far. We have a real forgotten gem here and the sooner the studio and Mr. Barker are nice and spend some time - the better.
