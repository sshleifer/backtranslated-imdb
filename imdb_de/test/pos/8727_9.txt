Goldie Hawn's portrayal of a simple young woman in a triangle with an older man, a dentist, was so pleasurably played by Walter Matthau that she won the Best Supporting Actress of the Oscar in 1969. However, the film is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman. Rarely have we ever seen her in a comedy, and she literally appears here as a dedicated dental practice, leading Matthau to tell Hawau that they are married. It is a pleasure to see how Matthau and Bergman fall here. Your cause is a chance love affair. <br /> <br /> As a friend of Matthau, Jack Weston is also fabulous as a partner in this project. Rick Lenz is also as a newly found friend of Hawn sufficient support.
