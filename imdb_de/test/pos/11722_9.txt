This is Burt Reynold's "Citizen Kane". Nothing he was ever involved in approached almost the "Sharkey's Machine". It seemed to me that he put everything he had into it. It's a movie that loves movies The opening sequence in which Detective Sharkey saves a hostage busload by herself is an immensely exciting piece of cinema. If everything goes wrong, everything moves so fast that it seems to have a life of its own, a brilliant effect. It looks cold, tense and dangerous on the streets of Mr. Reynolds. The Revier House looks dirty and tired, full of desperate people on both sides of the law who scream, curse, try to do business or just stay alive. In this underworld comes the recently crashed Sharkey - caused by a corrupt police officer) - he and his team are part of the Vice Command. Information that they pick up about a crooked politician leads them into the world of top-notch call girls and reckless drug barons. When he looks at the apartment of such a call girl (Rachel Ward), Sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall (I know, I know), and when a woman's body is found in one of the rooms with a shot-down face, he thinks it is her. (Well, I said, it was a movie that loved movies). The scene in which she enters him works wonderfully, even if you have seen the original. The film is full of good accents, I particularly like the war story of Charles Durning, which was subtly acted and filmed in sharp contrast to Sharkey's abduction and torture, which is appropriately hard and brutal. I have to mention Vittorio Gassman and Henry Silva as two different but equally evil brothers with absolutely no redeeming qualities. They are "full" every time they appear on the screen, and they are no loss to society when their time comes. The end of Mr. Silva is indeed something special. As previously mentioned, this is a Clint Eastwood movie Clint never did. The biggest compliment I can pay for Sharkey's Machine is to point out that I think Clint Eastwood could not have done a better job. The soundtrack is of a similar level and includes Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Julie London, Chet Baker and other high-profile artists. Randy Crawford's "Street Life" plays behind the title track, and I can never hear it without my seeing Sharkey walk down the sidewalk. Like other correspondents, I've never understood why this movie was a flop. I hope that there will be a critical revision, especially at a time when so many policemen are vowing films and shows without a quarter of their energy, freshness and sheer joy Vivre are praised by the rooftops. If you're ever tempted to consider Burt Reynolds a burned-out pony, put "Sharkey's Machine" in your video machine. I promise you will not be disappointed.
