This little short absolutely fascinates me. <br /> <br /> The only thing I've seen so far is part of the work of Sam Brakhage, the creator of Dog Star Man. However, where Brakhage tries to "annoy us by making us learn to see each other again", and putting us through a headache that causes bright colors and flashes (which I still totally consider as high art and gush around ...), this is the case movie I would describe as very relaxing and mesmerizing Man Ray's general use of spinning objects / cameras does not produce so much dizziness, but a warm flow of senses that resonates with the moving ones An interesting idea of ​​this very short work is that objects become more and more recognizable over time until we end up on a bare torso (which I believe that these are the slightly rounded female breasts I've ever seen.) The circles and spirals of shadow and light over the torso make him an object of surrealistic beauty It's something you could hang on your wall and go through forever. Because of these and other pictures in this movie, I had to watch it over and over again (eventually seven times overall) just because it totally fascinates me. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
