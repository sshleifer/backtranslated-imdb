I saw this movie a few years ago and literally got carried away. So charming and so very romantic. David Duchovny and Ms. Driver have a chemistry that is so hot that you need to take off a layer of clothing. The supporting cast is 100% first class. Just to see how Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play against each other is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the most engaging moments of the movies are when they appear on the screen. As Jim Belushi cries for his children to "sleep forever!" or he dances in the kitchen. In this movie, we wish we knew people in my own life. Not to mention which woman does not want David Duchovny for a friend?
