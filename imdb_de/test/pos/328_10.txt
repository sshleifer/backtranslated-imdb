Kannathil Muthamittal is certainly a great movie. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a great directing job and A.R. Rahman for great songs. The camera work is just outstanding and resembles Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I am shocked if this film does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Cinematography.
