Produced by MGM in 1936, One-Reeler shows the talents of two of his young stars under contract, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. In a sense, these short films were promotion trailers with new talents in front of or behind the camera. Felix Feist led this project to present the two talented stars to the public. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. The orchestra, which runs every Sunday in a public park, does not get the attention it deserves. Two music lovers, Judy and Edna, love to hear the band being directed by one of their grandfathers. Two of the city's elders, sensing that there is no audience for this type of entertainment, have decided to cancel their Sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra, which attracts a larger audience's own promotional tour that only does what they do just know, run errands, run errands, and in return serve their neighbors in return for a promise that they will attend the park concert next Sunday. Well, this day is coming and to their surprise, hardly anyone comes when the music starts. The two girls decide to take matters into their own hands and ask the conductor to sing a song for them. The result is clear: people all over the park flock to listen to the talented young singers to ensure the orchestra's existence. <br /> <br /> Of course, the only attraction of the short film is the inspired singing of the two stars who are wonderful in their performance. Mrs. Durbin's opera voice fits in well with the natural voice of Mrs. Garland, who creates a beautiful duet. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it when it's on TCM!
