I absolutely love the promised land. The first episode I saw was during my mission from 2003 to 2005. I loved the rich family background in the show. There was a family here with their own fighting, but instead of dwelling on them; They would love to address others who may have had the same problems forgetting themselves and going to work. That's what made me fall in love with the show. All actors; especially Gerald McRaney; had shown the true meaning of "family" that has shaped my life indelibly. I was on the same path as her, but it took me a long time to develop this character. I love this show so much that I wanted to share it with friends. but I was really stunned when I heard that it was taken from the air. I still thought and still think that they should bring it back! So many lives can benefit from the sky-inspired media. I really believe that this show was divinely inspired. because it brings the mind every time I see only one episode. This show has really (in my book) really defined what a "promised land" is. It is the love that you hold in your heart for others. that brings you to a higher goal. The Spirit of Love is one of the most powerful messages in this series, and I can only say bring it back. -Robert
