Look, this movie is dark, brilliant and a classic that should be looked for. I assume that the powers have decided that they will fall into the bin forever. Nevertheless, we could only pray for the chance to see them on DVD. I would say that it even surpasses the big phatasm. If you like a dark movie with many scary images, look for this movie and see what an 80's horror movie should look like.
