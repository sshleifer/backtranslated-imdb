This is by far my favorite action movie. But what works are not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. It is the Shane Black script and its skillful delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two clients deserves a continuation. Thank God it was never done. Too much danger of damaging the original. <br /> <br /> 'The Long Kiss' Chessboards from the quote scene to the action scene to the quote scene and back again. Never a boring moment. <br /> <br /> This must be Jackson's funniest role of all time, and the amazing thing is that he plays one of the most normal characters in his career. No quirky Tarantino hit man, super cool Shaft or Border soldier. In TLKG, Jackson is the Jedermann with whom we identify. The poor fool is dragged on the odyssey of this crazy woman to uncover the dangerous secret of her past. <br /> <br /> Although the story claims that Davis' character, Samantha Caine suffers from amnesia, the author and the director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder. <br /> <br /> Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by the Amnesian Charly Baltimore - she is an independent, fully developed personality. The trauma that Samantha suffered in the first half hour of the movie helps Charly's submerged dissociation personality reappear. <br /> <br /> The materials from her past life, dug up by Jackson's detective Mitch Henessey, facilitate Charly's reappearance. Good timing considering the goal that makes Samantha out of itself. <br /> <br /> But Charly has to fight to stay the dominant personality. One collects dialogues that the warrior personality (Charly) developed after her father died and she was recruited by the Chapter. In the eight years, Charly was buried in the psyche Samantha identity evolved into the dominant personality. (She's all the funnier than Charly.) This was probably because she became a mother because it's the reunion with her daughter that breaks Charly's fight for the suppression of Samantha, leading to an apparent integration until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> It's impossible to choose a "best quote" from this movie: <br /> <br /> "Now you're a sniper?" <br /> <br /> "I saved your ass, it was great!" <br /> <br /> "Continue dying." <br /> <br /> "I sock them and yell 'Pop goes the weasel'". <br /> <br /> And a couple of dozen more, many too slippery to quote here. <br /> <br /> Geena Davis looks great and acts as an action hero without glossing over the fact that she turns forty. (Listen to Charley's story, calculate). <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtrack. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye. <br /> <br /> I give 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' a 9 just because I do not believe in a perfect 10. I've seen it a dozen times and it still stays fresh. A beautiful, twisted holiday strip placed next to "It's a wonderful life" on your shelf.
