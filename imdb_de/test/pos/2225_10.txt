I enjoy reading user comments as much as watching the movie! It seems that this is the classic either "Love it" or "Hate it". And I have to say that I'm not just on the "Love it" site, I'm also going to get it to say in my FAVORITES movie, EVER! Thank god I found it at all. Nearly impossible to find, I was lucky to record it in a late night UHF channel about ten years ago. Of course, my preference for sellers may make me a bit biased, but I can not see anyone with a corncob, dry humor (like me), not being in love with this strip. The storyline is great (but maybe, as a previous poster has already said, maybe that's why it's not a well-known movie ... upset the medical field?) Acting is great (I can see why some say that the acting was awful .. but that made this movie so great ... it's totally cheesy) and the humor is good. I am proud that I have seen this movie no less than 20 times and memorized pretty much every line. This movie is genius !!
