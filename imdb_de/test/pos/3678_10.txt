When I bought this movie for the first time, I had my doubts, though the cast was pretty impressive. But after seeing it, I really do not regret spending the money. In fact, I would always like to spend it on films like this ... An absurd combination of humor, drama, thrill and the big questions. That's what makes it a great movie. Okay, some do not like what they see, and some even turn it off after a while. Your loss. It's a wonderful way to deal with the problems we've all gone through in one way or another, and the characters you think you do not like about society throughout the movie turn out to be the ones to whom You really love after a short time. For anyone who is open minded and has a good sense of humor and life - I promise you will not disappoint this movie!
