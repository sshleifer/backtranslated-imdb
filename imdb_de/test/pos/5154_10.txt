I laughed out loud a number of times during this movie, even though I would glance at it, and you'd think it was something else altogether. I admire the pace and the way it burns slowly as you present these stunningly beautiful pictures. Andersson gives us something else here. Show us something I have not seen since his last movie. He is extraordinarily composing and through his method of fixing the camera and allowing action to take place before us, he opens the door to humanity and we see into a place that reflects our own lives, our little lives. It's powerful stuff. The simplicity with which he allows events creates the opposite sense of complexity. Everything in front of the camera is anything but easy. Andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. I believe that most of the scenes, if not all, are rebuilt from scratch according to his designs. I highly recommend this movie. For me, it brought me to a place and I came out after seeing a world that was frayed and beautiful, strengthened and hurt, barren and glorious. Alien and familiar at once. This movie is brilliant and life affirming. I know because I came smiling and felt wonderful. It took seven years to do this. If he was only shooting this one movie, he would still be with the big ones.
