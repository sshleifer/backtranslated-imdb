I do not know why critics call it bizarre and macabre. I really not dark-yes, bizarre - no. It is sad and with many emotions, especially with the story of penguin. They say it has elements of S & M, but I really do not find anything like this except Catwoman's Whip. <br /> <br /> This movie is deeper than its genre and villains are not just a few crazy freaks a masquerade They have strong motives with strong emotions. Catwoman (a great achievement from Michelle Pfeifer!) Is not just a sexy girl who likes to steel jewels - she's on her personal crusade and penguin ... well, at the end of the movie he's really sorry (strong performance from Danny DeVito). I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he wears his costume well. <br /> <br /> You can really tell that this is a Tim Burton movie because it has an unusual style and is very talented. But the music is fantastic and matches the emotions.
