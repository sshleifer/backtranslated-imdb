I first saw "Demon 2 Night" before I saw "Night of the Demons". Unfortunately, my old blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the sequel, but not the first one. Looney, what? Well, I think all horror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's, you know it's bad for you and you'd rather have The Cheesecake Facotory (or a more expensive restaurant you prefer), but you can not help but have the cheap stuff. <br /> <br /> Night of the Demons has it all: you innocent, sexy, follow the rules of chicka-dee, your black guy who surprisingly is not killed. You're a naughty girl, you're a drunk guy, you're a dark girl or a guy, the fool, the haunted settings of a haunted house, bad acting and a lot of unnecessary nudity. Is not that great? I mean, I know very well in my heart that this was pretty bad, but for horror movies a bad score. Horror fans should have fun and immerse themselves! <br /> <br /> 8/10
