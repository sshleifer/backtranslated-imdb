When I read the other comments here in the IMDB, I had very high expectations before seeing 'Angels of the Universe'. I was not disappointed, and if I gave the movie an 8, I would say that I can justify that note. <br /> <br /> The film has incredible acting, especially from the main character Pall. The supporting actors also do a very good job, such as the patients in the psychiatric ward, the parents and the siblings of Pall. Worth mentioning is also the music, which supports the film throughout, conveys depth and feeling. <br /> <br /> Although the film is very Scandinavian, it does not lack humor and has some kind of objective authorship of Pall's life. However, if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something light, this is not for you. It's a story about people with mental health problems, how to deal with them in society - but above all a story about Pall. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs. It's one of the best movies ever to leave Iceland, if not from Scandinavia.
