*Warning! Some spoilers! * <br /> <br /> Matt, a prolific writer, is actually just a boy in his behavior. He does not care about anyone except for his own needs and the consequences of his actions can not interest him any less. Just as he gets to know Nimi and her ties with her family and her community, he begins to feel that something is missing in his life. <br /> <br /> He realizes that he is indeed lonely and impersonal, structures that are just comfortable but lacking in heart and commitment. Nevertheless, he avoids any responsibility and hesitates to change his life. But will he be able to re-enter his old life and ignore the bonds he has already unconsciously formed? <br /> <br /> Nimi's situation is the opposite. She is pushed into the rules of her Nigerian community, her prejudices and her medieval values. As a single mother, her position is difficult and it gets even worse when she falls in love with Matt, a white devil (as the referendum would say), a man who can not commit himself. The women of the community are planning to marry her with the referendum to end her status and "give Sammy a name." But that would mean that Nimi gives up all independence and self-determination. But is there any alternative for her if she wants Sammy to be accepted and become a respected member of the community? <br /> <br /> This film has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with VERY sexy scenes from Matt and Nimi) and a loveable child who is eager to matchmaking, a beautiful landscape in vivid colors. Colin Firth (* swoon *) and Nia Long show great chemistry. It's just amazing to see her. And Fissy Roberts as Sammy is just a dream. You just want to adopt him. I just love how Sammy and Matthew talk to each other. They are at the same level in many ways. Especially when Sammy asks Matt about sex. This scene is absolutely adorable !! <br /> <br /> There is almost nothing to complain about .... wait! That is not true. One thing is not good: that the movie is not long enough! (Well, and maybe the referendum is too bad and too stupid to be convincing ...). <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, by all means!
