I've seen this movie, although I've never read the book, and took the characters at face value, but since I've already met them, I recently reviewed them. I got a completely different perspective from the movie. <br /> <br /> Without being focused on each character, learning their quirks and weaknesses, I was able to focus on the cultural issues set forth in the film. The farm families of Iowa are so closely linked to each other as in Indiana, where I grew up in the 40s and 50s, that I immediately recognized the backgrounds and motives of the characters. Perhaps for us, Jane Smiley meant looking beyond the superficiality into the world these people had to live in, but the viewers are so entangled in the Hollywood aura of individual actors that they miss a rich layout of a lifestyle less so exists and passes less than every decade. Another movie with these features is the "Bridges of Madison County". Look at both films again with a view of the whole picture.
