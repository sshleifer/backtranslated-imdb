Wow - most viewers seemed to shake the head of the documentary by sheer magic on screen. <br /> <br /> The shift from its beginnings as a New York-based Black-American phenomenon to Actual Days as a racially diverse subculture (and mostly on the West Coast) is well-marked. <br /> <br /> The modest turntable is not given the respect of a traditional musical instrument, but it can be much more versatile and versatile technically complex. These DJs use the skills required for each musical instrument - including skill, rhythm and timing - and apply it to a new technology with several other variables. <br /> <br /> DJ Qberts comment that he imagines "music". Must sound like on advanced planets and then it works, at first stupid, it makes more and more sense when you watch these guys spit out a lot of sounds that no conventional instrument could ever produce! <br /> <br /> Some critics have said that this movie focuses too much on certain "stars" and wastes an opportunity to profile the broader hip-hop culture. One movie at a time, people!
