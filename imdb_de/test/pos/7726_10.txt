Even for non-opera enthusiasts, Bizet's name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera about a gypsy girl whose capricious love destroys men. As much as opera is now considered a staple in every repertoire of an opera house, the true story of the wild gypsy girl created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845 has never been successful in this cinematic version of the gifted Spanish director Vicente Aranda ('Juana la Loca, too crazy for love ',' Amantes', 'if they tell you that I've fallen' etc.). The involvement of the author of the novel as the main character, who seeks the story of Carmen from one of her lover - José - provides exactly the right background for the story of this famous, wild Gypsy. <br /> <br /> Carmen (the incredibly beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory next to the military station where the real José (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is stationed. Carmen is stormy and in a fight instigated by a colleague at the factory who points out that Carmen is a Gypsy, Carmen murders her colleagues and gets arrested. José is physically attracted to the lush Carmen, and as Carmen flirts with him, he agrees to her escape - his repayment is the promise of a passionate night with Carmen. Carmen keeps her pact and gives José his first sexual encounter, and José is doomed to failure. His lack of military discipline causes him to lose his rank and be imprisoned for a while. Upon his release, Carmen meets Carmen again, kills an officer, and out of fear he runs into the mountains to live with the Smugglers and Gypsies of Carmen. There are many incidents to try the passionate connection between the lovers, but when Carmen's real husband is released from prison, destructive behaviors take over the behaviors, including Carmen's stupefaction and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of Carmen and José belong. <br /> <br /> One factor that makes the story so good (as adapted by the directors Aranda and Joaquim Jordà for the screen) is the role that Prosper Mérimée (Jay Benedict) plays: his interrogation by José completes that of Bizet The spectacle is great, the cinematography of Paco Femenia and the outstanding score of José Nieto contribute significantly to the success of this very good film, a must for lovers of the opera Carmen and a great action drama for the spectators, the historic one Admire pieces. We recommend. Grady harp
