Maybe this movie is a bit too long, but 45 years later it still has some charm. The lead roles seem to be more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. Gary Cooper might interest me less, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, especially with dark hair. The film is worth seeing for the minor cast: Flora Robson is fabulous as a mulatto servant. She is a black-faced white woman and may have a look of evil or a voodoo mistress. As a servant dwarf, Jerry Austin has a sexy role that makes you laugh despite some lengthy scenes. When it comes to scenes, Florence Bates steals most of her life as a dowager social lady. I did not understand the outcome of the railroad fight at the end of the film, and the last scene was a Hollywood filth. It's a strange feeling to realize that the movie title refers to a railway rather than a piece of luggage!
