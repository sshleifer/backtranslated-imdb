I was surprised that "Once More, My Darling" did not generate enough votes for "user rating" at the time. It's a "crazy" comedy that I've enjoyed many times over the years. The mission of Robert Montgomery brings him in very unlikely situations and he is exactly the man for this job. He remains throughout the film and also hysterically his trademark "dazed". Ann Blyth plays his precocious / eccentric pursuer, who enters into a relationship that does not exist. Her character is crazy enough to justify the unearned nickname "killer," but stays sweet and cuddly. <br /> <br /> Under the tide of "B" movies of the late 40s and 50s "Once More, My Darling" is an outstanding one. It is worth to look ....
