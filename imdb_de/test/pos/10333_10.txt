This movie was one of the best I have ever seen. Just recently I was reminded by something on TV about this movie. It came back to me like a dam was flooding. I've never been so touched by a movie as this one. After the movie was over, I could not stop crying for about 2 hours. No movie has ever moved me that way. I was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen it since, but I hope I can find a copy for sale so I can watch it anytime. If someone suggests watching this movie with them, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Peggy Fries
