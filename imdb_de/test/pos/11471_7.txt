I got a DVD from Public Enemies and expected it to be the 2009 version, but it was not - it was! Sure, it was not the best movie I've ever seen - not by any means - but, dammit, guys, it was worth more than 2.8 out of 10! When I saw this miserable review on IMDb, I wondered what I would get, but since the CD was in the player, I sat down to look at it. As other commentators have pointed out, Public Enemies is NOT a historical film - and I've noticed that unlike the 2009 version (which I've never seen before), IMDb does not categorize it as such. <br/> <br /> Come on, guys! It's a story based on some real people - that's all! If I wanted to have a history lesson, I would sit at this computer and read Wikipedia or something. Ma Barker (real name Arizona - or Arrie - Barker) was NEVER accused of a crime, and as other commentators have already pointed out, she probably never participated in her sons' activities. They sent them to the cinema when they "worked"! (I hope she was not as critical as some who have seen this movie!) <br /> <br /> Theresa Russell had the never-too-difficult task of representing a woman from the age of 17 up to her death at age of 52 years - of a young girl who ran from home to the mother of four Hoodlum sons. I think she did it pretty well. The naughty little smile she used in more than one scene was classic! OK, I agree with some critics that the direction of this movie was below average, and I sympathize with the actors about it. Theresa should have told the director to forget the topless recordings - they did not contribute to the story. Maybe some stars with a bigger name would have made some of their own expertise overcome the poor direction, while the second years were not so brave. Who knows? <br /> <br /> But although this was certainly not a block buster, it was worth more than 2.8 !! I have all of my DVDs in a personal database where I check them in BEFORE looking at the IMDb rating (though this sometimes leads to minor changes). I understand what I think is his own merit, rather than having a movie against others of the same genre, and I think that movie was entertaining enough to get 6.8. (Yes, I accept that such a practice depends more on my mood at the time, but does not apply to those who vote on IMDb?) However, you can imagine my surprise when I looked at IMDb and saw the wretched score, he got here. <br /> <br /> In the face of surprise, I decided to read some other comments hoping to understand the low rating, and found that they are quite polarized. I agreed with those who said that the film was worth seeing, and concluded that some people had a hard time. Well, since some were absolutely devastating, why should NOT YOU go out and make better movies? I'm looking forward to the gems they need to get out! On the other hand, if they can not do that, then why not just shut up?
