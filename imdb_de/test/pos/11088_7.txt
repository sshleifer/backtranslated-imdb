"The Falcon and the Snowman" is the story of two young men, a CIA employee and a drug dealer, who are disappointed with US foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. The events of the film are based on a true story. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn convince in the leading roles and develop interesting characterizations. The side cast also performs well, especially with a performance by David Suchet of Hercule Poirot, who is renowned as a seasoned Soviet agent. The film is generally effective in exposing, developing, and communicating its premise. Two boys have heard something they did not understand properly. However, it seems too long and awkward in places in the middle. The end, however, is tense, dazzling and effective. The soundtrack contains some catchy rock songs, but unfortunately also a repeated, mature synthesizer track, which does not fit into a spy story. There are other spy films worth more than "The Falcon and the Snowman," but it's still a decent movie.
