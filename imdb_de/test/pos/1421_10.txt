WARNING: MAY contain some minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> There is hardly anything bad to say about this film, except for one thing. <br /> <br /> YOU WILL NOT SEE MUCH MORE !! !! Then maybe because you have to be home in the morning or at 3 in the morning to see the Fox Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Pity, because this is another jewel of time lost, Clifton Webb takes his patented, sour, omniscient behavior, which he perfected as Lynn Belvedere ("Sitting Pretty" and sequels) and "Nature Boy" was. Actually, that's the way it is. Webb plays Robert Jordan as the host of a Sunday schooling program for children that loses audience, and the network breaks him off from having to do something about it or not. <br /> <br /> Part of The problem may be due to the fact that the married host has no children. <br /> <br /> BUMMER !!! But as such things happen, the local church pastor needs a leader for a recalcitrant troop of scouts and finds a willing victim ... ahhhh 'VOLUNTEER' ... in the host, so Jordan takes the position. > <br /> problem solved, RIGHT ??? <br /> <br /> WRONG !!! Since this is a movie, there are other issues. <br /> <br /> For example, it turns out that one of the scouts is the son of his boss at the TV station, which leads to a little friction; especially since the child is overweight, has asthma and has an attitude. <br /> <br /> And he is the more reasonable. <br /> <br /> There is also Cub Scout, Mike (George) Winslow), who likes to hang around and is the type of "stray puppy". <br /> <br /> The reason is that he does not have his own people, but is cared for by a relative who has no relationship. Not much time for him. <br /> <br /> It's things like these that make his job harder than expected. <br /> <br /> All in all, Webb gets more understanding for kids and not only saves his show, but learns a worthwhile lesson and eventually even takes on Mike. <br /> <br /> Still a great movie in all these years.
