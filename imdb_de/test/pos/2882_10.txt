I'll always consider Mr. Firth to be Dorian Gray when I turn 100. <br /> <br /> Perfectly played and directed. Oscar Wilde's Insight, Humor and Joke come to life with an unprecedented on TV absolute perfection. <br /> <br /> More proof that the BBC is more than capable of talent, which it does not always have in the money. <br /> <br /> A must for all Wild fans - and for everyone else. Inspired and perfected, each actor looked just right for the role and every shot was well done. <br /> <br /> In the end, I found that I loved every single character so much that no other film type movie had ever inspired. Take a look at this and try to see a different version. It's just not the same, right?
