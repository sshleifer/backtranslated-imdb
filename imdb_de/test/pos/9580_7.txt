... the opportunity to look at Ireland's past was invaluable. <br /> <br /> I had the advantage of seeing this with my mother from Cork and we talked and learned a lot from her about how things were back then. Things like Deasy and Co. were a Cork soft drink company; how rain could really destroy a crop; how in the past the farmers had to collect the harvest; how in women's halls the women and men really had to stand on opposite walls, before the men went forward and called the woman to dance; the bellows that kept the fire running; how priests wrote down the list of church donors and their donations, and a little bit about the currency at that time (which helped my father to show me a case in which the then amount, the shillings and the crowns (which were legal tender) England were also represented)). <br /> <br /> I did not pay much attention to how good the movie is, but I was very grateful that I had the opportunity to look back on a period that is Irish for some, but for others including some of our parents and grandparents, is just their childhood.
