Despite all comparisons with House of Frankenstein, this film outshines its predecessor and is one of the funniest monster movies in the Universal Monsters series, and unfortunately the last. OK. So it's not exactly what makes the Frankenstein Bride a classic revered by fans of all movies, but with a cast of Dracula, The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster (What? No Mummy?) You can not help but enjoy this feast! And unlike House of Frankenstein, the monsters in this movie interact much more with each other. This film also offers some unique storylines for both Dracula and the Wolfman, both of whom are Dr. Adleman go to heal their sufferings. While the wolfman actually finds a cure, Dracula injects his blood into the doctor and then the real fun begins! I highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. But remember, I never said it was good, just fun.
