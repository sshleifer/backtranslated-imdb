I do not see much wrong with this movie. Granted, the main singers may not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they may well carry a melody. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I love their songs, especially "The World Is A Circle", "The Things I Will Not Miss" and "Question Me An Answer". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is awful and that the snow-covered mountain ranges look like they're made of plastic. I disagree on both counts. I have seen powder snow before and the snow in these mountain scenes looked realistic to me. And most of all, in defense of this film, it is appropriate for a family audience (at least I remember it was like that when I saw it a few years ago on Christmas day). With all the outcry about sex and violence in the cinema Today I find It's refreshing that this movie deserves its G rating. And they do not say that nasty "F" word every ten minutes like some movies I've seen. Thank God. Although this movie may not be for everyone, it has a redeeming value and I give it ten out of ten possible points. This is my story and I stick with it.
