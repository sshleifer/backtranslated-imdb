Emanuele Crialese did a fantastic job with a movie that has been in the mind for years. It was Respiro (see comments and summary here in IMDb). Now he carries the great young talents he first had on the canvas into a dark void. A literal leap into dangerous waters. The topic is migration. In this case from Italy to the New World (the name of the film). A big thing, which it calls "The Golden Door" for its American release. <br /> <br /> The story of a family that leaves everything behind and risks the rest - that's their life for a dream. <br /> <br /> I hate spoiling the show with the story, so I'm going to spend a bit of time on the work that made Crialese and his whole team so outstanding. <br /> <br /> First of all, I decided on what he knows: sound direct as directly as possible. That is, the whole movie. The textures, the pain, the nuances of reality are always mixed with the smells, the heat or the cold, the sweat and the blood, the life and the death, as alive as in the real life. <br /> <br /> The creaking of bent metal and the grinding of wood, the infamous roar of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship's horns make this movie so interesting. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier. The symbolism of light is present from the first shot (again almost the very first shot of Respiro) and permeates the entire film with intimacy and horrible desperation. The muted tones and the very gray and sombre depictions of people who suffer from the cramped and dirty boat that they hope will fascinate. <br /> <br /> Light is used sparingly to spot almost every character in the dark. The beauty of each shot and scene is emphasized by the costumes and the perfectly chosen physical characteristics of the actors. <br /> <br /> Again, Vincenzo Amato is definitely for himself. He plays the father of two sons (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and are now nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always gives to his very complex figures. Charlotte Gainsbourg is so-so. I think she has never again achieved the perfection she has achieved in The Cement Garden and in her very first film: L'Effront√©e. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just that she seems a bit awkward in her role. <br /> <br /> The locations and sets are hard and captivating, they almost play an independent character. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most notable character is Filippo Pucillo, the dumb younger son. The contrast to his first role is complete here. Then he played a charged child as inexorable as everything around him. Now his character is all expression. And that's exactly what: no words at all. His eyes tell the whole story with sublime power. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is one of those films that is not very well received in the States. It is absolutely Italian in everything. It's so Italian that the language is usually one of the many dialects much older than Italian. In the US, this film may be a bit too much because of the topic for Americans. Anyone who remembers the story of his family when he arrived in the US will watch these films with awe. <br /> <br /> And again, the minimalism that comes with Crialese's ideas is over again scene in the water. Only this time it's from underwater photography to the air. <br /> <br /> All in all another great and very well-told story of this filmmaker, that only this year (2006) 6 prizes were collected and nominated for the Golden Film Lion. No small act!
