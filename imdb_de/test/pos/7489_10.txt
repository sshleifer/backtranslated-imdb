One good thing: this hidden treasure of a thriller is incredibly entertaining from start to finish. An example of low-budget filmmaking at its best: The author / director Skip Woods seems to use everything he could find (eg Lamborghini, supermodel, cow-phone) and an ear for dialogue, action and all other satire levels add his camera settings. <br/> <br/> Another good thing: This movie seems to be made for the DVD era, with several segments that have a larger history (similar to the work of Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez 'Desperado). Each "chapter" of the film features Thomas Jane's main character, who spent a day at home playing fast and memorable performances by Aaron Eckhart, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jeter and James LeGros and an unforgettable role by Paulina Porizkova. <br /> <br /> Even another good thing: Not a "good" thing, but incredibly shocking and unforgettable ... Anyone watching this movie will remember an important scene. As much as liberation will always be remembered for the terrible rape of Ned Beatty, Thursday will be a movie in which a woman forcibly rapes an indignant man. Unforgettable. <br /> <br /> BAD THING: The title makes people believe that it's somehow related to (or derived from) the "Friday" movie series with Ice Cube. GRADE: <br /> <br /> A +
