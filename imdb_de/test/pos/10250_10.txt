This film kept my interest from start to finish with a lot of laughter and real down to earth action of the entire cast. Glynn Turman (Preach Jackson) is the star of the picture playing the role of a wise guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girlfriend. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (Cochise Morris) was an outstanding athlete on Cooley H.S. and even won a scholarship at a famous college. There are scenes in this picture where the Chicago Police Department chases after all these boys in a Cadillac and a visit to the Lincoln Park Zoo with Monkey Mist being thrown around. The music is superb and there is great photography in the city of Chicago. Great movie, have fun.
