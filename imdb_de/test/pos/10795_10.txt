I've seen it a couple of times and I'm glued to it every time. It is very exciting and intense. To describe it sounds boring, but it's amazing. It's the kind of movie you do not have to miss, but if you soak it in, it will hang you for a long time. Now when I think about it, I do not even know what Stone was trying to see us. Only the story of Alan Green? I do not believe it was a look at ignorance, stupidity, selfishness and a guy who was losing his grip. Maybe he had more grip than the audience. I did not like Barry, but for some reason seemed worried about him. I was stunned why I could not get it out of my head at the end of the movie. I wish I could take a look into Olive Stone's mind for this one.
