Because it's late and my vocabulary is running out, I'll describe this movie as "beautiful and heartbreaking" and implore the forgiveness of those who complain of such stereotypes. Robin Tunney has done an amazing job showing a young woman in the clutches of Tourette syndrome. Her character was absolutely sincere and persuasive, and I will pursue her career everywhere because of this movie.
