Review is a wonderful thing. Much abusive when it first appeared (inspiring for the famous review "Me No Leica"), this predecessor of "Cabaret" can now be considered in comparison and is not half as bad. It is certainly not a classic, but it has its own idiosyncratic charm (the movie version of "Cabaret" follows this plot, while the stage version has slightly changed the storyline). Of course, one should resist the temptation to giggle when Laurence Harvey's Christopher Isherwood (the name of the original author, God knows what Isherwood thought of it) describes himself as "a confirmed bachelor" and Harvey is completely deficient in "hero" (he is virtually asexual) and Shelly Winters suspicious as Miss Landauer (the role that Marisa Berenson played in "Cabaret"), Julie Harris is an absolutely wonderful Sally (a wonderful piece of comic drama) Anton Diffring is first class as Fritz, the German Jew who loves Shelly's character. If "Cabaret" had never come along, you might wonder if this would ever have had the daylight again. That it was revived, is not a reason to celebrate, but is quite acceptable.
