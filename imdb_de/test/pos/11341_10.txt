Nice, emotional and subtle. I watch this movie in an art center with a smaller screen in a movie room with 95% of the seniors. I wish a bigger movie, like Lowes here, would show it. Great camera by Wong and Christopher Doyle. Since I understand Cantonese, it's much easier for me to understand the movie. As simple as the story is, many English-speaking viewers have not understood the whole story. Three old ladies next to me continue to knock and have no clues to the film. <br /> <br /> spoiler; You were surprised when I mentioned that Mr. Chow slept with Ms. Chen and they have a son. She went to Singapore and tried to tell him, but did not. <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> The translation of the movie title into Mandarin actually means flowery like a moment or a reminder. The phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memories that were inconsistent and short. The whole movie fit the title pretty well. Not to mention the flowery "Cheung Sam". <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was definitely the street corner in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun shines on the old and faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, really a poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of the familiarity of their relationship when I saw her standing against the wall, talking softly. I had a terrible grief when Mr. Chow said goodbye and wept Mrs. Chen on his shoulder ... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai! <br /> <br /> As much as I like this one, Chungking Express is still my favorite. However, I will also give a 10. As a reference, CTHD has only 7. <br /> <br /> If you love art, you will love this movie. Do not miss it.
