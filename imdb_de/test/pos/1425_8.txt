This movie was never intended for a big budget movie, but it was a sweet little picture that anyone could enjoy. It probably will not change your life, but it is definitely charming and engaging. Clifton Webb plays a Curmudgeon (who is certainly not new) who has a TV. His ratings are, however, and he worries about the cancellation. He decides that maybe he has too little contact with children - since he and his wife have no own. So he volunteers as Scoutmaster and regrets to have done this almost immediately! Remember, he is a Curmudgeon and does not like children very much. To make matters worse, one of the kids really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy. No matter how indifferent he is to the child, the child just wants to spend time with him! The kid is cute and steals the show almost by itself! <br /> <br /> What happens next, and the twists and turns of the movie are something you just have to figure out for yourself. Understand that this is a light, sweet, but not annoying movie you're likely to enjoy.
