My wife and children were and still are the best comedy series ever made on television. All of them should somehow be seen together in a comedy show. My wife and children were a comedy that the whole family could watch and that you do not get often do anything to show this comedy show again! 1 Damon Wayans should come back! I really want Damon Wayans to do another comedy like this, of course with the help of the entire Wayans family, excellent stuff! Sincerely, DezMo
