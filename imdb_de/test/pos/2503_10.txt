So well done. The photography, the sound, the music and the performances were the best. It's also an amusing story that puts a smile on your face with every scene - I loved it and I'm a 60-year-old heterosexual guy. Every character seemed to fit at a discount. It's the best performance I've seen from Ms. Capshaw - she has starred in more movies than I thought, but that was a wonderful performance. I suppose it's a plus to leave Spielberg behind, which allows a big budget and all the best that money can buy technically. Two of the actors now have their own successful TV shows - it's easy to see why. Tom Selleck does his usual good job.
