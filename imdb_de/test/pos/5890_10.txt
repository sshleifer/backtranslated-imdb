World War II veterans return home and find it difficult to adapt to civilian life. This great drama is expertly directed by Wyler and beautifully shot by the famous cinematographer Toland. Despite its almost three hours, it does not take a minute. The Sherwood script has very human characters and great dialogues. Andrews may have his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. Good are also Wright as a lovesick young woman, Mayo as Andrews trampy wife and the real veteran Russell as a man who has lost both hands. However, the best honors go to March and Loy as a long-married couple who face challenges and get to know each other again.
