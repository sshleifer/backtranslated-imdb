The comments of the previous user are indeed tough. One wonders if they have ever seen this beautiful, sweet movie. As for the director / director so evil ... well, that's just rude! For those who grew up in the eighties, it's an artful piece of nostalgia and a sweet story that's well played and produced. Irish filmmaking certainly has a lot of angry, angry people dealing with it, and the accompanying commentary from the spleen is proof of that. As humans we have the choice; give and moan about the people who actually go out and do things or do something themselves .. I know which one is easier ... do yourself a favor and watch this movie and watch how a short film is made ... She will not be disappointed
