I was fortunate enough to see The Last Stop here where I live at the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those who do not know, the Moving Pictures Film Festival is a tour of the Canadian-produced film in Canada). Just before the movie started, I was told that it was the world premiere and was about to receive an American distribution contract that added to my excitement. <br /> <br /> I'm a big horror movie fan. and yes, I also love the scream trilogy. When I found out that Rose McGowan was making an Art Ten Little Indians movie, I knew I would do something good. Rose McGowan was the actor / actor's biggest name throughout the festival. <br /> <br /> The best way I can describe without giving away too much of the plot is that it's not quite like Scream. And it is certainly worth seeing. It's in the middle of a blizzard (it was filmed in Vancouver, Canada, Canada, Canada) in a motel on the top of the mountain, which increases the tension. Rose McGowan plays a great performance as the girl next door (?!) Along with the rest of the cast. And what happens in the end, well, the only thing I'll say is that you'll never guess the end. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that North American mainstream cinemas will come because the only decent money maker is Rose McGowan. But if you get the chance to see it, I would recommend. And if it's worse, there are always videos. <br /> <br /> I gave him 9 out of 10 points.
