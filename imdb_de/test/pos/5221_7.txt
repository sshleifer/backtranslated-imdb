Father Hood is a fun story about an unwilling father who is definitely a HOOD! Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles, who is always on the lookout for the big "score" that puts him on an easy road. His wife died when he was in prison, and his two children were taken care of. When he "got out", did he think they were better off in nursing? He also had to collect his fortune. His daughter Kathleen Charles (wonderfully played by Sabrina Lloyd) breaks out of a foster family that abuses the children and misuses money that is believed to be spent on the children. She is chasing after her father; tells him how bad the place was and that her brother, Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall), "just a little 7-year-old kid," was transferred to the asylum she just broke out of and convinces her father Kidnapping The three start an adventure across the country, while Jack keeps telling himself he needs to get rid of the kids! Patrick Swayze is really good at this comedy. He plays a "hood" (probably a minor understatement to this criminal character) that resembles his Johnny Castle character of Dirty Dancing, except that Jack is appropriately funnier and more optimistic than Johnny Castle in this comedy. Swayze is funny and does rally pretty well! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer, a reporter who tries to find out the truth about the care system that becomes Sawyer's ally. Diane Ladd plays Rita, the side artist of Jack Charles.
