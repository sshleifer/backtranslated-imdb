The video begins with a scene from a horror movie in which a man proposes to his girlfriend. He begins to tell her that he is "different". With the full moon, he turns into a werewolf. Then he follows them through the forest and just before he attacks, we are taken to the inside of the cinema. In the theater are Michael and his girlfriend. She's too scared to watch any longer, so they go. When they leave the theater, he begins to tease them. ("It's just before midnight, something bad lurking in the dark ...") Michael sings and dances down the street with his girlfriend. This scene shows Michael's skills with the camera. Like many other artists, he never does his presence "consciously". As they pass the cemetery, the graves open ... As soon as they arrive in an alley, they are confronted with a horde of undead. Then we see the horrified face of Michael's girl. Who would not have a horrible look when their date turns into a zombie? Yes, he becomes one of the undead. (A very bright and shiny, though.) He and his other zombies then start with the most famous dance choreography of a music video. To tell you more would give away the end. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite music video ever! You do not want to miss it! I give a 10/10. (Yes, I know, you can see the curtains in the back of the stage, and the werewolf looks cheesy by today's standards.)
