Based on Khaled Hosseini's bestseller, the Kite Runner is a story about friendship, betrayal and the struggle for salvation. In Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion of 1979 and later in the days of Taliban rule, all elements are present for great drama, but under the direction of Marc Forster (Finding Neverland) the film lacks the painful effect that makes it an unforgettable experience, though entertaining , well played and occasionally moving. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed in Kabul in 1978, but filmed in Afghanistan because of the dangers in Kashgar (China) The film between two little boys is very real, although they are far apart in social and economic circumstances. The 12-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) lives in a distinguished environment with his wealthy and educated father Baba, played by the great Homayoun Ershadi, though his wealth seems somewhat inappropriate in one of the world's poorest countries. Although Baba is a loving father, he admits to Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), his friend and business associate that Amir is too soft and that "something is missing with this boy". The family has a servant, Ali (Nabi Tanha), who is responsive to all his needs and whose son Hassan (Ahmed Khan Mahmoodzada) is Amir's best friend. <br /> <br /> The two are not only separated by class, but also by ethnicity. Amir, an aspiring writer, belongs to the majority of Pashtuns, while Hassan is a Hazara, a minority sect (10% of the population). Although we learn little about their traditions or their social situation, they are connected by their love for hang-gliding, a popular sport in Kabul and the reading of Afghan folk stories by Amir with the illiterate Hassan. The annual kite flying competition for the boys is a big event in their lives and the CGI effects are breathtaking. The dragon strings are covered with glass particles and the winner is the one whose kite string can cut off the other kites in the sky. Hassan is the kite runner who has an uncanny ability to locate the fallen dragons and bring them to Amir as trophies. However, after Amir has won the important competition, a sad event will take place that will shape the rest of his life. Bullies, led by the elder Assef (Elham Ehsas), who later appears as a ruthless Taliban leader. Hassan attack because he is a Hazara and brutally rape him (out of the camera), while Amir is too scared to prevent this. Unable to face his alleged lack of courage (though one has to wonder what he could have done to help Hassan), guilt in his relationship with Hassan becomes the driving force, and their friendship becomes tense. In an incident, Amir throws pomegranates at Hassan as if to ask him to fight back and punish him for his passivity, but Hassan does not take the bait and remains loyal despite the cowardice of his friend. When Amir urges his father to dismiss the servants and accuses Hassan of having stolen his watch, Hassan admits the theft, even though he is innocent. At some point, the circumstances force Ali and Hassan to ignore the shame. As the Russians invade Afghanistan, Baba and Amir also flee to Pakistan and then to Fremont, California, where the story begins years later. <br /> <br /> Baba is forced to work at a petrol station and sell jewelry in an open-air market, while Amir (Abdul Salam Yusoufzai), who apparently goes through the movement of life, studies at the local community college completed. After he falls in love and marries Soraya (Atossa Leoni), the daughter of a Kabul general, Amir finally publishes his first novel A Season of Ashes. Things look very positive. When Amir receives a phone call from Rahim Khan inviting him to visit him in Pakistan, telling him, "There is a way to be well again," demands the specter of guilt that has affected him all his life pursued Amir to go home. Returning to Pakistan, he returns at great risk to Afghanistan, now controlled by the Taliban, to confront the demons of his past and discover a startling secret. The Kite Runner is a sensitive film that deals with the inner pains arising from the knowledge that you were not faithful to your best instincts, and offers the opportunity to move beyond shame to a new level of responsibility. Nor does it hide the pain caused by war and revolution in Afghanistan, a pain perhaps portrayed by the suffering of Hassan. Unfortunately, it reduces complex situations to the level of good and bad guys and distorts what has actually happened, and relieves the US, which has perpetrated covert operations within the country against the government, of any responsibility for the devastating war that killed one million and fatalities challenged millions more disabled. Although we are inspired by the outstanding children's actors and moved by the freedom of kite flying, The Kite Runner gives up its power as it tries to replace the story with a melodrama.
