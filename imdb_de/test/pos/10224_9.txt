I wish there was a category in which this was not horror. It just is not like that. Granted, it has terrible moments, but I do not think it's a horror movie. I will say that this movie could have been better. One million little things could have been changed to make it better. <br /> <br /> After I said, I love this movie. I am often sad that people misunderstand the whole meaning. It was always clear to me that this movie was about saying that things are not always what they seem. Sometimes 'evil' is not. <br /> <br /> Barker was at a con that I went to, and he talked a bit and then watched the movie. It was very interesting. Many things he wanted to bring into the film could not be, and the film cut out a piece that he believed was long lost. This was a chunk that helped illuminate Boone and his girlfriend, as well as some other details. <br /> <br /> I know that some people are disturbed, that they do not have any information about the whole breed in the background, but I always felt that the film was becoming more 'real'. I've read the novella, on which just as many comics based. Because of this, the movie always seemed to be a stage for the entire story. A much more engaging story that unfortunately never has a chance to live. <br /> <br /> Despite all the shortcomings that this film may have, I believe it has a lot to offer. The "monsters" are wonderful, very resourceful. While the drama is sometimes a bit stiff, there are some very quotable lines. Whenever I see it, I find something new. Hold and watch Boone's chest at the end. At one point Decker smothers him and shortly thereafter Boone falls onto a card table. He ends with a card on his chest. This card will remain there for a while after Lori has pulled out the knife. It stays there until Boone removes it casually. I love that. That was a nice little detail, I thought. Basically, I would like to say the following: If you are looking for a horror movie, do not look at it. If you believe that men can sometimes be more evil than anything we have ever dreamed. This is the movie for you. This is a film about how men destroy what they do not understand or fear.
