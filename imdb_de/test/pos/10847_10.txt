Both the book and the movie are great for themselves. They differ slightly, but this does not affect a great script and drama. The historic atmosphere, the young girl in search of love, the amazing background of the music hall and the journey into the lesbian world of London in the early 20th century make this film an extraordinary film. Andrew Davies, a screenwriter, is self-styled as he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are both great actresses and give the best to these parts. The rest of the cast is very good. If it were more than 10 out of 10, I would give it!
