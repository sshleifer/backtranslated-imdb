When The Thing hit the screens all over the place in 1982, it had a cold reception and very poor box office results and was almost doomed to failure in John Carpenter's career as a horror director. However, time has shown that "The Thing" was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the fault of the movie. Today, John Carpenter's "The Thing" has received the recognition it rightly deserves, and is regarded by many horror fans as a horror classic and not without reason as this new version of John W. Campbells jr. "Who's Considering Is Going There?" (Previously adapted as "The Thing from Another World") is closer to the original story and retains a pessimistic sense of anxiety and high doses of tension in a masterfully crafted study of paranoia. <br /> <br /> The plot of "The Thing" begins in the winter of 1982 at a US research station in the remote areas of the Antarctic as the crew members see a Norwegian helicopter approaching, the helicopter 's two obviously mad pilots attempting a husky Killing dogs entering the American base After the Norwegians were accidentally killed, the Americans try to figure out why they were insane, and soon they realize that the husky dog ​​the Norwegians hunted was not a normal dog, but a creature capable of imitating every living creature, and not only that, she is hungry. <br /> <br /> Direk Tor John Carpenter earned a place in history when he led the groundbreaking Slasher "Halloween" in 1978, where suspense and atmosphere were over the pile and shock. "The Thing" could be seen as a development of this style, because even though Carpenter uses the special effects of Rob Bottin (critically acclaimed as "repugnant" by his critics), the film focuses more on atmosphere and tension instead in the violent (and very well done) performances of blood. The sense of loneliness as well as the "bad karma" between the crew members reinforces the sense of paranoia, since anyone could be the thing, even our main character RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell), who ends up in a situation where nobody can trust. <br /> <br /> This plot was more faithful to the concept of the source novel and was obviously ignored by the previous version (not quite a bad thing, just a big difference), making this version feel less like a remake and more than a new conception of the source novel. Bill Lancaster's screenplay treats the characters with a brilliant domain and gives us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to fully trust them, which makes them an essential factor in the haunting feeling of the film going through the film. The mystery and the tension are greatest, because nobody can say who the thing is and who is normal, which increases the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results. <br /> <br /> The cast is very effective, and their overall performance is so effective that you can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real. Carpenter's regular colleague Kurt Russell as MacReady wears the film, and through his eyes we witness the madness and horror that the research station becomes when the situation worsens. Definitely one of his best services. Wilford Brimley is also Dr. Blair outstanding, a scientist who goes crazy after discovering the intentions of the cause. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" is a movie that has been made so wonderful that its flaws usually go unnoticed, even though they exist. Most notorious is the very restrained and sometimes inappropriate score of Ennio Morricone. It's not that bad, but in some scenes it just feels out of place and it's not one of the legendary composer's best works. Due to some mishaps with special effects, some scenes have been omitted that actually fill some small storylines, though nothing of great importance or annoying is actually. Speaking of John Carpenter's films, most people will almost immediately call "Halloween" his favorite movie, but personally, I would go with "The Thing," considering it to be Carpenter's biggest achievement so far, and one of the most interesting and the most frightening horror films ever made. I would go so far and call it one of the most beautiful films ever shot. 10/10
