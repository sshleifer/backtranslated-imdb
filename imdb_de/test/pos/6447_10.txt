I wandered through my local library and rummaged on VHS cassettes when I saw a movie that took me in my mouth - Waterbabies. I was hoping to see this movie again - I've seen it for over 22 years (cable movie channel at 78-79). I remembered a lot of details, especially Grimes. My son, who is 4 years old and I saw it. <br /> <br /> He agreed that Grimes was "not nice," and the best way to describe it was that he did not love Tom. He accepted that. It was amazing that I also remembered some of the songs! They had been stuck in my head for 22 years - which means they needed to have some memory, right? <br /> <br /> It is a good children's film with parental guidance for asking what children had to go through that were not nobility / society in a timely manner. This is what all the kids have every day (except a few lucky ones), and while we try to make Disney-mantled movies, making them more PC's for kids these days does not mean that cruelty did not exist - or even still not. I enjoyed the animation. It was not Disney, no. I do not think that Don Bluth touched a brush in this movie. <br /> <br /> But there is much to offer. David T plays two roles! (I really like him!) James M too. The water babies themselves are cute. I'm sorry for Tom and root for him. Then Billie herself is extraordinary in the role she plays - it's as if her eyes are magical! I'm a big fan of WoO, TLW & TW and Company (and looking for HP!), And I've put this together with these kind of films. Yes, he jumps in the water, but not because of suicide. He jumped because he trusted the woman in black - she had appeared to him all the time. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie! If you have children, pick up a loan copy. If you find a commercial copy, let me know where! Ian liked it! :) <br /> <br /> Dee
