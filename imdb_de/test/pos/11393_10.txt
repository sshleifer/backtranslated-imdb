Everything you need to know about pornography in the late '70s and early' 80s is summarized in Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS. Although the film is completely fictional, it is said to be based on the story of the porn king John Holmes. In Southern California in 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) works as a busboy in a nightclub. Regular customers include pornographer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and two of his starlets, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack and Eddie meet and Jack realizes that Eddie is fine ... a little ... talented. <br /> <br /> So Eddie plays in Jack's films under the pseudonym "Dirk Diggler". He becomes a "big" pornstar (no pun intended) and seems to be above everything. Then comes the '80s, when the video replaces the movie and Jack's porn empire collapses, along with Dirk Diggler and everyone else working in this area. <br /> <br /> BOOGIE NIGHTS is a really well filmed drama. There is a bit of violence, but P.T. Anderson makes it stylized. And it's a devastating approach to degrading pornography, especially when VHS became the standard medium for making porn. <br /> <br /> Many bizarre and unique characters are introduced. William H. Macy has an interesting role as someone who works on the films and whose wife has every sex. I especially liked Don Cheadle's role as Buck, the stereo seller. The best performance is that BOOGIE NIGHTS was definitely Burt Reynolds. A classic of the 90s!
