Fat Man and Little Boy were the codenames of the two atomic bombs that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshina in reverse order. How they came into being and got into American hands is the story of this film. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, the names are the codenames of two bombs operated on plutonium and uranium. Fat Man was the plutonium bomb and this was dropped on Nagasaki, and Little Boy was the one who was used on Hiroshima. <br /> <br /> The film is primarily a conflict between General Leslie R. Groves of the United States Army and physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under the direction of Groves. Conflicts were inevitable with two men with backgrounds as diverse as these. Paul Newman, a life-long disarmament activist, plays General Groves. In his opinion, Newman plays no man whose views he would have little in common as a caricature of any kind. Groves is first and foremost a military with a technical background. He wanted a combat squad, since trained military would naturally want in these biggest wars. However, due to his technical background, Groves managed the Manhattan Project, which was the trouble code. Well, Newman is determined to make his contribution to the war effort. <br /> <br /> Most of us learned Dwight Schultz from the A team as H.M. Murdoch the pilot who keeps the reality tough at best. If you were only familiar with the A-Team, you'd think Schultz had a big future in comic roles. <br/> <br/> Instead, Dwight Schultz is one of the best actors in the English-speaking world with an amazing range of dramatic parts since leaving this television series. J. Robert Oppenheimer was a complex man in life who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy. The challenge of the problem also fascinates him. Later, Oppenheimer got into a real mess because of his left-wing political views and his associates, who everyone knew entering the Manhattan Project. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller characters that stand out are Bonnie Bedelia as Ms. Oppenheimer, Natasha Richardson as Oppenheim's communist mistress, whose affair with Oppenheimer later got him into such a jackpot, and Laura Dern as Los Alamos' nurse , <br /> <br /> But best of all is John Cusack, who as Michael Merriman is made up of real scientists who might be called the first victims of the nuclear age. His scenes with Laura Dern, especially with what happens to him, have a real impact. <br /> <br /> The debate over the bombs as they are deployed is still a matter of angry debate. Fat Man And Little Boy presents the facts and lets you decide what would have happened if an alternative use of these factors had occurred.
