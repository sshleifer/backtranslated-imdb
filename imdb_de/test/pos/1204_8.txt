I saw this movie for the first time when I was four. I remember that I loved it and everything about it. Thirteen years later, I am now 17 years old, I decided about a month ago because I attend a class of 1960 at school. I did not really know what to expect, as I had not seen it for 13 years, but I was thrilled. The actors were fantastic, the music was so funny and I now sing along to every song. Treat Williams is great as Berger, the "leader" of the hippie group, who always gets what he wants in one way or another (except, of course, at the very end). John Savage is really very convincing as Claude, the Oklahoma supporter, who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is as beautiful as the rich and rich girl, who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just as adorable as Jeannie, the girl who is pregnant, but still as sweet and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good, because Woof and Hud, the other two members of the group, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud's fianc√©e, has an amazing voice. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this film, however, is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are barely shown together, and if they are, are they fighting (remember the skinny scene)? It seems that their relationship is very weak, and at the end of the movie, we should believe that they are in love immortally, just because of the few meetings they had. I also see that many people who write here are upset by the PG rating of this film. Personally, I would increase the rating to PG-13 just because there is some drug use ... but in 1979 it was not known that PG-13 did not exist. I do not think nudity is bad at all, it's not sexual at all (there's really no sex in this movie), and it's just to show the childlike innocence the group claims. Nudity is not considered a bad thing in most European countries, and I do not see why it is here in the US. Anyway, I appreciate this movie and I'm glad it was made then, because in the insanely "politically correct" world of today they would not even think about it, and if so, then it would be a very watered down version, and I am sure that you would not achieve the full effect. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a very underrated movie that is definitely worth it.
