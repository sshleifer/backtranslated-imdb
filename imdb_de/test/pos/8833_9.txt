I was part of the Space Odyssey cast and played FIDO in mission control. I just want to say that none of us actors, especially those in mission control, who had to respond to a green screen most of the time, had an idea of ​​how amazing it would be. I knew it would be good, if only because of the camaraderie and professionalism that Impossible Pictures' production team offered to everyone involved. But when we all saw it for the first time at the show at Curzon Mayfair, I was very proud. I was so happy that none of us looked like we were in Star Trek. Joe Aherne, the scriptwriter and director, is the most amazing man to work for. He pretty much brings together a good team and trusts that they do what they do best. I am really happy to have been part of this show. Anyone who knew something so epic and complicated would find it so tempting to watch. and my God, it's a beautiful universe out there.
