Pat Conroy's autobiographical book "The Water Is Wide" proves to be a kind of "Up The Down Staircase" from the South, but despite the formula in which teachers play against the odds, "Conrack" really moves the audience with every little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black children on an island off South Carolina) actually learn to learn, and their wide-eyed collective innocence is remarkably sweet. The only real actress (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the "hard nut" that Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze. But the story is not prepared for a happy ending, and I was not prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale. It is beautifully done. The script deviates from the course from time to time, but director Martin Ritt is very wise to always rely on Jon Voight's solid presence. Scenes like the one in which he drives around in his van and releases his frustrations through a speaker are not much, but the whole movie is full of episodes that trigger emotions, and the real end is their gain. ** 1/2 of ****
