Hello everyone! The best drama is now on Gospel Music Channel! Visit the website to see the schedule and find out which number is your cable or satellite. It has everything I want for a TV show, a clean, family-friendly drama that does not offend me. The story of a man who decides after losing his job for a great cross-country skiing adventure. Along the way they meet all sorts of interesting people and are in the midst of all kinds of difficulties. This show was originally a spin-off of Touched By An Angel, another really good family show. Make sure you try it!
