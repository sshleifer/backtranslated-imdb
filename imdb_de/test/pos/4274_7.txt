This show is really the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British guy, a guy who is nice at times, and a super cute woman. <br /> <br /> Of course it's different because there's a song, and there's dancing and acting (we just look a bit of acting. <br /> <br /> I gave this show a 7, because there are a few improvements that I know many people (including myself) would do if they were to work for the show.The first thing that really needs to be changed is deciding who goes home, I know that they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the power to decide who's coming home, there's really no sense in singing, the person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway, another thing What would Broadway be without acting? The last thing that needs to be changed is the song that the eliminated people sing in the end, the departed Danny always sings the same song and the off Divorced Sandy always sings the same song when they leave. As they sing every week, these songs get annoying. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm not a fan of the movie, Grease, but for some reason I'm addicted. This show is underrated. There are so many unforgettable gigs and moments.
