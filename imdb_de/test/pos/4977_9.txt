This is the classic western. The Good, Glenn Ford, the nimble hero, the ex-soldier, the man who would no longer hold a weapon. He finally has to get up the bad land baron Edward G. Robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants everything. Then there is Barbara Stanwyck, the real ruler of sleep. Edward G. Robinson's wife, who will not get in the way of anybody and even make Edward G. Robinson look weak. She is so angry that everyone else is blowing along with her blind ambition and ruthlessness to dominate the valley and everyone else. The gleam in her eyes as she sees people exposed to death for her is disturbing. It is worth to wait. Throw a young Brian Keith and a few others, and you have a drama that stands alone. With the required stampedes, shoot-outs, ambushes and close-ups of hard-boiled cowboys, you have a real Western experience.
