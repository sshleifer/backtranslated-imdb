HBO created this show to see the most realistic view of the prison, and they did a damn good job. Oz was created by the makers of Homicide who wanted to show a pure version of the prison. This show has spawned the idea of ​​all the other HBO original programs like The Sopranos, Sex and the City, The Wire, Arliss, Deadwood and Six Feet Under. Oz is the nickname for the Oswald State Penetentiary, a fictional prison in a US state that is never quoted (though accented, crime scenes, and the distribution of races is assumed to be NY). The main jail unit seen on the show is Emerald City, a seemingly ideal prison unit with more privileges than others, devised by a liberal unit manager named Tim McManus. Overall, this show shows what it really is like to survive in prison. <br /> <br /> On Oz, about 10 bands are shown. First, we have the Muslims, a group of black people who want to destroy the injustices of criminal justice and help improve the living conditions for black people everywhere. They are led by Kareem Said, a black militant minister, who wants to destroy all the racist in the justice system. As a group, they are not so much against white as against injustice. Our second group of blacks are the homeboys, who are essentially the blacks who want to maintain bad ghetto behavior and engage in drug trafficking. Her leadership varies mainly because she always loses members due to violence. In this group Simon Adebisi is a character who is acting in a terrible way. Adebisi is an African detainee who is basically the most frightening evil character. This gang as a whole is occasionally supported by the Irish and is in conflict with the Latinos and Sicilians when it comes to the distribution of drugs. Since Oz is mostly black, the homeboys have the most soldiers in a gang. <br /> <br /> The Latinos and Sicilians, like the Homeboys, have different tours of violent deaths that occur throughout the show. The Sicilians have pretty much the most fundamental say about how illegal activities are carried out in Oz. The Latinos announce their presence so they can at least sail well when they are not in control. However, unlike the homeboy, these gangs have less internal power struggles and are generally more stable when it comes to drug use. The Irish mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulative and serpentine Ryan O'Reily. O'Reily always manages to stay in good shape with all drug users, and he can manipulate things in his own way whenever he wants. They are not under illegal control but are in good shape with all who are. <br /> <br /> Among the whiter inmates we have the bikers and Aryans. The bikers are just a bunch of tattooed drug users who support the Aryans most of the time. The Aryans are the most hated and hateful gang for most of Oz's audience. They are led by Vern Schillinger, one of the most racist, sick, and sadistic characters you'll ever see. Both gangs do not control anything illegal. They only make the dark-skinned inmates aware that they pose a significant threat to anyone who thinks all white inmates are soft. We also have the others. The Others is a band of outsider inmates who are not necessarily a problem for other inmates. In this group we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life is forever being changed by the prison. We also see Augustus Hill, a black man tied to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who tells the show and introduces the audience to each inmate. The crimes of the character are shown as they are introduced, and Augustus lets us know how long they will stay in jail. Finally, the gangs include the Christians and gays. The Christians merely remain religious, so as not to become spiritual, and the gays are a bunch of crossdressers who are often raped by other inmates judicial system and is more explicit than any movie about the prison. Since the language is unprocessed, we have here more racial terms and bad words than in any other television program. Augustus Hill's comment offers us a great way to truly understand all the issues that Oz has to deal with. This show is as good as she is not at all for easy to mid heart. It explicitly shows drug use and distribution in every possible way, rape in prisons, killings, deadly bites, and general blood noise than anything others have ever seen. In my opinion this is the most influential and biggest show ever created, but at the same time I can see why other people are disturbed by this show. If you're into shows and movies about prison, Oz is a must.
