I loved the One Dark Night! It deserves a 10! As for a user's statement, the dead were indeed zombies in this movie. A dead person who is brought back to life IS a zombie, regardless of the method or cause why it is brought back to life. The "zombies" in this movie are designed to scare the girls, rather than eating them like traditional zombies. This movie is an absolute star among the horror movies of the 80s. The score and atmosphere are quite eerie and the audience is held in tense during the mausoleum scenes. The spectacle is really convincing, with real horror at the sight of the undead. Although I like all zombie jumps, this movie is a refreshing change from the typical carnivorous zombie movie.
