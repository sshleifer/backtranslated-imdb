The short film that brought Gaspar Noe on to the movie ticket introduced us to the terrible but interesting character The Butcher, brilliantly played by Phillipe Nahon. Noe's direction here has all the hallmarks of his later films, which show that he carved his own voice and his own style right from the start. His sudden cutting along with hard, loud noises, skipping flashbacks and many other techniques are all used to disturb the viewer. And it definitely works. He is not afraid of violence, as viewers of Irreversible will know. Here the violence is just as strong and in the sequel to Seul Contre Tous it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a horse killed. It is shot in the head and we watch it writhe on the ground and its pool of blood flows out. Then we see a human birth in all its bloody glory, the daughter of The Butcher. He was orphaned during World War II and grew up with the hatred of the world and all and everything in it. He serves his customers, but his inner monologue keeps reminding us of his thoughts - he wants them all dead. Only his daughter Blandine Lenoir, who would repeat her role six years later, is the only one he cares about, and we see them getting older together. However, it is dumb and the subject of bullying and gambling. The butcher's relationship to her is almost incestuous, she bathes her when she's old enough to do it herself, etc., but this will be explored in the next movie. When she is attacked by a man, the butcher explodes with rage and stabs an innocent man in the mouth. He goes to jail, taken from the only things he wants - his shop and his daughter. In the short 40 minutes we see all this and more, his time in prison and his release into his world. I think because of the condition of his daughter, who is also autistic, she is boring, does nothing but stare and is under the full control of her father. The film continues in the exceptionally gloomy Seul Contre Tous. If you can, have a look at these two films first. It does have some really great acting, but is hard to see because of the relentless tone. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 points
