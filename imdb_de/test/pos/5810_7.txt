Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time is set in rural England on Woodstock Farm, where up-and-coming musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with actress, Ms. Mary (Prunella Gee) and is currently composing music for a horror movie. Looking for his dog, Billy David finds a mysterious woman in his barn called Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn) one night. She claims to be a witch who has moved from 300 years to today. Obviously, it's rather skeptical that David finds it hard to believe her, so he locks her up in a room in his farmhouse and calls his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to examine her. As soon as he arrives, they enter Lucinda. Charles thinks David was drunk too much, but over the next few days, David & Mary are going through strange and disturbing things ... <br /> <br /> Witching Time was Episode 1 from the UK's short-lived horror series Originally released in September 1980 here in the UK by Hammer Studios for TV & was the first of two Hammer House of horror episodes directed by Don Leaver (episode 13 The Mark of Satan is the other). Because the Hammer House of Horror series dealt with a variety of topics, and all were unrelated except in the name and not surprisingly, the game "Watch Time" is an eerie and effective little fairy tale about a witch. The script of Anthony Read benefits from its short duration of 50 minutes & moves at a good pace. The characters are pretty good, as well as the dialogue, there are some nice scenes here & I liked the way it's never clear whether David & Mary go crazy or not. I think it's a well-structured, entertaining and somewhat spooky horror movie TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought. <br /> <br /> Made for British TV meant a lower budget than usual for the guys from Hammer. If that was possible, there are no splendid backdrops here, as in their most famous Frankenstein & Dracula films, too when the contemporary English setting gives it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a little bit more. Another limitation on television is that the exploitation level is lower than you might hope, there's some nudity and gore, but not much, although I did not mind, since the story here is pretty good. It's well done for what it is & Hammer's experience in her feature films has probably helped make them look pretty good, the acting style is good, with genre-favorite Ian McCulloch doing a bit of a parting. <br /> <br /> Witching Time is a great start to the Hammer House of Horror series. As a 50-minute piece of British television, it's damn good. Why are not they doing such shows here anymore?
