This movie was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I personally know most of the owners of the different locations that were used in the movie. As a teenager, I worked with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car in the fields around the remote road that was later screened in the movie. I was told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are from NC. I was fortunate enough to see it at a local exhibition. This show was one of the people who helped pick locations and props, such as the bus used in the movie (1938 Greyhound). The bus had no reverse. During the shoot, the driver missed his breakpoint a few times and had to cover a few kilometers to return to the correct point. These details of the technical issues have contributed to my pleasure. The film shows life in this area during the Second World War exactly. A well made film and I am looking forward to the DVD availability.
