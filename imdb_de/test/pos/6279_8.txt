This is something I have never seen before. I had to collapse all the time, I do not think there was a scene I did not laugh about. It's about a girl from the country in the south who goes to college in a big city. At school, she makes friends with the RA on the other side of the hall. When she realizes that he has no family for Thanksgiving, she invites him to come home with her. Rabecca and her family and her serious friend all go out for dinner one evening and Becca realizes what her boyfriend is going to do ... Suggest. She asks Cral to do something to get him up and screaming ... I'm sorry, but you're too late. I've already asked Becca to marry at school a few weeks ago. It all becomes chaos. Please look at this classic, it is absolutely worth it ... I swear it.
