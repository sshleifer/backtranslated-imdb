This is an excellent Anderson production that is worth comparing to the best episodes of UFO or SPACE 1999 (first series). Of course, it's not SFX extravaganza or Star Wars Pseudo Mystic Tripe Fest, but a subtle slow-paced movie that still conveys the creepy, weird, and weird atmosphere of the best Anderson productions: science-fiction Lynn Loring's voice is absolutely VALUE. SFX are good for this type of product and also the action is good. Two astronauts visit a planet on the other side of the sun, but instead they go home ... or do they? Ah, videophones! Now and then the next "everyman's gadget in the next decade", but still 40 years later. The device of Earth's double planet on the opposite side of the Sun also returns to Gamera tai daiakuju Giron (1969). So who copied who?
