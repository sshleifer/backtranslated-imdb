I recorded this movie on The Horror Channel and was pretty impressed with the gothic atmosphere and the sound of the movie. As a big fan of all things to do with vampire, I'm always excited to see a new variation of the vampire myth, in this case a ghoul-like creature living in a different Lovecraftian dimension. The director has done a brilliant job to convey the subject's dark mood and the decadent art scene as the backdrop to what is essentially a story of love that encompasses time and space - the pure love of friendship as opposed to bloodlust and life from the vampires in the story. The characters in the story are brought to another dimension by a substance that changes the mind, in which a shape-changing vampire creature seems to fulfill their heart's desires as they are withdrawn from their life essence. There are some analogies to drug addiction and loss of control and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I enjoyed seeing the two main characters of the story, Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich, who were very attractive guys and always a plus in a vampire story for the female audience! The make-up and creature special effects were done well, and the stage design of the vampire dimension was very effective. All in all a pleasant version of the myths of the vampires, recommended to anyone who loves his vampires with intelligence, not just action. The only thing missing to make it even better would have been a bit more erotic and nudity, as it fits action and themes.
