In the DVD era, you'd think you could find just about any crap that's dedicated to the celluloid, and for the most part, it's true. WHY, WHY is it so hard to find this great little movie, which is clearly made by people who love Noir as a loving homage (that never crashes into Parody's Land) of the most cinematic genres. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are a bitch in this and Superstar-in-the-Making production Carla Gugino (KAREN SISCO, SIN CITY) is now performing her as a "red hot babe" / great show. <br /> <br /> This movie really has everything for fans of the movie. A b noir of steroids, the clever and steaming JUDAS KISS is successful in every way. <br /> <br /> Please Columbia TriStar PLEASE post it soon on DVD !!!!!!
