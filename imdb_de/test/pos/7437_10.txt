I can not believe how perfect this movie is. Great CG graphics, good story and the fights, oh the fights !!! This movie was great !! The characters. They look real enough to be considered genuine. They definitely resemble those of the game perfectly. The scene where ... well, all the scenes, dropped my jaw. Fantastic 10/10 graphics The story. Perfectly explained. In addition, Aeris helps the cloud at many different times in the movie. They explain it very well and let your jaw drop as perfect as it is. But the repetitive battles take out some stories, but that's just a small thing. History 9.5 / 10 Everything else, great. The movie was just amazing. I really do not know what I can say more, except that this movie was pretty perfect. I LOVED IT!!!
