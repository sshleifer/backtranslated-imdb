I have to admit, I liked this movie and I did not think it was misogynistic. There might be subtitles, three views on LiV Tyler. Three different men are owned by the same woman and tell their stories of very different characters: A man (John Goodman) tells his story to a priest (the very funny Richard Jenkins). For Goodman's character, the character of Liv Tyler is an idealized character Saint, the second coming of his holy wife Theresa. For Paul Riesers (who tells a shrinking story (a subtle, unobtrusive performance by the great Reba Mcintire), the Liv Tyler character is simply an object of (confused) sexual fantasy, as Matt Dillon's rather weakened draftsman tells a sloppy hit man, played by Micheal Douglas, the HIS side of the story All three tales of obsession are narrated simultaneously, and all are amusing I will not betray.
