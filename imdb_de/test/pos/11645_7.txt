Before I see this movie, I suggest that the viewer refuses all expectations that the victims of the depicted crimes are treated the same as perpetrators and taken into account. There were many films about victims of crime. This is about the murderer. <br /> <br /> "Dead Man Walking" finds realism in the simplicity of the story: there are no crack lawyers who save William Poncelet, and no dramatic storytelling. The film does not try to put it in a good light; he is guilty, he is repulsive, racist and responsible for terrible murders. In all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: regard him as a human being despite his crimes. In this way, the film questions the view that the death penalty creates "justice". Regardless of whether you are for or against the death penalty, the film raises the question of whether guilty people can find salvation, injustice in the judiciary, and the appropriateness of the death penalty. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Especially the last moments of the film show the true depth of Penn's abilities.
