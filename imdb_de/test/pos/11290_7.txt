Although it does not matter to the film, this is a myth of creation. God (a crippled, bloody figure in a chair) cuts his organs with a razor and dies in his own filth. Mother Earth rises from his corpse, impregnates himself with his seed and gives birth to man. However, it is highly unlikely that you will find out about it without first reading a summary, and it is not particularly important to the movie you are making, as this is more of a surrealist art-house picture thing, all in Inky, processed black and black white. A stark, dark atmosphere is created by the stark photography and minimal sounds (mostly dripping with water, moaning, scratching, etc.), but each scene takes a bit too long and the film as a whole. As a short film, this could have been great, and the god who kills his scene was excellent and very scary, especially because he's the first thing you see, but it's hard to be patient when it lasts and so long you do not even know what you see most of the time. <br /> <br /> A good movie for the original style, images, atmosphere and content.
