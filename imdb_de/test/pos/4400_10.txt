After seeing most of the earlier Coen Brothers movies, I expected something different and slightly out of the middle of the picture. Obwat is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as ... well ... as big as Mississippi. It's one of the simplest movies that has come out lately, smart, well-made, smart and well played. <br /> <br /> Characters are shown by a group of wonderful actors in their countless shades. George Clooney has completely won me over with his Clark Gable look and character. I've only ever seen him in Three Kings and his cameo series "Thin Red Line" and am now a fan. More comedy please George. <br /> <br /> John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson are cleverly helping, especially Nelson. Of course, if "The Simpsons" is turned into a movie, then he must be Cletus, the slack yoke. I do not think there is a performance that is not too big of the whole cast. My special favorite is Stephen Root as a blind radio station. <br /> <br /> Great old music, a jiggy-style dance by Clooney that I'm trying to learn, and a sense of depression in the US south that's being amplified by the US Sepia-style photography makes this movie best movie I've seen so far in this century. The only drawback of the movie is that it almost got me to buy the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to play on ... it's so good! <br /> <br />
