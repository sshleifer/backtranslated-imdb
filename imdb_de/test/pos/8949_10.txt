This movie is one of the funniest I've seen in years. A movie that deals with death and burials without being depressing or disrespectful. Christopher Walken provided much of the comedy in this enchanting romance and I could barely breathe because I had laughed so hard. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie as a preview, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded, but cheered. I tell all my friends to pay attention to the arrival in the US. I definitely plan to see it in the theater again and buy it on DVD as it becomes available.
