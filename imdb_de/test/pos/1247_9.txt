This, in my opinion, is one of Bruce's most underrated films. It's a stunning, heartwarming movie with a great story and an amazing performance by Bruce Willis! All the characters are great and I thought Willis and Spencer Breslin were great together, and Bruce Willis is just great! This is definitely one of Bruce's best comedic performances (The Waaaaaaaaamabulance thing was great), and I found that she was well written and well done, plus the finale is especially cool! It's good-natured and it was cool to see how Russell's (Willis) character changed during the movie! and the end was pretty good. I think it should be higher than 6.0 and it's one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen! Besides, it has many surprising moments. All characters are extremely likable and it also has a cute love story angle, besides, Bruce and Spencer Breslin have some really funny lines (Holy Smokes!). This, in my opinion, is one of Bruce's most underrated films. It's a great, heartwarming movie with a great story and an amazing performance by Bruce Willis. I say, it is a must! The direction is great! Jon Turteltaub does an excellent job here, with really good camera work and a very fast pace. The spectacle is excellent! Bruce Willis is amazing as always and here he is amazing, he is one of his best comedic performances, is weird and had a wonderful chemistry with both Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer The main reasons why I liked this movie so much! (Willis rules !!!!!!!). Spencer Breslin is awesome as the younger version of Russell, he was very funny and did not annoy me, he's one of the better kid actors out there. Emily Mortimer is good as Amy and was really cute. I liked her, she also had decent chemistry with Bruce. Lily Tomlin is funny because Janet thought she was pretty good. Jean Smart is good with what she had to do, which was not much. The rest of the cast is doing well. All in all a must! **** from pf 5
