A film about the relationship between a man and a leopard that is very reminiscent of "The English Patient," to a scene in which Ralph Fiennes' figure carries his lover's body over a desert rock cliff. In "A Passion in the Desert," the main character wears the body of the leopard over a cliff in the desert, but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the movie is not perfect, but no less enjoyable. The last shot will haunt me for weeks. (8 out of 10)
