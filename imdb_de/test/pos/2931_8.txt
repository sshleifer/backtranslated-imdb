America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately I've been bored. <br /> <br /> Cycle 1: Yes, I am glad that Adrienne has won the beginning. <br /> <br /> Cycle 2: It's too bad, I think Mercedes deserves it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 3: I did not like Eva, but I did not like most girls in this cycle. <br /> <br /> Cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. I do not know what they saw in Naima, but I definitely know what they saw in Kahlen. <br /> <br /> Cycle 5: Like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle. but of all the girls, NICOLE as the winner? eww! <br /> <br /> Cycle 6: I liked Sara and Joanie, but Danielle is okay, too. <br /> <br /> Cycle 7: Caridee definitely deserves it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 8: no, I did not want Jaslene to win. I did not like her. I've definitely seen more girls in this cycle with more potential than she, though I have not seen much of this cycle. <br /> <br /> Good show, I've just seen it too often to like it even more: D
