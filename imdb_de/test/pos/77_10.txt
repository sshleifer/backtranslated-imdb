Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson while working for Germany. <br /> <br /> The songs are beautiful. The two are well paired. Julie shows a more spirited side in this film than the nice girl she usually plays. <br /> <br /> A half-German, half-English girl, who sings beautifully in the First World War and entertains the troops, sings Julie some lovable Mancini songs. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie. Some will say that it is a "chick movie", but something like that. It is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Supporting characters are a bit stereotypical. It may not be due to Rock's performance in Pillow Talk, Magnificent Obsession or Giant. Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland, and the film used authentic WW I aircraft. Scenery for England and France is absolutely great.
