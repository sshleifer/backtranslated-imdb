The Captain and Tennille have released a very good 3-DVD package with minimal editing. Unlike most Variety releases, these shows were not hacked to pieces. The music and dance numbers are included in the delivery as with the first broadcast. I suspect that some music numbers on the DVD were processed into shows in which they did not originally appear but could not confirm this suspicion. I noticed some inconsistencies between the information on the DVD and program information I found on the internet. I could not check if the net information was inaccurate or if the musical performances were included in the shows on the DVD. Whatever the truth, I am very grateful for the efforts of the production company. I wish every variety show would show the same respect for the format. I would guess that about half of the broadcast shows is included. I think they had problems in the shows that were not included. Hopefully these issues can be resolved and a Volume 2 can be released in the future. Among the extras there are some individual music videos as well as a dance rehearsal. I recommend this DVD to every C & T fan.
