This was the first directorial work by Sebastian Gutierrez, author of Snakes on a Plane and Gothika. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love capers, and that was an idiot. An abduction and a woman shot dead. The FBI has kidnapped Emma Thompson and the police chief (Roscoe Lee Browne) has charged Alan Rickman with the solution to the murder that happens to be a Senator's wife (Hal Holbrook). These two are a great couple when working together. <br /> <br /> The kidnappers / killers have the lovers Simon Baker (Land of the Dead) and the ultra hot Carla Gugino (Sin City) along with a few partners. They have kidnapped a computer mogul and lead his accountant around the city before they get the dough. From then on things are moving fast as new twists and turns are introduced. The whole thing is brilliant and definitely a "piss in the pants because you can not go to the bathroom or you miss something" thrill ". <br /> <To be honest, I would have given this movie a 10, if the guard had seen more film in the opening, I would have liked to have seen more of Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but that was not part of the capers, just icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Thompson and Rickman should definitely have more movies together A treat: <br /> <br /> Agent Hawkins: So, please bring me in. Detective Friedman: That remark could be misinterpreted as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins Agent Hawkins: Let's get rid of it : You've never worked under a female supervisor, I'm where I am, pushing papers and playing nice games, I've never fired a gun before, I have a decent head, so I've been commanded by all worthy candidates all men, all equally talented, but there was a gender quota to fill. I am also stupid and idealistic; You are hard and cynical and usually right. I'm secretly in love with you, but it's hard to show. Did I skip something? <br /> <br /> Damn, that's a great dialogue! Gutierrez not only conducts a great movie, he can also write! <br /> <br /> And did I say that Carla Gugino was hot? <br /> <br /> Put this on your list.
