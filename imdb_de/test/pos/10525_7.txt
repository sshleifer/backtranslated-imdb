This interesting, lost movie (written by Terence Malick) shows Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest as two crazy, southern brothers looking for a seafood restaurant. Margot Kidder was never prettier and Forrest should have been nominated. Originally called The Dion Brothers, this carefree movie is a pure joy with a violent ending! <br /> <br /> Where is this movie? I have been looking for it for 30 years. Keach was still great then and I'm surprised that there is no cult anymore (maybe). These guys are a blast with more ambition than mind, but totally lovable guys! A 7 out of 10 points. If you can dig it up somewhere, you will have fun.
