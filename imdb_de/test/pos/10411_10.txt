One reason why they call the 80s "The Awesome 80's" is quality television. Shows such as Wonder Years, War of the Worlds, V, Amazing Stories and many more have always left an impression on every "happy" person of ours that over time he will always find a way to reawaken. Finally, monsters come here! A very own series and a theme that is completely dedicated to the monsters. May it be the good, the bad and the morbid. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of classic shows or the fascination of horror movies, then this one is for you. Provided you can find this rare gem. <br /> <br /> Even the newer generations will be impressed by the episode with its horror, the indiscriminate use of Gore effects or their story-telling power and simplicity. I guarantee, because I'm 23. <br /> <br /> DO NOT miss this! <br /> <br /> Although this is a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember ...
