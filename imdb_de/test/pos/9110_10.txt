This movie rocks ... so hard ... <br /> <br /> The cameos ... the drug references ... sharing ... the love ... the ROCKING !!! Years ago, when Jack and Kyle first met in Tim Robbins's "Actors' Gang" theater group, who knew that such a legacy would be followed by great music and serenity? All the house-to-house seesawing has paid off ... <br /> <br /> Although everyone who loves classic rock will get a big kick out of this movie, I would definitely recommend keeping the original 6 HBO Rent episodes in your local video library before you see the movie in the cinema. You are on the Tenacious D Masterworks DVD, which is available for rent in almost every video store. There are some insider jokes in the movie that relate to these earlier episodes and will make the overall experience a little more enjoyable ...
