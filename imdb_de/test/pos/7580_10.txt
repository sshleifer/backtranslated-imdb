I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story and involve people in just seven minutes. I think you do not want to end a good movie. Eric has done a great job developing the character of the microbe and making it "human". Loved the music and the voice for the microbe. I'm looking forward to seeing what Eric has in store for us in future films. This is a movie I did not want to end. Well done.
