I recorded The Morrison Murders on the Lifetime Movie Network and saw the Morrison Murders in Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network and Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett have played Luke and Walker Morrison in a great way. I'm glad Walker got his brother Luke to murder his parents and brother Bobby. I like to watch real stories in Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network and Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. The next time The Morrison Murders plays Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork, or Courttv, I'll see The Morrrison Murders again, as my favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders. I give The Morrison Murders a Ten because it's a good movie about Walker trying to figure out who killed his parents and brother Bobby. In the end, Walker discovers that it was his brother Luke who murdered his parents and brother Bobby.
