Now Throw Momma from the train was not a great comedy, but it's a lot of fun and makes you laugh. The title may seem a bit strange, but the entire movie is not literal, though it's something weird. <br/> <br /> Danny De Vito basically wants to kill his presumptuous mother and move forward a bit, finding some random and fun events to take place. The premise is pretty funny and the things that Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito got into were great. Some scenes did not seem to suit me, but that did not make him a bad movie. <br /> <br /> For what it is, a crazy comedy, it pulls it off well and should be seen once only to say that you have seen it.
