It's the twenties. And a man named Walt Disney had a mission: to satisfy families and children around the world with one thing: entertainment. What has he done? He did cartoons! Whoo !!!!! And he created a character that is as good as a mouse ... Mickey Mouse. Haha! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> Two films were designed by Mr. Disney himself: "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie". This review focuses on the 1928 Steamboat Willie feature. <br /> <br /> Ever since I learned about this movie as a kid, I always wanted to see this movie. Well, I rented an old VHS in 1997, where many old Disney cartoons were, with the mouse !!!!! Mickey Mouse !!!!! And guess what? This short film was there and I loved it !!!!! Shortly after I withdrew the tape, it was played early Saturday morning on the old Disney channel (Note: "Age" Disney Channel). That paved the way for more great Disney stuff from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 stars in fact !!!!!
