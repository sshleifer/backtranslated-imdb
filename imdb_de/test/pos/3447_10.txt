I have seen some of Mr. Boorman's films and did not like them. Not that they are bad movies, on the contrary are good movies, but not the content that I find personally entertaining. Still, I think that Where the Heart, though intended for the less art-interested American public, is masterly as a satire and as a social commentary of the time in which it was made. I had to replace this film in my collection at least half a dozen times, because every time I lend it to someone I know that he can appreciate the artistry on all levels, my copy does not come to my house, lol , The last time it took 7 years for it to be replaced, as it was no longer available for the sale of VHS. It was never made as a DVD I know, and had to wait until one of the premium cable channels ran before I could record again. <br /> <br /> My favorite aspect after the nail-on-the-head -Social commentary are the paintings by Timna Woollard. I've been looking for 15 years to find someone or anywhere who could lead me to where their work is for sale. Or better still a copy of the pictures in the film, without the end credits ends. I have a room in my house where I have copies of their pictures, and no-one seems to know if it's ever been published as a coffee table book or video aquarium, or as a documentary of their work. If anyone knows where to buy a copy of Timna's work or where her studio is in England, please do not hesitate to contact me via email.
