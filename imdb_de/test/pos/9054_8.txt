Hick Trek is clearly a movie that is jealous even at the El Mariachi level ($ 7,000). Nevertheless, developers are able to achieve decent effects (often due to great editing), such as beaming, the situations on board the cat's sail, and the unique way in which Slim T. Jerk communicates with his ship, without one conventional communication device. <br /> <br /> The drama has its rough edges, but the performance of "Horns" McBoy is excellent and Fluffy is certainly not too hard on the eyes. <br /> <br /> I wish the film had been longer than its approximate hour - and that should be understood as a compliment. This film is a success due to the sincerity and hard work of those involved.
