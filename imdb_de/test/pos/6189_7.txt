Sleeper Cell tries to swim both sides of the pool (terrorism / patriotic Muslim Americans), and neither does it very well. <br /> <br /> I had been hesitant to watch this show for a long time because I had one. The feeling would be too predictable, but after a year in my Netflix queue, I finally pushed it forward. <br /> <br /> The show is about a covert Muslim man who works for the FBI and tries to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The covert agent on the show is actually a Muslim, so we see his conflict / solution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs. Personally, I would have preferred to watch a drama about a US based American American family, but it is doubtful that an American television station (cable or network) will ever produce anything that shows Muslims in a flattering light. <br /> <I am not a Muslim but I have many Muslim American friends and I can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love America. <br /> <br /> Sleeper Cell is about to collapse stereotypes of Muslims, but it also focuses on the worse Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode, we see an "honor kill," which is a very poor portrayal of Islam, but in the third episode, we see a very respected moderate Muslim scholar teaching the audience that true jihad is actually a personal struggle it does not mean violence against others. <br /> <br /> If only the moderate Muslim scholar had been the main character of the show. <br /> <br /> Americans need to learn a lot more about Islam, that helps Sleeper Cell a bit, but it's far from giving the US audience what it really needs to know. <br /> <br /> That said, the drama on this show is superb and the drama is extremely captivating. If only they had done this show about Islam in America without terrorism, it would have been top notch.
