Every Saturday morning at 11 o'clock I saw superstars. All major events took place at this time in this show. The challenge that aired on Sunday morning was also decent, but all the big stuff happened on this show. Wrestlers would all run interviews with Mean Gene on a platform next to the live crowd, or talk on their own screen against a backdrop that spurred them on. The fights were usually squashes, but sometimes you saw two middle carders in the main event. There were also interview shows, which usually led to violence and thus set up a feud. These segments ranged from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Salon and The Barber Shop. I can not remember that titles on this show have changed hands. This usually happened at pay-per-views and Saturday nights main event.
