I highly recommend this movie to anyone. My son and I first read the book and then watched the movie. Although the book was (in my opinion) better, the movie was still great. My son and I agree that we love the book version the best, but liked the end of the movie better than the end of the book. The scenery is just amazing and the soundtrack is a must. The fact that Jimmy Buffett plays a small role and provides music is an added plus. Luke Wilson does a decent job in his role as Officer Delinko and is pretty much what I imagined Delinko would look like when I read the book. I am surprised that this was not better in the cinemas, and I am waiting for the DVD to come out.
