This is one of those Tweety and New Year's Eve cartoons that put this legendary couple in second place behind Bugs Bunny in terms of the popularity of Looney Tunes. Apart from the fact that all inventories for this duo (New Year's Eve from garbage) stem from cans, the line "I did not tawt putty," etc.), Tweety's SOS stars are also grandma's to the supporting characters who had these Warner Bros. classics abound to enrich color and flavor. This time, the cat and the bird are aboard an ocean liner, and the gags that are pulled out of this situation are creative and vivacious. <br /> <br /> What a day in the history of the cartoon was when Frizeng decided to pair his New Year's Eve with the deceased Robert Clampett's little yellow bird.
