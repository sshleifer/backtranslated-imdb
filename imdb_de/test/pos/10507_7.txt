I brought the DVD with the expectation of a camp perversion from the makers of Society and Re-Animator and was quite surprised to be involved in an authentically exciting story. The drama was top notch (nice to see Vosloo in a protagonist role after a long line of villains), which included action and the few twists were quite surprising. I figured I'd rush through a lot of it to get to the kidnapping scenes, but instead I went through it and only disappointed at the very end. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too lenient, but as I said earlier, I did not expect much more than extraterrestrial sex. If you are looking for hot alien sex, you will of course be disappointed. It was mostly a fast, lightning fast examination table with a blinking look and one thing you would miss - an interesting "impregnator" alien.
