If I had to decide which was the best Ernest movie, and not act so that it does not happen all the time, it would be that. <br /> <br /> All Ernest films are entertaining, but the best are those where Jim Varney plays a variety of characters. I'm also known for enjoying the comedy styling of Bill Byrge and Gailard Sartain as brothers Chuck and Bobby Tulip. "Ernest Goes to Jail" contains all of these elements as well as a witty script and a minor cast featuring several popular character actors. <br /> <br /> That's why I chose "Ernest Goes to Jail" as the king of all Ernest movies. Do not agree with me if you have to, but you know I'm right.
