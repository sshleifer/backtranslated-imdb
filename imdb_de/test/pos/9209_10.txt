I think that Vanessa Marcil is the best actor in the cast. She makes Sam one of the best characters on the show. James Cann is pretty good too. I love it when he's worried about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes when Ed and Delinda cut a guy's crap off. That was funny. Nikki Cox is also good and she has a great chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was great in her guest role. I wish they had not killed her. The show has a great cast without bad actors, which you do not often see on TV. I still think that Vanessa Marcil is the best. She should have gotten an Emmy, in my opinion. It's a shame that the show was canceled
