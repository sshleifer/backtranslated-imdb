I have not packed so many people in front of a theater since Star Wars Episode III. Both shows are sold out and for a good reason. The man with the screaming brain was the best movie to see with a lot of geeks. (Hey, I'm also an idiot.) <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! The film was cheesy in the best possible way. It could be the funniest movie Bruce made. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop itudes and crazy facial expressions, he is a laugh uprising! Who knew that Ted could rap? <br /> <br /> I changed my mind that the person who stole the show was actually a robot. There is nothing more fun than a robot making the robot. <br /> <br /> As for Bruce's performance: "I'll take 5th place." Thanks, Bruce. Thanks for being cool, thank you for taking the time, thanks for all the fun.
