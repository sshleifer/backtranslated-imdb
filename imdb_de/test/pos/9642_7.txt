I recommend movie viewers when they are in the New York City area of ​​the Intrepid Museum to see how closed and cramped life was for WWII submarine crews. How much more must that have been for the sailors during the First World War. It really must have been hell downstairs. Walter Huston and Robert Montgomery head the cast of Hell Below, Huston as the book captain and Montgomery as number two. Both of them are quite credible as naval officers, and the rest of the cast, such as Robert Young, Eugene Palette, Jimmy Durante, Madge Evans, Sterling Holloway, etc., are performing their roles quite well. <br /> <br /> Silent service became more and more popular in World War II and beyond. It's amazing, but I could name quite a few submarine images like Torpedo Run, Operation Pacific, Hellcats Navy, Run Silent, Run Deep and many more, and you'll see the same plot situations in all of them. I think there is really a limit to situations. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Durante's performance is interesting. He is pretty funny and his boxing kangaroo scene is indeed very funny. But I have to say, a figure like him in these tight quarters is probably very important for morality. If you do not have someone who can break the tension aboard a submarine, you should have one put on your ship right away. <br /> <br /> But the highlight for me is the death scene of Sterling Holloway. Very similar to Sean McClory in Iceland in the Sky. It will haunt you for a long time after watching this movie.
