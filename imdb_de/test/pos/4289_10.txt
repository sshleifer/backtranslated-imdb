Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife cause a crime to be covered up despite betrayals on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is not a brutal Othello in modern England. So, gradually, a network of fraud begins to weave. And we experience cycles of jealousy and drunkenness as well as guilt and fornication. And so the network of "separate lies" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) continues, despite the bright flame of the man's love and the deep despair and guilt feelings that are interwoven in so many lives. How many deceptions should be shown in this growing carpet? The impetus is to build an excellent reputation and careers and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world. Wilkinson offers an emotional performance full of grace and discretion and decency and yet the humanity of those who have much to hide. Those who desire clarity and openness on the road to justice will be disappointed by the wickedness of so many deceptions. And yet, who among us has nothing similar to hide about his relatives? Nevertheless, the viewer wonders if this network will crumble someday.
