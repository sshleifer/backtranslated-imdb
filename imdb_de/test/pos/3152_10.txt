I have a little hobby of finding really cool pictures that are pretty much unknown - and then letting people know about them. This picture is high on my list to speak this summer. This indie movie (and I really mean indie - not Miramax, Fox Searchlight-Indie) is easy to miss in the big labyrinth of celluloid, but if you want something completely different, you need to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, I thought it was great. I should have known from the front and back of the DVD case that this would be something completely different, but they all say that their stuff is different than being tied up. Well, that's really different. It's in your face: beautiful and scary and unobtrusive, to tell you to wake up. War, Peace, 9/11, poetry, even an eerie music video that consists of an old "patriotic" song and a funny guy in a camper. Do I have to say more? Just see it.
