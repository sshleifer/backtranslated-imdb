I participated in a film screening of "Fierce People" at the Woodstock Film Festival 2006. I hesitate to call it a "premiere" since it was filmed in the spring of 2004 and premiered at Tribeca in 2005. It played several festivals this year. The liberation seemed imminent, then it vanished. Poof. Disappeared At least it seemed to the film public. Now and then rumors about a movie or DVD release appeared, all of which proved unfounded. Then this screening was announced. Maybe you can call it "re-premiere"? It certainly felt like I was witnessing a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. <br /> <br /> I think you could characterize "Fierce People" as a drama of growing up. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. And a little farce thrown in. In short, real life. This makes it difficult to put in the drawer, which makes it more into the category of an indie rather than a Hollywood movie. However, the high production values, the large budget and the occupation with star caliber seem to contradict the indie label. Call it a hybrid. And maybe that's why it was the reason to be "lost". It defies categorization. <br /> <br /> Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), 15, whose father is away. In fact, Finn never knew him. But he sees him and hears him through the collection of home videos from South America. Dad is a renowned anthropologist and has made a name for himself by teaming with the Yanomani, the tribe of the "Fierce People", who live to kill and feed well. All her activities are built around these two "tasks", and Finn is fascinated by them. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is missing something too. Although physically present, she is lost in a world full of cocaine and alcohol. With his movie roles, Finn grows up in his small, lonely world. <br /> <br /> In a summer, Mom decides to drag Finn to the wilds of New Jersey. As a massage therapist, Mom has looked after a wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, on a tour de force performance), and invited them to a long home visit to his palatial estate. Osbourne's "tribe" includes a selection of eccentric, wealthy children, servants and village idiots, among whom Finn will be part of his own anthropological study. Will his experience with Dad's films help him survive as a visitor to this tribe? Will he be accepted? Or is he seen as an outsider fighting at the same time with his own identity as a teenager? This is the stuff of fairy tales, and I think that would have been without the dark abdomen, the director Griffin Dunne and the writer Dirk Wittenborn have infused into this great story. <br /> <br /> With the voice of Anton Yelchin, Finn has to cut bits of Dad's home video, and he has to learn to be the teenager he never really had. He stopped being parent to his mother, allowed the sober mother to be parenting to him, and learned the responsibility for the movie way to adulthood, as it should have actually happened. Nevertheless, he must accomplish this transformation in a dangerous, dark world where playing with fire is folly of this broken family. <br /> <br /> This is primarily a story-driven movie, and Griffin Dunne emphasized that as well in the intro to the movie. He bought the rights to Wittenborn's novel while he was writing, and Wittenborn's own script is awakened in the hands of the masterful Dunne in a way that is a marvel. <br /> <br /> This is also largely a character movie, and Sutherland has never been better. His star circle, when Osborne stunned the people around me, will probably also amaze you. The character of Diane Lane ultimately shows so many personalities that it's hard to imagine another actor doing so well. She is stunning. "Fierce People" is above all the film by Anton Yelchin. He has a long CV as a child actor, but little worth while as a teenager. Apart from the little known "House of D" (also a jewel), he is known on television as "Buff" "Huff". In January, he will star in "Alpha Dog" (also on the shelf since 2004, a movie I saw this year at Sundance, where he is "the heart and soul"). His performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from such a young man and is simply spectacular. <br /> <br /> This complex, quirky movie is out of sight long enough. "Fierce People" is a treasure full of light and shadow, comedies and tragedies, joy and pathos, but above all, miracles.
