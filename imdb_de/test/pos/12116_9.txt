That was a great anime. The animation is old, but still worth seeing and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll. The problem was that she was quite long. <br /> <br /> Japanese film star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Ujio by Last Samurai, played the main character Jiro and was directed by Rintaro, who made Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis. <br /> <br /> The anime has some good animations for an old anime, interesting characters like the main villains Tenkai and Ando Shouzan and of course, do not forget the beautiful musical scores in the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a must-see for fans of anime, animation in general, action and samurai / ninja flicks. Despite the lows in the movie, the movie was not a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie.
