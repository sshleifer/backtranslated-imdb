I saw this before 'bubba ho-tep' at the fantasia film festival in montreal. All of this is either tilting the hat to Tim Burton (or completely demolishing it). I enjoyed it anyway, even if it is extremely distracted. What impressed me most was the quality of the optics given the apparent budget of the shoe strings. The scenery and props were original and original, but definitely not the script.
