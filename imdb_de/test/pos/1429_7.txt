A proof that a film does not necessarily have to have a deep layered history and other subtle elements to be a good movie. Even if history could be expanded in many directions, especially in sociological terms (people are longing for money), it seems to be perfect. With many sudden changes, the viewer is brought to the end without undue complications, without the viewer having to take the eyes of the screen. <br /> <br /> But the acting is not so good for me. With the exception of Lindsey McKeon, the others were average or even worst. In some scenes they just stared blankly. With the exception of Lindsey, that was more convincing. It's a really easy movie to sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> 7/10
