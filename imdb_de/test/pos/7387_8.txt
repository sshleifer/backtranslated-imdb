If the ending had not been so fantastically unexpected, I do not think I would appreciate this movie so well. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of uncomfortable, distressing, "marriage decaying" character interaction. This kind of thing is not my kind of drama, so the pace seemed to slow down for me. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main characters are hard to understand and therefore very interested in the husband (Alan Alan Rickman) is quite bitter and moody and the wife (Polly Walker) is reserved and a bit haughty. The acting was fine (Norman Reedus was very tempting), but the characters themselves might have been a bit too realistic (for me). <br /> <br /> The setting was nice and reasonably isolated and a bit scary. The cinematography had something that somehow seemed a bit old-fashioned to me. <br /> <br /> But the last 5-15 minutes of this movie are so ingenious that any uncomfortable scene, unpleasant conversation, and inexplicable character behaviors are absolutely worth it. I've guessed every typical plot flaw except the one that occurred. <br /> <br /> The end definitely makes this movie worth seeing. The intrigue and the drama, not so much.
