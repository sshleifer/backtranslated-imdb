This is a little-seen anti-war movie that has been ignored for too long. It is the time of Thanksgiving of 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The eldest son has just made a comeback from Vietnam and he has a damn long time to adapt to the life he left behind. And the family does not know how to handle the problem. I honestly do not think I'm exaggerating when I say that this is one of the most heartbreaking war movies I've ever seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie. Most of the story takes place within a few days in a house. But the kind of war that's taking place in this house is as intense as any real battlefield action. The movie does something hard to achieve; Somehow, Estevez and his team have created a film that embodies the entire Vietnam experience. Given the similarities between Vietnam and the current invasion of Iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. Estevez does a great job with material. He gets a lot of help from a handpicked cast. Especially the parents are Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates. A really moving movie. Highly recommended
