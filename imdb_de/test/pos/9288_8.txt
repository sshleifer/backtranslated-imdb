A very funny look at some of the current happenings and political events in Australia. The Chaser guys really seem to enjoy this show, and I enjoy that they all have their strengths. Some are awesome (chas) when they turn into complete idiots, while Julian gets a grip on it. "I interview a famous politician and suggest he disguise himself as a" pot of jam "" humor ". > <br /> You have great segments in the show that exploit all sorts of aspects of Australian culture, such as our Current Affairs Shows, our Adverts and Early Morning TV programs, some stuff is a bit tired and predictable, but overall It will be fun to look at it and will leave you with a smile on your face.
