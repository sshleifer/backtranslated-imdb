I see a lot of movies in the cinema (103 so far this year) and I have to say that this is by far the best movie I've seen this year, even though it was released in 1954! <br /> <I sat reverently and looked at this work of genius and was rather ashamed that I had never heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to put it on a new print for a week. <br /> <br /> The best part of the entire movie has to be the 28-minute break, in which there is no language and no music, just the sound of the men performing the robbery. Pure quality. <br /> <br /> Although it is really dark in some places, it is lightened with dry humor. <br /> <br /> Not many movies are scored 10 out of 10, which is a golden star for effort. <br /> <br /> If you ever have a chance to see this movie, please do not hesitate, it's a classic. <br /> <br />
