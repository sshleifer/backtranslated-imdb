The incredibly sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, a new nurse in one of those movie-like institutions, where the responsible doctor has his own unorthodox treatment methods for the inmates. Reluctant to bring her on board is the insulting dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, a.k.a. Annabelle Weenick). The inmates do not take Charlotte too friendly. <br /> <br /> Partial Puzzles, Part Horror, this initial effort by B-film director S.F. Brown rigg has a depressing feeling. These colorful psychos, including a nymphomaniac with no self-esteem, a gentle giant who already had a lobotomy, and an alleged "judge" speaking in legal jargon dominate the screen with their disturbing presence. <br /> <br /> It's a picture that works pretty well and creates the grim, gloomy atmosphere from the start. A few short bursts of graphic violence also contribute to this sophisticated exploitation quality being created in an old-fashioned way. <br /> <br /> It gains in intensity as the endangered heroine struggles to maintain her own mind and provide one surreal encounter after another. Particularly effective is the poetically quoted, inglorious old woman Callingham. <br /> <br /> For cheap cheese from the 1970s, it's pretty effective, with a particularly nasty climax. I had a pretty good time watching it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
