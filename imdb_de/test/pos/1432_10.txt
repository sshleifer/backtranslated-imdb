"The Moon Is Blue" director Otto Preminger went even further in his controversial publication "The man with the golden arm" of 1955 before more taboos. While angering the Motion Picture Association of America with his use of the words "virgin" and "mistress" in his mild 1953 comedy "The Moon Is Blue," Preminger went far beyond what every film in "The Man with The Golden Arm, since Dick Powell thwarted his law and order epic "To the ends of the earth" (1946) about the international traffic with narcotics. Based on Nelson Algren's novel, which was awarded the National Book Award in 1950, this uncompromising, 119-minute, black-and-white melodrama of heroin addiction. Initially, when Preminger's movie came out, the Motion Picture Association of America did not issue a seal of approval as the filmmakers depended on narcotics dependency. This groundbreaking film was the first major film to be treated with narcotics from the perspective of the image of the Dopia and actually showed the items junkies used to shoot heroin. The Production Code provided that filmmakers must refrain from showing characters with illegal narcotics. Nonetheless, United Artists released this unique Frank Sinatra image and raised over $ 4 million. <br /> <br /> The production code was removed by the critical and commercial success of "The Man With The Golden Arm". As a result, the MPAA changed the code so that filmmakers could investigate other taboo subjects such as drug abuse, kidnapping, abortion and prostitution. The film received three Oscar nominations. Oscar nominations went to Sinatra for Best Acting, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera for Best Art Direction's Set Decoration, Black and White and Elmer Bernstein for Best Music, scoring a dramatic or comedy picture. In fact, Elmer Bernstein made a name for himself with his jazzy score. The producers had considered casting Marlon Brando in the title role, but Sinatra beat Brando to the stroke. Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin and Robert Strauss played together with Ole Blue Eyes. McGavin was particularly memorable as a slippery heroin trader, while Eleanor Parker played the protagonist's wife with a dark, deep, secret secret that was shocking. <br /> <br /> "The man with the golden arm" refers to the ability of the protagonist Frankie Machine to manipulate card stacks. Frankie gives out cards for Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss of "Stalag 17"), but he has been in Chicago for the past six months after recovering from a heroin addiction. Frankie has not only licked the habit, he has also learned to play the drums and plans a music career. Frank is optimistic about his future, and he faces his past again when he returns to his old crushing grounds. Schwiefka wants him to act for him again, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski (Darren McGavin of Counter-Attack) tries to persuade him to resume his heroin use. In the meantime, Frankie comes home to his invalid, wheelchair-bound wife Zosh (Eleanor Parker of "Escape from Fort Bravo"), who manipulates him with guilt. Frankie was drunk when he had a car accident and Zosh was put in a wheelchair. Frankie shows great hopes and drums, but Zosh sees no future for him as a musician and urges to work for Schwiefka again. Frankie plans to attend a music promotion, and one of his friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang of "My Sister Eileen"), brings a business suit from a department store for Frankie. After Frankie refuses to work for Schwiefka because he will visit the musical agent Harry Lane (Will Wright of "The Wild One"), Schwiefka turns both Frank and Sparrow into the police. In the meantime, Schwiefka receives Brach's department store to reduce shoplifting charges. The suit was worth $ 37.00. Frankie agrees to continue trading with Schweifka, and the hustler lets him out. Not long after Frankie collapses, although he has decided to avoid heroin use. <br /> <br /> At some point Frankie meets Harry Lane and Lane warns him that Frankie is caught doing nothing. What poor Frankie does not know is that Zosh regained her ability to walk, but she uses his blame for the accident to capture him. Zosh is also jealous of her neighbor on the ground floor, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak of "Picnic"), the former girlfriend of Frankie, who drinks at a nearby strip bar called Safari Club. As Zosh complains about the headache that Frankie gives her on his drums, Frankie brings her down to Molly's apartment. Schwiefka and Louie are planning a big poker game with Sam Markette (George E. Stone of "Guys and Dolls") and Williams (George Mathews of "Gunfight at the OK Corral"), two big players who have heard of Frank and Frank being his legendary "golden arm". Schwiefka and Louie convince a reluctant Frankie to trade for $ 250. After an early winning streak, Frankie begins to lose and he can not reverse his bad luck. In fact, Frankie spends about two days busy. Exhausted, nervous and desperate for a solution, he falls apart on the second day and Mark and Williams catch him cheating. Louie refuses to give Frankie a solution, so Frankie beats him out and pleads for heroin. <br /> <br /> Preminger does not punch "The Man with the Golden Arm," and the movie is pretty disillusioning. None of the characters is likeable from afar. In essence, they are either Hustler or Hustler. Sinatra offers another dynamite performance like McGavin and Parker. Although "The Man With The Golden Arm" has lost much of its impact over the past 50 or more years, it is still a milestone film.
