I've always liked this movie, I've seen it so many times, but I've always enjoyed it :) The story is interesting and special. The only thing I have to disagree with is that I do not believe that Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what it was: P You do not look like that in Romania. Anyway, Ghita Muresan played pretty good well, as someone said before me, his english has to improve. <br /> <br /> And there were some funny moments and also tragic / sad parts. It's worth it to be seen, I thought it was cute, that the giant wanted to find his love. I have recommended you all. It's not the best movie ever, but it was nice!
