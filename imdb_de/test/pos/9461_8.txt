I think a person is well advised to read or watch "Twelfth Night" (I prefer to read) before they see "She's The Man". The movie is good for itself, but if you compare them and look for the jokes, it's much more fun. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think he would give a thumbs up. Harald Bloom said in Shakespeare, The Invention of Man, that most people have to be imprisoned in Twelfth Night. Malvolio, the person Malcolm is based on, is for a good reason. The people in She's The Man, on the other hand, are sensible. For example, Duke Orsino is far more than the Duke of Orsino. He also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay. He shows a lot of self-control. <br /> <br /> It's a youthful comedy (a clean one), so it does not have the dark edges of the game. For example, Olivia grieves in the play for the death of her brother. In the movie she was emptied. <br /> <br /> If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the game, they do not get the same attention in the movie. <br /> <br /> The jokes are often fast. The last name of the hairdresser Pauls is awarded once. It is Antonio. Many people who have read the play say that Antonio has more love for a man than just friendship. At that time, a deep love was found between men. Some see a sexual side of homosexuality as illegal. <br /> <br /> The only line from the game I've seen is where Duke Orsino cites the coach for size during the Soccar game. In the play it is said by Malvolio, quoting Maria.
