Or the other way around. <br /> <br /> This is a French film noir directed by an American filmmaker (Jules Dassin) who had to leave because he was blacklisted by Hollywood's HUAC. The premise of the story is pretty well known - one last jewel robbery for Tony le Stephanois and his buds - and so the ending ends with everyone ... Well, there are no spoilers here, sure, since this is the kind of movie in the suspense End is important. Dassin filmed on realistic light effects in black and white on the streets of Paris. Actors and actresses who are not glamorous. The appealing - sometimes haunting - score by Georges Auric beautifully enhances the film and reminds viewers of many similar scores of American film noirs from the 1940s and early 1950s. Jean Servais plays the hardcore and consumptive lead role in a fedora, much as Humphrey Bogart might have played it. Tony is recently out of jail, beyond his best time, but still hard and determined, if need be, with his mind still focused, a kind of anti-hero whose eyes are watering, though the tears will never fall Dassin plays the Italian safecracker and wants to be a ladies man who knows the rules but becomes careless. In Film Noir, the film's logic and focus force us to identify with the bad guys. Often there are bad guys, the "good" villains we identify with, and the "bad" bad guys who are dealing with our good bad guys, and then maybe there are one or two really bad, bad boys. (Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a somewhat sadistic drugstore.) Then there are the policemen who are irrelevant or almost so. In modern movie Noir, the bad guys are not even "good" villains, and they come with it or something near it. In the old Noir movie, which developed from the gangster films of the 1930s, the usual motto was the old Hollywood codex "Crime Does not Pay," in which every criminal had to pay for his crime before the film ended the film. <br /> <br /> Probably the most impressive feature of Rififi is how beautifully the film moves. The plot evolves quickly and seamlessly, as the great movie directors have always done, directors like Stanley Kubrick, Louis Malle and the best of Hitchcock. Some have actually compared this to Kubrick's The Killing (1956) and suggest that Kubrick stole a bit. Well, directors always steal, if need be, and there may be some similarities that say it's "a last-ditch attack" for the protagonist and that the girl picks up the work. The similarities may go deeper as, as the movie nears its end, I suddenly thought, Oh, no! The suitcase in the back seat will fly out of the convertible, fall to the ground, burst open and all the money will fly up! Those who have seen The Killing may remember what happened to the money at the end of the movie! Which reminds me of another movie where something bad happens to the money: Oliver Stone's U Turn (1997) with Sean Penn. There, the money in his backpack is blown up by a shotgun. Hahaha! Obtaining the dubbed version of this film would be an act of sacrilege, since the dialogue (if there are any: the raid is made completely without dialogue (about 30 minutes)), is concise and easy to follow, and requires only an occasional look subtitles, which by the way are quite useful and leading rather than spelling out every word. <br /> <br /> Another thing: All brutality is made as sex made in the movie, so out of camera. A man gets his neck slit. We do not see it. I like this approach somehow. We do not have to see the wound. You could almost make your kids look Rififi - almost. <br /> <br /> Now catch this and look for a Hollywood reprise with Al Pacino, which will be directed by Harold Becker next year, where you can be sure that the violent scenes will be fully replayed ,
