I saw this movie on a Sunday night and I have to say that there is no better way to end the weekend. I'm totally satisfied with the humor and warmth of the movie. It just leaves me in a nice mood. When you watch this movie, you have a great time and a warm feeling. <br /> <br /> The film has sharp black British humor and feels very fresh to me. They really enjoy the story and the characters. Brenda Blethyn is so great. I do not know why. She is too old to love me and too young to be my mother. But I feel really good when she shows up in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some say the story is thin and predictable. But who cares? It just has to be a happy ending, dancing in the sunshine! Are the characters stereotypes or clippings? I do not know - I do not care any better! I just loved her and enjoyed seeing her. <br /> <br /> Also, I have to say that I do not usually like romantic comedies. But this one is outstanding: a black comedy with a gold heart !!
