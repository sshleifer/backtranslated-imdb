I saw this movie at the first show in my area, and it was pretty clear that most people did not get the movie. Even if you do not, it's a good movie with an interesting character development. It's a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a southern city in the backcountry and really addresses the root of the blues. If you do not know what "Black Snake Moan" is when you leave the theater, you have not understood. And no ... it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and convinces in her role as well as Samuel L. Jackson. I think that's his best performance since his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best, including the one that results from his role in BSM. The rest of the cast is solid, with a few brilliant appearances here and there, notably John Cothran Jr. as Reverend RL. I'm a very selective movie watcher, and this movie truly ranks among my favorites because he honestly views the race as sex, religion, and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with her cinematic genius, in my opinion.
