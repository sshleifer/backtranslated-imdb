Well, the movie is basically about the last days of a certain Russian regiment stationed in Afghansitan before the main force left in 1985. The film shows exactly the dark realities of the Russian army, which have made them notorious: "dedovshina" (officers and NCOs of younger recruits physically harassed, beaten and humiliated), mixed character of war (you can someday trade with your enemy and him on the killing the next), the lives of women at the front, documentary traces of helicopter attacks and the soldering and dispatch of coffins home in heave C-130 Hercules class Russian cargo aircraft with tracer to stinger Stinger missile, fatigue, boredom, anti-war sentiment, emotional Page. There are some action scenes, but they are poorly done and often illogical, such as Major Bandura's suicide wandering and his ten-year-old child armed with AK-47, the father he just killed. Also the fact that in the midst of a firefight in the mountains heavy grenade launchers appear from nowhere (and every half-human knows that it is practically impossible to throw 40-50 lns of throwers on the march). But at the same time, films show that war is a filthy affair in which murder is sometimes tolerated, wanton destruction of entire villages is normal for no reason or reason, the indiscriminate killing of civilians as collateral damage, inevitable during the war, is overlooked about why the Afghan war was lost. Not the best war movie, but profound and intelligent enough to be seen.
