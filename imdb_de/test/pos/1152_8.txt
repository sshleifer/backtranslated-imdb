Well, guys, I loved this movie, though not as much as FAREWELL TO THE KING, another popular John Milius epic. It was fun, much more than when it was based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It's a great yarn with a touch of political correctness. I love this film because of its beautiful photography, its humor and its muted criticism of the Bad Guys (Berbers) and the REAL Bad Guys, the spearmen of the "civilized" world, with their repeating rifles, artillery and big gunboats there in the harbor. <br /> <br /> The most outstanding scene is the Berber camp, with blue-gray smoke from the cooking fire rising into the cool desert air. It is visually eloquent, very impressive. <br /> <br /> Located in Morocco in 1904, the WIND has a helpless American (Candace Bergen) taken hostage by a dastardly, if immodest, Berber bandit (Sean Connery), a model of a Scottish Muslim nomad. The exciting story is based on some historical facts. The photograph is Milius beautiful and is underlined by Jerry Goldsmith's excellent music. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Pedicaris and the Raisuli play a long foreplay and jump around among oases in the desert. Although the Raisuli proudly attributes his ancestry to the monkeys, he is a perfect gentleman - he even lets her keep her head after defeating him in chess! A naval squad storms the Bashaw's palace and extinguishes the fires of hegemonies competing with gasoline. Do not mess with the corps, Abdul. <br /> <br /> There are many entertaining stereotypes: <br /> <br /> The despicable sultan - resembles a ruined ferret. Definitely not a liberal. <br /> <br /> Cruel German officer - a big, warlike dachshund with monocle. He bravely chooses to fight the Raisuli with swords instead of knocking him down like Indiana Jones. Noblesse committed by Von Clausewitz? Raging naval officer - kick the shit out of the Bashaw army of Tangier and storm his palace while chewing tobacco. His speech is mildly aphasic. The Bashaw asked him not to breathe. <br /> <br /> The Berbers - a horde of groaning sycophants led by a charming megalomaniac. None of them take a bath, except perhaps in camelurine. President Teddy Roosevelt is undeservedly portrayed as empty and carrying weapons, toys and stuffed grizzly bears. Beautiful American Widow - teaches the men courage, as well as their two children. She obviously has a huge supply of clean, starched clothes and rarely has inappropriate hair. <br /> <br /> The Raisuli sends a message to Teddy Roosevelt, thanking him for the gift of a Remington rifle and declaring: "MEESTER ROOSEVELT", YOU ARE THE LION AND AIEE AT THE BREAKING WIND. "<br /> <br /> How true. <br /> <br /> Please do not take my sharp remarks that I did not like the movie, I had almost as much fun writing that as there pitcher to look.
