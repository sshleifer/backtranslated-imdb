Do not ask me why I love this movie so much ... Maybe there was a time in my life that I wanted to fit in, maybe it's the amazing monster effects, maybe because I enjoyed the novel "Cabal" but it's probably because I LOVE Clive Barker. I think it's fair to warn you that the movie and the novel have no true resolve, and like me, you probably end up with a WTF moment. There were at least two sequels planned, but never came about because the film flopped for various reasons. The studio has made drastic cuts to the movie that have been cut out of it for over 30 minutes, and they've done a HORRIBLE job to promote it. The ad made it look like another cheap slasher, mostly showing the Decker character "Button face / Mask". This is a movie about the monsters! About the imagination! About a place called Midian! It's a story where the monsters are the good guys. There is really nothing else out there! I do not think it's a movie for everyone, but it's one of Clive's great works. Sit back and be ready to be brought to Midian - where the monsters are.
