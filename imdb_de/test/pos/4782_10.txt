While in one country, in Spain, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali joined forces to set the standard for short-film, cinematic surrealism, Un Chien Andalou, Walt Disney and his collaborator Ub Iwerks in America worked on Steamboat Willie, the most well-known of them early dubbed sound cartoons (this turned out not to be the first, unlike other reports). It's also one of the more successful, simpler and funnier Mickey Mouse shorts (still in silent mode - the only sounds are the small bumps and beeps of Mickey and the animals). It also goes by fairly quickly for a run of less than ten minutes. In those minutes, however, it becomes immediately clear how much fun Disney has with his characters and how the newly discovered sound changes, how his creation uses the animals as a musical tool. There is no history worth mentioning, just coincidental things that happen in a river on this boat due to Mickey (uh, Steamboat Willie). And like the better Mickey Mouse shorts, his lack of speech is an advantage. It's a must if you have not seen it as a kid yet, but if you have it, it may still be worth a look.
