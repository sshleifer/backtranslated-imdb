The direction is brilliant, the casting is remarkable (although I would have liked to see something more from Aaron Lustig (from Y & R Fame), who played Paul Shaffer). I have only two little jokes about the movie, as subtle as they are. One-Roebuck's Leno is excellent, but his stage presence (ie H. While recording one of his late show episodes) is a bit oppressive. Two - the distribution of the bad language. I'm willing to tolerate bad language as long as it's not in vain and the film was, to some extent, free. The language seemed to be used as a means to reduce the pathos of Bates' otherwise well-described Kushnick through their frequent use, and served to make Roebuck's Leno a goody goody, since he did not use them (of course, when The Characters have The song is a great piece of work in terms of television and video, I think the movie had potential for the big screen, but would have required a re-casting for the bit parts, and probably another director (the aesthetic feel is that of Larry Sanders' show, good for HBO, mediocre for cinematic purposes).
