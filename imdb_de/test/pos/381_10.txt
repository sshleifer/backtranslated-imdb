Looking back on Alfred Hitchcock's career, it is always surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man can be denied recognition of how revolutionary he is for the film industry. It's probably a sign of how far ahead of time Hitchcock was. He always tried to postpone the envelope and never went with a movie that was meant to be entertaining, but always with a deeper, more poignant theme in mind. Strangers in one go, one of Hitchcock's first and underrated hits, is a perfect example of these traits - a fun and exciting story, even though it's considered over fifty years later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently designed today a masterpiece is in cinematography. <br /> <br /> Probably one of the seminal "suspense thrillers", strangers on a train may seem outdated in some ways, but it retains a lot, as it did in 1951 (and possibly in 1951) first-class tension a bit less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as the fast and meticulous editing characterize the film, releasing every possible tension and keeping the audience's attention even in slower scenes. If ever there was any doubt as to what the simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was, it would be enough to watch five minutes of strangers on a train to suppress such feelings. Each shot is so carefully selected and constructed that it drives the story in a particularly innovative way. Unfortunately, there are certain moments in the story that are screaming out of place to sweep away the focus from the outstanding cinematography and editing. Bruno is able to reach the bottom of a sewer, and the figure is just incredible. A stereotypical old man crawling under a completely out of hand carousel offers an unwanted comic relief in the film's most tense and compelling scene. These are just brief moments, but they are enough to prove painfully weak in an otherwise outstanding movie. <br /> <br /> But what really sets Strangers on a Train apart is the premise of the story. Since Hollywood movies are in danger lately of getting circled into the tub of Turgid clichés, it is wonderfully refreshing to see a 50-year-old film with a premise that actually looks smart and original. Sure, it's pretty straightforward, but the concept of "swapping murders" is simply one that would not fly in movies of today and the age, which makes it all the more entertaining to watch; The film's brilliant script keeps the action flowing at a fast pace, delivering some wonderfully memorable lines. One can not help being aware of the deeper issues that Hitchcock always refers to, especially the concept of "Darkness in the Heart of Humanity," which shows that older ladies are fascinated and thrilled by Murder's perspective and by Bruno's own militant Attitude Toward Death Hitch also works in many moments of dark humor (Bruno pops a child's balloon with his cigarette) is priceless, and irony makes thrilling scenes in jaunty, laid-back environments, such as the iconic carnival scenes, even more sinister create. This may be an exciting thriller, yes, but to overlook the hidden brain underneath would be simply inexcusable. <br /> <br /> The antagonistic character of Bruno (by Robert Walker in perverse perfection, unfortunately in his last film role, but easily stealing the film from his admittedly very talented teammates) is undoubtedly what makes Strangers all at once unforgettable, as the character is a miracle. Here we have a simply superbly crafted, vicious figure that is all the more intriguing as usual and modest. Instead of clucking furiously at any moment and thwarting the hero, Bruno is a calm, controlled, psychotic confusion. He speaks of murder in such an unconventional tone, but keeps a passionate sparkle in mind when he talks about different ways of killing people. Bruno seemed to represent the "id," as Freud put it, the inner, darker, and uninhibited aspects of humanity. It's an interesting contrast to Guy Haines heroic figure, and how bland and uninteresting he seems to bring home the prospect of evil as much more interesting and attractive than constantly striving to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Despite this implied message, Hitch still twists our emotions so that we need to anchor Guy around every corner and cheer on any new obstacle he needs to overcome. It's a testament to the talent of actor Farley Granger, although Granger's hero easily robs the show despite Robert Walker's villain, still looks sympathetic and still approves of our support, even if he falls victim to a far less compelling character. Outstanding support is provided by Ruth Roman, who succeeds in overcoming the cliché and being a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure. Kasey Rogers does an amazing job as Guy's appallingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife, and Patricia Hitchcock proves that she's far more talented than simply being "the director's daughter" would mean. The great cast (led by a simply wonderful Walker) really brings the movie to life and adds so much more value to the movie than just Hitchcock's stunning styling. <br /> <br /> All in all, Strangers on a Train may still seem a bit dated to certain viewers, but it is still a shock to be as modern and appealing to the contemporary audience as it is to think of it Half a century has been published. Once again, Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of suspense and film technique, and the surprisingly original and enjoyable premise of the film alone is worth a visit. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to make a brilliant but very entertaining movie experience! <br /> <br /> -9/10
