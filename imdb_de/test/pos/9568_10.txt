This must be the funniest movie I've ever seen. Chritopher Guest is really talented. He has a gift for humor. I nearly died when I laughed. When I saw that in the cinemas, I thought about going out because the movie was so stupid. But it is good stupid. It's funny-stupid. And that's a really good combination. You will laugh from start to finish. <br /> <br /> This mockumentary film follows a series of characters, all of whom compete at the Kennel Club Dog Show. The cast includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and many more. <br /> <br /> This is a really funny movie where everyone laughs. Someone born without personality would laugh about this movie. It will be displayed in widescreen format to give the image that you are seeing actual documentation. This is probably what contributes to the amusement. BEST IN SHOW: 5/5.
