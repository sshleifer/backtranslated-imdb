This show has everything you can expect from a prison drama. There are twists and turns until the season. The characters are very strong and give the show a lot of power. Looking at the show makes you feel not only for the prisoners, but also for the prison staff. The actors who play prisoners on this show did a great job portraying a prisoner. Even if you like law and order svu or law and order criminal intentions, there are many actors from this show who appear in these shows. The only problem with Oz is that it was not long enough. This show easily had nine to ten seasons without getting old. Even after the season finale, I always see Oz on DVD. This show is easily one of the best shows on TV. Do not be a fool, watch Oz.
