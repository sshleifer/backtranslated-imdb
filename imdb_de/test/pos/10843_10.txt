The BBC went beyond the limits they had crossed with Tipping the Velvet. In the past, they were "daring" with Dennis Potter's works, but this miniseries (as shown in the UK) are outstanding. Andrew Davies work is top notch - I did not read the novel by Sarah Water, but I imagine he did it right. I comment on the vulgarity - most men have observed it - proved to be a main argument for talking and selling when it was originally advertised. The fact is that it's the lesbian side of society in the 19th century - a time when most thought it was old men and retirees - well - lesbianism was mostly behind closed and often respectable doors. <br /> <br /> You can also think of Tipping The Velvet as a "love story" - it is indeed - as well as "self-discovery" that many gay and lesbian people go through and comment on and repeat all the time. <Br /> <br /> If you have not seen it - either repeatedly on TV or on DVD - you get it - you'll be looking forward to something - and even the production and the filming are perfect. Just try to hide your rouge in parts - as I said - "bawdy" is the order of the day - and watch out for one or two "phallus"! <br /> <br /> Have fun!
