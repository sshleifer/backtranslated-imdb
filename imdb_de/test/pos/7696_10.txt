"Porgy and Bess" is an outstanding production of George Gershwin's masterpiece. It is tastefully decorated in muted colors. The voices are excellent. Although Sidney Portier's voice is named for his vocal part, it gives a very touching performance. It is a notable achievement by Sammy Davis Jr. as Sportin Life. There is not yet a DVD to watch, and this piece asks for one. All intelligent moviegoers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on the new medium. The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that joins all other musicals, including the outstanding ones of Rodgers and Hammerstein. Make sure you ask your video provider. Like "Songs of the South" by Walt Disney, it may be the adoption of racial overtones that prevent the commercialization of this movie.
