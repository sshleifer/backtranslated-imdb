Nobody would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but we ask ourselves: is he an insane genius? So many people hated this movie! I'm usually the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and overbearing movies (like the terrible new movie "L'Enfant" and the pointless and offensive "Feux Rouges"). But strangely, I think that 'Pola X' is an amazing movie made by a master of his craft with great skill and passion, and that has remarkable accomplishments. The film takes melodrama to extreme lengths when I think I've ever seen it on screen. But Carax is extreme, we know that. The film also contains what I believe to be exaggerated Trotskyist or anarchist fantasies and humid dreams, with a mysterious group of young men firing machine guns in the bourgeoisie while playing Scott Walker's rather intriguing music in a band has his recordings in a deserted one Warehouse full of squatters and fires in old steel barrels. Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a ch√¢teau (whose stepmother is Catherine Deneuve, and he wanders into her bathroom while she's naked in the bathroom, by the way). Suddenly he "snaps" completely when he finds out that his late father, a famous diplomat, had conceived an illegitimate daughter who had effectively disposed of Deneuve as an inconvenience. This is because the sister suddenly appears as a kind of Romanian refugee, with wild tousled hair, expressionless face and a low ability to speak French coherently. Depardieu then turns into a "class hero" of the extreme left. He wants to kill or destroy his family for hypocrisy and corruption. He lives in misery and extreme poverty, while despising an enormous legacy. He then begins an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, shown in an explicit sex scene that has offended many people, although I do not mind, as I think people are far too hysterical about sex, especially in America , where it never seems to happen. The intensity of acting and filming makes this unlikely scenario appear as an experience of a powerful, albeit depressing, hypermelodrama. The differences between Carax, who does an extreme movie like this, and the many extremely French films I think are presumptuous and disgusting, are (1) that Carax is a great filmmaker, and (2) he seriously tries to make a meaningful one when shattering to explore. extreme emotional state in which a person dissolves and turns away from his background. Many would say that the extreme elements in this film were unfounded, but I disagree. I believe that Carax was real and did not exploit at all. It's very hard to defend a man who goes that far and to my knowledge is a completely crazy man, but I think he deserves to defend for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
