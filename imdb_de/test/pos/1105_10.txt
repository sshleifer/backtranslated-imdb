I saw this movie at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival in the Palace Cinemas and switched to it completely in the first five minutes. Thankfully for a movie that ignores all the garbage we often see in Australian movies that seemingly revolve around a) race b) gender and c) in favor of uh ... dare I say ... funny good cinema. The producer, a shy, somewhat eccentric guy named Alex Frayne, introduced his film, which was made from a bunch of his comrades near the city where he spent much of his childhood. Apparently, he spent the better part of last year with the movie all over the world, mainly in Europe. The world the film creates is both brilliant and artistic, not least because of the strange and disconcerting cut style, the gothic characters, and the unreal time and space feeling that draws the viewer into their nightmarish realm. <br /> <br /> The producer returned for the Q + A after. Someone asked him for his inspiration - he answered "South Australia". Hear hear! Another asked him what a "day in the life of Alex" would entail. He replied that he drives an old Ute, that he has breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant where he has eaten well for 8 years! and that he plays the piano, which helps him to think. He does not drink alcohol and plays cricket once a week. Then the question-and-answer session ended abruptly as the next film screening was to take place. So I think they have to extend the after-sessions for the next festival.
