At 2:37 pm in a bathroom at an Adelaide high school, a student takes the life, and the different worlds of six teenagers are changed forever. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a brutal, honest and stunning movie that focuses on the topic of being a teenager. The film shows one day in the life of six teenagers, all of whom are connected and who all deal with their own personal dramas. While there are a few stereotypes in the mix? The beautiful, beloved girl who deals with body problems, the overfull one who is obsessed with his notes, there are several horrors that are as far from the mainstream as you can get, including a social outsider dealing with a brutal one Illness and a young person deals with girls trying to understand a devastating event in their past. <br /> <br /> The film is mixed with documentary interviews with the characters that some viewers find somewhat inappropriate in the otherwise seamless narrative. The tempo is also a bit slow, but it fits the feel of the movie. The young Australian actors are all stars, especially Theresa Palmer, who has earned an AFI nomination for her breakneck performance. <br /> <br /> The film is very well filmed, with a great director. Some scenes are a bit difficult to see? especially the five-minute suicide scene, but overall it's a movie that has a big impact on the viewers. It draws you into the shocking opening scene and lets you guess which of the six main characters will be the one ending in the bathroom. After all, it's a beautiful, but somewhat disturbing look at the lives of teenagers.
