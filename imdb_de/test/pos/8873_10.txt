In a very orderly round about Hitchcock, Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) live an uncomfortable life: Larry's ex-wife has become rich by publishing a book he has written, and Owen has the most overwhelming mother, which one can imagine. When Larry tells Owen to calm down by looking at "strangers on a train," Owen gets the idea that they're all criss-crosses like in the movie. And just like in the movie, Larry thinks it's a joke, but Owens serious. <br /> <br /> I will never know how they came up with the idea of ​​"throwing mother off the train", but it's a hilarious movie. There is no boring moment in it. And that end was a scream. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and Anne Ramsey is just as much a hacker here as in "The Goonies." A modern classic.
