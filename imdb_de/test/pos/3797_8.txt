During this time, when almost everything appears on DVD (I expect to see the My Mother the Car collection every day now), this film was unjustly neglected. There are countless stupid comedies from the 60s and many other epochs that have received at least one fleeting DVD treatment. This, to my knowledge, had not even been released on VHS, despite the talents involved in its production (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (later known as co-author of Tootsie) and even Dustin Hoffman in his Debut). It's obviously a product of the sixties, but pretty much everything else from that time. All films reflect the taste and customs of the time. This was released in the same year as The President's Analyst, another absurd masterpiece. The film was finally released on DVD and has developed a cult episode. This movie has many memorable bizarre, silly, crazy moments. Sure, it's painted in broad strokes and has consistently stupid go-go music, but that's part of its charm. It creates its own absurd universe. If the person responsible for Columbia Pictures' DVD production (I think Columbia has published) participates in surveys for new releases, I get my vote.
