Rose Troche, an inspired director of choice for this latest Brit flick that has burst into the scene with the budget-priced NY Dykes story, brings Go Fish Fish a gentle glimpse of that story of a Londoner who blights a slightly unfitting environment chooses male bond society to explain his desire for a fellow male truth clerk. The highlight for me is a scene in which society tries to become primitive hunters and collectors, but in the end orders a take-away. The movie as a whole is wonderfully played, and Troche, who would never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film, enjoys the bigger budget by enjoying wonderfully lingering panning, unlike _Go Fish's form granular hyperkinesis. A really nice movie
