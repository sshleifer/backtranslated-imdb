I've gotten a few laughs about it, more than many other so-called comedies. The big ship was a knockout and seeing many of its landscapes was fun, as well as some curves by Dyan Cannon. This was not the culmination of Lemmon's and Mattheau's career, but it was not an absolute dog, as some would suggest.
