Rainy day with not much to do. We surfed the channels of the film network and found it just at the beginning, so we gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> The more we looked, the more we went into the story. It's the old story where the working class tried to do it in a sport that was usually played by the wealthy upper class at that time (1913, I think), but this movie was as interesting as seabiscuit and based also on a true story. <br /> <br /> The acting is believable and the casting is brilliant. AND . , , , We are NOT golfers, please do not miss them just for the sake of golf. Every single sport would serve the action because it is about the people. Golf is well suited for this story, as class differences and snobbery affect some players playing the game. <br /> <br /> Conclusion. , , , It is a movie to feel good. It is well put together and it is not always fun to see that those who think they are better than others, take one or two hooks.
