This is a "redesigned" Riverdance presentation performed at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Of the three Irish "Dance" musicals that I saw in the mid-to-late 1990s (including the first "Riverdance" and "Lord of the Dance"), I liked it the most. <br /> <br /> I thought it would be better than the original in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful staging and eliminated every piece for two from the original which was not good at first. This is just a very solid show with few vulnerabilities. To be sure, there are some songs that are just "fair", but none that are poor, which is amazing, considering that there are a total of 20 numbers. <br /> <br /> The cast resembles the first Riverdance with The main exception of Colin Dunne replacing Michael Flatley as a dancer. Both are extremely talented. The main difference may be in their looks with Dunne, a small, shaggy black-haired, while Flatley is the straight-shaven blonde. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big that sometimes it gets annoying. Fortunately, the female lead, Jean Butler, is still there and can be seen: What graceful beauty and talent! Butler and the rest of these women have the best legs I've seen in dancers. I also enjoyed the dancing of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco actress and two boys, Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. One number - with these two pairings against Dunne and two other dancers -0 - is called "Trading Taps" and is a lot of fun to watch, maybe the highlight of the entire show. I also have no complaints about the violinist Eileen Ivers. <br /> <br /> The "fast" Irish songs here have appealed to me the most. I appreciated that the audience of the performance did not get in the way of screams and screams, as the women do in the Lord Of The Dance video.
