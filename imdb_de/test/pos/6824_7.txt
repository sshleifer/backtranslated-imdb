The problem with the movie is quite simple: Conrad's prose is powerfully wordy and can not be adapted to a movie. Marlow's story in the novella captivates you from the first movement and you "only" see what Conrad is writing about. It's different in the film, you see the visual, but the description and the reflection that really make the novel are awful. But as far as a non-customizable book has been adjusted, it is of a good standard. There are the same scenes that are pretty awesome, but they never have the same effect as in the novel. The plot in the movie has been improved and works very well to make it more interesting. The references to ancient Egypt were thoughtfully inserted. My tip, read the book and keep it that way, there are better movies.
