This is Lucio Fulci at his best. If only all the films he did after that would be like that. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary film is as intriguing as Dario Argento's "The Bird with Crystal Feathers" ... <br /> <br /> If you are an Argento fan, but you do not like Lucio Fulci movies such as <br /> <br /> "The Beyond", "Manhattan Baby", "The House by the Cemetery" etc. This one has nothing to offer with the others ... that is what the Italians call "giallo". .. that would be something like a "who-done-it" movie in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> You do not know who is the killer until the last moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, there's the plot: A maniac living in a small village starts killing little boys ... A journalist (Tomas Milian), a sexy young woman (Barbara Bouchet) , a priest (Marc Porel), his mother (Irene Papas) and a witch (Florinda Bolkan) are the protagonists of this confused, bloody history. <br /> <br /> Speaking of actors, I want to say that Tomas Milian (as always) is great and Florinda Bolkan is great s the village witch ... <br /> <br /> Want to know who the killer is? ... <br /> <br /> I can not tell you ... but I can tell you that must see this movie! <br /> <br /> (10 of 10) ... of course!
