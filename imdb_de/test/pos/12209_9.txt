This show has an amazing plot with good and recognizable actors (like the girl from Boston Legal and Boris the Butcher from Snatch). Even the extras and the kid that I thought had a weak connection in advertising surprised me with his skills. It's just the little things that the director needs to adjust. Like the man who creates the last episode of the last episode at the beginning of each episode, he must be fired. When a narrator tells you what happened, the story ruins. The only other little problem I had was that sometimes they take too long to get things done. Does anyone know when they will continue the season?
