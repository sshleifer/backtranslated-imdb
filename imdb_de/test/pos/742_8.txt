I'm not sure what fascinates me about this movie. It is grainy, poorly written, bleached, often ridiculous, and in many places the head is numb and dull (the person with whom I watched it has fallen asleep twice.) And yet there is something in this film that fascinates me, although I'm not sure what; maybe the character of Sam, a huge former patient lobotimized by the former head physician and constantly sucking on an ice peck) or the wonderfully played head physician (I forget her name). Anyway, look at it and form your own opinion; It has one of the biggest endings I've seen in the movie.
