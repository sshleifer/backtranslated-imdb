The historical inaccuracies of this film are well documented. It was never intended to be a serious story, but a fun saga, and they succeed. Errol Flynn was never better when this role was tailor-made for him. Olivia DeHavilland has never been so beautiful. Arthur Kennedy never more vicious. Anthony Quinn was never as noble as Crazy Horse. It had a lot of humor and pathos and interested you consistently. The one historical aspect that I found most inaccurate was the last "Last Stand" on the shores of Little Big Horn. The movie version was shot in a desert without a river in sight. Still, I think it's a wonderful conversation that's typical of Hollywood's golden age.
