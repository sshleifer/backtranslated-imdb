(Synopsis) High school graduate Bartleby "B" Gaines (Justin Long) has a college he can not attend. He was able to speak and settle for every problem he faced, but he could not be charmed by the admissions department of eight colleges. His parents are very disappointed that Bartleby was not admitted to college. His parents believe that if Bartleby does not go to college, he has no future. Several friends of Bartleby are in the same situation that they are rejected by all the colleges they have applied to. To satisfy his parents, Bartleby has the idea of ​​starting his own college with a website. They convert an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. The website states, however, that we accept everyone. On the first day of school there are an unexpected number of students who have been rejected by all colleges. With a million dollar study fee, Bartleby has to turn his fake college into a working one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as a college dean. The fun starts with designing your own curriculum, setting your own rules, and celebrating the night away. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The requirement to start a college without teaching staff is a bit off. Since it was a bad college, Bartleby really did not need a staff. The movie reminded me of the classic movie "Animal House," the college environment, the Brotherhood, lots of gags, and pretty young women. These new college freshmen had a different idea of ​​what the college experience was about. Not only does the movie have a lot of humor, it also has a good message for life. People should reach for their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not be content with what other people want from them. The end was a bit unrealistic, but it's just a movie. The film was made for the young audience to have a bit of fun. (Universal Pictures, Running time 1:32, Rated PG-13) (7/10)
