I watch a lot of movies, but right now Asian horror is my number one genre. I just bought this DVD and found "Janghwa, Hongryeon" a fascinating but confused movie because I did not understand many parts of the story. But I saw a message on the IMDb board titled "A masterpiece explanation (all questions answered) Faster Load", written by Opiemar, and I was really impressed by the high quality of explanations this user had missed viewers like me history. I would like to congratulate Opiemar for his outstanding work and suggest that he write a proper summary of this film in IMDb to help and guide other viewers. is a great Korean movie, but I do not vote ten in my vote, because few people can afford to watch the same movie more than once, as this movie demands, and without the great support of Opiemar I would not be able to to understand the story as a whole. I intend to see this movie again in the near future. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo" ("fear")
