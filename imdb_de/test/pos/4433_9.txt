After visiting the Kimbell Museum in Forth-Worth, Texas, USA, having enjoyed the art and architecture (including the adjoining Modern Art Museum) and having a charming conversation with the knowledgeable bookstore lady, I bought a Propos DVD pretty high quality expectations? and was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The thematic approach, dramatic tensions, revealing interviews, archive footage and stunning architecture are also mixed in a coherent whole to explore the life of the late iconic Louis I. Khan. <br /> <br /> The documentary begins: contemplative classical pieces of music, archives are overlaid with a reflective, shady face and blur letters that symbolically point to a train window that passes through a backdrop landscape? A journey, focus and blurriness, the search finally ends in an article in a newspaper. Nathanial Khan reads on the front page of the New York Times, where his father is simultaneously praised as the best American architect and his death is announced. <br /> <br /> "When I read this obituary for the first time, I have to admit that I was searching for my own name, and I was his child, his only son, I did not know my father very well never married my mother and he never lived with us. (?) He died when I was eleven years old. "Years later, this illegitimate son is still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father, seems a great professional and to be a public figure, but who does not know his secret private life escapes him and influences him to the point where he wants to do something about it. <br /> <br /> "For years I had trouble satisfying the small pieces of my father's life, but it was not enough, I had to get to know him, I needed to find out who he really was I would go on a journey to see his buildings and find out what's left of him out there, I'd go to the other side of the world and look for the man who asked so many questions. " br /> <br /> The documentation is thus two Through a slow, systematic discovery of the world-renowned architect, we learn: 1) his ideas, buildings and the architectural perspective and 2) his families, collaborators, the lives of people and people affected by him The Human Perspective <br /> The DVD also provides additional information with a Q & A with the author / director and additional material containing such great Louis I Khan quotes: "All that everyone says is the truth i their truth. It can not be factual. "And" a good idea that does not happen is not an idea at all. "<br /> <br /> This film is a journey of discovery Self-discovery and discovery of a man A great man, yet a man imperfect like all of us We meet him through the eyes of an admiring and slightly bitter son, but with the openness and objectivity that he can explore without subtle conclusions and without judgment <br /> In key interviews with people who interacted with him in various ways: We slowly assembled some parts, until this final interview with him Bangladeshi man who seems to bring it home with understandable and reasonable comments <br /> Brilliant architect, brilliant documentation.
