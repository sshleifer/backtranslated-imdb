Visit the story of Sweeney Todd ... The strangest, most repugnant, but most wonderful Broadway musical. It's reassuring, funny and moves at once through Sondheim's most memorable and unbelievable score and sharp performances. George Hearn is incomparable in the title role. He brings along a strong voice (and no pun intended), while Angela Lansbury offers the comical relief of happily crushing his victims into meat pies. If you just allow yourself to enjoy it, "Sweeney Todd" is a real treat.
