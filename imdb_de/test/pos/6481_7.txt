I saw the movie about 13 years ago when I lived in Airlie Beach Qld Australia. I found it on the shelves of a small shop in the back that most people do not browse. <br /> <br /> For my pleasure, I found it and saw it with the intention of someday owning it and being in my collection. I still do not have it, but I will one day. <br /> <br /> I like the concept with the poetry and the imagination. The half-abandoned street scenes with a busy city in the background expanded the visual effect. <br /> <br /> I have mentioned this movie several times by people who enjoy this genre with nothing but praise. It has remained in my memory and will come for a long time. <br /> <br /> I can fully recommend this film, but only to those who are in this type. <br /> <br /> This commentary and the one from LA, CA can help you choose this movie. The comments may be negative, but I found them positive if you leave the derogatory connotation behind.
