I wanted to love this movie. Everything seemed ready for a fun, if not groundbreaking movie. Located in the south of France, good-looking and recognizable actors led the cast, and I really admired the vibrant African costumes, the proverbs, and the music. Despite everything, I did not love it. Films are meant to convey their meaning at first glance, but "Secret Laughter" does not. Nimi and Matthew, played by Long and Firth (both of whom have played romantic leads before and should have known better), radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish. I purposely used "dried fish" because it was one of the few - too few - strong lines and moments in the whole movie. Another winner was when Nimi sniffed at her apartment. He finds a book of her with her first name on it and says, "Her name is Nimi, I never knew." Then he insists she calls him by his first name. I watched this scene carefully as Matthew Nimi asked "to say my name" over and over again, and I realized that until that moment, they always named themselves after their surnames. I thought that was a turning point for the movie and I expected it to get better. Did not Do It Why does Nimi and Matthew always seem to be in ten steps, even in this "say my name" scene? What does Matthew like about Nimi, aside from her obvious beauty? And why would a sensible woman like Nimi fall in love with a comic book author who sees his marriage as something he can put off when a beautiful exotic "adventure" comes? And I would like to add that it was a bit difficult for me to be behind a romance based on adultery. Yes, Jenny is a vicious harpy, but if I was in her shoes, I would probably use her Cruella tactic to keep my husband from wandering. Believe it. The story suggests Nimi's painful past, but never fully explores it. Some critics say Firth seemed a bit awkward here, and I agree. For God's sake, the actor conjured up more yearning and passion than the snob Mr. Darcy of the early 19th century (and while wearing those hideous breasts)! With Long, who shines in Love Jones, she sometimes seemed to focus more on her accent than playing her character. Nevertheless, there were many moments? the "say my name" scene among them ?? when she was completely in control and came across really well. However, "Secret Laughter" is not without its redeeming qualities, and I have found that it has grown with more sight to me. Nene was well portrayed as supportive and well-intentioned, though she does not fully understand Nimi's allure to Matthew. I absolutely loved it when Nene confronted Mama Fola in these duel proverbs. My husband liked it, and usually he's the first to sigh and insult the screen if he does not like what's going on. He even laughed about the scene when Sammy asked Matthew some very open questions about sex. So there you are. 'Secret Laughter' was good enough to entertain a self-confessed Curmudgeon like my husband, but an avid moviegoer like me will need more than a spectator to understand what the director and writer are trying to convey.
