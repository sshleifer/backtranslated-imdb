Everyone told me that this movie was not good and was ill etc., so I finally rented it and was amazed. I thought the torture was going to get a lot worse, but in the end it was shocking, but that's about it. I would not call it a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something under the category "Silence of the Lambs" and / or "Kiss the Girls". Sometimes it got stupid, but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of the seat. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R - for severe torture, violence, language and sexuality
