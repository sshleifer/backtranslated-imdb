Like most people, I'm tired of the many clich√© movies Hollywood does. There does not seem to be any creativity in Hollywood. Companies that only spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience. <br /> <br /> This movie is a welcome change. It could be classified as a romantic comedy for its genre, but do not let this movie turn it off. This is a very original movie that is not like most things that Hollywood produces. <br /> <br /> As you read this, you already know the basics, so I will not care. The only films that come to mind to compare this are "Interstate 60" and "Art of Travel," which are little known jewels that take a different route than most garbage rubbish in Hollywood. It's worth it to see each other when you are fed up with seeing more of them. <br /> <br /> Dean
