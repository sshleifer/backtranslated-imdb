May we intervene in the everyday life of our fellow human beings? Is it possible to invade her intimacy, to penetrate the inwardness of her thoughts and to violate the privacy of her own home without being accused? The director expresses doubts about these seemingly solvable issues, which are almost sympathetic to Judge Jean Luis' destabilizing decision to deal with his own self-contained self-denial with the help of his life fragments. <br /> <br /> Trois couleurs: Rouge "is based on the concept of" UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION KNOWN AS THE HUMAN WISHES OF AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE WORLD. "The phone can be considered the protagonist of the story: after its performance in" Decalogue 9 "In the beginning, Kieslowski 's viewers are given the encore, followed by step by step in his quick world tour." The director takes a deep look at the ability of people to communicate without taking a clear stance on the ethical side of individual behavior the unpredictability of future events by venting careful descriptions of strange lives and returns of life, separated by a considerable number of years, inexplicable combinations that strangely converge in a series of ongoing and exciting situations - some books fall on the streets - One of them opens casually often on a fatal side and determines the fate of a future profession as in a similar event of the past. - fleeting insights into everyday life, ideally combined with her preference for the fictitious musician Van den Budermayer. - The happiness of man is characterized by the most unfortunate coincidence. <br /> <br /> In this work, which deserves to be seen with our hearts, rather than our thoughts, we can have a dialectical play between Judge Jean Luis' (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Valentine Dussaut (Irene Jacob perhaps the sweetest actress of our time, along with the beautiful Winona Ryder), in a generational conflict between the experience of a world-weary old man and the self-confident immaturity of a nice girl approaching the steepest path of her ascending path. Kieslowski speaks of "dialogue tests" between a disappointed human life and a young person who is unaware of his future, between a mindless misanthrope and a spontaneous girl who has a feeling of selflessness. The smell of tragedy still lingers in the air. All the protagonists of the entire trilogy have been proving his great passion for the cinema through evidence that has been saved by a fortuitous stroke of luck thanks to the skilful scheme of deliberation. There remains only a sense of bitter regret and emptiness to remind us of the existence of a void that is impossible to fill. Goodbye KRZYSZTOF. WE MISS YOU SO MUCH!
