Reasonably effective horror / science fiction films like "Alien" are quite good given their limited ambitions. Some nice special effects and well thought-out action sequences correct the cracks in the rather tedious dialogue. When a spaceship crashes on a remote planet, survivors quickly realize that they are facing terrible terror in the darkness of the impending total solar eclipse.
