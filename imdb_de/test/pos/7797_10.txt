This movie is an amazing comedy. The script is too funny. If you look at it more than once, you will enjoy it more. Although the comedy is sometimes stupid, it really makes you laugh !! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have done justice to their roles. After 1994, I never met a Hindi movie that was so funny.
