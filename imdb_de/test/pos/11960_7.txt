It's a simple fact that many of us have grown up in the '80s generation who loved these shapeless John Cusack comedies by Savage Steve Holland, and though I'd prefer that there are other, more bizarre, out-of-the-way bands, Better Off Dead, It's Hard One Crazy Summer, a movie I loved as a child with all my heart in my youth. OCS was a successor to Better Off Dead and returned Cusack and Curtis Armstrong from this film. <br /> <br /> Cusack is Hoops, followed by his graduation buddy Joel Murray (George) to Nantucket for the summer, having fun on the beach. Hoops is involved in a feud with a blond buff punk named Teddy Beckersted, whose greedy father has plans to ransack a neighborhood's quarters to build a huge condominium. One of the houses whose mortgage must be repaid belongs to Demi Moore (Cassandra). There's a sailboat race that might be their only hope of saving Cassandra's grandfather's house (he was recently deceased), but Teddy has won it in recent years, and Hoops is scared to death of boats above water. But with the help and motivation of newly-discovered Nantucket friends (such as Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as automechanical twin brothers!), George and the up-and-coming, affectionate Cassandra, Hoops may be able to deal with his fears and win the race for the neighborhood to rescue. Armstrong has a supporting role as the son of a crazy, manic arms salesman, General Raymond (Joe Flaherty of SCTV in an inspired casting), Ack who uses his father's training to help hoops and companies in their goals win the race. <br /> <br /> Among the memorable scenes is that Bobcat gets stuck in a Godzilla suit (!) conditioning over an entire model of Aguilla Beckersted (Mark Metcalf, barely recognizable as Teddy's rather invincible pop), and Hoops are pursued by confused Boy Scouts seeking first aid, George a victim of poisonous bloating, Bruce Wagner's crazy Uncle Frank's growing madness every time he tries to improve his chance of winning $ 1 million from a radio show, and the wonderful Billie Bird as George's granny, who actually counts the group after a meal! Jeremy Piven as (you guessed it) a brutal idiot allied with Teddy and causing trouble to Hoops and his posse, the fat Kimberly Foster as a cookie (Teddy's girl trying to be with Hoops while he's with his Lunch together eats father) and the only William Hickey as Old Man Beckersted, who brings no inheritance to his son and grandson, if they lose the sailboat race. Demi Moore is cute, but this is Cusack's vehicle, though Bobcat and Villard steal most of the scenes. Again, throughout the film some charming animations from the Netherlands are scattered (Hoops is an artist). If you like his films, I recommend the underrated How to Into College.
