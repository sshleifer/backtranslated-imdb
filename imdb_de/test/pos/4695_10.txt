To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan in one of the many DVD comments, this "shaky music" above the HTV logo was enough to lift me from what I did to put my face on the screen for an hour glue. The individual stories in the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful. Robin of Loxley makes a very convincing journey through the two series in which he appears, though his departure from the program was not planned. Marian is also developing her relationship with the two Hernes sons very well. <br /> <br /> After landing in the TV Desert for years, I encountered the series on Sky 1 in the UK in the mid-1990s and was even more impressed that the series seemed even better than I remembered , This is not a children's television program, it deals with witchcraft, betrayal, rebellion and injustice. And he manages to show without too much blood. As I recall, in the pilot, you can only see some of the red stuff (episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD set). The DVDs are great and contain a variety of extras, including Series 3 cast comments (Jason Connery Robin) and crew commentaries on Series 1 and 2. The picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing /> The idea of ​​freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing is forgotten. Nothing has ever been forgotten.
