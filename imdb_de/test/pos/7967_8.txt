I have reasons to love the great users of a camera. flowing courses of action lend themselves to fast-paced adventure and comedy stories; Such a skill, which is in the hands of a King Vidor or Anthony Mann, can also be applied to work on the idea level. This is the masterpiece of Paul Wendkos. His action can be offered in a single set of sentences. General Hector Cordoba sets up as the imperial emperor in northern Mexico and steals a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. He sends his crack mission unit, split, worried, but determined, led by George Peppard, to return the cannon and revive Cordoba to put an end to the rebellion. Charismatic Raf Vallone plays Cordoba; The ladies in the play are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York; with the squad even further from Nico Minardos, Peter Deuel and Don Gordon. Other stalwarts in the class are John Larch and John Russell. Miss Ralli and a stubborn Mexican teniente (Gabriela Tinti), whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba set herself up, also rush on a fantastically dangerous operation. The danger multiplies when Gordon's brother is captured as an Adventist spy and tortured to death while he has to be careful ... and he decides to kill Peppard. The attack that captures the cannon if Peppard's orders are not followed by a regular army type is one of the most exciting visual and staged scenes in film history. The penetration of the fortress of Cordoba, the revelations discovered there and the actions that give the mission team a chance of victory - or almost victory - are presented perfectly. This is a beautiful color adventure movie with unusually strong costumes, drama, lights, art direction sets and music by Elmer Bernstein. The screenplay by Stephen Kandel is probably the best thing ever for a feature film. This is probably the most underrated Western state at the moment, but I've always valued its heroes as a result of getting hard workers. But as Peppard reminds his group on the way home, "The problem of being a 'hero' is the morning after." To find out why he says that, you have to see "Cannon For Cordoba".
