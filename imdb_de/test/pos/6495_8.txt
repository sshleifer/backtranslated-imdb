What do you mean by the son of the actor, not the actor? You do not become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar. That does not work that way, at least not in the UK. Macbeth (this version) is a Scottish budget movie. You can not compare this to the Polanski version as Polanski has all the world's budgets. <br /> <br /> Jason traded throughout the school, but in 1985 he broke the role of Robin Hood in the British television series Robin of Sherwood. Since then, he has been involved in many films, including "Shanghai Noon" and "Lord of the Rings 2". Jason has since pushed behind the camera and founded the production company Unconditional Entertainment. He recently shot his last movie, starring Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ray Winstone. <br /> <br /> And all this has nothing to do with being the son of Sean Connery. If you think Jason said to Sean, "Dad, I want to be in Macbeth's movie you're going to film," Sean said, "sure, son, whatever you say," and phoned and got his son's role, you're wrong you. In fact, Jason Connery is cut out of his father's will. Given his father's Sean Connery, that's a big part of Jason's change. The reasons for the decision seem to be Sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to look after himself. The relationship has become quite tense and Jason even threatened to change his name. <br /> <br /> --------------------- --------------- As the son of Sean Connery, <br /> <br /> "I realize that I am always compared to my father, there are always hints, should I spend all my life justifying myself?" ----------- --------------------- <br /> So stop being a donkey and accuse him of being unable to act just because he's the son of Sean Connery is (big deal!). Watch Jason in Bullet to Beijing and you form a different opinion about his acting skills.
