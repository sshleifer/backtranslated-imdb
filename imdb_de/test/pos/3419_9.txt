Where this film differs from the traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of emotion. In Europe, for example, we had years of wars, and although one nation could never exterminate the other, the old enemies always lived side by side or MIT at the end of the conflict. In the United States, the white population of immigrants almost destroyed indigenous people to extinction. The US citizen never had to live with his enemy. This explains in my view the often simple character of the Hollywood film when he tries to explain the conflict of a foreign country. But in this film, the director and the script did not fall into this clich√©. It turns out that everyone in the story has something right and something wrong. It's a great story about morality, hidden truth and compromise.
