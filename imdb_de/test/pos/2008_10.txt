The young filmmaker has a talent for quickly capturing his audience with unusual camera work and thrifty but intense scripts. The concept of combining animations with live footage is remarkably well executed and the soundtrack is very good. <br /> <br /> The decision to publish the film in twelve parts online makes the director a fascinating episode enough for the viewer to invest in buying the next episode. I just wish all movies had this obligation to entertain the audience in their stories. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
