Daniel Percival's "Dirty War," a BBC production for television, was recently shown on cable. The film has a documentary style in the way it caused the nearby Holocaust in one of the world's major cities, London. In fact, this film, produced in 2004, is a cautious story of the events of the following year, when terrorists used public transport explosives to kill innocent people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time <br /> The film impresses with the speed that the director and the production team gave to the project. There are no boring moments in the film as we see the preparation of the terrorists and the people who are following their dirty work. Although the inevitable happens, it's amazing to think about the consequences of having a real "dirty bomb" planted in such a densely populated area. <br /> <br /> The last pictures of the movie are daunting. The mob scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated makes people shudder and think that this could happen somewhere.
