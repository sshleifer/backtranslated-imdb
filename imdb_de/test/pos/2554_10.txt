Chop Shop is a hidden treasure in the theaters! I can not begin to describe how wonderful the performances in this film are. This movie is for anyone who wants to see an impressive story and see an example of how contemporary films should look and look. <br /> <br /> This film is about a little boy, Alejandro "Ale", who works and lives with his teenage sister Isamar "Izzie" in a small one-room loft in a car shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (which I did not even know existed - Willits Points), where there are endless junkyards and body shops. Here Bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children, who hoped to feed themselves by buying and repairing a transporter. Ale earns money by helping out at the dealership, and Izzie helps with a van; Both, however, earn additional money. Ale sells bootleg films and stolen car parts; Izzie sells herself. Her life is surrounded by sand and grief, but though both testimonies live in her hard world and barely survive, her love for each other is never stained by the dirt that surrounds her. And occasionally they are able to laugh and enjoy moments of their childhood stolen from the reality of the struggle to survive and stay together. <br /> <br /> The best comparison I have for Chop Shop is that Bahrani is standing side by side. The innocent love between family members for such a sombre atmosphere is as powerful as that of Mama Roma of Pasolini in combination with the fighting growing up too fast in an adverse environment, just like in Bresson's Mouchette. Co-authored, directed Bahrani is a full-package filmmaker who has worked on this film as well as his first movie "Man Push Cart" (which has received awards around the world). I can only hope that his films will not be hidden treasures long!
