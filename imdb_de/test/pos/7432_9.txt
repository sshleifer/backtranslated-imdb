I'm an avid ff7 fan. For example, I sold the game and sold it (bad mistake), but then buy again (good mistake ... um). <br /> <br /> anyway, yes, this movie is very good. The fights are very cool, the music is very good and the cgi, which you can not falter. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed the movie was the lack of other characters. Great character, you can not beat Cid and Barret. <br /> <br /> but still the movie was great in my opinion and a must see. <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie will give it 9/10 <br /> <br /> squaresoft, make more movies like this and you will be more revered than you already are !!!!
