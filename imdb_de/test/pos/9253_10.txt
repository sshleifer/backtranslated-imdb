*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Now that I'm a big H: LOTS fan, maybe I like the movie more than normal people. However, this movie is still excellent. There were a lot of surprises and gave the series another graduation. While I was sad that Bayliss was a murderer, the overall feeling I felt was content.
