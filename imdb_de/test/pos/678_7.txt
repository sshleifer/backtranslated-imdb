The film, with its single set, minimal cast and uncomplicated photography (aside from a few short special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60-minute drama dramas that were so popular in the early years of television. Still, the tension is heavy on the poor warrior ida Ida Lupino as she tries to cope with her semi-psychotic artisan Robert Ryan before one of his mood swings kills her. And who could play the anxious role better than this great actor Ryan? He was not very versatile - it's almost painful to watch the essay comedy. But no one was better off in the injured idealism (On Dangerous Ground) or the psychological pain of this movie. Few actors could express so much with their eyes as this slim and towering figure. <br /> <br /> Lupino's problem is that she is locked up with a man who is kind and gentle in a moment and rages the next. The tension comes from their various tricks to make him happy in the escape attempt. It's definitely a thrill. This is not one of Lupino's many fine "soulful" parts where she was so good. Instead, it's a role that many smaller actresses could have done well enough. My favorite scene is with Ryan and the breasted teenager Margaret Whiting. Ryan's already having trouble with his masculinity and what others say about him. When Whiting then comes in and finds the attractive-looking Ryan scrubbing the floor, she becomes shy and flirts with her burgeoning sexuality. Ryan senses difficulties and stops them abruptly - finesse is not his strength. Offended, Whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work "women's work". It does. Until then, he was polite and professional with Lupino, trying to follow a normal path. But Whiting has hit his nerve. Now there is a lot to pay for when Whiting jumps out of the door and leaves the price to Lupino. It's a fascinating scene that's been done professionally. Anyway, these are a dozen films produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when audiences moved away from these little black and white musicians in favor of widescreen goggles. Too bad. What an enormously talented character she was both behind the camera and in front. She deserves at least one honorary Oscar from a film industry to which she has contributed so much.
