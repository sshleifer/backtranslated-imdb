I've seen this on TCM recently and through the IMDb I found out that there were seven "Crime Doctor" movies with Warner Baxter as a psychiatrist detective. Baxter is a bit long compared to his stiff performance on 42nd Street a decade ago. Not noir and a bit belligerent today, the film also has a hint of the supernatural. The storyline, black-and-white cinematography, and characters are far more complex than those of the Moto and Charlie Chan series. There are subplots, unexpected twists and appearances of a series of B films that we all should recognize right away (no one has made it into the A status). It's a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes. I would like to see a DVD series of these films.
