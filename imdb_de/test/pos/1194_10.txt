Just unbelievable! Humor, upbeat music, and an anti-war message make it probably the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love how smart this movie is, especially in the Vietnamese part plot. It's interesting how they ridicule the officers who enforce the design. Follow that with the serious situation of real war and the conclusion (which boils me with anger over the war); and yet there is absolutely no screen violence. Wow. <br /> <br /> Also the music is really cool. What is very unique in this musical (unlike Evita or Wizard of Oz, for example) is that the lyrics do not tell the story. The mood makes (along with the visuals and the intercommunion dialogue): "Donna" is a happy song that emphasizes the happy mood, while "Flesh Failures" has a driving, intense beat in a minor key. <br /> <br /> I also notice that the LSD scene is not particularly flattering. Now I will definitely not use any drugs (not what I've ever intended). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an amazing movie. The only negative comment I could say is that the dialogue is sometimes hard to hear. But who cares? 10/10 stars!
