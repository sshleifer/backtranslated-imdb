The majesty of Ramin Bahrani's second function is that, like a poet, he represents the soul of humanity and makes it thrive on the screen. CHOP SHOP is far beyond most indie films and is wise, which radiates the best of the great cinema of the time. We can look back on the works of Bresson and Pasolini and compare Bahrani's work with theirs, and yet CHOP SHOP is fresh and urgent for modern society. We can see the working method of a master here? A certain sense of beauty, style and content merge into a movie that reminds us of what it means to be alive. Instead of focusing on the side of New York, we often see that we live and breathe with our young hero Alejandro in penniless Willits Point. a fascinating quasi sub-world of our culture? and yet it is a very, very real place. Alejandro has to feed himself and his older sister. Watch this movie and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that Bahrani leads us to. all with deep and concise realism.
