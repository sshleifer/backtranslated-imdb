"River's Edge" is based on current events and is a David Lynch-style film about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but nobody cares about it for a long time. With top-notch actors from Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper we can forgive the average acting of everyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a small boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller), dropping a doll from a bridge (murder 1). Tim then hears someone screaming. When he looks up he sees Samson (Daniel Roebuck) on the bank of the river with the dead naked body of his girlfriend behind him (murder no. 2). Samson finally shows the corpse to his friends. Everyone is appalled, not only for the murder, but also because the victim Jamie (Danyi Deats) was a friend of theirs. Nevertheless, nobody goes to the police. You may think that this is unrealistic, but that's what happened in real history. If you are familiar with the story of "Alpha Dog" (2006), you will know that the same thing happened there too. Layne (Crispin Glover) is working to get Samson to safety, although no one (including Samson) seems interested in keeping him out of harm's way. Over time, we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper), a middle-aged man who sells drugs to local youth, has previously killed a woman (Murder 3). From here, things start to close to Samson and his friends, and eventually everything is revealed, but not as you might expect. <br /> <br /> In the film, we learn of three murders, each of which has a different reason, a different reaction and a different effect on those involved. When Tim drops his younger sister's doll off the bridge, we are never made aware of his motive. However, we see the reaction of the younger sister. She cries and screams while her mother comforts her. Later, her older brother Matt (Keanu Reeves) helps her put a cross in the yard to commemorate her doll. The murder of Jamie terrifies everyone (except Samson, who is apathetic for the whole situation, and when he was asked by Layne why he did it, Samson answers with, "She said shit."), But they do not sob or scream , they run away and continue their lives trying to forget what happened. In Feck's situation, he did not kill his girlfriend out of hatred. We never really know why he killed her, but we see that Feck is not proud of what he did. He even mentions that he is sorry and that she loved her. From this we see the different ways in which we can be influenced by death. In the film, we can easily identify with the adolescents because they do not know what they feel or how they should feel about their friend's death. Similarly, we viewers do not know how to feel because we do not know Jamie. We are obviously saddened by death and realize that Samson should be arrested, but we do not particularly care for Jamie as an individual. <br /> <br /> There are several similarities between "River's Edge" and "Twin Peaks". (1990-1991), especially in the overall feeling of the film. I'm wondering if Mark Frost and David Lynch were thinking about "River's Edge" when creating their series. Finally, Tim Hunter staged three episodes of "Twin Peaks". Crispin Glover's performance as hyperactive, wild Layne is an Oscar-worthy achievement. Always in a hurry and always worried that Samson will not get caught, Layne is an intense character who seems to be on speed. If you've seen Crispin Glover in any movie, you know he can deliver a line like no other. It is always a pleasure to see him in his performance. The other great achievement in "River's Edge" comes from Dennis Hopper. His portrayal of Feck, the closed drug dealer who has a leg and an inflatable sex doll called Elly, reminded me of a slightly softer and more humorous version of Frank Booth, Hopper's character in David Lynch's Blue Velvet (1986) River's Edge is a great movie, and I think it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic when in reality we have to do something about it and speak out against the evils in the world.
