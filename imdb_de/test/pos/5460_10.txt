Although made for HBO by cable, it's an entertaining movie and a fascinating look at the restrained and double world of television. Allowing the viewer to catch a glimpse behind the scenes of the late night talk show wars of the early '90s, Jay Leno and David Letterman fought for the coveted position of hosting the Tonight Show. Kathy Bates gives a Bravo performance as Leno's Mercator Helen Helen Kushnick and one can feel empathy for what Leno / Letterman had to endure by TV managers. Equally up-to-date, considering recent events related to ABC's failed attempt to replace Nightline with Letterman. No matter how many times I've seen this movie, it's still a pleasure to look at it when I first aired it. If this ever was to be released on DVD, I would add it to my collection.
