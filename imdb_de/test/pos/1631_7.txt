I go to the cinema to talk. The first movie in this series entertained me a lot: The DaVinci Code. It had many twists and turns to interest me very much. Angels and demons is no different. If you liked the DaVinci code, you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie. Angels and Demons is done in the same style as the previous movie, but faster, which I liked. Ron Howard held me in place for two hours without getting a bit bored. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about this movie was that, although it is obviously fictional, it leaves enough history it seems very credible. If there is one thing I did not like about this movie, then the plot itself is unbelievable (does not want to spoil). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained during the whole thing and was very happy with what I saw.
