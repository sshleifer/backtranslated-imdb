I think the movie is fabulous because it has so many emotions. From the script and the fabulous acting one can recognize that behind all feelings there is a story. They understand why the characters perform certain actions and why they do not make others. You can feel compassion and joy, love and sorrow for all at the same time. They see humanity at their best and from their worst side. You can refer to the characters, even if you have never been in their exact situation before you see qualities and falls in them that you see in yourself. To a certain extent, this film makes you wonder why it is surprising, but in the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding, not only in you, but also for the characters. I'll say that I have never cried so much in my life and have not gained so much from anything. I implore you to watch this movie and to take its meaning to heart. That there is only one true thing and that is ... love.
