The third entry in the "Stepford" franchise, but apparently the three obscure sequences made for television are incredibly dark and hard to find, while the original of the 70s and the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are well known and popular. I did not see the "Revenge of the Stepford Wives" of the early '80s nor "The Stepford Husbands" of the mid-'90s, but this "The Stepford Children" is a pretty charming and extremely entertaining little movie. It's basically the same movie as the original; obviously less mysterious, but much cheesier and incredible to the nth degree. The main difference here, as the title implies, is that not only the liberated wives, but also the rebellious and punk newcomers in the city undergo the typical and highly effective "Stepford treatment" approved by the local men's association. For some reason, the scenario tries to keep the mystery of Stepford open until late in the movie, though probably no one will look at this sequel before checking the original and probably everyone knows about the resolution. The Harding family is packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford. Especially father Steven is thrilled with her new life, because he already lived in Stepford and wanted to return again and again, since his first wife, about whom his new wife Laura and his adolescent children Mary and David know very little, died under mysterious circumstances. The city is almost too perfect, with quaint neighbors and model students, and especially the modern teens have great adjustment difficulties. Their efforts to modernize the site and get Stanford's local youth under control create confrontations with respectable citizens, especially members of the Men's Association, and put stress on family relationships. David meets the last "normal" girl in the Lois school and falls in love with her. But even if she turns into a house dummy overnight, David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the weird Stanford mystery. The first hour of "The Stanford Children" is slow and pretty tame, but the finale is trashy and cheesy, like the VHS cover promise and how a thriller of the late 80s should be. The approach behind Stanford's secrets is presented in more detail, and I think horror fans and original film lovers will appreciate that. At least I did it. The overall presentation still does not make much sense, and the script is full of irrational aspects, but it's still an appealing formula that undoubtedly creates an atmosphere of tension and fear. The acting performances are well above average. Especially the arrogant and disgusting members of the Men's Association show plausible characters and even the teenage players Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff make impressive achievements. Recommended without hesitation!
