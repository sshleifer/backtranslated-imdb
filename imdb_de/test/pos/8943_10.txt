I think this movie deserves 10 out of 10 points because it's weirdly funny from beginning to end. The plot is simple and straightforward, but it always keeps you attentive and there are so many laughs that you really start loving it. When I saw this movie, I did not hear much and did not know what to expect. I thought it would be an old women's movie like Calendar Girls or something, but that totally surprised me. Although I'm still a teenager and the movie was probably not intended for my age group, I thought it was great anyway and I think it would appeal to all ages. I think it's a pity it's not famous at all and deserves more publicity so more people see it and realize what a great movie it is.
