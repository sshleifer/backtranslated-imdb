Big Fat Liar is a great watch for children of all ages, including adults. I had a great time watching this movie and I recommend it to children under 10 years of age. The laughter never stops and the adventurous plot is pretty good too! Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is weird! All in all a nice movie for kids to enjoy and just have a great time.
