I did not read the novel on which the film is based. So I can not comment on what's missing or if any changes have been made. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I had a wonderful experience watching THE KITE RUNNER. I find that when I see films about different cultures. Here in the USA I learn how other peoples live and exist. The actors in this film are from Afghanistan and other countries in the region. There are 3 little kids in this upcoming epic movie in their first roles. They were wonderful. <br /> <br /> The scenes that were allegedly in Kabul were filmed in different parts of China, I assume that the area is similar to the actual places in the book. <br /> <br /> Mark Foster directed & he found NEVRRLAND FINDEN. He created the same magic here. <br /> <br /> All aspects of production are first class. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a better movie than the nominated and won Oscars. <br /> <br /> The film has a subtitle, it is very clear to read. It has a correct PG-13 rating. SPOILER ALERT --- The rape scene in children is handled very well. <br /> <br /> However, I can not rate this as 4 stars, as the plot and plot that we have often seen is less. This is a very worthwhile movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
