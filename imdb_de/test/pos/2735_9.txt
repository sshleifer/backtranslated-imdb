This is a multi-faceted, insightful and courageous story about the people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and our) perception and realities. Although the main theme is an insane young woman, history flirts with physics, medicine, religion, and even politics, as it challenges our perception of what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma miraculously conveys that the world in which Mithi lives is as real to her as ours is to us. In this world, it is logical and its thoughts are consistent in themselves, not the nonsense they seem to us in our world. <br /> <br /> Here are a few great scenes to watch out for as you watch the movie (don't worry, they're not spoilers, I loved the way Aparna Sen put these comments in) History. <br /> <br /> - The clues to quantum mechanics and relativity mingled with the witch doctor ("Ojha" in Hindi), who performed his religious rituals dispelling the "spirits" that sit in Mithis brain. <br /> <br /> - The doctor prescribes the shock treatment as a solution that is believed to "work" <br /> <br /> - Perception Window - The scene about the review of Anus's book. <br / > <br /> - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director looking for "Maya." <br /> <br /> - News footage that George Bush told the world that "undoubtedly in his head" is that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (now it is not so The truth is how the gullible public perceives weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.) <br /> <br /> - One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mithi Anu says, "Charu sent this man to beat me" and Anu of course rejects it. Konkona did a fantastic job producing the strange mixture of confused thoughts in a schizophrenia brain as her world and the real world collided. <br /> <br /> Aparna Sen was courageous but not brave enough to ask a big question: is almost all humanity insane in believing in God? She could have put in some scenes about "normal," "healthy," people praying and sacrificing for a being no one has ever seen or heard in all of human history (the ritual / exorcism scene does not go far enough). That would be the ultimate question: what is normal? Who has the truth, the faith or the atheist? <br /> <br /> IMHO, this film is a much more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than "A Beautiful Mind." It not only looks at the sick, but also at the healthy from different angles, enlightening our understanding of our own mind and our world. If the former received 4 Oscars, it deserves more - at least one for Story, Screenplay, Director, Konkona and Shabana Azmi. It was really a pleasure to watch this movie, and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. <br /> <br /> This was a very well told story.
