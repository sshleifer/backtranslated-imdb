I personally LOVE this movie in the midst of the Halloween series. After seeing it with many friends, I've found that you enjoy it completely or find it absolutely unbearable. Personally, I have seen it dozens of times and it never gets old. There is a great background story in the movie itself, and many different things are finally explained. It's a pretty short movie with just under 90 minutes, but it's definitely an exciting ride. <br /> <br /> The form seems pretty brutal in this movie, but the acting is still there as walks, stalks and kills. There are many nice little screenshots of Micheal appearing in the background, adding a bit of a scary element to the movie.
