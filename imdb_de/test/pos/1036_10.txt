The absolute best I've ever seen on TV. It was entertaining and informative. The reason I found this site is to try to figure out how to see it again. <br /> <br /> Given the current understanding of the story, we must sympathize with General Leslie Groves, who was responsible for the nuts and bolt the implementation of the Manhattan Project. Certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most people used to think. <br /> <br /> The casting for the portrayed real-life people was outstanding. It was the first time I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor. Apart from the altitude, he looked very much like Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> I was particularly fascinated by the early scene in which Oppenheimer heads a class of doctoral students.
