As a movie freak, I'd obviously read all the agonizing reviews and funny, sarcastic comments on this movie (my favorite is Woody Allen's joker "If I lived my life again, I would not change anything ... except seeing." The musical remake from Lost Horizon "), so I could never look at it without chuckling the choreography / set / songs, etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and saw it for the first time in years together with a friend who is still He had really enjoyed it, and after trying to hide all the negative prejudices I obviously had about the movie, so did I. It's nothing particularly bad about Lost Horizon, and it is a lot more enjoyable and observable than in many other movies of the early 70s, it is not even very lager.The lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simple, but that's not nic It's really obvious when you hear them for the first time or when you make a mistake in advance, so you're ready to make fun of them. All critics claiming that the cast is out of tune fall apart as Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were dubbed (also brilliant as the vocals fit perfectly with their voices) and Sally Kellerman is a really cute person has and absolutely unique vocal style. Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey on singing is "The things I will not miss". Particularly noteworthy is the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer as High Lama. His comments on the destruction of humanity are suitable for today's broken world. I would not say for a second that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece (the things I would not miss are the uninspired choreography and Bobby Van's "Question Me An Answer" number, which could easily have been cut), but if They have not even seen Lost Horizon or have not seen it for some time. Without this setting, try "Oh boy, let's laugh about that pile of trash," and you'll be surprised how beautiful it really is.
