It's a shame that Asterix and his buddy Obelix do not receive the worldwide recognition received from other comic book characters. <br /> <br /> This is another funny Asterix cartoon jammed with entertainment. The animation is excellent and the speech characterization is good, even if the synchronization is a bit off. The music and the score fit well into the story, and the insertion of some modern musical numbers is a nice touch. <br /> <br /> The runtime is short and is not the best Asterix story or the most developed cartoon. it's fun to clean. The modern (Disney-like) animation will capture children, Asterix fans and new arrivals ... Enjoy the Gaul adventure!
