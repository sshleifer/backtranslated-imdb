For Gene Kelly's home studio MGM, he needed a movie rental to Columbia to recognize his creative talent and give him some control over his own films. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II. Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn, where Rita is a dancer and Phil Silvers the comic. Of course, Kelly himself is a bit huffy. Hayworth becomes aware of the millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother. Hayworth also plays her own grandmother in some Flashback sequences from the Gaslight era, while Jess Barker plays the young Kruger. You may remember that Jess Barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead, Susan Hayward. <br /> <br /> Broadway producer Lee Bowman also attracts Hayward but is not interested in nostalgia. He wants her for his Ziegfeld Follies Revue, and in fact the largest number of Cover Girl is the title song of the film. It's beautifully done in Follies style. <br /> <br /> Hayworth also sings A Sure Thing in a Gaslight era number and in the only song of the series that was not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, Hayworth also makes an old English number for the music hall Poor John. When I sing, I say, as everyone knows Rita words. Here sing Nan Wynn. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit of the show is Long Ago and Far Away, presented by Gene Kelly. It was one of the biggest hits of World War II and one of the biggest sellers Jerome Kern ever wrote. It's actually the favorite of an aunt of mine who will celebrate 60 years of marriage with my uncle in September. Long Ago and Far Away was nominated for the best song, but did not lose the title Swinging on a Star. <br /> <br /> What makes Cover Girl so special and what makes it a milestone for Gene Kelly are the two numbers that put me to the test and the Alter Ego number. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Mayer refused at MGM to creatively give Kelly control over his own material. Kelly later said the alter ego number is one of the hardest things he's ever tried in his career. In it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and complicated. <br /> <br /> In fact, after another rental, Christmas Holiday at Universal, Louis B. Mayer never borrowed Gene Kelly for the rest of the time when he was at MGM. And from then on he got creative control. <br /> <br /> With this dazzling Technicolor cinematography and Rita's red hair and Gene Kelly's boundless creativity, Cover Girl was and is a classic and will be forever.
