This is probably the best picture that not many will see. It presented a culture in a truly un-Hollywoodized way. A must for those who love indie and for those who do not like it. I think this movie will draw more into the indie scene. The acting was first class! The figure of Alice was so well portrayed. With perfect objectivity. This movie should be brought into the mainstream! I think that would be phenomenal! ALICE is the most realistic look at an element of our culture that I've seen since GO ASK ALICE. A look that is not touched by the Hollywood hand. Movies like this show young people that these things are not glamorous, but that they are real and captivating. If you liked PIECES OF APRIL, you will love this!
