I'm a fan of action movies, but to date I have never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in Italy. That's why I saw "The Long Kiss Goodnight" on pay-TV and hoped for nothing special. <br /> <br /> But what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I've found is the presence of some holes in the storyline, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and funniest action movie ever made. <br /> <br /> The transformation of Samantha / Charly from an ordinary female teacher To recover from amnesia, it seems like a good idea. The action scenes and the stunts are the best I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson adds some of the best lines I've ever heard, and his chemistry with Geena Davis is good. <br /> <br /> And what about Geena? She is wonderful, she plays the best action heroine ever seen, and convinces with compelling acting and fantastic stunts. <br /> <br /> I think this movie had poor box office performance and bad critics because most reviewers and something else the public find it hard to play with strong female lead roles. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
