I'm not sure how that could have been better, so I gave him a 10 (the truck driver's death is an example) outstanding. The story was believable and the length of the series was just right (ie H. I love Lost, but will it ever end?). As a Briton I tend to consider Yanks as Gung Ho. The LAPD were in their ill-advised attempts to arrest him, but the other authorities were positively portrayed. My main idea with programs like this (and the equally excellent 24) is - could it happen? Would it happen? Probably now. <br /> <br /> I hope they will do another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it would not seem like that. <br /> <br /> In summary - If you have not seen anything Make sure you do it.
