I rarely make films that deal with smart doctors who have problems with authority, but "Toy Soldiers" has grown on me with repeated considerations. This is also a movie about Billy Tepper, who has grown up and grown up, and everything else, and I honor Sean Astin and writer / director Daniel Petrie Jr. that they do not make a big deal with it, but just leave it alone Unfold and sneak up on you. The camaraderie of Tepper's friends, their mourning for Joey's death, and their joy in their survival are all genuinely on the move. And I have to admit, I have some patriotic (and maybe a little reptilian) joy as the US Army finally moves in and righteously kicks a naked terrorist in the ass. Ooh-rah, General Kramer! And the heroic Robert Folk score is the cherry on top. I'm sure I could find a hundred reasons not to like Toy Soldiers, but as long as we do not take it too seriously, I do not see the need. This is one of the most entertaining "bad" movies in my pantheon.
