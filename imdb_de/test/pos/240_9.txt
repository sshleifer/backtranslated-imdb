In Brooklyn, nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life at McGuire, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday evenings: they order oysters in a bar and try to find a pearl. Rusty's life changes when she participates and wins a contest to become the front page of Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a giant Broadway theater whose owner she proposes. She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new lifestyle. She misses the love of Danny and her old friends. 'Cover Girl' is a delightful romantic comedy that is very naive and has great parts, like the beauty and the talented Rita Hayworth who dances, sings and plays; Gene Kelly, especially in two scenes, dances with himself and with Rusty and Genius on the street; The songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectacular. Danny, the character of Gene Kelly, is almost uncomfortable with his chauvinistic behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I thought she was great in 'Gilda', but she is breathtaking in 'Cover Girl'. According to the cover of the VHS, "Cover Girl" was the first musical in which the songs were part of the storyline and gave the story continuity rather than being "thrown" in the movie. My sixteen-year-old son watched this movie with a friend of the same age at a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved Cover Girl. So I dare to say that this classic is recommended to every movie lover, not just the old generation. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Modelos' ('Models')
