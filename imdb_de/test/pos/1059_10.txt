Barbara Stanwyck is a pure delight in this war comedy about a sailor who was invited to a popular magazine writer's family on her farm in Connecticut for Christmas. The problem is that she does not have a husband, a baby, or a farm, as she writes in her column, and she can not even cook; Her wonderful recipes were provided to her by her good friend "Uncle" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City. <br /> <br /> Things get even more complicated when their rigorous publisher invites you for Christmas. A plan is hastily planned. Her clogged fiance provides a real farm in Connecticut, neighbors provide a borrowed baby, and a quick wedding is planned if the publisher is not looking. But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, there are romantic complications, as the supposedly married writer falls like a ton of bricks for the nice man of the Navy and vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a charming, warm film that cleverly balances humor and emotion, and is a wonderful showcase for Barbara Stanwyck to showcase her considerable comedic talent, supported by such wonderful character actors as Sydney Greenstreet, Una O'Connor, SZSakall and many others. A Christmas night dance in the Town Hall is a real treat for the toes, and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise for spectators who have seen them mostly as hard, bitchy women in Femme Fatale roles. Truly a wonderful movie that has stood the test of time.
