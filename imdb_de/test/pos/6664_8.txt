"War movie" is a Hollywood genre that has been played and renewed so often that clichéd dialogues, reworked action, and exaggerated action sequences for conflicts that deal with large-scale battles seem inevitable. Every now and then, however, a war film is added that goes against the grain and brings to life a truly original and compelling story on the canvas. The "Cold Mountain" from the Civil War with Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a movie. <br /> <br /> It is not entirely correct to call Cold Mountain "a war movie". The film begins with a (literally) fast and dirty battle sequence in which "Glory" director Edward Zwick is a pity. However, "cold mountain" is not so much about the civil war itself as about the time and the people At the heart of the story is the angry Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, about the cruel war and the homesickness for the beautiful Hamlet Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern beauty he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman At first glance, this setup seems formulaic, as the romantic interest at home gives the audience enough sympathy to stand up for the recalcitrant Defend soldiers on the battlefield. In fact, the film's early segments are relatively inconspicuous, and even s Cold Mountain is soon becoming a drastic turnaround as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (who, by the way, wants to save the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of choosing the Internet) to establish) Confederates) and begins a long odyssey home. In the meantime, Adas cultivated ways have proved to be of little use on the farm. she soon turns into something wild. Rescuing Ada comes the course, the stubborn Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada reassemble the farm and, perhaps more importantly, deal with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought on Ada. <br /> <br /> These two environments unfold a lively, captivating and sometimes disturbing portrait of the war-torn South. The characters that Inman and Ada interact with are surprisingly complex and are enhanced by wonderful appearances by Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an imperturbable southern lawman, and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All were mostly badly affected and changed by the "Northern Aggression War". The dark, penetrating anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and frighteningly beautiful Virginia and North Carolina footage, is not so much conveyed to the audience by cruel battle scenes as by the scarred country and traumatized people for whom the war was responsible fought. Although the weapons and tactics of the war have changed dramatically over the past century, its infernal impact on the country is timelessly relevant. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is vilified by a rather lukewarm climax that does little justice to the wonderfully shaped figures. The love story between Inman and Ada becomes awkward at the beginning and at the end of the film, though the inherently remote, abstracted, and even absurd nature of their relationship fits in with the dark nature of the rest of the plot. <br /> Make Do not make a mistake, "Cold Mountain" has neither the characteristics of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an epoch that will not only entertain the public, but will truly engage in the life of a people that has been torn apart by a war and is absolutely desperate to completely eliminate its terrible effects.
