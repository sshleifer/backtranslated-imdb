If you have ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know that they are longer than most other movies (each longer than five minutes) due to the numerous song and dance routines. Fortunately, this program has fewer song and dance routines and fits in the "standard" movie length. Do not get me wrong, I like Bollywood movies, but tend to move quickly through the song and dance sections. I bought this DVD because I'm a fan of Ian Bohen. Although his role was not as big as I had hoped, he still had a good screen time. And his character was much different than his other roles. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a good movie. Like most Bollywood films, there is at least one element of controversy / conflict in traditional Indian culture. But true love triumphs over adversity and all have a happy ending.
