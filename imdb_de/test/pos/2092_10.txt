To be perfectly honest, I did not expect to go to 9 Souls, even after reading heaps of praise, but to say that I was surprised would be a great understatement, in short, I was thrilled. <Br /> <br /> The basic conspiracy is as simple as it gets: Nine prison inmates range from a drug trafficker to several murderers escaping from jail, looking for a secret cache likely to be hidden by a tenth of an Inmate who was dragged off the guards just before they escaped, but it is the direction in which director Toshiaki Toyoda leads this simple story that is so brilliant and original that drama, comedy and violence merge perfectly. Not just fans of Asian cinema but the cinema in general. <br /> <br /> Well played, emotional, funny, violent and sometimes very surreal. This is a movie that has everything.
