I thought this movie was great and laughed so hard that I had to see it twice to catch the missing pieces that I had missed as I bent down and held my stomach. The reviewer who reviewed this movie for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over his shoe size to find this movie funny. Well, my IQ is about: 135 ... I ask this person to question me and then eat his own words! This movie is brilliant and if the critic was not such a boring idiot, he might even smile in his life and take things as lightly as they meant !!! <br /> <br /> The musical numbers were so inventive! Anyone watching a movie over this period will notice men in tights and realize how different it is today and how funny we would find today's male population if they were wearing tights day after day! The idea of ​​dedicating a song to men dancing in tights was so fresh, how can you not laugh !!! (Besides, it's always hysterical to see hip-hop rappers playing ballet, as a dancer I also did ballet and hip-hop and danced with men who had to do both ... it breaks me every time !!!) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, if someone has not seen it yet, do not listen to the above mentioned critic ... look at it and then decide for yourself !!!
