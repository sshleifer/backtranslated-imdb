The filmmakers made a rather boring story interesting and complex for everyone by focusing on his wife at home. At the same time, we are exposed to a truly original, existential French loner. <br /> <br /> The film is more than a documentary. I almost never have the feeling of having experienced anything inadvertently profound, which makes it all the more profound. I was absolutely thrilled with the journey of the filmmakers. (Pretty many Europeans in the credits). Hopefully, PBS will review this to reach a wider audience in the US.
