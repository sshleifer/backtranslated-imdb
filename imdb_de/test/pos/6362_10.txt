To say that I did not expect much to look at "The Couch Trip" is an understatement. I had no idea what it was about - I thought it would be a journey into the realm of sexuality when I heard Chevy Chase playing a condom man and the title of the film was couch couch. * Wink, wink. * Then I found out that it had something to do with a psychiatric institute and a patient who was fleeing. My expectations fell even lower. <br /> <br /> I literally expected a movie that was grinning - the guy who once smiled and felt a bit cheated. And in a way that's a cheap comedy - it does not have the biggest gags, the plot is ridiculous, but you know what? I had a big stupid smile on my face all the time I watched it. Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient in a mental hospital that may or may not be mental. He gives the psychiatrist, Lawrence Baird (David Clennon), a lot of grief and misery, which leads us to believe that he is a reasonable person. <br /> <br /> After a small uprising in the mental hospital Cafeteria, Burns expects a tongue from Baird in his office when the phone rings. Burns picks it up, pretends to be Baird, and finds out the caller on the other lead, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), that the real Dr. is on vacation with his wife Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Baird so much that he even booked him a plane ticket on the plane. Burns escapes to the institute with the help of a receptionist and drives to O'Hare. He gets Dr. Baird's ticket, gets on the plane and finally poses as dr. Baird. His show is a phenomenal success. "People love him!" One guy says, and the other guy answers, "It's because he's really interested in her." Donald Becker (the late great Walter Matthau) is an ex-mental patient, Burns' clothing identifies pants and shirts released from custody. To keep him quiet, Burns Becker promises a percentage of his income. The secret is kept secret. <br /> <br /> Maitlin and his wife are arguing now. He flies home to end his vacation and realizes that the man on his talk show actually does not. Baird is, but nobody believes him. He gets the real Dr. Baird, but unfortunately he has lost his ID, so the police take her as a nutcase and do not listen to her story. <br /> <br /> I just want to name some of the storylines that I've named noticed while watching this movie: Burns poses as a dr. Baird, however, is never asked for his ID even if he claims his plane ticket (he was robbed, he says, but they would still make sure he is Baird). If Burns gets so famous, why did the real Dr. Baird in Chicago never heard people talk about him? Word is traveling. Finally, why should the police ever arrest Maitlin and Baird (the real Baird) without engaging in their stories? <br /> <br /> To be honest, I do not care. I went into this movie with a closed head and it surprised me - I really liked it. It entertained me. His ideas are essentially ridiculous and not realistic at all, but Dan Aykroyd gives a truly spirited performance as half a loon, making "The Couch Trip" a journey worth taking. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
