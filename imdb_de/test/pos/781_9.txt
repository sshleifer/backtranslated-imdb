I saw tonight with modest expectations - if Tartan Films found something and released it, that's usually a good sign. However, I'm usually not a fan of Julie Walters and usually reject her comedy roles (sorry to all the fans, but it's a personal thing - I just do not find them funny in the comedy.) That was Great - great for everyone, but Grint and Walters are extraordinary! Lots of laughter, lots of pathos, great timing and a wonderfully moving movie - a movie that grows up would not normally be something I'd like, but me can not recommend it enough - and see Rupert Grint becoming a fine actor.
