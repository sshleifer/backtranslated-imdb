Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life through the soap opera "A Reason to Love" to escape her sloppy husband and her boring life. After a shocking two-song incident (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty gets into shock and travels to LA. She thinks she should marry the main character of the show (Greg Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is the rare thing, a lesser-known movie with All-Star cast and a fluffy rom-com plot that surprises with his terrific screenplay and acting enjoyment. In fact, such a conspiracy calls into question the R rating, but it's fine. The shocking incident that sends Betty over the edge is, in comparison to the light, too graphic, too amusing comedy that will come and feel like something from another movie. At the same time, however, it is necessary to show Betty's transformation into the movie Doe Eyed, endearing nut job that she becomes. <br /> <br /> As we travel with Betty on their journey, director Neil LaBute works with an extraordinary magic that makes the movie unique and high above the marsh's standard mistake comedy. An example of this would be Betty's first meeting with her crush. She pours out his heart and he joins in and thinks she's going to audition for a role on the show. While we are aware of the ridiculous nature of Betty's wobbles, the music swells as she speaks and gives us, the audience, the emotional perspective of Betty. We almost believe what she says, but we understand that her mind is broken. While other filmmakers would try to emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation to rip any comedy out of the scene, LaBute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with utmost sympathy and understanding. The banter between the men played by Freeman and Rock is priceless excellent script that spends a smart line for a refined line from which to rip. Freeman, as always, is excellent and goes up and down, while his character falls in love with his own ideal of Betty slowly and blindly, does not even know who she is or what happened to her. Aaron Eckhart shows once again the versatility in the thankless role of Betty's uncomfortable husband and is almost unrecognizable. The other revelation here is Kinnear, whose representation of the soap star is not too overcooked. There is a tendency to be as thick as possible on the famous bastard cliche, and Kinnear resists instead giving him a pompous, yet restrained self-importance, even though he is just a soap star. The soap opera is realized so well, it could almost exist. LaBute and Co hit the nail on the head and that's a good thing. If the soap opera had been too satirical, much of the film would not have worked. A parody "Days of Our Lives," as seen in Friends, would have been the wrong step for this film. The devotion to detail pays off as the style and feel of the soap opera seem to dive deeper and deeper into Betty's reality, while at the same time taking into account the unintentionally funny aspect of the genre. The scenes on the set feel real, unlike some films in which the atmosphere is so made that you wondered why people doing it can not do it right. <br /> <br /> The neat resolution of The Last Act is a bit predictable but overall satisfactory. It's a shame that after LaBute made this wonderful movie, the mainstream asked him to direct the awesome remake of The Wicker Man, a good example of a man who is so over the material he has been provided. Unfortunately, you can not absolve him of any responsibility. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Sister Betty, there is something to discover. If so, a visit is worthwhile. Sister Betty has a spell that is contagious, even if you do not have to think so much afterwards. Still a hidden gem.
