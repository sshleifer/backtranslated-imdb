The film was excellent, except for some scenes with Esposito. I enjoyed seeing how each detective in the series was brought together and have summarized some storylines that were never resolved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together in their most humane and basic people. Braugher and Secor have done a great job, but are overlooked as usual. It hurt to see that this was the end of Homicide. Reminders, tapes, and reruns on CourtTV are just not the same as seeing it every Friday. But the movie did its job and he did it very well, a great portrayal of life after retirement and the family relationship between the unit. I enjoyed that very much.
