This is an excellent movie. No, it's not Mel Gibson in Braveheart, but it's not trying to be. In fact, "The Emperor and the Assassin" probably (luckily) has more of a Shakespearean production than a Hollywood blockbuster. <br /> <br /> In the third century BC The King of Qin tries to unite (in other words, you "conquer" the seven kingdoms of China, he has already overthrown the kingdom of Han, and now he needs an excuse to invade the kingdom of Yan. <br /> <br /> This is where Lady Zhao comes in. She and the king have been friends since childhood, they are obviously very much in love, but they can not marry for political reasons, and together they work out an act that will pretend to be out of favor with the king Once there, she will convince the Prince of Yan to send a killer back to kill the king, and if the assassination fails, the king will have his excuse to invade Yan, once in Yan , Lady Zhao begins to think again, she hears and sees more and more examples of her old friend's recklessness in childhood, and begins to wonder if the king is really murdering <br /> <br /> A sure sign that you do not see any Hollywood production is the last encounter between the king and the assassin. Unlike a Hollywood movie in which the hero and the villain are clearly defined and the end result is already predetermined, this is a fight that could go both ways. <br /> <br /> This is a well-made and well-made story of a tumult time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. However, the most beautiful is Gong Li as Lady Zhao. I am increasingly convinced that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that she has an unintentionally funny line in this film. Early on, Gong Li asks one of her servants, "Do I have a beautiful face?" <br /> <br /> Duh !!!
