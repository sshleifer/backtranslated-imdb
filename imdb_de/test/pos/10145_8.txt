This is another entertaining and entertaining Hitchcock movie. James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this movie. Bernard Herrmann appears as himself near the climax. <br /> <br /> The scenery and settings are great, except for the scene where the background was obviously wrong, which to me since the previous and later scenes made no sense in the same environment and they were real location shots. I've heard that Hitchcock did this on purpose. <br /> <br /> The reviews for this movie seem to be mixed. I think this is an above-average Hitchcock movie. Very entertaining and it has a great, light comic scene in the end. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />
