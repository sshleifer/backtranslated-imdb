I have to pick up all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I always look at it when I need a pickup service. Granted, it's not like the Sound of Music, but it's just as much fun if you do not opt ​​for movies. I loved the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta was and always is a favorite. I saw this when it first appeared in cinemas. I'm a big musical fan and he's 100 times better than Twiggy in "The Boyfriend". It is a modern musical and should not be judged by everything that has gone before. It's just the best for dreamers like me who wish they could find this place - no illness, no wars, no drugs, all the bad things in life are over. This is nothing more than a good movie. That's why all films should be. The title song by Shaun Phillips is outstanding and explains the overall feel of the film. If acting is not the biggest thing, who cares. I love the idea of ​​the movie. Peter Finch, a very stiff actor, Liv Ullmann, gorgeous as ever, Sally Kellerman, surprisingly good voice, Michael York (typically) and Olivia Hussey (stunning), all convinced me that they were normal mill people. None of them behaved like actors in a movie. They behaved like real people, just like me when I find this place. Torn between going home and staying there, reverence for everything. Yes, there are shortcomings in this film, but overcome it, it is not Citizen Kane, it feels good!
