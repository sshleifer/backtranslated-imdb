I thought the movie was pretty good for what I expected. Although I'm tired because I'm afraid of hypodermic needles, I somehow figured out when they would come. So if you do not care for needles, blood, the human body, and good medical fun, put this movie back and rent another. As the other user commented, I was also pleased with the German attempt at a Slasher movie. I am an American who has just moved to Germany to stay with a family and saw it on the shelf. I love psychological thrillers, and I would say that's somewhere in that direction. A character falls in places and feels misunderstood. When trying to pull yourself out and find something true, things get a bit sticky and others are not so sure if they're on the right path. Throughout the movie, you'll always be up-to-date with the anatomy that you might catch a glimpse of, and who's going around the next corner.
