A copy of this old classic found in a bargain market. I played it without problems with Dosbox on a Vista computer. It's graphically outdated, but what do you expect for a 12 year old game! The game is a FPS / Adventure hybrid. It's what I call pseudo-3D. You can not look up or down, just turn 360 (think of Wolf3D). The game can be tricky with a very limited supply of health pots and a slightly average interface (hint: press I), but on the whole it is passable. <br /> <br /> One of the main strengths of the game is the mood. The game mainly uses full-motion video, and although the game is b-grade and the plot is very choppy, the game as a whole feels really scary. It's also a good job to question the 'good guys'. Are they really helping or just waiting to stab you in the back? The other big selling point is the length of the games. There are 18 chapters in memory that can last from 10 minutes to possibly hours. My first playthrough lasted a week with serious dedication to the time. <br /> <br /> Obsolete, yes, but if you missed it years ago and can find it for $ 5, take a look. Cheaper than a movie and more entertaining than most movies.
