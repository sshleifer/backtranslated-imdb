Was in the mood for a French movie and saw this at Blockbuster. What a little gem it was! I do not know how I've missed Gregori Derangere over the years, but he's fantastic. Such innocence and grace! I love his face and the way he moves. Isabelle Adjani was funny - reminded me of Nicole Kidman's outstanding performance in Moulin Rouge. It looks exactly as it did 20 years ago ... really remarkable. Gerard Depardieu has not been nearly as good, but his acting is still amazing. He is perfect in this movie. I'll probably buy that, I liked it so much. If you want to see another great French movie, rent Joyeux Noel. breathtaking
