I really loved this movie. I thought it was very well done. The character interaction was wonderful, as was the characterization. The actors were definitely believable. The plot was very deep and fascinating. Even if parts of it are a bit slow and sometimes boring, it definitely pays off to look at it several times. The chemistry between the three main characters was great. If you do not want to see it, at least look for the drama between the characters. I mean, the whole thing was just "Whoa!" It was like I could not look away. The whole movie caught my attention and kept my interest in the slow parts as well. I loved this movie and almost everything about it. I loved the end because it was so interesting and if you watch the movie a second time it makes perfect sense. But I do not spoil anything.
