Night Gallery has never impressed me much, but this one episode is striking. <br /> <br /> A TV network manager is doing a strange act - a young, nerdy boy making predictions. The Exec rejects the whole thing as a fuzzy waste of time until both predictions come true the next morning. What first appeared to be a salon act becomes a hit show because the child's predictions are consistently correct. > <br /> He then rejects the show one day. Given the upcoming showtime, everyone is at the end of the line and even threatens legal action if he does not fulfill his contract and makes his daily predictions. The boy gives in and shows a seemingly utopian morning. <br /> After the show, the confused manager asks for an explanation just to find out why the whole truth is too horrible to reveal.
