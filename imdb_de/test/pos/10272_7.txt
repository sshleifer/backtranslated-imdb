A visually appealing but interesting movie is mainly the storyline. The film shows a zigzag progress in exploring the innermost feeling of the lead actor. Max, who has been living in New York for two years and wants to marry a girl he met, returns to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend, whom he still likes a lot, but finally finds out which one he loves the most is her best friend. Nonlinear narrative, so many flashbacks and each part are quite well articulated. The three women Max has met symbolize something we need to pursue, even though they may not have a clear idea of ​​the underlying motivations. His fiancee is the one he needs, not the one he loves, and therefore no loyalty we can see. It does not give him love, just stability. True love can not be found in his relationship with the ex-girlfriend. Just a fantasy for him to escape - many very romantic things he has done for her, but almost nothing seems to be pleasant. The one who really animates Max's life is her best friend. The final equilibrium is not identical to the initial equilibrium, as Max has understood much more about his innermost feeling. The nonlinear structure makes the search process more complicated. Not as ingenious as "Pulp Fiction", but in "The Apartment" things are much more natural. Max is not the only character going through a transformation, and indeed the description is interesting for Romane Bohringer. The good camera makes her and Monica Bellucci very nice too. A good commentary on today's love and undoubtedly a worth watching movie. <br /> <br />
