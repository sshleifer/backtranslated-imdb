Do not be fooled: this is not another tired example of the space girls pretending that the French ski team comes to Earth to collect as much sperm as possible, even though the synopsis suggests otherwise. This movie is a gem, an absolute gem that enriched my life from the moment I saw it. "Oh yodel me one more" is a funny, exciting, action packed and breathtaking erotic, a Euro-Madcap Tour-De-Force, a highly underrated Bavarian classic to run or better yet, BUY this movie right away.
