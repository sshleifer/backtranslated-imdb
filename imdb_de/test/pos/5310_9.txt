Maybe people like the devil more than God. Maybe we like this safety net for a reason; make a mistake just blaming the devil for the pain and suffering in the world. There are so many troubles pouring into the masses that it's hard not to see the sadness on the faces of all your faces. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands all this; He knows that maybe everything is not all right. Maybe it's a risk to leave someone who is leaving the earth to avoid the pain his life is waiting for. Thanks go to screenwriter / director Matthew Ryan Hoge for creating a lyrical prose about two suburban families who have crossed in good and bad times. A look at the actors of almost all A and B list actors shows that the material really resonates with its audience. Emotions do not have to be worn on the sleeve to exist. Sometimes we just want to end the suffering. Ryan Gosling brings an unremarkable performance to the table that encompasses the inwardness of his Leland emotions. He is a very passionate and intelligent young man who cuts through the BS of life, knows what he sees and, with the better, accepts the worst. The film is a catharsis for the souls of those affected by the terrible event in which Leland killed the spiritually challenged brother of his ex-girlfriend. In the confused mind of this teenager, he goes into the incident and knows exactly what he would do. He would stop the pain he sees everywhere, but especially on the face of young Ryan Pollard. Almost immediately he realizes that he has made a mistake, that it may not be a task to play God when he is used on the earth. Whether this is true or not is soon debated as the murder begins a series of events that eventually make the lives of many people meaningful when awakened by the tangential fragility of life. This boy has opened his eyes for sadness and rebirth. <br /> <br /> With haunting ballads sung by the former frontman of Sunny Day Real Estate, Jeremy Enigk, the film goes through a journey of small vignettes from the lives of two families in the aftermath of the tragedy. Acting is consistently excellent, with some being particularly mentioned. For someone who plays the naive role in most films, Chris Klein is actually good with the same material, but also with a development to a man of purpose. His seclusion is effective when used in the right part, similar to Election. I'm curious if directors will allow him to expand his talents and sink his teeth into something more substantial. Jena Malone is equally effective and plays the role of disturbed youth as in Donnie Darko and Life as a House. Don Cheadle is a master of professionalism, giving us a different view of the compassionate therapist than Manic. and Martin Donovan is brilliant as the grieving father who tries to keep his mind together, and finally realizes that he must also keep his family from falling apart. It's also great to see the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn in a small but important role. <br /> <br /> When a tragedy occurs, people gather to go through everything. As Leland points out at one point, you can see men and women helping others to hug each other when they see the pain and suffering around them, but after a few days, everything will return to normal. Cheadle's character extrapolates the optimistic view that at least we get a glimpse into the true nature of the people who want to help and who want to be good with each other, just to be shot at with the retort, "at least during the tragedy." Maybe we do not want to believe that we are good-natured, because we feel that we should be good all the time, and when it's bad, it has to be. If we are flawed, we allow ourselves to strike back and try again. Leland's mistake makes him see the love he has for his relatives, and he opens the eyes of others to wake up and not allow their loved ones to be farther away from them. You can not focus on the sadness of others once they have to deal with their own. Hoge has designed a parable for this and a really effective piece of filmmaking with, hopefully, much more.
