On the dirty streets somewhere in New York City, a lonely punk named Tromeo (Will Keenan) has little friends, but all they ever do is tattoos, piercings and just party. He's in love with a beautiful rich girl named Juliet (Jane Jenson), who is also worried because her dad is a rather abusive son of one, you know, but when our title characters meet and fall apart, things start pretty magically to become you. Unfortunately, her fathers are used to each other when Julia's father wants to take over the film studio of Tromeo's father, but could love really conquer all of them and stop this feud? <br /> <br /> The funny and scary horror comedy out of the crazy and disgusting people of Troma is a wonderful modern interpretation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The book was released in cinemas in 1997 and received some good reviews. This is a dark, humorous satire of the legendary story that started it all. She's got some good laughs, pervasive, graphic violence, and blood, like a head smashed on a fire hydrant. For me, this is the third best Troma movie next to the immortal "Toxic Avenger" and "Troma's War," which come second. Yes, acting can be a bit bad, as with some Troma flicks. If you like horror comedies, Peter Jackson, and Troma, or if you want to see a weird version of a popular story, then you need to watch a movie. BTW is also looking for some fun performances by The Toxic Avenger and SGT.
