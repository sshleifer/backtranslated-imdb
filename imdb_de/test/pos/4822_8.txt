This has no relation to Virtual Encounters 1, so it's not really a sequel. The two videos just share the general concept that humans have simulated sex through a virtual reality machine. So, if you were really excited about the history and dialogue in VC 1 (yes, right) and expected a sequel to VC 2, just be forewarned. All actors and actresses are new, but it has the same great director, Sybil Richards. <br /> <br /> But as with VC 1, there are many beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that come across the envelope Softcore almost as far as it gets. <br /> <br /> If you have VC 1 and you liked it, you will like VC 2. If you do not have both, you might get really good softcore sex both
