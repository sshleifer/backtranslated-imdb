I've seen Lonesome Dove, Dead Man's Walk and The Streets of Laredo and now The Return to Lonesome Dove. If you are more hungry after seeing Lonesome Dove, it will fill your stomach. Great cast, great story. In any case, just under a second behind Lonesome Dove. I will buy this movie to add to my collection. This is the best or at least my favorite performance by Jon Voight. He is Captain Call. Lou Gossett Jr., who plays Isom Pickett, is not someone I'd screw myself with, he's a bad ass with perspective. William Peterson also does a great job. Rick Schroder returns as Newt with a fearful performance reminding me of his commitment to NYPD Blue. My only problem with this movie (and it's really a joke) is that I got the impression that Call wanted to be "the first man to graze cattle in Montana," and it's obvious that Dunnigan has been there for a while was. A little volatile, but easy to miss if you lose yourself in the fantastic story. I especially love the obvious character growth of Jasper Fant and July Johnson. I've seen this movie several times and am ready for another sequel.
