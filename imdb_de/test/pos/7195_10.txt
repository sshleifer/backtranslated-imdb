It's the first time I can remember where an adaptation was just like the book ... Actually, jokes were added to the story instead of mixing or removing content. <br /> <br /> Like the Egyptian slave Cellularis Who had difficulty in transmitting, um, to communicate, LOL! Or when Tidivinnus was played as a quasi-Sith lord and annoyed when the Roman Empire suffered a blow, the general ordered the Empire,? Ah, look at the movie people! <br /> <br /> I can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in French cinema history and for my part it was worth chomping Obelix. Clavier played well with the small, irrepressible Gaul, and was a long way from his time as Jean Reno's limping squire in Just Visiting. The Matrix theme was not borrowed to rob an otherwise perfect battle! <br /> <br /> Redbeard, the pirate and his crew, had almost stolen the picture, from their own ship to the engine used for Otis' assistant invention at the very end. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are Asterix and the Olympics with many of the same teams. I also want to see that from Toutatis!
