In addition to working with amateur cameras, I found that this movie was very different, and in contrast to all the blogs and posts I've read, in the end I have something quite different than others. The premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their connection to their church. How to comply with all the strict rules and regulations, but the daughter seems to be having trouble staying on the right path, which is related to the unpleasant thoughts of others and their use of bad language. But she prays a lot, as does her family. Then one day they go to a church picnic and have an accident. From there, the parents and their brother change. what about turning off and "saving" Jesus. WARNING: IMPORTANT spoiler ALERT. At least we'll be made to believe. I think if you only see this movie from the daughter's point of view, then you are really paying attention to the end, and you will see that what we, the audience, consider to be an actual event with the parents and the son is indeed Everything is dreaming and from the daughter's POV. This would explain many of the actions of the parents and the son who were totally different than before, especially in sex, and also why Peggy got away with murder, etc. Take a look at how perfect this pie is, but go back and look at the cake Betty makes. That is, unless Caroline removed all evidence that the cake was laced. And also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents lying in her arms and her brother, all of whom seemed to die very peacefully, despite being poisoned, fit into a dream sequence.
