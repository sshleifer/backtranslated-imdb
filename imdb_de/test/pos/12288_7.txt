This is not a movie, but a clever, witty and often heart touching film. It's a retrospective look at a failed relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Leydon Campbell) and his foreign Irish girlfriend Grace Mckenna. Michael decides to choose his luck, to produce a documentary that reflects his entire relationship and what went wrong. He takes advantage of his friendship with an actor whom he met in the gym Nadia (Nadia Dajani), whom he can play as Grace. The concept of this film is very original. Michael's relationship is shown from every point, whether it's a high or a low. Michael Leydon Campbell presents a fantastic performance in which you want to help him find Grace. In fact, most characters perform well except the puzzle player. The puzzler is needed to advance the plot, but seems too surreal to exist in a caf√©. His monologues are often overdone and meaningless. This is proven when he says, "Out of this chaos we all try to create order, and out of order, of meaning, but in reality there is no meaning." A thing has meaning only when we have meaning. " <br /> <br /> The comment saves this movie. The comment was made in the Vain of This is Spinal Tap and Michael and his brother explain the problems they had during the filming. Michael offers a very funny, self-confident comment that makes some very good belly laughs. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would give this movie a 7/10.
