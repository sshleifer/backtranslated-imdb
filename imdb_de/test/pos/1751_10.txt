Well, I may be biased when I grew up watching a VHS copy of this movie, which is now ready to go. I spent the last few hours tracking down a DVD copy for my dad as a birthday pressie. The movie is so harmless and harmless that it is suitable for all ages ... much better than anything that Disney has ever done in my opinion (and I used to work in the Disney Store !!!). The characters are enjoyable and the Best Picture award is a link between the interrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of Swat, the Fly and Smack, the Midge) and the amazing nightclub scene. The music numbers still hummed me 20 years after the first sight. There's no other movie I can recommend for babysitting, and indeed, every kid I know (thanks to my Hoppity-loving parents) has seen this movie a lot. It always gets top marks for its fabulous love story, a brilliant baddy and beyond all originality.
