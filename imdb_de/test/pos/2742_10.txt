This Oscar-winning short, featuring two sequels and a TV animated show, features minimal animations but adelightful script (by Theodore Geisel aka Dr. Seuss) and an even more remarkable and enchanting protagonist. UPA was the pioneer of an animation style that even influenced Disney in the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts of the late 1940s and 1950s. This is one of the most beautiful. God, to have it under pressure. Highly recommended.
