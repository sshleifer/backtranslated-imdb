I just can not believe the low ratings for this movie. The probable cause has to do with the low number of votes, which means that few people have seen it. This is just a fantastic movie! There are so many stories, but it's not complicated. Every character grows with the movie and we experience how life changes. The scenery is just amazing and the credits are the best I've ever seen in a movie (just like a Shakespeare play). Yes, it's a bit dated (added in 1982), but the issues the characters face are very current. It could have been filmed in 2002 without changing the story. Raul Julia is amazing, the best role ever played in a movie - this is his signature. A young Molly Ringwald is excellent as she matures from girl to young woman. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman, and John Cassavetes is the force that brings it all together. Do yourself a favor, find this movie, watch it and enjoy it. Come back to IMDb and score this movie in the best 250 of all times where it really belongs.
