Skenbart takes place in the 1940s directly after the Second World War. The main character Gunnar (Gustav Hammarsten) gives up his job to get the chance to "make a difference" in ruined postwar Europe. He grabs a book from his favorite philosopher Ludwig Witgenstein and embarks on a journey that proves Witgenstein's famous statement true: nothing is what it seems. <br /> <br /> to this movie, which takes place on a train to Berlin. The author and director Peter Dalle (who also plays the role of train driver) has put together an impressive cast, including the Swedish legend Lena Nyman, Gösta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson. Overall, the spectacle is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Skenbart offers a slightly twisted slapstick comedy combined with subtle black humor (like the nun who loses her faith and violently escapes). It's as if Killinggänget meets Peter Jackson (Braindead, Bad Taste) in Schindler's list. I laughed during most of the movie, and when I woke up the next morning, I laughed even more. An intelligent movie for fans of Swedish comedy.
