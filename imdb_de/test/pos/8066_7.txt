Mary Pickford plays Annie Rooney - the daughter of a policeman living in the harsh district. She is a rough young woman of indeterminate age (somewhere between 12 and 16) who loves to scrap but has a heart of gold deep down. <br /> <br /> This is a very typical movie style for Mary Pickford. Like so many of her films, she plays a young girl - even though she was nearly 40 years old with LITTLE ANNIE ROONEY. And like so many other stories, she was both courageous and brave. As a result, I had a strong sense of deja vu. If you have not seen her other films yet, that's no problem. However, it essentially plays a character similar to that of SPARROWS or DADDY LONG LEGS - though these two other films are much better. Well, this is not a bad movie - just that it certainly is not one of her best works - mainly because of a rather "lean" story that is very emotional but not very convincing. Entertaining but not necessary watching, unless you are a big fan of the Silents.
