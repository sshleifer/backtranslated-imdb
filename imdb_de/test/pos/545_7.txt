I thought Anywhere But Here was a good movie. It features two wonderful actresses, Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman, and when I heard they were in a movie together, I refuse to look at him. Overall, it was a pretty enjoyable movie. I felt like they were trying, and there was really exaggerated and worn material, but there was nothing in the movie that I absolutely hated. I even liked how they feel about the pop-up performance of Thora Birch, and all the little happy / sad moments are touching and effective. If you want to watch this movie, go ahead, because although I do not recommend it, you should not avoid this, and you should get a rating of 5.9 in my opinion unfair.
