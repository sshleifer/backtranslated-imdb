River's Edge is more than just the story of a murder. It is an indictment for the wave of apathy that has been plaguing teenagers for decades. Our main characters are a group of what my high school would have called "stoners." One of them has just decided to strangle his girlfriend because she apparently had the nerve to talk to him. This dangerous young man, played by Daniel Roebuck, has an intensity that will scare you. He takes out the other children in the group to show him his girlfriend's body, and strangely enough, no one seems to really freak out. The balance of the film underscores the desperate circumstances under which these people live, and how the guilt eventually prevails in these apathetic children. River's Edge is certainly not the behavior of his characters. We clearly see the dangers that such an unrestrained apathy brings with it, and only desire to get drunk or come up. We are shown how poorly these children live at home, and perhaps that explains their terrible behavior. But could only unstable houses lead to this kind of destructive life? Crispin Glover is his usual whipped self. He drives through the city after the murder in a city full of paranoia. He tries to understand why his friend had to commit the crime, but obviously he does not understand what could have made the young man. Dennis Hopper plays an older man, from whom these children get their dope. Although he is undoubtedly a rebellious figure, he can not relate to the apathy and anger of the younger generation. Experience his confused reaction as Roebuck describes how his girlfriend killed him. As wild as Hoppers character may be, even he knows that this young man should not enter the face of the earth. What will you think of these children? Well, there is really no way to like their characters. Some are less despicable than others, but you can not help either hate or be sorry for them. Twenty years later there is still apathy and there are many young people. When do these children get lost? Why do so many want to act antisocial? This movie and the questions he asks about teenagers will stay with you for a while. That's a fact. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
