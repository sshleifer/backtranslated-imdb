I have just seen "A Tale of Two Sisters" last night and enjoyed it very much. I have recently been a big fan of Asian horror movies and think that this is a strong contribution from South Korea. There are not many fears as in an ordinary American horror movie, but the director keeps the most extreme and gloomy mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions. Most of the horrors are more conceptual and play into everyone's "there is something under the bed" - fears of her childhood, but in this case it is the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director realized how badly this household is being held up by scenes like the first dinner the characters have in common. He's also good at showing the inner life and fragility of people through simple scenes, such as the stepmother wiping her makeup in the mirror, or sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this movie is mainly an exploration of the guilt and consequences of living with this guilt over you. <br /> <br /> MAKE THE MOST IMPORTANT SPOILER (DO NOT READ ANYTHING IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE TWISTS OF THE FILM) I followed the story pretty well, but was confused during the bag drag part, but I think the flashback The film is similar to "The Machinist" in the way that two of the character's common guilty feelings eventually lead to mental failures and delusions. <br /> <br /> Here's my interpretation of the movie Su-Yeon, whom we see after the girls return to the house, is either the delusion of Su-Mi or the real spirit of Su-Yeon that only Su-Mi can see and interact with-the first stepmother we do see, is in my opinion a delusion of Su-Mi. However, there is a real stepmother, and she appears for the first time in the movie when she wears the gray pantsuit I think it is the real stepmother, with the father in the first tei She's on the phone, and she does not show up until he picks her up and brings her home. The stepmother before this point is featured by Su-Mi (maybe part of her split personality?). This explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like crazy and does not remember anything she's telling. I think it was Su-Mi who played her step-mother as part of her split personality. The film reveals this later in the bag-drag scene and scenes like the stepmother wiping her makeup in the mirror, which later turns out to be Su-Mi wiping her makeup in the mirror. <br /> <br I think the ghosts in the house are not fully presented by Su-Mi and are either from Su-Yeon or the mother or both. In the last flashback, it turns out that Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress they had previously shown on the ghost at the dining table while the stepmother looked under the sink. It is also the hairpin that Su-Yeon wore in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother looks under the sink. <br /> <br /> The real stepmother is punished at the end by her mind Su-Yeon, who comes in a scene like The Ring. Then the flashback scene connects everything, as both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, as Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the "mother" that is Su-Yeon sees when she goes to her room to cry, in the flashback, is already a ghost. Maybe the mother had already killed herself in the closet at that time. That is not unique. <br /> <br /> Other things that are suggested, but not clearly stated in the film, are that it seems that the stepmother may have been a nurse at some point looking after the mother and somehow also having to contributed to her death. It is not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether the mother killed herself. It is also suggested that the mother also had mental health problems and needed a nurse. The stepmother points out when she tells Su-Mi that you are starting to look for her mother. I do not think she meant only physically. <br /> <br /> If we also accept that the first stepmother we see is actually Su-Mi, then there is also evidence of incest as the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi freaks out and exclaims, "Do not touch me," when the father reaches for her in later scenes? Is that the "dirty thing you did" she refers to in a later conversation with her father? This film is interesting in its ability for different interpretations. However, some of the scenes were a kind of derivation, such as the Black Scene woman who reminded me of the jerky movements of Kayako in the films of Ju-On / The Grudge. Even the last scene, in which the stepmother finally gets her desserts, reminiscent of The Ring. Even the idea that some characters may be ghosts comes from "The Sixth Sense" or "The Others". <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked it, and it'll be interesting to see what that looks like Hollywood remake (which is already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both "The Ring" and "The Grudge", so I'm not one of the shitty guys who insists that remakes can not be good too. One remake that I am really looking forward to is "Dark Water", which will be released this summer. I have not seen the Japanese original version yet, but both movies are definitely on my list.
