Nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to bring him to death and then bring him back to life so he can prove that there is a life after death. They do that and soon all medical students want to know if there is a life after death. In the hereafter, it's not about pearly gates and lights at the end of the tunnel, but something more sinister. <br /> <br /> Past spirits are returning to persecute them, and surely this movie will follow anyone. It has some pretty scary moments that translate into real life, and people wonder what happens when you die. It's a good movie to see when it rains and you feel bad. It is also a bit funny. <br /> <br /> See it with a ghostly past.
