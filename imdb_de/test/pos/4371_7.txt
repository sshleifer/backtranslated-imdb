George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I saw so many of his specials and even had the chance to see him live. He had a certain cynicism that always appealed to me. His last two specials (especially life's worth losing and complaints and ailments) have a certain amount of spirit and content missing. George seemed overweight, old and tired (not to mention a rehab stay). "I did not say to mention it!" Anyway. Life is worth losing was particularly tragic because he was overweight, annoyed, came out of rehab (there we go back ...) and extremely unstable. If there was a way to apologize for a comedian without putting him off the stage, George got it with Life Is Worth Losing. It's as if the New Millennium and American America trample Georges' ghost after 9/11. The BS were too big for the management. <br /> <br /> The comeback is partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! This special is the transmutation complete. George is not trying to revive his glory days. He accepts his age completely, is old and deals with the emerging perspectives of death. He has accepted to be an encrusted old SOB, and he is happy about it. This is better than its previous specials, but far from Jammin 'in New York. It's a bit tragic. His observations are no longer groundbreaking and seem more like Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George is not George anymore. He does not criticize us anymore, but the Man in the High Castle shows how things were and how different modern life is. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the previous two specials, but George will not bring back his old fame (if any). He was reduced from critical social and political stinging comments to mostly personal thoughts. If he is political, he still has something to say. It's strongly derived (especially if you've seen one of his earlier works), but it still works somehow, unlike his random screams, which lack some relevance outside of the baby boom generation. The last 25 minutes are the best that this special has to offer. <br /> <br /> At the moment, I will worship the sun and pray to Joe Pesci that George can recover as a progressive Septemburger. It's a 50/50 chance. Life seems to have become boring for George and his "art" is now his life. This is a step in the right direction from his previous 2 specials, but is far from his old self. Where does he go from here? He may never recover, but perhaps he can continue to refine / refine this routine of the old man. I hope for 7 more words that can not be said on TV, or at least a windmill that he can handle.
