I saw this series on PBS in the eighties and saw the old tapes every few years. Sometimes very atmospheric and scary. This is a very good show because the characters are all well defined and played. They are drawn into the plot and come to look after these people. The villains are almost ridiculously evil, especially the sheriff of Nottingham. Man, I would love to beat that little bastard. Nicholas Grace does a great job, and as a sheriff, had a great time. His flogging boy, Sir Guy, is both hissable and pathetic. Much murder and chaos in this series, along with tons of black magic and devil worship and stuff like that. I noticed that it received a children's television award, which is surprising. If I had children, I would not let that look at me. Excellent use of locations in this show too. It's on DVD now, so go out and buy it.
