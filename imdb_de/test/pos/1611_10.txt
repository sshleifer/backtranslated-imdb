Are seaside resorts the sad, drab places they always portray in films and novels? Certainly this film, along with the almost contemporary "Do not Look Now", shows Venice as a particularly poor and decadent tourist trap (see Just Married with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy for more information). Since I've never been to Venice, I can not say with certainty, but it's the perfect setting for this sombre but lush spectacle of Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema. After watching the movie, I now wish I had read the Thomas Mann novella it was based on (which also inspired an opera by Sir Benjamin Britten). Since I do not know the background story and the film has little interest in plot or exposure, I wonder if Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) is so obsessed with the young Tadzio. Is he gay? A pedophile? Or is his yearning for the beautiful youth a little more innocent? Maybe Tadzio reminds him of what he could have been and now knows that he will never be. Those who complain about the slow pace of this movie should stick to car accidents and kung-fu: 2 hours and 15 minutes are not very long, and they are moving at a slow but barely slow pace. The film benefits from the captivating music of Gustave Mahler, on which Aschenbach's character is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde gives a moving performance, and the film is favored by the presence of Silvana Mangano, one of Italy's great beauties, as Tadzio's mother.
