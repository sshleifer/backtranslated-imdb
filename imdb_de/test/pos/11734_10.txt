The above profile was written by me when I used the nick of OldWereWolf56, which is still my e-mail address. I still think that Andy Devine's character of Frisky is the best of the Twilight Zone episodes, and I watch this episode at least once a year, while Frisby is a happy man because he has many friends who love him very much. <br /> <br /> If many of you are too young to remember, I'm 61 years old, Andy Devine hosted a children's entertainment show in the 1950's that I believe is called Andy's Gang. He then had three assistants: a cat named Midnight playing the violin, a mouse called Squeaky playing a hand organ, and a devilish toad named Froggy that might pop up and disappear, and many other funny guest stars like Billy Gilbert bring.
