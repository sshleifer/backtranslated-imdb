One of the fascinating aspects of this historical drama is the way in which the "Tories" or British-American loyalists are portrayed, and the kind of splendor that their passionate support for King George III bestows. In many ways, the American Revolution was definitely a family affair as some of the more affluent colonial families were separated from it. If there is a strong criticism of this film, then it may be that the people in this story are a little nicer than in real life. <br /> <br /> In some ways: The acts of the character of Major Boulton, played by Cornel Wilde, make him the least lovable member of the cast and the mistake in the plot. He seems to be changing from a spiky patriot to a kind of "something for the cause". This film focuses heavily on the notions of personal honor and personal prestige that were an important social "norm" at the time. In its subtext is the fact that about 25 percent of the film was colonially well colonized pro-British. But the strength of the Tory element is obviously not bad, even though the good doctoral circuit is about eighty-five percent upper-class (to steal a fine sentence from Monty Python's Flying Circus). Anne Francis does quite a bit with a rather thin section of the script, and it stands out. She was a good choice for the woman with shared loyalties, a 'gal' that was a little more modern than the social conventions of the day could have allowed - if there had not been a fight for life and death. <br /> A good aspect of the film is how the rivalries of American revolutionary leaders have degenerated into jealous inclinations, and how these personal conflicts have almost sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort. All in all, the main characters are very well drawn, the minor characters are not just human "props" and the fight scenes are credible enough to carry the dramatic action. <br /> <br /> This is a great spy movie. It is not a big historical drama, but it satisfies well enough. Seven is mainly counted by a seven, because Cornel Wilde is so deeply immersed in his role, and because Anne Francis makes the most of her support. <br /> <br /> The color print used in Turner Classic Movies was also very clear and so it was a pleasing presentation in this important respect. <br /> <br /> I hope it will be back soon.
