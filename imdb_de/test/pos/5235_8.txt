One of the myths of the early sound era is that they could not make Westerns because they had trouble recording sound locally. In fact, it was the financial limitations of depression that temporarily killed the genre, at least in budget class "A". In the period from 1929 to 1931, before the economic downturn had really begun, the "A" Western flourished, notable examples such as The Virginian, Billy the Kid and Cimarron. The Big Trail was perhaps the biggest of them all? a gigantic pioneer Western shot Grandeur in an early widescreen process with the appropriate title. Thanks to a recent DVD version, we now see the widescreen version next to the full-screen, which was simultaneously shot. The director was Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the adventurous spirit lay in vast outdoor vistas. and thus in many ways a perfect choice. He uses the broader frame to show the western landscape from its most breathtaking side. Very typical of Walsh are a number of settings at the beginning, for example, one in which a woman chops firewood. Most of the screen is filled to capacity by the wagons and other clutter, but in one corner we see the wilderness that extends invitingly. When the waggon train gets under way, the open level is gradually revealed to us, with cars driving away like stage curtains. These settings are not as effective in the fullscreen version, but on the wider screen, Walsh has never been better off in the open air. <br /> <br /> But there is an unfortunate flip side. When it comes to dialogue scenes, Walsh tends to place the actors in the middle of the recording as if they were in an imaginary full-screen box. The extra width will be exactly that? extra. That may seem logical at first glance, because it means that we see as much of the actors as we would on a full screen. However, the players within the frame look small and insignificant while the background business dominates the shot. and there are many background businesses in the Big Trail. When the widescreen formats reappeared in the fifties, many directors made the same mistake, before finally realizing that in talkie scenes it is better to uplift actors from the chest, lose some height, but fill the screen. <br /> <br /> Too bad, because The Big Trail is a particularly balanced and finely scripted work. The romance and the revenge are simple, but clearly defined, and do not threaten to overlap one another or the pioneer story. It could have been a great, intimate epic, but it's losing weight dramatically, because every time the characters start talking to each other, we get distracted by cattle herds, driving cars, or whatever else, every inch of the frame. Still, Walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still visible, and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. There are also a few nice comedies, mostly courtesy of "weird Sweden" El Brendel. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is also mentioned as John Wayne's first starring role. While Wayne is another victim of the far-flung dialogue in dialogue scenes, we at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but assertive vocal transmission. He reveals his lack of experience, but the potential is clearly there. Unfortunately, this potential was not widespread at the time, and he spent the rest of the decade doing it in B-pictures before he finally became famous. This image also features Way Bond (and later a prolific character actor) Ward Bond. He's not credited, but you can spot him in a series of scenes, most notably around the 80-minute mark, where he's left of Tyrone Power. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a grandiose epic that manages to defeat yourself as a drama. And it was this amazing scale that would put the Western (and widescreen) to bed for a while. And although the 1940s and 50s are now considered the golden age of the West, at the time it was an altered genre of stories about individual adventures and heroic deeds in an established West. not better or worse, but of a different shape. The early talkie period was the end of an era in which Western could really be gigantic.
