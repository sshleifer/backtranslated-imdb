I find it remarkable that so little has been done with the history of the atomic bomb and its development for decades after the completion of the Manhattan Project. I suspect that this was due to serious fears in the film and entertainment industry (in the fifties to the seventies) with "McCarthyism" and related national security phobias (including the Hollywood blacklist). There was a movie in the fifties (with Robert Taylor) about Colonel Paul Tibbits who flew Enola Gay in the bombing of Hiroshima, but nothing else. In Robert Shaw's description of the shark attacks on the survivors in JAWS one could take a look at a tragedy (the sinking of the US Indianapolis shortly after the transfer of the bombs to Tinian). But the actual trials and tribulations of Groves, Oppenheimer and their team were not considered to be capable of filming. And then in 1989 two films were released. I've already discussed a (DAY ONE) that I believe is best when discussing the lengthy technical, emotional and political issues in the Manhattan Project. The acting of Brian Dennehy as General Groves and David Strahairn as Oppenheimer was first class and neatly balanced. Small side vignettes on the Szilard Bomb Cruiser (Michael Tucker) help fill the story well. <br /> <br /> That's the problem here. Paul Newman is a great actor (as well as Mr. Dennehy), but Newman went in a different way to Groves, which is not terrible but less so than Dennehys intelligent, but soft military moron. Newman seems too concerned about the possibility of the gun being the biggest stick with which the other boys can be confronted in the garden of the school. Yes, it certainly was, but the real Groves would have been more like Dennehy had not kept to this great toy of the future, but to the business of creating this great toy. <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz's appearance as Oppeheimer helps maintain the movie's fundamentally interesting and good production, with support from Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. The most interesting aspect of this film, however, is the revaluation of the two tragedies of Daghlian and Slotin, especially the latter, in the character of John Cusack's Merriman. All technical advances inevitably kill people. It's just that these two tragedies (in addition to the tens of thousands lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) brought with them the dangers of the new unleashed power even in a so-called peaceful, controlled experiment. The two tragedies (notably Louis Slotin's slow, excruciating death by radiation poisoning) showed how much care was needed in using nuclear power - and how the slightest chance could still cause disaster. The only thing I saw in Cusack's performance (and the script) and the actual incident with Slotin was that after the accident, Slotin actually needed some time to find out where all his colleagues were, rather than the radiation the GDR were hit accident (he was able to show that only he had the full effect of the accidental explosion, so that the others would need only a relatively minor treatment). Maybe the whole story of Slotin's actions was too technical for the screen, but given the huge pain he had in the end, he took the time to think of the others, what a first-rate person he really was.
