I like to see Linda Blair in a real "horror" movie again. I have been disappointed in almost everything since the "Exorcist" movies (which I loved very much). What was wrong with all those nasty "B-movies" she did? <br /> <br /> David Hassellhoff on the other hand, I can only laugh. He is not a horror movie actor. David has to stay with "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch". <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a fantastic movie. Also for the eighties this was a great movie. It has horror, action and drama. It's exciting and I loved how Linda Blair came out.
