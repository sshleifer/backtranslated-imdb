Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I do not have to agree on some points. First, this movie is nothing like the cars of Paris. Not in my opinion. Nothing is like that. <br /> <br /> I think the film had elements of surrealism, but I think the filmmaker's basic approach is not "surrealistic" per se. So it's not really like CARS Paris, I'm more like a funny Euro work, with some scenes that do not carry the hallmark of "funny" surreal. <br /> <br /> Second, I find the music of Heuzenroeder brilliant. They used Whistles, that old sound of Country and Western Records, and it was better than most Australian films, where the filmmaker usually works with a dull-sounding Indy band that wants to push the company. <br /> <br /> As for the name of the movie - I do not know why it's called Modern Love. I was hoping that David Bowie would appear dressed in drag and lipstick ... I'm showing my age now.
