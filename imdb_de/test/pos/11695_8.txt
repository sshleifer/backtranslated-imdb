Crackerjack is a hit-and-miss movie set in Cityside's Australian Suburban Lawn Bowls Club. Mick Molloy plays a cheater who has earned free parking at Cityside. If the club is pressured to install poker machines on its premises, you will need to collect $ 8000 to prevent this. The club needs new members to help, and this is where Mick Molloy's character comes in and has to roll to save the club. With many emerging and aging Australian actors, Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Be warned, though most of the jokes are for those familiar with turf bowls, but there are many amusing gags that make for comical relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy co-star. Overall, the film should be recommended for people who have played or played a turf bowl, but there is enough other material for an amusing game if you have a little understanding. If you like Australian humor, I suggest you tackle Bowling White and go to the theater, as this is the premiere of Lawn Bowls (the only one).
