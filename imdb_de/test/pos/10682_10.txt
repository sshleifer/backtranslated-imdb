Gerry Anderson's first big-action live-action marquee that benefits from incredible Model FX work and a great musical note by Barry Gray. The reel-to-reel analog computers in the far-off year "2069" (I think Anderson really wanted a safe date of 100 years later!) Are a shout to see, as is the guru jacket fashion, but you could easily accuse 2001 of the same violations, but no one could have foreseen, as it turns out. This film was the springboard for the UFO series the following year, and in fact not only had the same FX people and producers, but many of the performers were regulars on this show. <br /> <br /> It always goes down well An "alternative history" future more than anything else - the "Apollo-like" rocket that is used in takeoffs always seems to be actually a different planet than Earth is. Given the act of "alternative earth," one would assume that this was the feeling they wanted. We end with an ending that contains more questions than answers. Because the "other earth" exists, every movement, event and thing is repeated on both worlds. Because of this and the sun in between, the two versions of the same person (in this case, Glenn Ross, Astronaut) can never meet. A complete accident has discovered the planet in the first place, as it most likely remained a mystery forever. <br /> <br /> The film was shot mainly in Portugal with FX work in England and is a must for any Gerry Anderson fan. I sold out the Image Bare Bones DVD a few years ago, but it's hoped that Universal will re-release it with additional extras and even a comment by Gerry Anderson.
