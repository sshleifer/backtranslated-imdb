Yes, it is Sean Connery who plays Bond again and acts more vividly and in his role than ever since shooting this film for the first time, in 1965, when he was called "Thunderball". But the tongue is so tight in the cheek, you wonder if Connery is not using some watched tricks from his friend and his more humorous follower, Roger Moore. Moore is my favorite bond, but Connery makes a strong impression case for herself on this unusual outing. The only serious Bond film not filmed under the aegis of the classic Eon Bond series "Never Say Never Again" is an irreverent return to the well. Gentle in action, yet strong in character and smart dialogue. Bond, it's clear, is a man who does not feel well. No matter how many times he saved the world, his new boss does not think much about his fat lifestyle. "Too many free radicals, that's your problem ... Caused by too much red meat, white bread, too many martinis." "Then I will cut out the white bread, sir," Bond replies skillfully. An early fight sequence in a spa represents the climax of the movie Action, Bond and an attacker fight each other A kitchen, a bedroom and a lab before Bond finally ravages his opponent, ironically with little help from these free radicals. Humor is widely used in the film, rather smarter than most of Moore's travels, though Connery seems to have more fun sitting up as a result of Moore's less selfish example. <br /> <br /> Was it because he was? make a good part of the gross? Or did it work for less stingy producers? Whatever it is, the script benefits his relaxed style and the result is richer and more entertaining than Connery's two previous Eon Bond events, "You Live Twice" and "Diamonds Are Forever." <br /> <br / The 1980s were not a good decade for Bond, whether it was Connery, Moore or Timothy Dalton. Leg warmers, video games, and ugly sports cars are all evidence, and the Bianca Jagger sunglasses worn by Klaus Maria Brandauer in his first scene do not look good on him. Forget the first impressions. Brandauer's role as chief villain, Maximilian Largo, is one of the best in any Bond film, with Brandauer enjoying the threat and mania of his character. At some point, he allows Bond to wander the area in his lounge with a martini, and his dancing eyes and crazy, seductive grin make for compelling company. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film, unlike Connery, is the Bond girls who were shot in Bond films with more attention to personality than usual, a testament to cinematographer Douglas Slocombe and the Director Irvin Kirshner. Barbara Carrera was nominated for her role as Fatima Blush for her Golden Globe, as crazy as Largo and more beautiful. It does not last the whole movie; They almost need them to focus on the others. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger's breasts and buttocks should have their own agents for the screen time they get in this movie, but I'm not complaining. Basinger is a rare beauty who, in this early role as Largo's mistress, blends incredible sharpness with a childlike vulnerability that brings out the bond within me, and many others I suspect. (Her lips and cheekbones are also pretty cute.) <br /> <br /> It's not a well constructed movie. It's the knockoff of a better Bond movie with a sloppy storyline, a terrible score, and a shallow end. But there is Connery, who proves that he has definitely taken over the final secret agent of the cinema, even if he steals one or two pages from my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is entertaining enough, so I'm not complaining.
