Well, I just discovered IMDb from my twin sister Carol. Carol and I played the "Fat Identical Twin" in Midnight Madness. We did not have to prepare much for the fat part that came with us, and the rest was natural. ;) It was our first big movie role and we had a great time doing it. We were 21 years old at the time and lived about an hour and a half away from the Disney Studio in Burbank and Hollywood, California. We grew up watching TV and probably some of the first generation of keylocks. Twenty years later we still have a lot of fun and are still "heavy" or whatever is politically correct. We no longer pursue acting, but know that we will come back when the opportunity arises. Carol is a chiropractor in our hometown of Southern California and I'm in Information Technology in Georgia. We knew it was not a masterpiece or Oscar nominee, but it was and still is a movie that the whole family can watch together and have fun with. It's nice that you do not have to worry if your kids can watch a video without having to rewind parts. And nobody was more excited than Carol and I were released on video. Carol found it at Kmart for $ 6.99! This is a cost effective way to capture and share memories. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; The Thompson twins
