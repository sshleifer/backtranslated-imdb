I do not agree with the imdb.com review that it's a bisexual man preparing to marry. Rather, it's about all the crap we go through - ourselves and our parents - when we grow up. As the Linda McCarriston poem says, "Childhood is the keg they throw you over the falls." This movie is much more of a narrative poem. It's about life and the mistakes we make and experience over the years, and how it all ends in love (I try not to be over-sensitive or schmoopy) and how to get along with a special person.
