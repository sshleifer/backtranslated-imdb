The melodies are the best aspect of this TV movie, which has above average production values, but a very superficial and slightly altered biography. Dramatizing Richard's discovery of "We've Just Just Begun" and Karen's marital problems admirably (the "superstar" montage was a nice touch), however, leaves the disagreements with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc., in her Karen's character cute, but not the tomboy and brave sides of the real Carpenter's personality. Anderson is in good shape as a creative and engaging Richard, and Fletcher makes himself known as a loving but overbearing Agnes. The haunting moment of the original show is the use of "Goodbye to Love" in the background of a commercial with anorexia hotline.
