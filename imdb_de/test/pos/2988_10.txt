I really love this movie, I saw it for the first time while working in a video library. When I went to buy it, they told me it was out of print and I could not order it, so today I thought I would look. and then I found out that they released it in Spain on DVD under the name "Algo Mas Que Amigos" and you can buy there that it is in English and Spanish on DVD ... hope that helps .... I know how hard it is to find movies that we love and that they have not released on the US market. Good luck..oh For more information here is a place to look .... http://www.zonadvd.com I think it goes for $ 10 on eBay.
