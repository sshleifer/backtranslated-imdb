I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and director Aku Louhimies introduced his film and was available for questions and answers afterwards. For some reason, the film is in Frozen Land. Therefore, I do not know how the dealers from Paha were frozen. This is a very good movie. For me it's not enough that I could classify it in the excellent category, but I've talked to some viewers who felt it was a great movie. Louhimies said that the people in Finland either loved or hated this movie and said that many people in the cinemas went for it. I'm sure some have objected to some of the cases of violence, swearing, drug and alcohol abuse and sexual assertions. It's a very smart story of how these different lives are interwoven due to a droplet effect. This movie has very interesting and strong characters. I would rate it at 7.0 out of 10 and would see it again and recommend it with caution.
