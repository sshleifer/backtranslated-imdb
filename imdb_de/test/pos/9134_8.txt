Although "Le Samourai" was not the masterpiece (I have since accepted that Jean-Pierre Melville never surpassed this classic), I find "Le Cercle Rouge" much better than "Bob le flambeur". I felt like Bob Le Flambeur was an above-average and influential B-movie, but still a B-movie. "Le Cercle Rouge" proves that Melville has continued to improve as a filmmaker. John Woo is a big fan of Melville, even if the movie style is different. While Woo uses fast motion for shootouts and an opera force for violence, Melville has a minimalist style that suits him very well. He was not interested in making fast-paced action movies, but more meditative crime thrillers. He was one of the best in this department. <br /> <br /> "Le Samourai" is still his best work, mainly because it has more character development than these, but technically they are probably equivalent. While "Le Samourai" did a great feat, there were four. Alain Delon is again an ultra-cool gangster on the search - the silence of this man is fascinating. As a police inspector, Bourvil is excellent for the case of robbery and escape. He steals every scene he's in and proves he was a talented acting actor (in France he is known as a slapstick comedian in the style of Buster Keaton). Yves Montand is also great as a shaky and paranoid weapon expert. Gian Maria Volont√® (spaghetti western regular) is overshadowed by his three co-stars, but still does enough work. <br /> <br /> Once again, Melville's direction is outstanding. The man, who is equally influenced by the American crime novels and the French new wave, always seems to know the best settings and angles. This is slower than most capillary effects, but it pays off in the end. "Le Cercle Rouge" is a bit too little absolute classic, but is still one of the best raid films ever made. Tarantino must have seen this before he made Reservoir Dogs. (8/10)
