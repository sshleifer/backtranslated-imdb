The Canadian filmmaker Ron Switzer delivers a solid, uninterrupted ride of relentless horror with the great 1991 science fiction movie "Science Crazed". A terrible monster takes revenge on his mother, a policeman and tenant of a residential building. Brilliant, practical make-up and special effects create a truly frightening monster, especially when you lurk through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the gloomy apartment environment. The characters are beautifully designed with outstanding and surprisingly touching performances from an ensemble cast. Produced by Donna Switzer newcomer Ron Switzer also wrote the face of the film in the face, which he a thrilling rollercoaster ride of twists, twists and horrors linked together, which lets you guess to the last image. Science Crazed will surely follow you long after the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!
