Four pretty young nurses in their senior year of nursing school are experiencing all sorts of turmoil and excitement in their lives: Sweet Susan (brunette Elaine Giftos) is trying hard to console bitter, terminally ill Greg (a moving performance by Darrell Larson), eagerly, But the neurotic Phred (the pretty blonde Karen Carlson) loves the handsome gynecologist Jim Caspar (the friendly Lawrence Casey), the free-spirited hippie Priscilla (the stunningly beautiful Barbara Leigh) is impregnated by the laid-back drug dealer Les (the solid Richard Rust) and compassionate Lynn (nicely played by Brioni Farrell) helps the mad Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (the excellent Reni Santoni). Despite the fact that this film was made for Roger Corman's legendary New World Pictures exploitation outfit, it's anything but your thoughtless piece of laughing softcore thug. Instead, it is a very pleasant, charming and often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the groovy early 70s (the subplot in which Lynn and the revolutionaries are involved is particularly powerful and provocative). For the director Stephanie Rothman special Kudos are commissioned, which give the material a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity. In addition, the four attractive and appealing female lead roles in tonal and commendable work. Scottie MacGregor also impresses as a wise superior, Mrs. Boswell, and the ubiquitous trailer voice of Ronald Gans, who delivers the off-screen voice of a psychiatrist. Stevan Larner's polished cinematography, the awesome rock soundtrack, and the flamboyant Folksy'n'funky scores of Clancy B. Grass III are all up to date. A real sleeper
