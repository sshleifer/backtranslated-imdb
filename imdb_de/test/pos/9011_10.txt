It's not as good as the movie that said it's a cute kids show. Okay, the Emperor has another slide and becomes a selfish spoiled brat again, accepting her and enjoying the cartoon as something entertaining. It has many jokes for the parents and still holds the attention of children. It also features two of the film's original speakers. Earth Kitt, who has starred in numerous films, but I'm sure many people know Catwoman. And Patrick Walburton (sorry, if I am misspelled), who also starred in many movies and TV series, but is widely known as The Tick. It really is a rare and wonderful combination. If I recommend it for no other reason, comic fans recommend at least one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo. In summary, an entertaining children's show with lots of inner jokes that adults can laugh with. If you value education, this is not your show. If you are just looking for something fun, this is a good choice for Saturday mornings!
