I saw this movie during a special, advanced preview in Reading, Berkshire. <br /> <br /> The two main characters Michael and Rory make a friendship when Rory is introduced to the nursing home where Michael is already located. Michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand him because his Cerebal-Palsey made people think he could not communicate. <br /> <br /> Rory introduces Michael to the life he misses. Rory is a vivacious character who does not allow his condition (muscular dystrophy) to come to him. <br /> <br /> They bond and compete for an independent life and find a nice apartment and an assistant and have all the fun you could ever dream of. <br /> <br /> Do not go to this movie if you are looking for some "entertainment". Watch this movie when you're ready to see something different. <br /> <br /> The plot is strong, the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that accompanies the movie, the mood is uplifting. <Br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. However, if you are something like me and you are prone to crying - take handkerchiefs as you need them!
