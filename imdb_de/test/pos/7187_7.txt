This movie is pretty much better than the first "Astérix et Obelix contre César", but it is far from perfect. The adaptation of the comic is good, some pictures and dialogues of the film are the same as in the book. However, there are some things that do not make the movie as interesting as the animated film released in 1968. For example the battles between Numerobis and Amonbofis. That was neither necessary nor believable, not even for the little love story of Astérix. It also lacked a few things, like the songs in the animated film and some other things ... I'm being deceived by the film because it cut out the things I was expecting and showed things I did not want or did had to see. I know it would have been very difficult to make the movie the same as the comic or the animated movie, but I expected that. Conclusion: Although the film is good, I prefer the animated film, which in my opinion is much better.
