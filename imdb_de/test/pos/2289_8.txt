Many believe that this movie is a baseball movie. Such people are disappointed because it's a baseball player, but the movie is not about baseball. <br /> <br /> Some think the film is a romantic comedy and disappointed because the relationship is not really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie is about culture. An arrogant American major leaguer and a strict traditional Japanese baseball manager can not succeed as they can not understand each other. After they have managed to break the cultural barrier, they succeed. The ballplayer becomes more Japanese in his team mentality and the manager becomes more American if he allows for individual performance, and they meet in the middle. <br /> <br /> Baseball and romance are subordinate to this critique of the two cultures. Many who have no understanding of Japanese thinking miss this and think that this is a movie about baseball or romance, and see the clash of cultures as a mild comedy. It is not - the Kulturkampf is the gravamen of the film. Based on my own experience and understanding of Japanese culture, I believe that this film worked well because it did not over-romanticize or exaggerate Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this is a fun and relaxing movie, once you understand what it's all about.
