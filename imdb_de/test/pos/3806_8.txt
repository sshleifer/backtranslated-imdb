This movie may be the best you've ever seen, watching movies, laughing, and then watching movies with your friends. If you are something like me and you probably are too, you will laugh for years about the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest things is when Gus pulls money from a guy with kids and the guy brings these kids into the woods, like Hansel and Gretel, and then he and his wife go home with them. The soup kitchen is full of funny geniuses of buffoonery: "Inspection Officer - Here!" and the following lines will probably stay in my head forever. When I showed this movie to my friends, they usually say, "What was that?!?" So if you fancy one of these movies, yippee! This movie is so OOP that it's not funny anymore, so it would probably be the easiest way to auction it online. The first time I saw it, it was a rental.
