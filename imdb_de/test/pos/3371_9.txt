The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To illustrate my experience, let me use this word image: Imagine you've spent the last month pixie sticks and color vapors, seeing nothing but twilight zone reiteration. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital where the nurse seems to get a nudge when you shoot adrenaline into your infusion. The dream you have in a coma will be something like this movie. ABSTRACT: A man appears at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it. Press the button, they will get a million dollars in cash and a person they do not know will die. I will try not to spoil anything, but from there things develop into a conspiracy that is so complex and pure and original that you will question your mind. But hey, most of us have been reasonable for a while now and the change is good. <br /> <br /> PROS: Amazing plot, good acting overall, not a slow moment when it starts. It raises questions of human morality that are rarely asked, if at all, in popular culture. This movie is deep and has meaning. It's not a summer blockbuster special effect (not that there's anything wrong with that); This film had a relatively low budget and showed up in some places. But I think maybe that's what I like so much. <br /> <br /> CONS: The first twenty minutes before it starts are really slow. At the end of the movie, you'll be so confused that you just have to lie down and think for half an hour. I can guarantee that this film will not receive rave reviews from colleagues or most critics. it's way too weird and there are not explosions every three seconds. In fact, there are no explosions in this movie (apart from your brain trying to figure out exactly what happened). I personally do not think that this is a bad thing, but many will. <br /> <br /> RATING: Just a 9/10. I've never had an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can not give him a 10/10 is because he's just too tall. There are some big things that are in the end inexplicable and that still annoy me when I sit here and write this. But overall, this is the best experience I've had in a movie for a long time. But be warned, you will not like this movie, if you can not sit back, turn your disbelief up to 150% and prepare your brain for impressive acrobatics. <br /> <br /> thestuffblag.com for more reviews
