You will like Sam Elliott's character (Falon) right from the start: a reliable policeman who is especially loyal to his partner. But too loyal and vengeful when he sees his partner dead in an alley, because he kills the one he considered the attacker before he gives him an explanation. Falon is an alcoholic and that makes him control himself, though he manages to focus on who really is behind his partner. He wears a rookie as a new partner (which happens too often in movies), but Esai Morales works well as a companion to Sam Elliot, though puzzling pieces adapt to the location where Morales begins a self-approved investigation of Falon. Above all, he wants to find the answers, because Fallon does not let him into the whole story and does not like what he finds. There is no last minute to show who the bad detectives are, which is fine. and they can not make Falon join them, leading to a dramatic ending. Fine acting with a touch of humor by Paul Sorvino, the captain of detectives. It's a good movie that makes you want to see it several times; It is therefore considered "must see" and is a good complement to a film collection! (Filmed in San Francisco)
