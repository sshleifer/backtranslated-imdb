Lucio Fulci's cat in the brain is an imaginative and somewhat selfish story of how a director drives mad. The director in question is Fulci himself, who plays a major role in the film. Fulci has become known to horror fans around the world as "The Godfather of Gore," and for good reason, as he has provided us with some of the nastiest and cruelest films ever screened. from eyeball violence in movies like Zombi 2 to a man chained to chains in The Beyond to the full Gore festival known as The New York Ripper; If you want Gore (and let's see who does not), Fulci is your man. But all that has provided for Gorehounds like you and me has taken its toll on Fulci's state of mind, and he quickly goes into the madness evoked by what he's filming. Fulci's problems do not end in his mental state, since his psychiatrist, whom he has gone to his problem, has accepted murder as a hobby by using Fulci's films as a blueprint for the murders! <br /> <br /> I have to say, the acting in this film is absolutely cruel. There is a particular scene involving a hooker and it is only suitable for laughter because it is both acting and stupidity. Fulci (obviously) takes over the main role of the film. He is not an actor and that shows, but his performance is actually the best of the movie. It is safe to say that acting is bad for an Italian horror movie. Of course, no one goes into an Italian horror, expecting good acting, so it's a bit forgivable, but I think Fulci could hire some better ones. Bad dubbing does not help either. What helps, however, is the fact that the horrible spectacle is offset by a lot of gore, and it's, to say the least, extreme! People get their heads cut off, a woman is killed in the shower (and unlike Psycho, here we REALLY see it), people are hacked, fed to pigs, and there are lots of the city's finest melee weapons - the Chainsaw on display. that pleased me without end. The amount of Gore is massively exaggerated most of the time, which gives the movie some "parody", but Cat in the Brain is obviously a movie in the tongue anyway. <br /> <br /> It would be hard to make a film about yourself and not act as a bit of a big head, and Fulci actually appears as a big head in this movie. His name is often mentioned and he is almost always on the screen; It's not much different from 'New Nightmare' in the Ego stakes, but it was obvious that he had a good time doing this, and I enjoyed seeing it, so we can forgive him a little selfishness , The end of the movie drops him - I saw that it came a mile, but then I did not seriously think the movie would take that path, but I was wrong; Unfortunately not. The end left me cold and the movie is a better watch if you turn it off just before the last two minutes. Despite the end and terrible acting, Cat in the Brain is a lot of fun and will not put an end to fulci enthusiasts and it is therefore recommended.
