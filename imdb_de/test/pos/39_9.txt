Ever since I first met Divine Ms. Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's "She's gota have it," I've been sold by this extremely gifted, but terribly underrated actress. She got an Emmy for her presentation here and to say she deserves is a masterpiece of understatement. <br /> <br /> Here she shines simply as the leader and hand in her community. This was particularly poignant for me as I grew up at the same time. The production detail was phenomenal, evoking memories of life and times in the '50s and' 60s and of women like Ms. Merkerson. She was thoroughly and skillfully accompanied by a hot, hot cast that you would enjoy over and over again. I first saw the name of Macy Gray in the credits and went ho-hum. Her performance was so good that I did not recognize her until one-third of the way. I am particularly proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to create a feeling and look of another beautiful era in African American culture that is very tastefully made. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned about the racial fabric of the time, but infinitely more on the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity that they offer to show that Ultimately, it's about the decisions that we make and how we take responsibility for those decisions. <br /> <br /> This is a dignified, elegant depiction of African American life and is certainly destined to become a classic. You owe it to you to have this as part of your collection. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
