Greta Garbo plays the lead role in "Anna Christie," a very early 1930's "MGM Talkie," the first time "Garbo Talks." 'Anna Christie' is a strong movie, but not for everyone. The film is filmed like a stage play, short sets and cinematography, long dialogues and dramatic characterizations. Eugene O'Neil, who wrote the piece "Anna Christie," is known for his dark works, and Garbo's character Anna Christie is a grim figure with a tormented past. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was mediocre. It does not help that George F. Marion, Chris Christofferson, Anna's estranged father, is verbally difficult to understand verbally. Marion does a good job as the old drunken sailors who waver with their fixation of the evil "Devil's Lake" to madness. His dialogue, however, is written with a very heavy Swedish accent, which corresponds to O'Neil's original play. The dialogue of Marie Dressler as Marthy Owens is also difficult to understand. Dressler credibly portrays a decayed old drunk woman, a "wharf rat". Their dialogue is also true to O'Neil's original, as is Charles Bickford as the Irish sailor Matt Burke, who pursues Anna in a troubled relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand. <br /> <br /> The strength of the films is Greta Garbo. As a victim of neglect and abuse, she performs well and leads to a life in prostitution. Garbo was a big star at the time and was considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Here her look is not glamorous, but tormented. Her posture almost doubles in pain. She crunches her face and becomes a wretched creature on the screen. Garbo gives the viewer these fearful feelings to convince us of his misery. <br /> <br /> This is a dark topic and Garbo brings it to life. It's not light fare, not fun, not for everyone. 'Anna Christie' are strong emotions that are brought to the investigation from the depths, this is a hellish journey.
