I saw the last night in Fort Lauderdale. In general it was funny and I liked the characters especially Sabrina. The drama is good and the story was OK, except for the end that gave way to many strings, and we were like (what?). I wanted to know what happened to the characters much better. <br /> <br /> The movie has shown the life of the rule very well and we laughed. It certainly has shortcomings, but for the first time for Ash Christian I found it good. Maybe you would like to wait for this DVD. But if you get the chance to see it, give a shot
