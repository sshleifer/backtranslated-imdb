This is a funny movie, there are not many. OK, the plot is a bit disturbing but very original. A teenager trying to compete with dad because he was not around and he was almost jailed for lying to impress an older boy. Besides, not the typical movie with teenagers. The first remake I've seen is better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor, that would be a perfect 10 because he plays all roles the same, sucks. Another problem is all women who melt over him, that is not nearly credible, he is not attractive !!
