Dee Snider was inspired to make a two-part song of a horror movie. In this film he has written / directed and produced the themes of these songs (horror terria, by TwistedSister / Stay Hungry). People have commented that he has to have a sick mind to bring it out. I do not hear anyone commenting on Stephen King, Wes Craven, Dean Koontz, or Alfred Hitchcock in his day. The film is a modern psychotic created by current social trends. Personally, I thought that it was pretty well done out of pure imagination and inspiration, even without a big budget and interviews with actual victims / criminals. This movie is perfect if you want something that will give you nightmares and scare the possible and the likely. IT COULD HAPPEN!!
