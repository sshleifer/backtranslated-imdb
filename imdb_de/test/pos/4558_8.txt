I've seen that this movie knew absolutely nothing about him and his stars, Chris Farley and David Spade, and I have to say that this movie is a comic book classic. It is sometimes so stupid that it can only be funny. Farley is as brilliant as the bumble-headed idiot who takes to the streets with his father's right hand (the equally excellent spade) to find the means to save the auto parts business. Relax, put your brain in the autopilot and enjoy the fun. A great side cast includes movie favorites like Brian Dennehy (Cocoon), Rob Lowe (Wayne's World) and Bo Derek ("10"). Highly recommended for a good laugh.
