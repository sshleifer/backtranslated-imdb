After reading a biography of the last Russian czar (Nicholas II) and not deciding to support the army, I decided to give this movie a try. <br /> <br /> I openly looked at him, not knowing anything about her (except her reputation). <br /> <br /> These are the things that impressed me the most. <br /> <br /> 1) Shots of battleships and soldiers deployed as extras. More than once I paused to think "if this had happened at that time and in that place, 80% of it would have been computer generated". <br /> <br /> 2) The realism in it. From the maggot-infested flesh to the sailor's shot with his candle and the legend "killed for a bowl of soup", this film makes no concessions to the cause of the PC (which fortunately had not yet been invented). <br /> 3) The slow descent into the madness of the sequence of Odessa Steps. From the first shot, when the flabby man appears, you have the idea that something is wrong. However, because the overall shots are composed, you will feel comfortable in your environment. Then an amputee appears and people fall into dramatic poses. Nevertheless, the images are composed ... until the Cossacks take the stage and the incredible juxtapositions appear. This scene is worth the price for the shot. <br /> <br /> 4) The fact that this film is 100% genuine propaganda. When Rambo was fighting in Afghanistan, he also had something to do with "propaganda"; just another way. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie clouded by a slow tale. Nonetheless, Metropolis, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this film are perfect examples of imaginative, edgy films that are still remembered for their merits. They make modern films look really boring and repetitive.
