When I was engaged, my fianc√© and I were in the adult bookstores. He searched for his favorite magazines and occasionally for a video that caught his eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media created, there was never a video that I really liked. I had only seen another movie a long time ago when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it was a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a correct action and was pleasant. Everyone else was grunting and puffing and blowing and so on. There are only so many times that you can watch a blond bimbo fake. <br /> <br /> This movie caught my eye and I went there and allowed him to walk in the shop. He noticed (how heavy was it not?) Grins, I was actually interested in something, lol (!) In the video section!) And came over and bought the somewhat used copy for me. We took it home and I loved it. Here was a "porn" with an act. I was not sure if it was classified as porn, but I use the word casual. <br /> <br /> The librarian was a character I could identify with. Alice declined her friend's progress. She did not feel comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments. Bill went away and she kept checking books. The White Rabbit walked through the library (a book, if you notice, I think (it's been ten years since I saw the movie) was from Lewis C.) and Alice, for the same reason, from the teen in Running the Forest If a chainsaw with a maniac is behind them and not in the direction of populated areas, then this will follow. It's the best way to move the action forward. Alice finds herself in Wonderland again. <br /> <br /> I can barely remember all the details, but I remember swimming in the lake and how it was "dried". I liked how they got Humpty Dumpty back on track, the size of the member of Mad Hatter on his hat to wear it proudly, and the brother-sister team of Dum and Dee (which bothered me a bit), then could she have been husband wife, but i could never tell how many times i have seen it). The woman on the knight Alice told her to go away and find her own knight (What is a beautiful girl like you when you make a knight like this?). <br /> <br /> The part that grabbed my attention as I watched It was about a year later one of the cards (3 of the hearts, I think) that was exactly like my ex's current wife! We could not help teasing her because she was in the movie! The king of hearts was interesting and the queen even more. Due to the openness of the forum I can not go into details. I just say that it was "orgy" and we will leave it at that! <br /> <br /> When we parted, I was allowed to take the video - he knew I liked it - but in the time since it was lost in borrowing. One day I will find another copy. By the way, if anyone could tell me which scene was cut from the Amazon version, I would really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I am very grateful Recommend this movie for over 18 people. It was soft, sweet and really '70s, but I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> ***** from 5. D.
