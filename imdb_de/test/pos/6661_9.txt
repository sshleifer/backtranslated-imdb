In Cold Mountain, North Colorado, near the American Civil War, Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) comes to the small town for health reasons with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Ada meets the shy Inman (Jude Law), and they fall in love. With the beginning of the war, Inman becomes a soldier and his great support to stay alive is the desire to see Ada back in Cold Mountain. In the meantime, Ada Ruby meets Thewes (Ren√©e Zellweger), a survivor of the war who helps her on the farm and becomes her best friend. The story changes current and past situations and reveals a beautiful romance. I really liked this movie. With names like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the side cast, a great director by Anthony Minghella and seven Oscar nominees, this film does not disappoint. My comment is that some very important scenes in the story are deleted and presented on the DVD. At least one of them, showing what happens to Sara, her baby and the three bodies in her factory, should not be deleted. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Cold Mountain'
