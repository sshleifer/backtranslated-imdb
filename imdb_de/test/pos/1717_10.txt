If you're a long-time fanatic of the doctor and huddled together when you heard that they made another series, then just rest - it more than meets the high expectations of the original. The tempo is much faster than the original shows and fits more often in 50-minute episodes than in the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the acting excellent. The hardest - and the best to get used to - are the production values ​​of the new series. Compared to the original, it now has some. (Although I'll always have good memories of bubble wrap and hand puppet monsters.) If you're not a fan or have tried the original and have not gotten it right, jump in with both feet! Everything you really need to know about the doctor will be experienced over time. This series was written with minimal reference to the doctor's vast background story to encourage new viewers. Granted, I can only see the first new series as shown on the sci-fi channel (in other words, due to time constraints probably reduced to bands), but I look forward to future episodes either on the air or on television on DVD , (4th of July can not come soon enough!)
