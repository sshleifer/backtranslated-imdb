I just watched "The League of Gentlemen: Apocalypse" at a special show in Manchester, with Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith out of the league. <br /> <br /> On the back was Peter Kay (who has a short cameo) The movie is tickled affectionately behind the back during the question and answer session after the movie. <br /> <br /> The film was complicated (in a good way) and very, very funny. This is followed by Geoff Tips, Hilary Briss and Mr. Lipp as they try to save the fictitious Rosyton Vasey from the disinterest of their creators. <br /> <br /> The league plays a wide range of their characters and self (or self-reliant characters) and is supported by the cream of British character actors and comedy actors like Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner , Warner is a special accent that reminds me of his smooth and cutting turn in 'Time' Bandits'. <br /> <br /> The film swims in and out of different realities, leaving some of the residents of Rosyton Vasey some room to grow beyond their usual limits of their comedy shits. <br /> <br /> Steve Pemberton's Mr. Lipp has a great Brethren moment at the end of the film and has to make a decision about his meaning and purpose in life, which at one unexpected moment lumps you and his tender Affection for the characters surprised. <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of something that Mark and Reece in the questions and answers after that the plot of the league, which is tired of their famous characters, is spurious and that the entire movie is really a love letter to them , <br /> <br /> For a format that began as a radio character These sketches show that these guys developed the idea of ​​entertaining a movie that takes you on a journey through fiction, reality, comedy, and a tragedy Pleasurable journey for two of the less obvious characters who have a long shape story from 70 different creations. <br /> <br /> The fans of the show will love it. It pays off, dedication and attention to detail in spades, the uninitiated may be a little lost, but the joy of the LoG was always the ability to immediately tune in to his keenly observed characters and the stylistic leap into a farce and expressionist homage do. <br /> <br /> There are numerous tributes, including 'The Shining' and 'La Belle et la Bete', to name only two I have discovered, and they demonstrate their love of cinema and history with one Segment in 1690s England, that makes perfect sense if you are dealing with the movie. <br /> <br /> What can I say, I was surprised, confused, felt and chuckled and they definitely did what many failed. A successful British television comedy for the cinema. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed The League of Gentlemen in the past, have a look. You will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If not, borrow / buy a DVD and then check it out. <br /> <br /> Well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous questions and answers.
