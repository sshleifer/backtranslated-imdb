I saw "Signs of Life" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written ensemble production with great performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother Daryl. Arthur Kennedy has also been honored in one of his last roles as an alternative shipbuilder whose family business is nearing completion. The rest of the cast, which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker, gives their characters remarkable clarity and substance. <br /> <br /> The direction is subtle and effective. I've seen this movie several times over the years and highly recommend it. A nice piece of filmmaking.
