This is my favorite kung fu movie. It has a very authentic flavor, spiced up with an eerie music score (from traditional Chinese instruments, I think), and some wonderfully outdated melodramatic moments contrasted by a deeply affected comedy. In trying to create their own "western" genre (cowboy movie), the Chinese built a whole new animal, marked by kung fu fights and the associated sound effects. The story of Five Fingers Death is simple, a story of revenge (for killing a loved one) and the persecution of the main character to master the "iron-fist technique" that enables him to take a sacred revenge on his To practice enemies. There is even a love interest, though the awkward, polite way (found in most Chinese films of that time). The end result, however, is great and much more authentic than any Bruce Lee movie.
