I, as many IMDB patrons seem to do, stumbled upon this little movie when it appeared on the Canadian "Showcase Network." Like many of you, I was sucked in and seen the whole movie. At first I was fascinated by the dialogue and the dry humor with which the film is rich. I walked leisurely along a kind of "Kevin Smith meets Killer Films" wave until the movie really stunted and explored its themes in more detail ... with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. Far from being taken out of experience, I was brought in further. This is not the best movie of its kind and certainly will not have universal appeal ... so I understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought ... and I liked it a lot. The "Flashback" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well implemented and the issues raised were human, accessible (in my experience) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to be sweet, funny and entertaining, without shying away from controversial issues and harsh emotional language, dynamics and situations. This movie is a great antidote to many punches that have permeated the funny / clever romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the educated sect. Take two hours and head to the world of Wirey ... or you could rent "You Have Got Mail" because if you like it, you will not like it anyway! Those of us who have liked it will be fine without you on our side ...
