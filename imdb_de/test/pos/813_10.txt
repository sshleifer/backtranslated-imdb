This must be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The idea of ​​a typical family that leaves everything behind to live in the wilderness. If mom and dad both lose their jobs, they have green slime in the bath. They decide that it is best for their families to move to Oregon. Once there everything goes wrong. An interesting cast of characters complements this movie. Including a young Molly Ringwood I would definitely recommend this movie.
