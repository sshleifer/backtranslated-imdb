Ah! When good actors accept sober material! If you consider this film a tight police thriller, you may be disappointed. While the situations are very realistic, the action continues with a very predictable clip, and you can pretty well see what's coming up before the actors get you there. Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just moving clich√©s. Much of the dialogue is just stupid. <br /> <br /> But! If you love to make good actors about this kind of material and make something out of it, then you will LOVE this movie! Sam Elliott is downright brilliant when you bring Detective Falon's one-tone character to life with depth and pathos. Those of you who have never known Elliott as much as your usual stoic stance will be pleased with the emotions he shows in this film. And in his early fifties, he looks fantastic! His bare breast scene gives hope to middle-aged men everywhere! Esai Morales does a wonderful job by playing his role as Det. Falon's eager beaver new police partner. He could easily have played it as Robin for Elliott's Batman, but instead he breathed a genuineness and passion into that role. He lets it work, despite some lame lines he has to say. Paul Sorvino is fun to watch! He plays the eccentric police captain. He seems to know that he is slumbering in this movie and has a ball with it. He also makes it fun for us. <br /> <br /> This movie is very much in the storyline, but makes up for it with great performances! Sam Elliott fans should get away with it, because it's a killer when you see him spreading his wings and doing so much more than he normally is allowed to!
