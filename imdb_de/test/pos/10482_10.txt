The dead spots and the superficial picture postcard of "Out of Africa" ​​have buried almost every interest that I might have had to read to read Isak Dinesen. When my brother bought "Babette's Feast" for me and knew that it was based on a Dinesen story, I did not necessarily go to the VCR. But as the titles rolled, it became clear that this was not an ordinary movie. Jutland (where it is set) is not Africa; The cold fog that collects on the camera shots is not inviting. The cold, forbidding sea; the heavy gray clouds; the pale, icy green cliffs - translate into hardships that show on the faces, over the director Gabriel Axel draws the curtain. The shabbiest is Bodil Kjers as Philippa; amidst the countless merits of this movie, this face is the most memorable. It is like a map that presents us with the esteemed miracle of the apostolate of your minister, Fathers. Like a labyrinth of long-overlooked fjords, where the complications of the persistence and commitment of their congregation hang like shiny shields. <br /> <br /> I assure you that Dinesen inexplicably teases the world for Christian devotion, if Philippa is rejected by her as her only serious worshiper (because he fears he will never comply with the rules and hardships of her small religious clique and he returns to find her mistress, whom he considers the continent's greatest cook. I think it is also her point that Christ answers the doubts and regrets of those who give up worldly success (Philippa's sister Martina rejects the effort with a visiting baritone (Jean-Philippe Lafont, whose cheerfulness elevates a uplifting counterpoint to the sparse mind forming the title of an opera star: the titular figure leaves France and has an enviable reputation and seeks refuge as a servant of two Spinster sisters) to achieve artistic successes for only God and those close to him, to pursue. But it is Axel who unites the lives of these people with the rich voice of Martinas voice and the table of Babette Hersant and radiates a splendor that you would never expect from a film about sacrifice, belief and religious beliefs. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this film from other religious films is its clever humor. "Babette's Feast," that is, the banquet itself-a posthumous commemoration of the minister's 100th birthday-is a beautifully staged collision of sensations that delivers comic moments to an ensemble of actors who are unparalleled in their subtlety. It is only this clever comedy that enriches the solemn feelings of closing. Together, they do some pious movies that are rarely done. They leave a believer trembling hopefully and unexpectedly determined and humble.
