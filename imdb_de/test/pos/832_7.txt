This movie is good in its genre and this genre is of course action with a small / average budget. Looks like Van Damme will perform much better if he's led by a good director. There is your basic bar brawl, alley scene and mostly rifle fight. A simple drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine performs an OK action movie if you ignore the faint plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the show is: <br /> <br /> Scott Adkins. How come that this guy is not a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger action star I do not know? Director Isaac Florentine has previously shot a film called Special Forces (2003) with Scott Adkins, who has an incredible martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding Kung Fu fans. Another amazing Scott Adkins feature is Undisputed 2. Check the guy and make a noise. This guy needs to get a super action star status, and he has to get it now! Movie? It is Van Damme who has refined some of his recent work even further. No Oscars here, but you knew that. Nevertheless, it has a nice little town and I could find worse ways to spend my time. Therefore, I give this genre a solid 7 out of 10 points.
