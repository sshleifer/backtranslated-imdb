In relative terms, after seeing a lot of disgustingly bad television, Tom Fontana & Levinson are geniuses for creating and delivering this writer's book, the biggest TV show ever. Oz was treated terribly In this country, the final went well. 3 The morning before, it was seen as an alternative to those who had nothing to do with primetime. <br /> <br /> I did not catch Oz until the end of the first series and from then on it was an inevitable clock. My husband Adebisi is probably the most intimidating villain of all time, Beacher the perfect anti-hero, Eammon Walker's Saeed an acting class. Of course there was the hardcore stuff - some bad evils, but essentially Oz had a soul. Augustus tells the developing plot with Beads of Insight, while the struggles of Beacher, Mcmanus, Saeed, Rebedahl, etc. are better than any soap opera before or after. Compassion Violence Wisdom Tragedy Intelligence Pain Joy Brutality Love & Heroism Oz went through the spectrum of human emotions - all in a max-safety prison! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Thursday evenings should be followed by the great vids of the Oz series. 2/3 back In 99 was the best TV I have ever seen. Beacher attacks Vern In the gym is a moment that I do not need a video for - a little classic I'll never forget. <br /> <br /> Imagine what Oz would have done with the same boost as the Sopranos had a 10 clock window and all promos ??? Well, I'm over now, for those who got it. It's a privilege for those who were not on TV, shit ... and you deserve it.
