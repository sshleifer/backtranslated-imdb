I saw this movie recently and decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is not to expect what you have seen in the past of Miyazaki. Miyazaki is known for his work on Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. good for western viewers. Both films somehow resembled each other but at the same time were completely different. Ponyo, however, is a completely different kind of story and animation. <br /> <br /> The story follows "Ponyo", a fish that has the face of a girl. After running away from home on the ocean floor, Ponyo finds a whole new world that she never knew was out there, and also new trouble when she was almost caught by a fishing boat, she became a five year rescuer rescued boy, known as Sousuke. <br /> <br /> The story then follows the two and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish. Can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever? <br /> <br /> I think the movie was inspired by "The Little Mermaid" and is similar to "Tonari no Totoro". <br /> <br /> The film is very short and you have very little time to learn more about the characters in this film. But the characters, a fish and a little boy, how much do you expect? The movie is about 3 days apparently. I think that's why the movie is so short. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and I hope you all like this movie
