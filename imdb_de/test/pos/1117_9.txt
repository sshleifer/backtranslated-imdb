A wonderful family movie & a nice horse movie. 75 +% entertainment. Casey, Buddy and Kelly Marsh are very interesting and lovely characters. The horses are real beauties. <br /> <br /> Has the horse race a backdrop to how happiness is sometimes good. Shows how children can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistic characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something that everyone can identify with. Andrew Rubin does a wonderful job as Buddy, the sensible older brother. Something reminded me of Aidan Quinn (eyes, voice, facial expression). <br /> <br /> Casey lets you fall in love with the character because of the seriousness. Sarah Blue is also beautifully portrayed by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle, the father, is played by Walter Matthau and he is the character. <br /> <br /> Although the film offers room for improvement, this is a very enjoyable movie.
