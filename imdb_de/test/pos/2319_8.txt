The first few minutes of this movie do justice to justice! It's not funny for me to get on board the submarine and these funny characters start to gel. I was born and raised in Norfolk Virginia and met my share of "other" sailors - I even married one! Most of my favorite movies are just funny, not up to date, regardless of sex or violence, and funny every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still funny, even though I know the dialogue by heart. Kelsey Grammar with "God I LOVE this job!" Was sincere, sincere and kind. Rob Schneider is hysterical when the crew turns back to him because of annoying nerves. I'm still amazed at the size of this fishing boat next to a submarine! I can see why people living this life would notice the Uh-Ohs, but it's not a documentary, because it's a comedy and I love it!
