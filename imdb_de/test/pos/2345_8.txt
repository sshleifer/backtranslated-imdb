One Life Stand is a consummate piece of film that has not yet earned the recognition it deserves. The IMDB rating of 1.7 does not do it justice and may be due to the few screenings it has ever had, and not to the quality of the film. The film was digitally shot in black and white and is well equipped with production values ​​that speak for its lowest budget. The performances are excellent, especially those of Gary Lewis, who gets better with every role. My only criticism is that it is a bit too long and could compensate for the dark moments with a little more humor. Overall, though, it's a nice piece of work.
