The world will miss John Frankenheimer. This was his first feature film and it took him four years to shoot his second, but do not let that stop you from finding out. Frankenheimer's direction is safe, and he gets some convincing performances from his cast. <br /> <br /> Somebody else has already pointed that out, but I also want to discuss James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two important supporting roles. Both would work for Frankenheimer again - Gregory, above all, as a limping senator in "The Manchurian Candidate" - and they are doing a good job for him here. <br /> <br /> If the whole thing seems too simple in the end This is just because Frankenheimer and the writer Robert Dozier told a simple story and they are doing well. Look out - Turner Classic Movies may show it again.
