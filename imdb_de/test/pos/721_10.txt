This is certainly a cult classic !! <br /> <br /> It's difficult to follow sometimes, but on the other side is a movie like Jacobs Ladder or even Fight Club. If you want a standard fare, you can rent the Care Bears Movie or an old Disney classic. But if you want to "see the world differently", then I would say, open up for Enigmas and for a movie that challenges what we see and think. <br /> <br /> For me, the key is The film was original and had been asking me all the time. Although I have seen some complaints, but overall I would say, take the movie the way it is and enjoy it.
