I loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More classic sci / fie / horror movies should be reset to this comedy level, which I think is high on the line. A movie without alcohol, you laugh so hard that you pour it over you. Can we expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to propose many films for this kind of remake. Mel Brookes has done some remakes of classic movies. He has made some very strong contributions. A picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope a producer or director can come up with the idea and bring us new comedy on our screens. We need a good comedy boost to keep our laughs higher than ever. A good comedy FIX.
