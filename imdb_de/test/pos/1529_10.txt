Rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion. What disturbs the movie so much is that the drama feels so real that it's almost hard to remember it's just a movie. This is by far the achievement of Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman in their careers. The film feels almost like a staging as it is staged and illuminated. The only bad thing about this movie is that it's very difficult to get a copy of it. I've only seen it on laserdisc so far. This really powerful movie deserves a digitally remastered broadcast and special edition on DVD. It's really that good.
