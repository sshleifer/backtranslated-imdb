In 1952, Hollywood decided to redo the first classic of Al Jolson. This time the son of the cantor was played by Danny Thomas. When he returns home from the army, he is expected to follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming cantor. Young Mr. Golding, however, is quite enthusiastic about the show business. At this time he meets Peggy Lee, an aspiring singer. She looks very good and her interpretation of her favorite song Lover is remarkable. The movie writers were clever enough not to hide the obvious Jewish man and non-Jewish girlfriend. If anything, this is dubbed. In his anger at betraying his promise to become a cantor, his father makes the traditional Jewish sign of family loss. This would not happen under circumstances where a promise was broken. This would happen if an inter-faith marriage took place between the Orthodox. Thomas is really good at playing the cantor's son. His singing is impressive because the film ends with a positive result. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that technical advisers did not realize that women do not carry paperback books to the synagogue during this time on the Sabbath.
