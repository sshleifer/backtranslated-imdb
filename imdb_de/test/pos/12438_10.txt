After a long time in the West End, this charming film has transformed Margaret Rutherford in this financially successful 1950 version as Headmistress "Miss Whitchurch". <br /> <br /> All interiors took place at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. The outdoor scenes were filmed on site at a public girls' school near Liss in Hampshire. During the 12 - week shoot, both Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell lived in a nearby hotel and often visited the school in the evenings, where they would enjoy the company of real schoolwomen. The film 's script contains only two original lines from the original play. The main actors and supporting performers are in great shape and you can only feel benevolent in the final scenes.
