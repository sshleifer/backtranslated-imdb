A nice film. John Garfield's character is a distant relative of Jean Valjean from Les Miserables, while Detective Rains recalls Victor Hugo's Javert, the relentless arm of the law. <br /> <br /> As in many of Noir's films, The City embodies evil, while the land and nature are sanctuary, redemption and a second chance for those whose lives are destined to fail forever. But even in bright daylight, the danger can suddenly arise, as the excellent scene at the reservoir shows. John Garfield -an actor who, as Leonard Maltin points out, should be rediscovered: I have never been disappointed in any of his films except for his supporting role in "Gentleman's Consent", but it was not his mistake, but a heartfelt one sensitive performance and the onlooker pages with him as soon as he is wrongly charged (the first sequence shows a rather unfriendly hypocrite, but all his exams trigger him and how do we feel in recent scenes with Detective Rains.Colorful characters ( Grandma and the kids) plus much joy in life that is necessary.The humor is also present in the strip poker game, as the Dead End brats are a rich kid. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
