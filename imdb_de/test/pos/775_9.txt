I saw this movie on ITV and I really liked it. It was very good to see and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters is particularly mentioned, as she creates a wonderful, varied interesting figure. Ben's character is a bit shy and stoic, but the changes he undergoes are wonderfully played by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say that he has a future in acting after Harry Potter. Laura Linney is pretty good in her. The role of Ben over the protective mother is the only thing they're wrong with when they do ... Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother, and in the end he is also quite honorable. The only character I was not so interested in was Bryony, she was a bit plain and unnecessary, I thought. All in all, this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to see. one of my favorite movies of the year easily.
