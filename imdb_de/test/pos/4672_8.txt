The movie is really good, it does not use violence or sex etc. to sell itself like other movies, but instead uses a really decent storyline (based on the original by Michael Caine) and some great actors for a fun, action-packed movie to do what I really enjoyed. One thing that made me even happier about this movie was that there were some actors I really like, such as Edward Norton (whom I last saw in the 26th hour, which I enjoyed), Jason Statham ( the van, too) and Seth Green is great in my opinion. His role as roommate of Shawn Fanning, known as "The Napster," is hilarious and his hacking abilities play a big role in the main robbery, which centers on a big traffic jam in LA. The chases are very decent and the thieves' high-tech equipment is interesting and very impressive. I have not seen the original yet, so I can not really compare that, but I really liked it and would highly recommend this movie to anyone. It's not a movie where you have to like this genre, everyone will like it I felt good after watching this movie, it had a really good ending and overall it was very funny to see. I give 8/10. Look at it!
