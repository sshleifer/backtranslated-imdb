There are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer. Two women gradually find themselves trapped in their arms (as cheesy as that phrase sounds, that's what happens) and find that they can not answer their own question as to what their relationship is when their own society has no name for it , Deepa Mehta's slightly misnamed FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked to the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming. Fire as an uncontrolled erotic passion does not appear here as the women - the older and more feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and the younger, more masculine Sita (Nandita Das) - realize that they share far more than shared ideas and affection for one another and for what they believe is their passion for each other, despite the opposition that their very traditional husbands and families face. As in WATER, FIRE is deeply spiritual, though technically it falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama (where WATER, like the weight of the word, has a stronger meaning that ultimately exceeds its definition). Nevertheless it is a very nice picture and a strong voice from a strong director.
