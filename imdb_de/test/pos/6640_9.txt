This is one of the darkest, most terrible of Bergman's films I've ever seen. I also think that this is one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of the war and what he does to human souls. The pair of musicians who have left a big city to leave a remote island If they live as farmers, they are capable of unspeakable and shameful actions that would normally have been unimaginable to them when fighting for the terrible To survive the reality of war. They betray their souls, their friends and even themselves in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are, as always, brilliant as a lost, confused and frightened couple caught in the middle of a civil war. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
