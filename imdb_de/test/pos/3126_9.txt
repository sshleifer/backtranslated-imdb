Wagon Master (1950) Director: John Ford <br /> <br /> Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> John Ford takes the corporation out to the Utah desert to film a western movie with this smaller classic. No John Wayne, no contradictory antiheroes, no psychological explorations, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture. <br /> <br /> This ensemble features Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy)). They are horse traders who come to town to do business only as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, who is shown exit. The group is on their way to their own settlement, but they know that the odds and rough terrain oppose them. So they hire Travis and Sandy as wagoners for their journey. Along the way, they meet and meet a traveling medicine salesman and his two female cohorts (Alan Mowbray as a doctor who remembers My Darling Clementine and Joanne Dru as his "daughter"). Tension comes when the murderous Clegg group meets the wagon train. And there is also an atypical (for Hollywood) meeting with the Navajo. <br /> <br /> Much of the story and humor is driven by the clash of ideals / cultures. First, between Travis and Sandy and the Mormons, between Ward Bond himself (he is constantly trying to suppress his urge to be a Reformed man), between the doctor and his ladies and Mormons, between the wagon train and the outlaws, and finally all and the Navajo. There is also a classic Ford scene of a rushing dance expressing one of its characteristic subtitles of civilization that come to the limit. <br /> <br /> No duke here again, but I've found Ben Johnson, especially the boy, assure Ben Johnson that you have an appealing screen presence. He comes with his own background story, with this train and even when you see how he rides the stunt itself. He is great here in one of his early deserved performances. Harry Carey Jr. may have been on the market for a couple of years, but he's still pretty raw, but he's nice. Ward Bond is his usual wonderful, stormy self. I have noticed that Joanne Dru is a train in everything I see her, but here she is mercifully unremarkable. Other familiar faces include Jane Darwell, Francis Ford, and Hank Worden who play "stupid," as he will do in The Searchers a few years later. It is no longer amusing here. <br /> <br /> There are some absolutely spectacular black and white photographs by the frequent Ford collaborator Bert Glennon. Not only is there a typical master class in the landscapes and horizons, but also a handful of scenes with shadows and (sun) light. The soundtrack includes the legendary country music group The Sons of the Pioneers. I can not get more cowboy than that. <br /> <br /> *** Â½ of 4
