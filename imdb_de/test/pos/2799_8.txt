The first thing I wanted to do after seeing this movie was to look at it again (because I missed a lot laughing). I am European and have studied abroad and have lived as well as with Spaniards, French, Italians and Germans. The movie was full of stereotypes that usually push people over and read some of the other reviews that I see have driven people crazy. But this film gets the clich√©s so correct that I have nothing to complain about. Apart from the way the Frenchman became a drunken party animal. The Englishman was the perfect "Geezer" stereotype. Drunk, annoying, insulting, but in the end translucent. In addition to the stereotypes, the film has also understood the emotional aspect of studying abroad. At first he is shy, does not know anyone, misses his home, does not know his way around. Over time, it becomes his home and when it's time to leave, it's extremely difficult. A feeling that people can only understand when they experience it. I highly recommend this movie.
