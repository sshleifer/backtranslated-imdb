So begins "One Crazy Summer," the evil twin of "Better off dead ..". How can a movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by David Lee Roth? <br /> <br /> This movie is a total blast. Again a pair of John Cusack with Curtis Armstrong, but this time when Bobcat Goldwaith is added to the mix, it has great, funny results. Hyperactive Bobcat scares the nerves of everyone around, Curtis "Ak Ak" is the son of a confused military with pacifist tendencies and Demi Moore (with natural breasts ... wow!) As the love interest of a again chronically depressed Cusack <br /> < br /> The story is simple enough. The laughs are there, but both movies by Savage Steve Holland have a certain quality ... they're funny, but they're cute too. The scene where Curtis finds a pompous doll on the target beach and starts to think about how a little girl can not sleep was stupid, funny and touching. The animation that is used everywhere is pretty surreal. "The Boat" is hysterical (complete with Watsamatta U. sail and Odie plush doll). All in all an entertaining movie, albeit not as good as "Better off dead ..."
