NIGHTS IN RODANTHE puts two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere back on the canvas, in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman starving for something more in their lives than they currently do. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene of the movie to its final embrace. The places, the beauty of their attraction for each other, when they unfold at the first meeting, and the story that follows, and when they know each other with the attraction that they feel towards each other, is real, is a romance that is on a project audience is projected with tender care. James Franco in another trivet is just the right casting, and the elegance of Lane in combination with the beach house is a true fall 2008 movie that you'll always remember, as well as THE NOTEBOOK.
