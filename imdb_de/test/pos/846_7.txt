Believe me, I wanted this series to work, but the early departure of Kevin Kilner brought a death blow after the first season. Robert Leeshock just was not right for the role, and Jane Heitmeyer did an admirable job as lead, but at that point the series just got too messy and confused. I do not know what happened in the fifth season, what a mess. Sometimes it's time to drop the red cloak and just put the sword in the bull, if you know what I mean. The only consistent thread that held the series together was the astounding accomplishments of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in a quiet ideological conflict. If it were not for her talents and well-written dialogue, she would have been two weird bald heads in a B-movie series SyFy ...
