This documentation about dinosaurs was undoubtedly fascinating and very well done. However, I saw many of the parts with discomfort. The film generally had a fairly confident attitude toward everything he said and showed, but inevitably much of the behavior of the animals, their interaction with each other, how they looked, how they moved, what they ate, much of it is surely guessed - sometimes with reasonable self-esteem, sometimes just wild guessing. But the viewer is never made aware of it, the film pretends to actually observe real dinosaurs and their true behavior, etc. This probably makes better view than confronting the audience with mountains of disclaimers, but it does in my opinion do something to it populist.
