I remember when skateboarding was reborn in the 70s. I asked my parents for money with a used skateboard of a friend. It was a piece of garbage, complete with clay wheels and everything. I also remember reading the skateboarder magazine, both impressed and terrified by the Dogtown crew. Skating never became a way of life for me, but in a sense it has always been part of my life, whether it's a board used for transport or just a few friends who skate. <br /> <br /> This film is a brilliant documentary about the true birth of modern skating. When I saw this crew skating from the shallow, boring hobby, it became the vertical lifestyle where I had to sit limp for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that enough material from that time is left to make this movie, and thank God for that. The material is brilliant. It made me feel like watching an old movie by Buster Keaton: I've seen some of the tricks Keaton has repeated countless times in other films since then, but if you go back and see the first person doing the trick, it's amazing That you were not only the first to successfully try it, but also that they lived through it and worked it effortlessly. That's the feeling that this movie gave me. Yes, I've seen people slipping pools, but once you've watched the FIRST people ice skating and invented the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating, it's like being in front of the house on Keaton fall and let him safely stand in the frame of a window. It is absolutely awesome to see something that has not been tried before, but since then almost everyone has tried it. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautiful to watch and unbelievable to listen to. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a movie. This is a movie that appeals to people, whether they are skating or not. I talked to a few of my friends who, after vehemently protesting, got their girlfriends to go through this movie and all said that their girlfriends were intrigued at the end of the movie and loved him the way they did. <br /> <br /> As for the previous comments on this board, in which the film is hailed as too selfless, I find that this is an unjust devaluation. I enjoyed watching these guys get excited about their past. They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. You have the right to pat yourself on the back. They were stars for what they loved. Most of these guys / girls have never achieved the amazing success of Tony Hawk today, but for skaters this success was not possible at the time. Sure, they've had some successes, but more importantly, they have lived a life they enjoy doing, and as we end up seeing, surfing, skating or working almost all still in the surfing / skating industry. How many of us can say that we have lived our lives and been successful by breaking and doing all the rules we like to do? You can. My hat goes to Dogtown and Z-Boys to be on their own and forever change the skateboard world.
