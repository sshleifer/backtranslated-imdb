Aaron Carter plays the pop star (J.D. McQueen) in this movie (Surprise). This is a typical movie in which the lead actress (Jane) is very much in love with JD McQueen, the pop star (as well as many other girls), but she is the lucky one who can spend the days with JD and relate to him is more of a fantasy. J. D. has to go to a public school to maintain his math score to do his summer tour. Problem is that J.D. is not good at math. He finds the smartest person in the school (Jane) who teaches him. Jane tutors and falls in love with J.D.J.D in return, but J.D. messes up and has to fix everything to win the girl and go on the summer tour. The movie is definitely worth seeing. Aaron will be a great actor !!!
