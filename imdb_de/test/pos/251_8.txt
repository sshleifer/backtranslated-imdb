A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth), who dreams of being on Broadway, meaning she has to leave the small dinner theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and go every Friday night to a local bar where they get oysters to look for a pearl (they never eat it). The plot offers many possibilities for songs and dance. The film has two questions Rusty must answer: is the glory anything he has promised? and is less really more when you are happy? Answering these questions makes the movie. The film also shows the talents of the three main characters. Never a boring moment!
