This Metro movie is episodic, but almost a constant series of car chases that are mainly trying to escape the police, whether real or imaginary, as Buster is believed to be a runaway criminal. It is consistently imaginative and entertaining. His greatest asset is to document how Hollywood looked in the early 1920s, with 95% shot dead outside the streets and buildings of the time. Here there is a gemstone moment and a gemstone sequence. <br /> <br /> The big moment is when a train from a long distance approaches the camera quickly and then stops shortly after - with Buster sitting lazily on the Cowcatcher within seconds of a close-up view of a close-up. <br /> <br /> <br /> The big sequence is that the phone booth is next to the elevator - one that is constantly confused with floor-to-floor racing - one of the big Keaton gags. <br /> <br /> The cinema print is sharp and clear - almost immaculate. There is a violin / piano score. This is one to look for and enjoy.
