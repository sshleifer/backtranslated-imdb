Honestly, I just enjoy watching James Caan. Wonderful actor. With this simplicity, you know exactly what he thinks. A true professional. <br /> <br /> I saw the show from the beginning and found it different - this is something unique in Hollywood - a new idea - not a third version of a recent hit show - /> <br /> I think the show is funny and exciting too. I like the pace. It never gets boring. I especially like the mystery in each episode - as it unfolds. I'm a big mystery fan and have read many of the great mysteries, but I think the stories on the show are well written and the result is seldom obvious. Very interesting to me, probably because I'm not a player, the other drawbacks the "players" are dealing with - I was intrigued by the number of schemes people use to rob Las Vegas. The music: I like the music at the top of the show. Absolutely perfect for the show ... Sets the tone and the atmosphere. Just wonderful. And of course there is James Caan.
