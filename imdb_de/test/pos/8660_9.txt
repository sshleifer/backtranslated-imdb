What a great movie that was. Is it the sky? Hell? or something in between? I do not agree with many reviews of this movie that say this is a representation of hell. It's not even clear if the opening scene starts the movie or is a flashback from the end. Besides, it's not clear that the main character is going to hell, but maybe somewhere in between. The review I read on IMDb says that this is hell, but I do not agree with all my heart. Bear in mind that perhaps good people who commit suicide can not be condemned to hell ... this is just a belief. This is indeed a thinker and I would / would recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of movie. Definitely worth it!
