The riddle and its solution was a great noir imagination. However, I have some questions, maybe I have not paid enough attention. <br /> <br /> Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the replacement girl and why? <br /> <br /> And a few minor problems, they should have shown the stop at the hotel for the change. Not that they should have shown the counter, but they should have shown Jim and the girl how they went to the hotel. Jim went to the bathroom, came out and was told by the bartender that his girlfriend went to the car without him. Then Jim got back in the car and saw the sleeping woman and a little girl in the backseat. This would have given the viewer a sporting chance to find the solution. <br /> <br /> I wish I had taken it, I would like to see it again.
