"House of Dracula" is not so bad of a movie and is sometimes pretty decent. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Arrival at Dr. med. Franz Edelmann, (Onslow Stevens), Count Dracula, (John Carradine) in his house by the sea discreetly looking for a remedy for vampirism. He begins work on a possible cure by blood transfusion. The Wolfman, Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), arrives at his estate looking for a cure for lycanthropy. In collaboration with the two patients, he discovers a potential cure in a mold found near the lab. After searching the area, he finds the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) nearby. Dr. Nobleman is obsessed with resurrection and continues to neglect Dracula and Larry's wishes, and after demanding that they be treated instead of working on the monster, they turn to each other in a climax. The good news: This was a pretty decent one Movie. There is a basic idea that is very creative and imaginative. This is the first film that openly suggests the idea of ​​vampirism as a blood disease and can be transmitted from person to person through the exchange of bodily fluid, which should be picked up in later genre works, but rarely so directly. There is even a slide of the parasite, which is blamed for the disease. It works in some pretty nicely used ideas and comes across as a pretty clever idea, even if some of the execution is a bit stale. The fact that each of the creatures has at least one outstanding scene is a well-made idea. The Wolfman has a wonderful scene in which he turns into a doubtful member of the search party in a jail cell and goes crazy. Dracula's first appearance of appearing as a bat and flying to a sleeping figure that then appears in human form is impressive. The Monster Rampage is handled well and causes a fair amount of destruction. The big bat into which Dracula transforms always looks decently and is quite realistic. It's a decent thing. <br /> <br /> The bad news: There are some things that were not great about this thing. The fact that the film combines so many potentially fascinating plans and ideas that it really does not know what to do with it. There are several background stories that need to be mixed together and that should be clear enough to mix well and appear coherent. That really does not have any of that. The plot is pretty thin and does not favor any of the stars. She focuses instead on one and the other and then includes all three in the end. The monsters seem to be engaged only for the smallest possible reason, which makes it a big distraction. The ending is, for once, a big disappointment, and it seems like it's been changed at the last minute. There are a few other little things that were not too spectacular and contribute to it. <br /> <br /> The Final Conclusion: It's a pretty decent movie and mostly manages to make a movie entertaining in style. While not nearly as good as the classic status of each monster's debut features, it's a nice watch for fans of monsters and universal movies in general. <br /> <br /> Today's rating PG: Violence
