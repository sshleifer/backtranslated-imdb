The first half hour of "Homegrown" was quite boring and not exciting, but as the movie progressed, I was also interested in the characters and the plot. Some scenes are really scary and you are afraid of the main characters you are actually connected to. The story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in Southern California. They witness the murder of Malcolm (John Lithgow), the owner of the farm, and take the weeds for themselves. The three rather simple peasant hands soon end up in a fearsome world full of mafia and local interests, while always trying to convince all people that Malcolm is still alive. While the film had several mistakes and a slow start, it proved worthwhile. 7/10 stars.
