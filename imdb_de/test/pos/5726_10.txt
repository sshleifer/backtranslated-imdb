The Elegant Documentary - <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie ... if you're a selfish know-it-all physicist. So much less than one percent (tiny fraction) of the population can tell that this show just tells them what they've already learned and already know. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie! - If you belong to one of the vast majority of people who belong to more than 99% of the population who do not study or already have in-depth knowledge of theories of physics, including theory of relativity, quantum, string and M theory. <br /> What a brilliant documentary. Starting with a helpful historical background, you will step by step into a universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. I've always valued mathematics. This movie can easily give you a glimpse into a very nice language math without feeling like you're leaving the mark. <br /> <br /> The show repeats itself sometimes, since the original format was a mini-series split into three shows. It therefore makes sense to politely remind us of the principles presented. I found that very helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our existence. <br /> <br /> We are all (and all around us) vibrational energy with a natural tendency to harmony. This film can blow you away - or at least help you to recognize that the universe is far greater than what we see around us (even with the Hubble telescope) and much smaller than the protons and neutrons inside the atoms that we use we have learned secondary school. The M theory holds many great sizes for "possibility". <br /> <br /> It just seemed so appropriate that all this elegance inherently (by the admission of numerous brilliant scientists) should move out of the realm of science and into the realm of philosophy. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be religious to feel like this movie that has brought you one step closer to God. <br /> <br /> Bravo Brian Greene. Well done. <br /> <br /> P.S. If you are interested in being more comfortable in your place in the universe and wanting more insight into the 'possibilities' that quantum mechanics offers in connection with spirituality (of all things), then I strongly recommend you, too "What the Bleep !? - Down in the rabbit hole". Yes, I know that they are making some stupid mistakes, implying that a shaman may not be able to see a boat if he's never seen one (my eyes handle light reflections well - I see things everyday that I've never had and brain cells are cells in the body that do not actually share. But if you can overcome those little hurdles and put off the things you do not like and cling to those you do, then there's a lot to like about this movie. <br /> <br /> Then check out "The Secret" (2006 documentary on The Law of Attraction - Finding IMDb Title "tt0846789"). This information could change your life fundamentally - forever. If you look deeper, you might even find that the universe is talking to us with thoughts (if you want to listen) - and there are some - and that's really incredible. There is a modern Jesus / Mohammad / Buddha (who among other things, according to history, communicated with the non-physical) who lives today and lives in Texas. I know that some of you know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> I do not consider myself a traditional religious, but I have never felt so comfortable in the universe as now.
