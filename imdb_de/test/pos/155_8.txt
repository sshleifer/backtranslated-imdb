The "craziness" of the vampire has, in my opinion, actually proven such a notorious categorization. There have been many sub-genre films from a variety of countries over the past year. I have discussed many and have a few more to discuss. Forgive my forbearance, but since I've recognized the trend as a phenomenon (which it is and happens to be my favorite horror clip). I'm going to move a bit outside of North America and hopefully show meaningful films that you have not seen before. <br /> <br /> Of the many effects of Twilight is the creation of "guy" and "girl" vampire movies. I hate this sexist categorization that polarizes a whole generation of fans into "sides". I think men tend to hate Stephenie Meyer's work (and her offspring) to some degree because they feel a sense of betrayal that an archetype that was always hers is now liberated. Women may not be interested in future "neutral" imagery as they have grown up with icy expectations that have been pushed through four times. We need more directors to create vampire movies that both sexes can enjoy (unlike) when vampires survive and remain relevant. Keyword: thirst This Korean movie was filmed by Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy's fame. There are two ways to disassemble it. It either spreads between gender expectations and is generally slightly enjoyable, or it is a jumbled mess that does not decide which target group it prefers and therefore should not be seen by anyone. Do not let it convince you that the movie has no inclinations. His director is a man known in story-action films. His protagonist is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on that later). His desire for a woman he knew both before and after mortal life is not invented, and his attention is returned. There is a male inclination to this picture, but it is not so one-sided that women could not enjoy it. The same does not apply to Daybreakers or New Moon. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a novel by Emile Zola named Thérèse Raquin, which I did not read. According to Wikipedia, the novel is an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man. He kills her husband during a fishing trip and starts dating. The two are unable to have sex because they imagine the dead body between them. They are driven to madness, but take care of the sick mother of the woman. After completing the novel, they try to kill each other, discover their plans and commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Well, transcribe this almost 150 year old French novel into modern South Korea and you are thirsty. Chan-Wook does not beautify history enough to make her a must-have. He often ignores many of his own ideas to follow his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are characterized by narratives. His use of the mother-in-law as a foil for her bad romance is just perfect. Do you see it. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is originally a devout Christian who becomes a vampire after a failed blood transfusion after volunteering for a new drug. He becomes the god with whom he was once struck. People flock to him and consider him a great healer. OK. That's really cool and could have provided a good foundation for his relationship. However, this idea is given little time on the screen as it transforms into a realistic Christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue, even though his lifestyle requires him to give it up. Instead of confronting the delusional people, he instead swallows blood from comatose hospital patients. <br /> <br /> Let us continue the Christian allusion. The wife gets the vampire man to kill her husband. Her overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and finally warns friends of the family against the treachery of her daughter-in-law (Fingerwedel). The man kills her, but wakes her up again. The two invite former friends and the wife begins to harass people without mercy. The man says it is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her to wait with him for the sunrise. They both die, but he atones for their crimes (and his own, but the movie portrays their evil more prominently). She is a homemaker without education, while the man is a priest whose earthly life was restrictive. Vampirism increases their properties. It becomes a monster, as one would expect from someone without knowledge. He becomes a demigod with a spirit. In his life, atheists see themselves and their lives as religious people without divine intervention.
