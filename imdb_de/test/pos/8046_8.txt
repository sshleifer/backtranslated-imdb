The Battle of Elderbrush Gulch was Griffith's longest and most expensive short he had made to date. We see him trying to perfect the large-scale action scene that would be needed for all his features, and wrap up all the elements that made his previous action shorts successful. Griffith uses the western format? the ideal backdrop for pure, straightforward action set pieces? as the setting for his first epic battle. As in many western countries of the 1910s, the starting point is a sign from the east to the west. a device that may have helped to liberate the audience into the wild, and here these Eastern children are a pair of children, which was important to the kind of image to which this evolves. For Griffith, you could not take any action without a sense of vulnerability, and here he pushes it with the children from the East, Lillian Gish as a disturbed mother of the "only baby in town" and even some puppies endangered end of the menu Indians. All of this paves the way for a highly complex and multi-layered action sequence that has melded the scenario of the captured heroine and the ride to rescue with the battles of Griffith since his earliest Civil War pictures in 1909 , There is a phenomenal amount going on here, and Griffith is doing very well to keep up the exciting pace throughout, keeping everything coherent and logical. However, juggling x the set of elements in an action sequence does not necessarily make it much more exciting, no matter how skilfully they balance, and Griffith has created a tense conclusion before and after this. But even a Griffith image, that so strongly geared towards action would not be without drama, characterization and atmospheres. In The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch, the emotional structure is treated briefly but economically. First, we have the scene where the Waifs leave home. The car moves on its heads away from the camera and uses depth and distance to express the shift away from security and civilization. An equally effective scene is the one in which we are introduced to the young family of Gish, Bobby Harron and their baby. The townspeople are cooing over the precious forest, then strolling down the screen, revealing that two Indians were watching them from the background, adding an eerie little hint of danger. Of course, many viewers have this today. The battle of Elderbrush Gulch was reminiscent of the Native American offensive view (as opposed to the rather sympathetic view of the Red Man), but perhaps not everything is as it seems. First, look at the vest of the son of the Indian Chief. it is black and covered with shiny white dots. It looks like a pearl-like king's mantle that may have been slightly modified for the warmer climate. Now take a look at the "War Dance", which you will later do. it has some "knee-up mother Brown" air. They are not Indians, they are Cockneys! Therefore, it should not be offensive to Native Americans. Only Cockneys.
