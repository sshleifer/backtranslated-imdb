This movie could only make you a cooooo. The movie was worth a dark trip to the city. Betty (Renee Zellweger) is the only "acceptable" soap group that exists. Her character is so charming and so convincing that you're forgiving because she's such an idiot. I even allow myself to lose myself in Betty's enchanting imagination, if not Dr. Ravell's real name George would be ... And speak of the devil; "Eye-catcher" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) wishes that his wish would come true, Wesley (Chris Rock) has her tied to a chair. And Rosa (Tia Texada) takes you back to these brilliant primary school friendships. The sheriff encourages you to feed him donuts and lose his name. The rest of the cast suits well. Never to turn the same movie twice, Sister Betty is the exception. One of those long, cold, must smile over some winter days.
