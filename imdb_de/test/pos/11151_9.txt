From a mere description of the main plot elements of THE TOLL GATE one might think that it is a revisionist Western of the 60s or 70s. <br /> <br /> * Our hero is a robber, murderer and arsonist. <br /> <br /> * The love interest is a single mother whose immobile husband has abandoned her and her child; <br /> <br /> * Our criminal hero is twice "unofficially" released by the authorities for a good deed, and this is portrayed as a commendable act; <br /> <br /> * the only deeds that it is Really angry are the betrayal of one's own family and the betrayal of a criminal colleague. The hero tries to go straight, but returns to a criminal life after he can not get a job; <br /> <br /> * the hero is on the run from the posse of a sheriff and a criminal gang; <br /> <br /> * The hero's final salvation is achieved by strangling a man with his bare hands throws his body over a cliff; <br /> <br /> * and the "good bad man" ends the film by sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and traveling alone (never) to the Mexican desert for his crime life. <br /> <br /> Shows only that there is nothing new under the sun. <br /> <br /> Of course THE TOLL GATE does not show all the cynicism or moral nihilism of its followers: the hero's salvation takes place when he surrenders to the farce after reading a passage from the Bible. I can not imagine Clint Eastwood doing that. <br /> <br /> THE TOLL GATE is an excellent movie, and Hart was a very good actor who was not dedicated to the broad histrionics that were often used to convey emotions in front of the sound. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
