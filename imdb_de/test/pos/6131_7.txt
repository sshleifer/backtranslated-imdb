This is a really amazing story and the most amazing thing about it is that it really happened! If you did not notice, it's based on a true story. <br /> <br /> (Possible Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Imagine the shock and the horror when you discovered that your own father once was an SS officer in World War II. <br /> <br /> It's a very fascinating story and I'm really surprised that the movie here on imdb.com has a bad rating of 5.3. <br /> <br /> my rate: 7
