I did not plan to see this movie, but I was not disappointed when a friend dragged me along. Although there are no real surprises here, the boys are reasonably good with their apparently modest budget. If you've seen the trailer, you probably know what to expect from this kind of movie, and there's a pretty steady stream of jokes here with a few classic moments, with the highlight probably being an excellent review of what the guys are in the 80s were. I also read elsewhere that the end was a disappointment, but I found it refreshingly different than I expected from this genre. Overall, this movie will not change your life, but he has enough laughs there to entertain you everywhere.
