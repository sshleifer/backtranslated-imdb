Christopher Nolan's goal was to follow the movie in a very tight direction, and in that direction he produced something that reminded me of the kind of big "poverty" series that Ullmer staged in the 1940's. Only this time, he can feel touches of homage things like black-and-white photography (due to the budget of the shoe strings, but also for the dark columns that inhabit these characters) and the casting of the actors (John Doe the smooth male counterpart and the beautiful-in-the-back fierce fashion (femme fatale) - while held in the realm of the 90s, where it is possible for several thousand dollars and specific decisions regarding places and music and the like. Nolan brings together a clever network of plot, perhaps even more than memento, where the latter was a work of psychology that evolved in an action enriched inch by inch by the view of the past, the nonlinear structure of which serves here To show how far someone like Bill can go as darkly as Cobb, only in an environment in which one is on tiptoe, is not meant for anyone I'm not even sure where it would lead, if it would be a kind of stream of consciousness where Nolan would turn his character from one urban British person to another. But the connection between Bill and Cobb is done in a quick and excellent way, as Cobbb addresses in the caf√© to ask what he does after him, and he says almost everything we need to know about both the first raid for which he brings him. What seems to be a good score on the horizon soon, is really all a big lineup of Cobb and his wife (just called "The Blonde", maybe too obvious an homage to Noir, but why carp). But this manifests itself in a way that really has really guessed me, as the manipulation of the narrative more and more contributed to asking questions not so much on the why, but how. The density increases as the actors understand their essential points as characters. Alex Haw is brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely hide his "deep" notions of what it means to really enjoy a break-in. and Theobald with the behavior of a man who can never be as smart as he really is, but more intelligent in the naive way that has no chance in such a dirty environment like this one; Russell makes it almost too easy, even with a face that would shake Ana Savage's head. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman, do not mind adding ambiance and excitement, with the fade in / fade not too fast to leave a lasting impression, but enough to make the Extend the logic of the script. He follows him in the hand, as if he knows where his limits lie, and yet is fantastic when it comes to keeping the bare necessities: close-ups when needed (one I loved is Russel's face in a small one Mirrors) and a fairly simple techno track that never distracts. Sometimes, as I said, the line between seeing "present" and seeing something as eternal as a solid mass history of low-level criminals with mental games and moral ambiguity is never quite clear, which is always quite clear to me is practically irresistible in its dark way. Simply put, this is one of the greatest business cards I've seen in recent years by a filmmaker, and hopefully it should be something future fans of Nolan's other work can look forward to. Or even for those who believe that Noir has gone to the mainstream fast-working and big-breasted dogs (even in independent films), it's a whopping 71 minutes.
