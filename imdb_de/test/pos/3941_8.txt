Are you crazy or what? This movie has talent. Who criticizes a movie made by famous directors and producers? I mean, you have to look at a shitty version, because if you had a real version, you would not think that it's a low resolution game graphics. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people who like the Hong Kong cinema on the other side What Asian people like to see ... They are such a sell-out .. Hong Kong cinema is completely different than that in Hollywood, HK Cinema is in a class of its own ... <br /> <br /> If you do not enjoy watching movies from Hong Kong producers, and not going over it, it's a waste of time to watch. Let other people enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> and I personally have seen this movie I love its story and how it was made ..
