This nifty little film shows the basal virtues of a time, a place, and a kind of male power that we no longer have or do not aspire to. The saint is a paladin with only the best motives, not to mention polished vocabulary and diction. There is no need to increase the volume or read the dialogue. George Sanders is so charming and, yes, reserved, that all the talent, the smarts, the physical presence, and especially the masculinity seem almost normal. Something normal! George Clooney can not handle the scene as well as Mr. Sanders does (and goes without Mr. Clooney's attack). very well. A man for all reasons and in every season.
