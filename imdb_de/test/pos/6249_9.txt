One of the strangest, most conspicuously scary and scariest horror films of the 70s, "Tourist Trap", even through the loose, free-roaming, anti-convention "everything goes" measures of his time as a true comedian. But the picture is very strange - a masterfully cultivated, eerie atmosphere of penetrating, supernatural fear that turns out to be incredibly scary right from the beginning and with the progression of the film becoming more and more obscure and frightening scattered moments of unreal beautiful, dreamlike elegance and end with a bitterly ironic, devastatingly nihilistic note with a haunting, hard-to-shake final image - making it a unique and exciting experience. <br /> <br /> Five teens traveling by car through the desert of California are losing themselves hopelessly. They stumble across "Slausens Lost Oasis," a run-down, rundown dive on the side of the road that's partly rotting a gas station, a three-piece wax museum, and all parts rotting and predictive. The lonely, seemingly friendly and harmless owner of the joint, Slausen (chucked by Chuck Conner's juicy infectious mutton), turns out to be a disturbed psychic killer with deadly telekinetic powers. Slausen brings his sinister collection of disagreeable human-like mannequins to life and gradually fetchs the children so he can add them to his ever-growing collection of victims. Director David ("Puppermaster") "The Arrival") Schmoeller cleverly supplanted the tension that he can express from the pleasantly ambiguous and open script he wrote with J. Larry Carroll. (The stubborn refusal of the aforementioned script to find a rational excuse for all the bizarre things that emerge throughout the film, which are often falsely criticized as one of the main weaknesses of the film, is indeed the film's main strength and gives the picture the uncanny anything and everything - the quality of a real nightmare may be neglected by the general logic, which would have been awfully brought to life, which would never have been achieved if a credible explanation for what happens is offered.) Pino Donaggio's beautifully shivering, understated score, Nicholas von Sternberg's shadowy cinematography, and Robert A. Burns' grubby, tight-knit production design add substantially to the film's deeply disturbing mood. Outstanding achievements are another important plus. Pretty, cheeky Jocelyn Jones (Ellie-Jo Turner in "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase") is a particularly fine and likable one of the most resilient and likeable of vulnerable teens. Even Tanya Roberts is a luckless guy who has a knife in his head. Unconventional and unusual is "Tourist Trap" worth a visit.
