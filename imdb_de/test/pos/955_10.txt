I'm a passionate Vijay fan. I've never seen a movie by him that's as good as this one. <br /> <br /> He has all the usual clich√©s one would expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is bad at study, but a star in his hand, d. H. Kabbadi. His friends fill in the comedy quota. A heroine in a life-and-death situation. A villain of whom I say is the best the protagonist has ever portrayed. High octane tracking and action sequences. Music that can make you dance. And above all a perfect act to keep all the above factors in a pleasant circle. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The director does not give the audience a chance to relax. He just goes from head to nail. And you can see the brighter side of Vijay in this movie, which he rarely performs. <br /> <br /> All in all ..... This movie was and will be perfect for many years ...
