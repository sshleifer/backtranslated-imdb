I will divide my meeting into the following 5 categories, each of which will be a maximum of 100% (if perfect). ________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Visual pleasure: [100%] This is a visually appealing movie. I had a great time to see it. Golf scenes are very well received and the dramatic effects on the green were amazing. I also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bag. <br /> <br /> Director's Work: [70%] Bill Paxton has more to do with acting, but this film shows he has talent. Has done decent work. Acting: [90%] Shia LeBeouf was very good in his role of Francis Ouimet (this guy can ACT well). The rest of the cast was good too. <br /> <br /> Amusement value: [100%] I enjoyed every minute. It was overwhelmingly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Screenplay: [91%] Based on a true story and that's why it makes the movie a lot more special. It was fascinating from the beginning and loved every scene to the end. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> My advice :. Definitely a must watch for all sports lovers especially golf (you all will love it). Anyone who is looking for a nice entertaining movie and does not hate sports can see it. <br /> <br /> _____ <br /> 10/10
