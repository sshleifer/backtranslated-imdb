This movie is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Sure, it's fluff, it's not "relevant", but when did movies that are just entertaining and fun become a bad thing? No, this movie is definitely "a good thing", as Martha Stewart would say (fittingly)! Barbara Stanwyck is so sexy in this movie and Dennis Morgan congratulates her perfectly. Both have charm and cordiality. They are supported by a crew of these incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 1940s and '50s - including Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall, Reginald Gardiner and Una O'Connor. Where are these characters today? No role could have been better. Bette Davis reluctantly declined the role and she was right to reject her. She would have tried to roll everyone and everything around and completely destroy the movie. Stanwyck was a strong actress, but had the wisdom to play it easily. She was rarely more responsive and perfect for the pitch. Morgan is the essence of the nice guy. Since his part is least lively, he tends to overlook his abilities. The mere fact that he could be surrounded by such diverse character actors is in itself an achievement, but he is absolutely perfect as Jefferson Jones. Skip the sick (and meaningless) remake of 1992 and look at this bright, sparkling Christmas present!
