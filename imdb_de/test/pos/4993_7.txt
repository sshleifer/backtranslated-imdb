Everyone wants Duvall and Jones back, come on! Spectators say things like tooth and urban are not that deep ... Puhlease! Were you so deep when you were young? That's the point: you have to learn a lot. Zahn and Urban subtract the flat innocence with which they were assigned, and with great dedication to preserve the intricacies of Duvalls and Jones' input into the characters. Tooth, like the early Gus, is almost perfect and Urban, like the early Woodrow, subtly perfect. What a brave step it must have been to take such a position in the entertainment industry. They must have known that they would all arrive because they are not the beloved originals, but they have clearly made the best efforts. I gave him a 7 because the editing was choppy in some places and the schedules were sketchy, but acting was a pleasure to watch. Val Kilmer was absolutely great. One more thing: I assume that the audience would have accepted the mysticism that implies the appearances of a jaguar and a blue and gold macaw, if more efforts had been made, as they appear, and so simple of the characters be accepted.
