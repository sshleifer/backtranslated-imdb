Well, I'm not the biggest Sondheim fan in the world. Although I've heard the cast album and listened to it a few times, I've never really seen this show and have not seen the Tim Burton movie version. I felt like I wanted to see some more loyalty before I see the Burton and give him a chance, just as a movie. This version is not a movie, but a film with some of the original members of the cast, notably Angela Lansbury's performance as Nellie Lovett. This is one of those performances that is like a way into the magic of Broadway and the theater itself. She must have had so much fun with this role. Sweeney Todd himself is not played by Len Cariou, who originally did it, but by George Hearn. Hearn is doing a fantastic job. His voice is not quite as good as Cariou's, but he seems to play a bit wider. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was really the Johanna character, as played by Betsy Joslyn, and to some extent her lover Anthony, played by Cris Groenendaal. Joslyn's voice can not stand high notes, but I was not sure if that was the point, as I'm not very familiar with this piece. More importantly, I'm not sure if the story of "Sweeney Todd" really has enough weight to get some of the music, but thankfully, the creators did not seem to take it too seriously. As a lark and a bit of comedy in the style of "Grand Guignol" it is quite pleasant. I do not think it's such a significant work as "Company" and "Into the Woods" or some of his other shows. Part of the music is quite spectacular, but elsewhere it seems to exist in a world outside the show. <br /> <br /> I will not say much about this, as this is a movie website. This is really not a movie, it's just a play that was shot in the movie. There were maybe three or four scenes where they moved the camera, but that was it. People will want to see this because it preserves the legendary performance of Lansbury, which deserves its legendary status because it's a fun and insightful performance. George Hearn can also be proud of his version of Sweeney. This would be a good movie to show children over 5 years old, to interest them in musicals, because blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. Seeing such an expertly and so faithfully filmed performance makes me want to see more effort being made in music theater over the years because I'd rather prefer shows from the 20s to the 50s to those later eras. "Sweeney Todd" is an extraordinary show from his time, but far beyond the AL Webber madness.
