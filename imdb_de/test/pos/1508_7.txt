The one who says that Lucio Fulci is not one of the most important names in splatter history is probably crazy. The Italian director is a legend among the hardcore horror fans, and his work transcends the boundaries of the genre (who can forget that?) Western, crime or fantasy flicks). This is probably his greedy movie and unfortunately one of the last. A horror director (Fulci himself) begins to hallucinate about cruel murders. He goes to a psychiatrist who considers him a criminal. During this time, the doctor begins a long series of serial crimes. With such an action, the film should have been filled with something. And there are rotating corpses, crashed or melted heads, knife cuts, decapitations, chainsaw disassembly, and many other boring, the film is sometimes saved by the excessive force that will definitely delight the greedy addict.
