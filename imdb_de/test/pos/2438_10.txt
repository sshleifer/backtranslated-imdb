I do not know much about anything, but I liked this movie. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple and heartwarming. In other words, it was all that it should be. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the first love of a girl (as the title suggests), and I should absolutely warn you: do not expect anything challenging or provocative terms of subject here. I mean, it's a kid cartoon. It is really just a simple story, but it is well told and keeps your attention well. <br /> <br /> In the end: It's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's easy, it's good.
