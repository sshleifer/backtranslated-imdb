When I saw this movie, I thought that this would be another fancy movie I would have to endure with my sister. Also, Amanda Bayne's last movie was not that hot and made me doubt the movie because she is the lead actress. But within 5 minutes I laughed so much that I had tears in my eyes then a second to understand it, but very funny. The script was not so complex that I could not understand the love triangle, but it was very faithful to the Shakepeare original. I loved every minute so much that I threw a guy two places away from me. very embarrassing! I would definitely advise people to watch this movie, especially girls, because the guys in this movie are hot, hot, hot !! (lol), so much so that I might get it on DVD.
