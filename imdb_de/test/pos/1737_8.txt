It was in September 2003, when I heard that the BBC DOCTOR would revive WHO and make it "bigger and better", but I had heard these rumors in the press and thought that was all - rumors. However, it was then mentioned that Russell T Davies would produce and write the show in detail, and then, on a Saturday afternoon in March 2004, Channel 4 news interviewed the actors in the title role - Christopher Eccleston. Yes, Christopher Eccleston was an actor I've always been impressed with since he made his film debut in LET HIM HAVE IT, and if he was interviewed on television, it must have been true. As the months passed, more and more information was leaked, Billie Piper was cast, the Daleks would return, and The Mill, the Hollywood effects company that had made the effects for GLADIATOR, was assigned to do the special effects for the show. For several weeks before the first broadcast trailers announced the return of the new series, massive London billboards informed the public about the return of the show. Tabloids carried massive photo spreads of emerging aliens and Christopher Eccleston appeared in such diverse programs on BLUE PETER, MASTERMIND (had a special DOCTOR WHO night edition), this morning and Friday night with Johnathan Ross. In fact, this new series of DOCTOR WHO must have been the most hyped program in British television history. It should be good bloody better. <br /> <br /> So was it damn good? Undoubtedly, it was a great success as almost every episode reached the top ten shows in the TV charts. To give you an indication of the ratings success, only one episode (The Ark In Space Episode 2 - February 1975) from the old series had made it into the top 5 of the TV charts. The episode of the opening series became number three with two more episodes that either beat the previous record or were equivalent. This is an era in which there is far more competition in terms of television channels and choices. Let's laugh and rejoice over the fact that DOCTOR has stuffed WHO HIT ME BABY UNIQUE, CELEBRITY WRESTLING and misadventures of ANT & DEC'S Saturday NIGHT TAKEAWAY. Of course, much of the success comes from the stunning visuals and casting of a well-known, reputed actor in the role. Everything you see here on screen is much like what you see in a Spielberg / Hollywood movie. There is a Dalek invasion force that counts tens of thousands, exotic aliens, a 19th century Cardiff that looks like a 19th century Cardiff, and night scenes that are actually night scenes and not pasted across the screen by a dark filter become. I promise you that you will hear much more from the directors who have worked on this series. Joe Ahearne will one day be on the Hollywood list. <br /> <br /> There are some mistakes in the new series of DOCTOR WHO and everyone should be put on the door of Russell T Davies. It may be debatable whether the soap opera and the postmodern elements are successful or not (in my opinion they are not), but it is not controversial that the weakest scripts are all written by RTD. As I mentioned in my review of CASANOVA, he cheats on the audience and he does the same thing here: When armed soldiers with their weapons are aimed at him, the Doctor blows "Attack Plan Delta", which makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allowed A naked Captain Jack suddenly pulls out a laser he has hidden, and RTD scripts are full of such cheats and Deus ex machina ends. In fact, the last episode is the ridiculous concept of what the "bad wolf" is that has brought RTD out of a narrow range, more than The Doctor. And from the ends I try to remember if one of them was actually at the doctor? More often than a minor character or the companion of the doctor who saves the day. The show is called DOCTOR WHO not ROSE TYLER. So can we see how the title character saves the day, just like in the classic series? A final point to the Doctor's presentation is the way he was written as a grinning idiot. Best known for his serious and dark roles, Eccleston is absolutely stunning in scenes of mourning, like the tear that runs down his face at the bottom of the world, but most of the time he is written as "Tom Baker on speed" , Character. It's obvious why Eccleston did not make much comedy in his career. He is not very good at it. <br /> <br /> Do I start to sound like I hate this show? I'm sorry I did not want to, but it's just that some expectations have already been met or exceeded, and they're almost all due to Russell T Davies, who thankfully has fewer scripts for the next series of DOCTOR WHO. Let's see more traditional stories about a human outpost threatened by monsters, as we saw them in the 1960s and 70s. Imagine a story like The Sea Devils, which has a huge budget under the direction of Joe Ahearne! Oh and one last request - can we see how these "NEXT TIME" trailers are being scrapped? They reveal the best parts of the next week
