I really enjoyed this movie, what it is: a funny little movie that does not take itself too seriously. Plot summaries are available everywhere, so I will not go into details. Michael is not about a complex plot anyway. It builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful journey. John Travolta's performance as a chain-smoking, women-loving, bar-brawling and cake-eater is just perfect. And who does not love Sparky? <br /> <br /> Look at this, if you have some laughs and want to have a good time together. Highly recommended.
