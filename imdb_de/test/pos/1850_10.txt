I saw this movie with my mother and I loved it! It was such a sweet story (not to mention the supporting actors!) They never make films like this ... never! My favorite part is when Grace (Minnie Driver) learns of her wife's death and that she has the heart of the deceased woman and she screams, "WHAT WAS GOD THINKING?" I believe that everyone (no matter who you believe) has such thoughts from time to time. But although it is very juicy, you may believe in true love and destiny forever and ever. (Sigh) especially in the above scene it is awful and yet so funny!). They are a good couple and I hope to see them again soon. 10/10 stars
