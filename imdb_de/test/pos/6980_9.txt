I have seen the Director's Cut version and can only be content. Outstanding acting (especially Cole Hauser, I was sad, although there was little room for Claudia Black), subtle visual effects and photography in general, credible plot (considering the genre) without many logical gaps, really unpredictable phrases, signs on. These are the biggest advantages of the movie. Combined with style - some might consider this movie as a B level, but I would not agree. The whole thing is really very original and stylish. <br /> <br /> And although I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel, this hard role of Riddick suited him well. I can not wait to see Chronicles of Riddick. It's really cool that this movie has a sequel ... <br /> <br /> 9/10, if you ask me
