The retelling of a classic story is made up of the music of Burt Bacharach and the lyrics of Hal David. The actors act like real people in this fairytale of the outside world, meeting with the mystical Shangra-la. It's a pleasure to see Bobby Van, whose play reminds me of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke), who always manages to carry Gravitas in his roles. <br /> <br /> The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the older High Lama. Who would have thought that? <br /> <br /> All star actors such as Michael York and Olivia Hussey make this work a keeper to those of us who appreciate people.
