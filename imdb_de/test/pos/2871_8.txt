There is a brand new killer, and he does God's work. Yes exactly! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a jerk, and Freddy Krueger looks like a doll to this guy. He is Jacob Goodnight (WWE's Glen "KANE" Jacobs), a 7 'monster with an ax and a hook and a chain. These weapons are not for him, his real Vollender tears eyeballs from the sockets of the victims. That's completely methodical! When the encounter took place four years ago, Jacob killed a rookie policeman and mutilated the veteran after shooting a bullet in the head. How on earth did Goodnight survive after 4 years? Now he's in the convicted hotel called Blackwell. And this hotel has many stories to tell. I found this movie both exciting and interesting. I liked the part where Goodnight watched one of the girl's tattoos on her back. And Goodnight is really confused thanks to his crazy mother. If you think Friday 13 was something, you better think again. This movie will leave you at the edge of your seat. And I think the crack of the eyeball was bony. This movie proves it and it was not a waste of my time. I enjoyed it. The title does not lie! Rating 2.5 of 5 Stars!
