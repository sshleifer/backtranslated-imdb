If you have not seen the movie yet, but like a comedy, buy it or at least rent it! The fact that the animation Oscar was won is no coincidence! I have not seen many other Wallace & Gromit films (I think I just saw one other), but the humor is very strong ... and some say British too. Of course, good! <br /> <br /> The story will only be an excuse for any future jokes, but although this is not the most time-consuming, it works anyway (by the way, my niece has guessed one of the big surprises I did not do kudos for them ; o)). I think after you look at this, look for the other W & G movies out there. Have fun!
