The problem with today's television is that people have been affected by "lite" television. This type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or "easy listening" jazz. The typical notion of "continuity" viewers remembers who was chosen by the island last week and wondered who the next one would be. Show them a program like Surface, Firefly, Dr. Who or anything with a plot of more than three episodes and ... well, they just go back to Survivor. <br /> <br /> 95% of Sheep watching TV does not want to worry. They want excuses not to think. They want to make sure that the "boob tube" lives up to their name ... and they do not want shows that try to go another way. That's why Surface and many other high-quality shows that should have lasted longer have been given the ax. <br /> <br /> TV viewers do not want stories, morals, philosophy or anything more than a third grade vocabulary level. They want people to eat earthworms or over-dramatized "real" series (no such thing! They can not watch something without changing the nature of the observed) or hormone shows that affect groups of people with trysts and then brag about it with friends , <br /> <br /> Today's television is nothing more than a wasteland, and the few diamonds you can pick up from the dust are simply thrown away because no one knows what a diamond is anymore. Surface was one of these diamonds.
