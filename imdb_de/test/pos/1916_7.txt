This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics and a must for all psychotronic fans. Why? It has everything that a great 1970s commercial film should have. Over-the-top dialogue, bad drama, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political impropriety, violence and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must. <br /> <br /> As with many of these films, the plot makes little or no sense. What I've heard is that the pimp kid Dolemite was framed for stealing furs and half a million dollars of drugs. During his time, his archenemy Willie Green (the same man who framed him) took over his nightclub. However, the sympathetic guard (the only white figure in the entire film who is not completely evil or incompetent) decides to release him to stop the evil Willie Green and his drug trafficking. Luckily he knows Kung Fu, about 50 to 75% of the characters in this movie. Fortunately, when Queen Bee was incarcerated, she sent all "hoes" to the Kung Fu school. With this army of the kung fu fight against "hacking" (his words, not mine) at his side, he plans to take back Willie Green's nightclub. However, two racist white cops try to frame him and have him jailed again. <br /> <br /> Do not try to follow the plot. I have seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seemingly have no connection to anything else. Minor characters wander into the movie and out of it. I'm still trying to figure out what happened to Reverend Gibbs, the mayor and the Hamburg pimp. Who cares in the end? The scenes with these characters are all priceless. As for the dialogue, he is terrible with an even worse delivery. Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I wonder if this movie should be a parody or a serious action movie. It seems he could not decide. Lines like "Yeah, I'm so bad, I kick my ass twice a day" demand further investigation. In any case, the movie is hilarious and the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese factory. Another hilarious element is some of the most inexhaustible uses of sex and nudity ever made in the movie. Actors you never want to see become naked (including mayor and Queen Bee). Not to mention that the boom microphone pops up in every other scene. <br /> <br /> Above all, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. He seems to have a good time and is certainly charismatic. His comedy raps had a big impact on gangsta rap on the final day, including dr. Dre, who examined him on his seminal 1992 album "The Chronic". As technical as the film is, he is culturally influential. More importantly, it's a good time. The biggest crime a movie can do is boring, and despite all the shortcomings, this is quick and entertaining. In other words, if you choose this kind of movie you will love "Dolemite". If you do not dig it out, you are a "no-business, born-unsafe, jaw-pine-moth-f *** a!" (7/10)
