This movie is like a lament. Until it comes to musical numbers that are like MIND F * CK, but gentler, like a caress. MIND FOREPLAY. The depressing atmosphere conveyed by the speed and despair of the characters can be pretty awesome until you get to the musical numbers. It's a great movie. Optimistic. Strange. Manic-depressive (bipolar). That's it! This movie is bipolar. you see it anyway. IT IS A MUSICAL !!! WITH DEEP !!!! If you like the existential cinders like The Stranger or waiting for Godot then you're probably getting a real kick out of this. I had to buy the DVD for about $ 12 through Amazon.com. OH & the songs rock. Well, they rock, but they are not Rock, there is not Calypso, Jazz, Broadway, but Grace Chung & I can not find the soundtrack NOWHERE.
