I once caught about 20 minutes of this movie on Turner Classic Movies about 6 months ago. I thought every minute of what I was looking at was gold, and since it was somewhere in the middle of the movie and I did not want to ruin the whole thing, if I saw it from the beginning, I decided that it would rent immediately. Well, the video store I frequented did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go elsewhere and rent it. I had only seen a couple of Chaplin shorts that were fun, but not very artful, but after seeing the excerpt from The Great Dictator, I checked out three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush, and Modern Times ( City) Lights was great, I found the Gold Rush a little overrated, but still worthwhile, and I found that Modern Times was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen (second-to-none, behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr., more specifically). <Br /> <br /> Finally the whole Great Dictator. Well, to be honest, it had moments of both comedy and drama. But these moments do not always match well Melodrama (City Lights is the best example of this) did not always work with social commentary, and the fact that there were dialogues diminished Chaplin's talent. Do not get me wrong, I liked the movie a lot, but I thought it was of little importance, I rated it on the rating scale with a solid 7/10. .if not to the end. The final speech given by the Jewish barber is enormously powerful. Yes, it is addressed to the 1940s and the 1940s, but its message is perfectly applicable to today's world. The speech moved me to tears, and I think it's one of the best finishes I've ever seen. Final score: 8/10.
