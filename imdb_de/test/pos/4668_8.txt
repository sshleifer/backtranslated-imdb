Especially after seeing THE MATRIX RELOADED !! * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> After seeing the Matrix with all its ridiculous fantasy machine robot characters with their superpowers, it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations where there was actually one Risk existed! I took care of these people, and although some of the stunts seemed a bit busy, I still felt "it's possible," "what a stupid video game" (like the Matrix). <br /> <br /> This movie is not brain surgery, it is very simple. Some things are predictable - for example, knowing that somebody is going to back off and someone dies early. Pretty obvious, but what? The first 15 minutes determine our reason, our motive and our main goal. <br /> <br /> I like that Theron and Walhberg had no make-out scenes. I'm glad they did not go there. They've held it about funny dialogues especially SETH GREENE. This guy is funny! <br /> <br /> This is a movie I would buy if it appears on DVD. It's fun, fast and entertaining. The only thing (and I think it's a big deal) is that we really - root the bad guys. This group of Protaganists is already on the wrong side of the law. No good news for the kids - parents, please explain this to them. <br /> <br />
