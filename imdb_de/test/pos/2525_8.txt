To put it in relative terms, if you just talk about "Pixote" by Hector Babenco (1981, Brazil, pi-shot) after seeing a series of films dealing with street children, adolescent offenders, and children in trouble (Truffauts "The 400 Blows", Bunuel's "Los Olvidados", De Sica's "Shoeshine", Nair's "Salaam, Bombay!", Bresson's "Mouchette", Nugroho's "Leaf on a Pillow", etc.) could be a source of anxiety portrayed in the film could no longer concern one who was already "de-synthesized" after undergoing the emotional roller coaster ride through the previously cited films. <br /> <br /> Luckily that will not be the case. Because Babenco tells his film in such a matter-of-fact way ("artless", as a film critic puts it in a positive light) and that his central children's artist Fernando Ramos da Silva (then 13 years old) himself is a street kid himself a straightforward, wounded performance that is so hard in its simplicity (this hardened face, those lonely and yearning eyes) that it's hard not to be pierced in any way. (Such a feeling can lead to such a heightened realism if one learns that the child has only lived a short life after being involved in street crime after the film and then being murdered.) <br /> <br /> In the In the first half of the film, Pixote and his street children and offenders spend their time in a repressive state reform school where brutality and humiliation, rape and murder are the norm and culture in which they have to confess their "crimes" underage delinquents are not "punishable" for their offenses. For these children, the dubious freedom offered by the roads is more preferable to the rigorous rehabilitation that these supposedly well-meaning authorities offer. Within the walls of this supposedly protective establishment, these young souls soon discover that parenting love and care are also nowhere to be found, if not worsened to some extent. The only form of escape is the swelling of grass and coryza of glue, secretly was smuggled into the Reformation.) <br /> <br /> When the children broke into a small "uprising" to finally express their collective desire and then return to the outside world - their "home" - the intensity and form are so that one does not have to think of the revolt of the students in Jean Vigo's influential "Zero for Conduct". It's just that in "Pixote" the "uprising" appears on a gutter level. <br /> <br /> Once Pixote and his little group are back on the streets (second half of the film), they engage in robbery, pimping and drug trafficking to defend themselves, and they meet Sueli, a battered, but friendly prostitutes. Sueli willingly accepts the four lost souls so that their clients can be robbed of them and provide them with more than maternal care (at least for one of the children). <br /> <br /> You would do it I thought that the street kids finally found the only person who could give them the love and warmth that is painfully lacking in their lives. But as dubious as the freedom these children hold for the streets, this newly discovered "maternal figure" can remain forever. <br /> <br /> Jealousy, quarrels, differences and murder have only distinguished the children - and forever. And during this scene, when Pixote can shoot not only Sueli's arrogant American client, but also his street kid, Ditto (more than a son of Sueli) due to the circumstance, he literally returns as a "childhood." She sucks on the disoriented right breast Woman, right there and then materializes his continued desire for parental affection, the picture itself is sad and disturbing. <br /> <br /> So, Sueli returns in a probable way, her "senses" sadly push Pixote back from his "nutritious" position and finally reject him. In a noisy moment, Pixote gets up with this young, old face and sullen eyes (not entirely unlike, albeit in a different context of the boy's expression in Elem Klimov's staggering "coming and seeing"), puts on his coat and takes his Weapon (yes, a weapon!), And makes his way to nowhere, running along the railroad tracks and with the morning light just starting to emerge. With this scene Babenco may pay tribute (along with many other homages that can be found in various films!) To the iconoclastic final scene in Truffaut's "The 400 Blows." <br /> <br /> But while we learned what happened to Antoine Doinel three years later in the short film "Antoine et Colette" (as well as three more feature films in the following years), we are in the dark, which is Pixote imminent, having finally disappeared from the last frame, this is the last time that we will see this real street kid (despite the fate that ultimately befell him in reality). <br /> <br /> "Pixote" may not be nearly as whimsical as "The 400 Blows" or as hallucinatory as "Los Olvidados", but it stands out for its simple, raw power.
