An intense, dark action drama with unusually rich support from Casey, Keith et al. Many of them get the best roles in their careers and they keep up. The film is strangely shaped - often slowing down the action just to make the characters get tangled up in strange, but well-made, seemingly improved dialogues - during the stakeouts, almost all "machines" get entangled in perfectly delivered humorous monologues - and Reynolds, the Director, deserves a lot of credit for Reynolds the star stepping down and giving them space. And unlike most action movies, you really like the characters, which makes the second half unfold as their different fates unfold in a good and bad way. The combination of character development, brutal violence, a jazzy soundtrack (Tarantino must be a fan - look at that & then "Jackie Brown" and you'll see what I'm talking about) make this occasional flawed movie (the bad guys are a bit melodramatic ) one of the better modern police films and in my opinion superior to the overvalued modern noirs such as "body heat" and the like.
