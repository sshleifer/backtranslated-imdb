Without a doubt the best Burt Reynolds movie ever! Even better than Smokey and the bandit. This was probably the first truly bloody cop thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect mix of humor, action, mystery and style that lacks in today's movies. On PCP jacked, $ 1,000 a night call girls, Ninja assassins and Burt Reynolds who take off their fingers with a butterfly knife. The film is based on the novel by William Diehl, who also wrote PRIMAL FEAR, another of my absolute favorites. It pays to see this movie just to see Henry Silva shot dead six times, to fall through a window and drop thirty stories from a rooftop skyscraper in Atlanta. This is probably the coolest stunt in Hollywood history, performed by legendary stuntman Dar Robinson. Robinson also starred "Moke" in the Elmore Leonard movie STICK with Burt Reynolds. Stick offers another great Dar Robinson stunt. Robinson falls out of an apartment building in Miami and unloads all six shots from a .44 Magnum on his way down. Very cool stuff. <br /> <br /> SHARKY'S MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I never understood why this movie flopped as it did. If Burt had made more films like that, he would have built a better reputation. He is a talented director with Sharky and a gifted actor. Burt is assisted by Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward and the most beloved villain of Henry Silva. PLEASE remake this classic movie! Get Affleck and Samuel L. and some other hot actors, and you have a great movie just waiting to be filmed. <br /> <br /> I give him a 9 out of 10 points
