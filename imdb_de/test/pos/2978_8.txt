This movie caught on me from the beginning, when a cute-looking teenage girl is shown alone in a grave. Then Elton starts to play John's mighty song "Friends" as she walks through the streets of Paris alone with a suitcase. naively not knowing that car theft and prostitution are going on around her. The entire film is a beautiful, dreamy, romantic collection of scenes of young love, holding hands, life in the country, free roaming wild horses, wildflower fields, sunsets, wine taps, evenings by the fireplace, fun and general innocence, all on romantic music by Elton John set. Its magical. <br /> <br /> Somehow I missed watching this movie when I was grown up. I'm sure it would have made a strong impression on me if I had seen it then. I remember the radio commercial for the movie in 1971, in which he talked about what it was about a special movie with music by Elton John and the refrain of the title song "Friends" in the ad ("Makin Friends for the whole world ") ..."), but I never heard of it at the time and could not see it until I rented it in a video library 35 years later, until then it had been edited and censored, and all sorts of hapless people with angry political agendas used all sorts of ugly words to describe the movie What can I say? Since then, the world has gone mad. <br /> <br /> The story is that a 14-year-old girl is after Her parents' death forced her to move in with her cousin in Paris. (It was her grave she visited on the opening scene.) One day, when she visited the zoo on her own, she met a 15-year-old boy who joined understanding and am next day a meeting agreed. The next day, while driving together, the boy accidentally drives into a lake in a crazy car accident. It was his father's car, he can not bear to go home to face his father's wrath, and so the two teenagers start living together in the French countryside, with each other's mutual background Hate life at home. They move into an empty house, the boy takes strange jobs to feed, their supposed friendship becomes romantic, the girl gets pregnant and they successfully get a baby at home. Meanwhile, the boy's father tried to find the missing son. On the one-year anniversary of the couple's escape, the police finally find the boy's employer through a personal investigation and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he gets to work. The next morning you see the boy leaving his cottage to go to work. He says goodbye to his girlfriend and wife and makes wagon wheels happy as the scene clings to his girlfriend and waves goodbye. At least that ends the video version I've seen. It is an unexpected but timely ending that is probably the last moments of bliss before the boy is brought home to his parents and his happy life is destroyed with his wife and baby. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as The story and the pictures are terribly unrealistic and very fictitious. I think it's better to just enjoy the movie as a truly dreamlike fantasy of a young person and not to go further in the analysis as logic and credibility quickly fall apart as the story is examined in more detail. Why should a fully furnished and equipped holiday home be left unattended if the door was locked for a year and not visited? What were they doing when the owners returned? Why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant? Did not they consider it unethical to use other people's homes and food? How could you ever hope that you would receive the necessary dental or emergency medical care outside of your home? How could the boy have a car accident on a country road, without a collision and without other cars? Where can you find places near civilization where wild horses are free? Why is it that a male teenager does not have sex as the most important thing in his head when he picks up a girl in a zoo? (Elton John lyrics just do not fit.) Why sleep outside at night when it gets cold? And so on. The scenes of wild horses appeal to girls, as well as the unrealistic theme of "friendship before the romance" and all the back wash and tickle scenes with their predictable results, running through flower fields towards each other, the haze filters The scenes shot through wildflowers in the foreground, the baby ducks and so on. It works, but it is definitely invented. <br /> <br /> This is still a film about youth and freedom, and this ideal has not changed since the 70s. Young people today are still treated as property or as lost pets that need to be restored by the police instead of being treated as mature people who have the same needs for romantic love and freedom as the adult world and the capacity to do so to be responsible for freedom. Therefore, the message is universal. It's clear why a sequel would not work: this story is about a magical, year-long reprieve from the real world. Such a situation could never have been extended indefinitely, provided that it could happen in the first place, and a story about real life thereafter would lack the magical allure of such an unreal state of existence. I really hope that no teen took the movie seriously enough to try such a stupid stunt. However, I also hope that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the 1970s have learned something from it and have since made attempts to make such a magical world more accessible to others, rather than upholding the various hate feelings and repressions of society. especially to their own children.
