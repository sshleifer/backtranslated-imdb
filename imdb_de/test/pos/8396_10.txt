My mother is blown away. She has the collectors' plates, the dolls by Rhett and Scarlett Madame Alexander, Christmas decorations by GWTW, even a cookbook by GWTW! My sister and I had seen only small parts of GWTW, but we knew the whole story by heart. On a whim, my sister bought this mini-series, which I thought my mother would like, and we were interested after flipping through the novel a bit. Yesterday we decided Gone With The Wind and Scarlett We started GWTW around 2:30 pm and finished it at 6:30. We started right after Scarlett. My mother usually goes to bed at 10:00, and she stays with us until 1:30 to stop it! We were riveted! I like the way the movie starts at Melanie's funeral right where Scarlett left off and said, "I'll think about it tomorrow." Scarlett does not stay long in Georgia, she runs to Charleston to win him back. Rhett is not happy when he finds Scarlett in his house, so he goes to the family plantation. Since Scarlett is Scarlett, he follows him and they finally agree to put their quarrels aside for a while to prevent the rumor. Rhett enjoys her company again and takes her out with his boat. A storm comes up and they sink. He helps her to swim to the shore of an island. Terrified that she died, Rhett is worried until she awakens. If she does, both are carried away at the moment and love each other. Scarlett wakes up in Charleston the next day, but Rhett has gone and writes that he thinks it best if they never see each other again. <br /> <br />. In this case, she sees Anne Hampton climbing into a hotel room with Ashley alone. Nothing happens, but her reputation is soiled, so Scarlett goes with her two dancers to Savannah. She soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to convince Rhett. During her stay in Savannah, she meets many of her O'Hara relatives and grows into a cousin, especially a Father Colum. She soon receives her divorce decree from Rhett and then decides that she will never tell him anything about her baby just to annoy him. Typical Scarlett. <br /> <br /> She decides to go to Ireland to make sure Rhett never sees her condition. She meets many more relatives and buys a beautiful home Ballyhara. During this time, Rhett woos Anne. It's on Halloween when Scarlett receives word that Rhett remarried. That night, she's going to contract. <br /> <br /> The movie starts a year later and Scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter Kat. She is being followed by Lord Richard Fenton, who is really a bad man and forces a young girl named Mary Boyle to join to sleep him. Scarlett meets Rhett and Anne at a horse fair. After a riding accident, Scarlett has a conversation with Anne and learns that she and Rhett are to have a baby. Heartbroken, Scarlett goes to Dublin with Fenton. There she maintains a relationship with him, as I said, she does stupid things when she is heartbroken. Mary Boyle has discovered that she is pregnant and goes to Colum for help. The priest asks Fenton to help the girl, and Fenton murders him after Colum threatens Scarlett. Fenton persuades Scarlett to travel with him to London to avoid her grief over Colum's death. Mary asks to go with her. Back in Charleston, Anne died of yellow fever. It is made clear that she never gave birth to Rhett. In London, Scarlett sees Fenton's true colors after he has hurt her, when she is not in the mood to sleep with him. Fenton rapes her after she tells him she never wants to see him again. She becomes unconscious, and when she wakes up, Fenton has been stabbed. Scarlett is charged with murder. Rhett learns about it and hurries with Sally in tow to England. Fearing the gallows, Scarlett has no choice but to tell Rhett about her daughter. Rhett is angry with her for keeping such a secret, but remains to help her. Mary Boyle, the real killer, can not be found. Scarlett is found guilty, but Mary finally arrives to explain her innocence. After promising to help Mary, Scarlett travels to Ireland with Rhett because he says, "It's time I met my daughter." The scene in which he sees Kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed, and the two eventually reconcile completely and admit that they still love each other very much. <br /> <br /> After seeing GWTW I will say that Vivian Leigh was a better Scarlett. but I liked the character of Scarlett in this movie as the first one. The reason for this is that you in GWTW do not know why you like Scarlett. She is so cruel to Rhett and haughty and spoiled, but you like her lively spirit. In Scarlett you can see how much she has changed. Oh, she's still in luxury, but she's no longer proud. You see her becoming a real mother to Kat and a generous person to the poor in Ireland. Joanne Whalley does an excellent job of playing this new Scarlett site. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but sometimes you swear that you can see Original Rhett in him. <br /> <br /> If you sit back and do not compare Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, you will surely enjoy this movie. It's a chance to compare Scarlett from yesterday, that she will be "tomorrow".
