If you use the film as it is worth, you will not be disappointed. If you think Murray should win an Oscar for his performance, and this is the kind of movie you expect, do not bother. It was funny when I saw it in 1979 and did not lose its charm. Good clean fun for the kids and thoughtless entertainment for the older people. The plot is simple and easy to follow. Murray has done better, but this is his first movie. The movie reminds me of a time when we did not need the blood and courage to be entertained. Morty is the main fool and plays the role perfectly. The other advisors are typical excited teens who want to have fun in the summer. A nice thing about this movie has a message.
