If there is such a thing as beautiful horror, this movie is one of the best in the genre. It's a horror movie that, although not free of gore scenes, relies more on psychology and a masterful build-up of suspense to create thrills. And it's one of those films that has been filmed so beautifully that each scene is a world full of symbols and details that all serve the scope and the genre, but you can call them beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's not easy story, with two sisters, after spending some time in a psychiatric ward, returning to their father and their stepmother's villa. They barely cope with their mother's death and try to protect their own world and defend it against the adult world. So the movie seems to be the outermost layer. In fact, the movie is slowly evolving into something completely different, at a slow pace, but there is no frame to convey the feeling of exciting beauty, so I will not say much more. Look at it, it's one of the best in the genre of Far Eastern horror films that have recently conquered world cinema, and it really shows that they've succeeded for good reason.
