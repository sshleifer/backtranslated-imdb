I saw that years ago, and it's entertaining, but not profound. The basic story is about a young man dreaming of Midian, though he is not sure where he is or if he really exists. Spoiler Episode: He eventually visits him and will be bitten by another one nightbreed creature. Then he has to help the other members of the Nightbreed because they are attacked by Canadians. (Except for the accents, they all behave like the Good Ol 'Boys.) Not much in line with the Canadian psyche, huh? Replace "Nazis" and get a glimpse of the monsters' fight against humans. Well, maybe. <br /> <br /> One of the main objections that I had was that the subway city was interesting but quite shaky and frankly dirty. This must be a convention for films with underground settlements. One would think that if the monsters were the good ones, some would have at least a little sense of decor. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit thin, but that's the introduction of characters. But it's entertaining enough for repeated consideration.
