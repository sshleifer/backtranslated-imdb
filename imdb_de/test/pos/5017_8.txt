What about certain films that cause such conflicting reactions? <br /> <br /> Some people here called High Roller "disgusting". Some have called it "extraordinary" (as I would). <br /> <br /> Why? I think that's because movies like these do not make heroes out of idiocy or glamor through degeneration and some people just can not handle it. You need a hero. And I would also add that they could personally feel betrayed as players or poker players if their existence is not justified. High Roller in NO Poker movie. It is a HUMAN movie. It's not perfect, but it looks good, is well written and played wonderfully. And best of all, it creates an emotional response and makes you think. <br /> <br /> And maybe that makes some people so damn crazy.
