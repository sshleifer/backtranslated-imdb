Called a multi-name and strangely cast, "One Dark Night" aka "Mausoleum" is one of the better early horror video stores. Original and raw, we meet Adam West in this film about telekinesis and teenage head games. Meg Tilly is ventured by "The Sisters," a high school gang of hairdressers in blue satin jackets, spending the night in a tomb. The inauguration is interrupted by the recently buried body of a mass murder psychic named Raymar. Surprisingly great make-up and scare effects characterize this chiller movie in style and deliver a breathtaking climax.
