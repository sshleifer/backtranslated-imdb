This film is certainly well structured, begins and ends in the dark, with a focus on Lili Smith / Schmidt, Julie Andrews, initially the singing 'angel', later the notorious spy. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and recently reviewed it. While critics dismissed it as an exaggerated "Cinema vulgaris" in the 1970s, and lack of structure (among other things) proved time, it turned out to be wrong. Blake Edwards has certainly produced a film that is almost lyrical in quality. <br /> <br /> The film floats and swirls (aerial photography, Julie Andrews in Motion) and captivates. All you have to do is assume that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission went wrong. If you overlook the lukewarm chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson, you have to believe that they are lovers - who fall in love with each other innocently. And in the end, love is much more important than winning wars. And so is the maintenance of innocence. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of understated drama, and the movie certainly reaches emotional depths that are often not seen in comedies. <br /> <br /> There are wonderful comedies (anticipation) of the French idiots in Victor / Victoria), interesting diplomatic side-notes (reminiscent of The Tamarind Seed, seen some 18 years ago) and a general sense of goodwill. <br /> <br /> Put all disbelief and this film overrides you Julie Andrews' sucking out of war songs and the haunting "Whistling Away the Dark" are reason enough to turn on the TV, just for the soundtrack. And the striptease number, like the 'Jenny' number in Star! is working. <br /> <br /> This movie has aged well like a good champagne. Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible. The same applies to the transfer of the laser disc from Star! on DVD. These are both interesting pieces of Julie Andrews' meticulous and then underrated work.
