As close as the movie is to the comics, it does not matter. This film moves away radically from the boredom of "Interview with the Vampire" (though the acting was good) and slips into the wonderful action scenes. Very convincing story and interesting with surprisingly good acting. Disadvantage - bad graphics. Is that important? Nope.
