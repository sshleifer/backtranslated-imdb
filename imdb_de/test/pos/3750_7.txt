I remember this movie from earlier. It's a terrific, frightening, atmospheric horror image of a man pulling into a Scottish castle, then discovering strange happenings in the corridors at night. And in Hollywood's most famous hedge labyrinth, even stranger things happen. Yes, this is the labyrinth you saw in any feature-length movie that ever contained a topiary puzzle, including "The Shining." But the point of this story is the last thing you would expect. I certainly did not see it coming. This is a fine example of how good and convincing a movie can be when the premise is absolutely slimy and ridiculous. I would recommend it to everyone.
