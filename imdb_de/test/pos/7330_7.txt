I like this movie. I can be biased because I love dolphins. However, my 3 and 4 years. old will sit and watch the whole movie ... It is not an Oscar material, but definitely entertaining. The dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of seascapes and sunsets. My favorite scene is when Flipper beats the pop-can out of the water and hits Sandy in the head. It's a funny moment that makes me laugh every time. On the other hand, the boatman's vicious banter (forget his name) is a bit hard to bear. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: Do dolphins really make so much noise? Or is there a serious synchronization here? Conclusion: My children like it and it is always recycled by our video recorder.
