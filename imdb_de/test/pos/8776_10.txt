This film is a masterpiece of brilliant acting and patriotic pride in America. The Nazi saboteurs of the 1940s are being replaced by today's Middle East terrorists. The intention is the same, to terrorize, to disturb life, to destroy property and to kill Americans! We see a falsely accused Barry (Bob Cummings) on the Lamb attempting to expose the plans of the Nazi terrorists, meet the beautiful Pat (Priscilla Lane) and travel together to New York to hunt down the deceitful and vicious saboteur Fry, the expertly played Norman Lloyd. On the way they meet the also very uncanny Otto Kruger, who plays the leader of the Nazi saboteur ring, but is disguised as a distinguished model citizen. Barry, who seeks saboteur Fry, takes him into his confidence to hand him over to local law enforcement. He escapes, meets a friendly blind gentleman and his niece and enters the Priscilla Lane. From there, Barry and Pat travel to Soda City, California, and head east to the saboteur gang of the West Coast. Their trail ends in the mansion of a New York Socialites. The gang gets hard as the wicked kidnap Pat from Barry and he follows with ruthless devotion. The highlight of the film is the famous Statue of Liberty, which is shown in many compilations. This is a real, blue, patriotic flag waving performance at its finest, and what's wrong with that? Watch this movie if you do not see another Hitchcock movie. They are captured by the patriotic sensation and the love interest between Cummings and Lane makes you wish that they would be paired in other films. She is the beautiful, ideal girl next door, often underestimated, her talent shows in this film. See it and bless America!
