THE RED CIRCLE (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970). <br /> <br /> This could be the coolest movie ever made, in the truest sense of the word. The men here never lose control and never - even once - show their feelings. No dramatic breakouts in this movie. Everyone is cool all the time. It is an abstract dream world in which men live by their own code, a gangster code in which the values ​​of the outside world are conspicuously lacking. In this masterly filmed predator saga, Melville attacks the American thrillers in a decidedly dark and desolate style, but with a hefty budget of ten million dollars and four of the greatest French stars at that time was made in a great way. Alain Delon as a master thief, Yves Montand as an alcoholic ex-cop, Italian star Gian-Maria Volonté as an escaped criminal and André Bourvil in an atypical role as a cynical police chief. Melville described LE CERCLE ROUGE as his penultimate movie and it's actually a masterfully stylized policeman. He also claimed that he wanted to shoot a film Noir in color, and he succeeded in many ways. The two main influences for this film were John Huston's 1950s film THE ASPHALT JUNGLE and Jules Dassin's RIFIFI (1955). But unlike these films, in which we learn a lot about the background of the individual gang members, with all their insignificant needs and concerns that motivate them, it becomes clear that these are not just ruthless underworld types, but ordinary individuals who are in one World of Everyday Worries is Human Aspiration, Melville, however, tells us almost nothing about his criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) in jail? Why was his colleague Vogel (Jean-Marie Volonté) arrested at all? Or why the former police captain Jansen (Yves Montand) left the troupe, was it his alcoholism? We never learn the motives for their actions and never know what drives these men. Women are even more absent than in his previous films, with "emotional" relationships being exclusively between men. They do not even seem to have a personal life. A kind of emotional twilight zone, and although the setting is not as abstract as in his previous LE SAMOURAI (1967), Melville still draws a very sinister world. The favorite actor of Melville, Alain Delon, is perfect and trumps himself, if you can imagine it, almost in coolness. <br /> <br /> At a tempo of more than 140 minutes, Melville takes his time to tell the story, but it's slow pace and length seem to be a perfect way to tackle the desolate world in which these men are live, show. Nothing is inappropriate in Melville's films and here it is no different, every detail seems to be crucial to the story. Although LE SAMOURAI is still my favorite movie from Melville, this film is one of the best ever made, but this movie is one of the best. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 10/10
