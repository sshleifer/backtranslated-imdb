Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character who can not speak and lives in a world that is incompatible with modern life. He trusts in his homemade weapons - helmet, sleeve and spear - from hubcaps, seat cushions and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote Rocicante rode, "The Man" (literally) rides his apparatus over lost lives, catching up with the harsh and humiliating modern world - floating above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters are on the lookout for adventure to correct the injustice of the world. Both characters are Guardian Knights of values ​​unfamiliar to most other characters in the story. <br /> <br /> In contrast to Cervantes' narrative, in this film we identify more directly with the main character's anachronistic ideals. We can only compare this alien and deterrent landscape with the lush and beautiful world in which we live. Our frame of reference is the fantasy realm that the lonely knight may remember. Our vision would be one that expects the protagonist to triumph, defeat, and transform his world (for the better) into a world of abundance that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> We are watching this movie and see a real knight in a world of humans as animals. Don Quixote considered himself a real knight among the animals. With Cervantes' story, we can only see the dreamer without really understanding the scope of his anachronistic shift. In Besson's and Jolivet's story, we see the new world in the eyes of Don Quixote because we value the same visions and ideals as the main character of the Crusade.
