This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It's just magical and fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you that you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so captivating, so real that you will love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really astonish you and bring that little spark of magic to your life The movie was amazing! I have not even read the book yet and you know what? I do not care. If film and book are so different, they can simply be described as two separate stories and satisfied with it. <br /> <br /> I thought the show was damn brilliant! Bridget Fonda plays the Snow Queen so evil and so cold - you just have to hate her. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda, a girl in love, determined to find her love, no matter what, and embarks on a wonderful adventure. And I love all the sisters of the Snow Queen (the Spring Witch, the Summer Princess and the Herbstriker). They are so funny and different in many ways. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for some time Forgive me if I make a small mistake ... but there is no doubt that I will always love this movie.
