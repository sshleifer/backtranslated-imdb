At the beginning of this film, which I saw early in the morning on IFC, I was filled with claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling of being trapped without being able to escape was so strong that I did not know if I wanted to continue to watch ... although I did not really seem to have a wide choice, the situation was inevitable the feeling of discomfort (though it had never quite disappeared), and I felt drawn into Tessa & Bobby's predicaments, hoping only for the hope that they would come together again. <br /> <br /> Really just a moving, powerful story that blends seamlessly into a small package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with her reading her little things, and now I love it even more. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it. ... if you're lucky enough to see it on the Independent Film Channel at some point, or knowing enough to find another way to see it.
