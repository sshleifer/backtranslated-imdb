In the opinion of that reviewer, the best time to be a kid was in the 1990s, at a time when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative heads were responsible for some of the best family entertainments that hit the waves. The best producers of Saturday morning animations were on Warner Brothers Television, which enjoyed a great golden age with the Dream Team of Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger and Paul Dini. Along with reputable and dark series like Batman, they also enlivened crazy, offbeat cartoons made famous by the Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the biggest hit with his dark adult humor and his homage to the celluloid of yesterday and today, but Tiny Toon Adventures was equally popular as he reinvented the Looney Tunes for a new generation, while still capturing the crazy comic violence and the intelligent comedy can hold to any age group, no matter how old it is. Even as the Tiny Toons stretched out on a length of play with How I Spent My Vacation, it did not feel like a lengthy episode of the TV series, a curse that so often plagues other adaptation lengths of popular animation shows /> <br /> The Tiny Toon Gang are young offshoots of classic cartoon characters who made the audience laugh in the 1940s and 1950s and are currently learning comic comedy to "earn their toon degree". The summer holidays have started and each character has his own idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeille) begin a fight with water pistols, which eventually causes Acme Acres to be flooded and sail along the Mississippi River. Plucky Duck (Joe Alaskey) accompanies Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on an off-road ride to the world's happiest theme park, but Hamton's family is proving to be more difficult than he had imagined. In other stories Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) tries to find a cat that can hug and squeeze her. Fifi Le Fume (Kath Soucie) tries to make a date with her favorite skunk and Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius) goes to the movies with a vociferous Fowlmouth (Rob Paulen). <br /> <br /> While the premise for a full-length movie sounds thin, the many directors and screenwriters make sure all the stories fit together well. The best of these is Plucky's unfortunate road trip, which uses a golden comedic opportunity very well: to feel compassion for someone while laughing at the predicament. Plucky's angry response to all the bad things that happen to him is a perfect mix of script and animation, all within the bounds of a small car filled with pork. Elmira's story is definitely second, just to see a small, almost innocent girl scare in so many jungle animals. The caricature violence mentioned above definitely comes to the fore with the story of Buster and Babs, which makes us smile not only because of the serenity of the results, but also nostalgically, since Ruegger and his company probably are not likely to show half of that in this Segment. Virtually half of this segment plays as a parody and tribute to Deliverance, including a subtle twist on the dueling banjo scene with the unforgettable Tiny Toon Adventures theme song. <br /> <br /> Part of the universal interest of the Tiny Toons The humor proves to be very intelligent, as it targets motives with a ferocity that proves that it does not deserve the title of "Children's fare" with which people call it seem to beat. A whole segment of Fowlmouth's bad etiquette in the cinema is fun for Yappern, along with an extra jab in the Lucasfilm THX logo. This scene is so perfect that it should be shown before any movie program. There are also a few moments when Disney World has fun, movie storylines and even the Warner legal department. The fact that today's cartoons are bland and uncreative makes these smart moments even more valuable, as there will probably be no more animated series approaching the end. <br /> <br /> After I first saw how I spent my holidays I can safely say in many years that they will not do cartoons the way they used to. With the continuing censorship that today's family entertainment receives, one wonders if such a thing will ever be done again. This review is not just a recommendation for a really smart movie, but also a request to Spielberg, Ruegger, and Dini to reunite and once again bring to mind a magical creation. Lord knows that the children of the twenty-first century need something with the intelligence of Tiny Toon Adventures. This is not a simple cash grave, it's a wonderful movie with a lot of mind, crazy chaos and cheerfulness.
