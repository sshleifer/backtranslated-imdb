H.O.T.S. is not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is a forerunner of many cult classics from the '80s, such as college-college films like REVENGE OF THE NERDS and PORKY'S, and a post-cursor to the world-famous ANIMAL HOUSE. Have a good time digging up a lot of big-screen 70s / 80s Playboy-type chicks and fun slap-and-pop comedy - but nothing special if you want to use it as whack material. is an "unauthorized" gays of sexy outcasts who fight against the popular and trendy pi girls. This one has pranks, a Aunt Jemima-ish janitor and even a super-heated robot that makes it relatively funny when boobies are your "thing" ... <br /> <br /> Well ... I like it tits so much (or probably more ...) like the next guy - but with all that filthy shit I've seen, I could only wish some hardcore scenes to make them really worthwhile. I knew it would not happen, but I still wish H.O.T.S. had a bit more sex and a little less shit. Not quite as notable as NERDS, PORKY'S or ANIMAL HOUSE, but it's worth looking for fans of this kind of movies ... 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS .. and I forgot - this one has a perfected one Shower -Jag Danny Bonaduce in arguably the best role of his career outside of his "reality show" ...
