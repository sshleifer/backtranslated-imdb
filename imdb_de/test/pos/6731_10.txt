As Cornish grew up with the history of tin mining, this film is very special to me. Shot on and around Cornwall, it depicts the story of two of your children being caught in a mine with a group of miners. <br /> <br /> The title 'Haunters' refers to the 'Spriggins'. - Ghosts of miners who live in the mine and bring evil to anyone who has my mine there. The events take place with an American looking to invest in local tin mining, but when the young Native Josh is plagued by the sightings of a little boy's mind, he and his American "girlfriend" want to solve the mystery of his death. A climax in saving yourself and several miners from certain death when a new shaft is opened and the Spiggins rescue them. <br /> <br /> Top movie, albeit on a budget and short term, but worth a look of Cornwall and / or the tin mine!
