It pays to see Reader's Digest. Or time, if it was the original source of the article that served Mani Ratnam as supposed inspiration for this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adopted girl searching for her birth parents, Mr. Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as he corrects, appreciates and appreciates, and rants and preaches just as he practices. <br /> <br /> Where do you start? The gloomy darkness that precedes new conflicts in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family, led by a Feuerbrand author and three adorable naughty children? Or this dark region where reality transcends the point of comfortable existence and becomes a monster of unbelieving and sinister events and ideologies? Whatever it looks like, this movie is worth being in your collection if you like the compelling dramas of Mani Ratnam. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ratnam is a master of the past, mixing fictional stories with real-life incidents. In this film he teaches to integrate two stories from real life into one. I will not go into the story because it is better seen than read. But I will focus here on the effects it had on me and why, despite the warmongering in this world, it can not destroy the simple but inexhaustible power of hope. <br /> <br /> Innocence In its purity one can not fathom the complex desires of the decadence and greed of an adult. Nor does it recognize dangers when it is accompanied by the hard determination to seek what it wants. It is an innocence of this kind that makes Amudha search for her birth parents, despite warnings that they might be lost in the cauldron of civil war. Amudha, who has survived a terrorist experience conversing with a physically disabled man to realize he is a more deadly person in disguise, clings to her cause in a manner that breaks down the resistance of her benevolent ones. And finally, when the two meet, mother and daughter, the reunification is so tense that even the spirited adoptive father tears to tears. Supported by a complementary background music by R Rahman, the following scene is crucial to melt even the stoniest hearts: a list of questions that Amudha must ask her biological mother. At such a dramatic climax as the series of incidents leading up to him, a child discovers his mother, who is alive but mentally lost. With the overwhelming realization that she has no hope of remaining with the one who bores her, Amudha does her adoptive mother what the title of this film means: a kiss on the cheek. <br /> <br /> As far as the cast is concerned, the path is clearly illuminated by the brilliant PS Keerthana. Mr. Ratnam has the gift of extracting spectacular performances from lesser-known children's artists, but this should not detract Keerthana for an award-winning performance. With a capable cast of Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and the amazing Nandita Das (Shyama), she beautifies the scenes in almost every frame she's in. The music may not be as catchy as other Rahman offerings, but nevertheless He has not stopped him from receiving yet another National Award for best music genre. "Vellai Pookal" is also an ode to the need to cultivate human life rather than nature. The dialogues are top-notch (sample the touching exchange that Amudha and Indira bring to the swing shortly after the revelation that she's not Indira's biological daughter) and the cinematography excellently. <br /> <br /> This film is clear An explanation for dropping weapons as much as respecting human life and language. Do not judge it as a lesson in filmmaking; At the Mani Ratnam-A R Rahman stable you will experience only one of the best.
