I was thrilled to see "the best years of our lives". The drama, script and direction of Master William Wyler (winner of the best director in 1946) is Brilliant. This film is about three World War II veterans who come home from the war and are reunited with their loved ones. However, they must deal with the hardships of coming home from the war. <br /> <br /> The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar winning role) comes home and finds his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy)) and children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) are grown-up and unlike before when he went to war. <br /> <br /> The second man, Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews), has to do a good job and come home to a woman he was married to 20 days before leaving for the war. He begins to find out that she is not the same. <br /> <br/> Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his Oscar winning role) has lost his hands in the war and has to deal with his family and fianc√©e 'Wilma' (played by Cathy O'Donnell) Reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands. All these men and their families are reunited in different scenes in the film. The stories of these men are all beautifully interwoven. <br /> <br /> This film really defines the meaning of a "classic". This memorable drama (winner of the best picture in 1946) is a movie everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I were asked to choose a favorite movie, this would be the result! <br /> <br /> Out of 10, I would give "the best years of our lives". A 10. <br /> <br /> Next time you go to your local video library and rent this movie, you will not regret it! <br /> <br NO disturbing material a good family movie.
