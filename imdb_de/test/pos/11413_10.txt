Do not listen to most of these people. I'll give you a better overview of this movie that I and my girlfriend love! It's about Jill Johnson, played by Camilla Belle babysitting in the Mendrakis house, and someone breaks in. So, do not stop "the worst drama". It has amazing acting. with a great story. I think Jill has two advantages. 1. She is a fast runner and is on the track team. 2. She came out alive! lol. <br /> <br /> It's a cool movie and pretty scary. Try it, you will be satisfied with this masterpiece. Do not listen to the other people on the site. it is very good. Trust me, I'm good at watching movies. I am a future film critic. I really want to buy this movie. and you will, too, if you see it. it is amazingly great.
