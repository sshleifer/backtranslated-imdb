Sharpe's Honor for the Uninitiated, is the fifth entry in a series of television films focused on an English commander during the Napoleonic Wars, based on the books of Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading). However, if you start looking at this particular movie, you have the impression that Sharpe is less a soldier than the centrifugal force the rest of the army spins. If so, I would recommend starting with earlier chapters like Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a good choice for a second visit. <br /> <br /> This year's story is about the espionage side of things. With the retreat of the French army from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master discovers the opportunity to reverse the situation. The murder of a Spanish Marquis against Richard Sharpe, the hero of the British army, will break the fragile Anglo-Spanish alliance and things will turn around again. When the Spanish nobleman comes to Wellington and cries for Sharpe's blood, the English general is less willing to hang his best soldier, fakes his death and soon he goes on a secret mission behind the enemy lines to find out who controls the plot. Surprisingly, even for a Sharpe movie, there is a beautiful woman to rescue on the way, and you want that. <br /> <br /> The result is, of course, a more adventurous approach. Concentrating less on the way the English military works with Sharpe as a figurehead, it focuses more on its rural escapades, evading French patrols, hobbling with the Spanish guerrilla fighters, and bravely escaping from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his faithful right-hand man, naturally accompanies him, but the rest of the shooters remain in the camp, unaware that the leader is still alive. Strangely enough, they actually receive more attention than usual as they end up in their own subplot with the birth of Harper's baby. <br /> <br /> This slightly different approach is a fascinating episode, but only a good thing in the long run. And should anyone be worried that there will not be the standard fight at its peak, as the poor Frenchmen get a real kick again. In addition, Ducos is a fantastic follower of Obadiah Hakeswill as the evil guy you hate to hate. He's a suspicious, vicious, and totally malicious son of a female canine and strangely remembers this black guy from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman is particularly noteworthy as he has the chance for more screen time and more. It looks like a man you want to hand over to your firstborn even though he looks like a member of Iron Maiden that was catapulted through an accident in time. <br /> <br /> In short, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as ever, but this time in view of the events of the previous film much more bitter and angry. It's not the best introduction if you have not seen any of the other chapters, but it shows a page from Sharpe we normally can not see: the action hero and not the professional soldier. And if that's not enough to tempt you, it's worth watching just for the somewhat surreal sight of an angry Sean Bean brandishing a living chicken among a group of nuns.
