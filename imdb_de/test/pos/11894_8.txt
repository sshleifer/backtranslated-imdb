I have watched the movie and am very pleased to see a film that differs in character and history from the stupid, American mainstream productions. It's a movie with an interesting background for all ages. Contrary to certain reviews, the audience seems to split my assessment, as the film is very successful wherever it is still exploited. In the Netherlands, for example, ranked third. Negative statements must be respected, but one should expect such facts to be facts-based. If you have the chance, watch the movie and enjoy it.
