I hate to admit that, but I did not find it one of Hitchcock's best, but still a mesmerizing climactic thriller. In a remake of Hitchock's 1934 film of the same name. Ben McKenna (James Stewart)? the man who knows too much - and his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day), along with their son Hank (Christopher Oslen) vacation in Morocco, if a case of false identity and they are involved in the network of an assassination. The conspirators are doing everything they can to prevent them from interfering with their conspiracy: the abduction of their beloved Hank. <br/> <br /> I was surprised that Doris Day, whom I usually associate with rock hudson comedies, was played in a Hitchcock ensemble movie. When I saw it, I quickly realized that this was more of a family movie than Hitchcock's other works (example: Psycho), and she had the ability to sing to dissuade "Que Sera Sera," which she did wonderfully. She was as well-fed as herself and James Stewart had chemistry, which made the couple more credible. <br /> <br /> Compared to the other works of the great director, I believe that this is not so good, but it is still extremely entertaining family thriller / mystery. There is also the added bonus of Que Sera Sera, which turned out to be an absolute hit for Doris Day. Well judged, well played. A nice film.
