This is certainly one of the best Western movies produced in the new millennium. It pays homage to all the stars of the great Western TV classics and the ultimate revival of Western film. The story of two brothers who meet after the war between the states and land on different sides of the law is not new, but nevertheless interesting. The shootings and the atmosphere are great. There are graphic acts of violence in which bad guys are hewn to death with an ax or women are shot down in cold blood, and Lee Majors does not take part in the action until the end. That's why I've awarded 9 out of 10 points. But it's still one of the best new Western productions I've ever seen. I had the honor and the pleasure of meeting Chris McIntyre at the Festival of the West and having a nice conversation with him, and I had the opportunity to meet Buck Taylor, who plays the role of city doctor. In my opinion, we should be very committed to Chris McIntyre to collect so many stars of the classic TV Western and SASS in a new Western like this one. Chris has a great talent for selecting the right actors for the main characters as well. Both are young and promising, and I think we should see more of them in future Western productions. I sincerely enjoyed this western movie - it was worth every minute. I hope that Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other western films and introduce us to other great productions like these. Great job, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)
