I am always surprised that the famous title song of 2001 "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" means that no one (no one I have read) has noticed the parallels between Nietzsche's famous work "Thus Spoke Zarathustra". , The idea of ​​the rebirth of man to a star child; an infant form of an indescribably advanced being is an explicit part of N. "Zarathustra"; There is a prominent passage entitled, "How a camel becomes a lion and a lion becomes a child," in which N. describes the first incarnation of the Superman as a child, both of which exceeds the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel) ( always asking for more weight) and the predatory, brutal willpower of the human (the lion). The fact that the song is played during the Star Child sequence can not be coincidence. And Zarathustra also said that "man is a rope bound between animals and the Superman." The structure of the film fits in with this description: a brief history of man as an animal, until we become true humans through mastery of weapons and reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, so to speak) and then a glimpse of the superman Die Inscrutability of the transformations and the indication that an external force has caused it is also Nietzschean; In "Zarathustra," he makes it pretty clear he has no idea how people can make these changes themselves, and suggests that we have to rely on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to do it , "go under". Bowman's near-end psychedelic sequence may be understood as Kubrick's best attempt of the 1960s to depict mystical "perishing." I know that these parallels are quite wide and have been seen with certainty elsewhere, though I have not personally seen it. But I only wanted to mention it when, for no other reason, I tried to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the end of 2001 grim, and it is in my opinion explicit and unmistakable Nietzscheaner. It could well be said that 2001 is above all a modernized Zarathustra. Feel free to disregard the almost snobbish attitude of my attachment to Nietzsche.
