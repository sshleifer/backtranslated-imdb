I am not sure if these other people saw the movie - some apparently could not follow the "complicated plot". He's a billionaire and owns an oil company that EVER happens in big-game hunting - wow - that's really far-fetched. However, his new "drill" accidentally breaks through a glacier and on the other side is a world separate from our time, where dinosaurs and cave dwellers roam. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's certainly not ridiculous. Anyway, the rest of the movie is about that T-Rex they found (which billionaire Boone claimed was there) and they hunt. Look - it's an old TV movie - of course the special effects look cheesy - they did not have CG - they did the best they could and for a MFTVM they did a damn good job. This film was to be redesigned for the big screen - I would love it and be the first in the series. To see that dinosaurs with modern special effects that follow these guys would be great!
