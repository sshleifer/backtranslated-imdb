This Columbo episode is one of the better and maybe one of my personal favorites. Performers include Rosemary's baby John Cassavetes as Maestro, his wife, Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mother), and his mother-in-law, Myrna Loy (one of America's leading actresses in the film of our time). Anyway, I do not agree with anyone who criticizes this movie. This episode is one of my favorites because you have a great cast that does a great job. I love to watch Columbo with his beloved dog, whom he never calls in the series. This time, the episode focuses on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of L.A's attractions. Of course, Columbo is as interested in classical music as he is in all other crimes.
