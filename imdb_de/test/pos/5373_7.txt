A family travels through the Midwest. There is the widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and Ben's little daughter K.T. (Geri Reischl). Then hit a town called Hillsboro, where everyone looks more than a little strange. Your car is broken and you have to stay. They quickly find out that a witch's circle casts a spell over the city and faces unbelievable evil. <br /> <br /> The story is not so good. People just find things out of nothing and they just find out where the witches are at the end. In the end there are still many loopholes. Acting is also pretty bad. Bateman and Capri are bland and everyone else is about the same. Only the old professionals Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones gives good performances. This movie still works. There is no blood and blood (there are some, but this is PG) and it is important to work with some scary images and atmosphere. Acting hinders a lot, but it works anyway. Martin chews especially the scenery in his role. I can not explain exactly why I (somehow) like this movie, but it worked for me. It's a quiet kind of horror that's not done anymore. Hardly a masterpiece, but that deserves to be rediscovered. A 7.
