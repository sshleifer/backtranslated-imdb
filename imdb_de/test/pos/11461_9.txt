I absolutely love this movie! Evil Dead has NOTHING in this movie! Night of the Demons 2 and 3 are a totally boring party, but this is a classic. It's super cheesy and the acting is fine at best, but what more do you want from a horror movie of the 80s? Stooge has some of the best one-liners ever on the screen. (he's my favorite character) Many people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favorite is the end. Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with the main characters when the old man eats his leftover Halloween apples in a bowl of pie, and his neck is mutilated from the inside out. The soundtrack is great. The scene in which Angela dances is totally scary, especially after the flashlight comes on and you can see her jumping from one part of the floor to the next with every sound from a camera shutter release. The make-up effects in this movie are pretty cute; Angela gave me nightmares as a kid. If you are the type of person who demands perfection from your movie experience, you should give them a passport. But if you're like me and really dig all Halloween, the house haunts the Demon Clich√©, then this is definitely a must.
