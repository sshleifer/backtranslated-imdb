This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our world today. The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values ​​makes this film an extraordinary view of "war is hell" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia from a special purpose captain whose job it is to eliminate (under extreme prejudice). a rogue colonel who has left the justice concepts of the army to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a profoundly flawed masterpiece. In particular, I found the last leg of the journey with Brando, which contains Conrad's Heart of Darkness, rather boring. Finally I came to Apocalypse Now Redux and the bugs were fixed. Redux makes the film an absolute masterpiece, certainly the 100 best films ever. Brando's performance now seems full and complete, perhaps less mysterious, but much deeper. Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best ensembles ever assembled. It's great to see a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn and so on in early screen performances that suggest what good actors they're eventually recognized. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms are significantly improved by the additional material. If you have never seen this movie, skip the original and go directly to Redux. I wish we could get a gorges of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in any gaps in this highly flawed potential masterpiece.
