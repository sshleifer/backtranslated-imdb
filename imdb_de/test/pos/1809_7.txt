This typical teenage film is one of the best, apart from the story, the music is good, the music accompanies the movie all the time. <br /> <br /> Although I do not like classic film, unless it's classic and better written script, this is an exception. Maybe hairstyle and language should change a bit, in the 80's I think that abusive language is still rarely heard. <br /> <br />
