This is a stunning movie. Raw and confident in motion. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets when watching people on a stage) playing on every horror of a white lie that escalates to huge consequences. All main actors are fascinating. At the end, Tom Wilkinson broke my heart ... and everyone else judges the amount of handkerchiefs and hands that face men and women alike. Julian Fellowes has won again. He is a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now that. Can not he go wrong ?! GO AND SEE IT! This is a movie for real adults.
