A hard life becomes more difficult if the three children of a single mother are sent to separate nursing homes after their untimely death. <br /> <br /> To stay together, the older boy plans a daring, high-risk escape Find a distant, lost uncle whose only surviving relatives. <br /> <br /> Your journey leads the three anxious escape routes on a desert chase in a classic beetle, without penny, hungry, desperate, driven by criminals and even terrorized young, chased by ever-threatening civil authorities. <br /> <br /> What the film lacks in drama and plot realism makes up for it in the honest human need to be part of a fulfilled and complete family. Even if this family is cobbled together with spare parts from broken lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, the end is too overkill and too dramatic for the critical movie viewer, but every heart beats the same cry for family togetherness and affiliation. <br /> <br /> Despite all the weaknesses, I still give this film a strong recommendation.
