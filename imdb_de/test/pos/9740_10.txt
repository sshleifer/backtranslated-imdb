In the 1960s, Cleveland television audiences saw an episode of "Flash Gordon" during the Ghoulardi Show (Friday, 11.30pm). This was the best mockfest material ever seen by us in junior high. We would regularly have "sleepovers" (though we did not call them that) just for the fun of watching this stuff with a group of friends. Next week we would quote our favorite Cornball lines from the last episode. To see today provokes the same reaction. But if you can stop laughing at the dialogues, the lame creatures, the stupid costumes and the awful spaceships long enough, there are some good things that I did not appreciate the first time around. The production designers built some excellent sets, both the rooms and the laboratory equipment. Charles Middleton's "Ming the Merciless" character was the best screen villain ever, certainly up to that point, and certainly better than anyone else. Jean Rogers is stunningly beautiful. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
