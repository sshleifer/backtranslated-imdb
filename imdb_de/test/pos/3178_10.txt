Up and Coming was a very positive sitcom that brought an instrument and / or a channel that opened the young minds of the Black culture. The focus and prospects were a positive message for our employees and hope for change. I recommend this selection for every American household to learn the fight and the reward. The show never had a chance to turn into the idea that the middle class blacks would become their own entrepreneurs. The problems were so well compatible with the situation of real life that life affected so many. I sincerely hope that the entire band can be restored and the Americans can enjoy their families on DVD. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
