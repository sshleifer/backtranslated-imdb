Jamie Foxx performs a brilliant cast through the life of the blind, emotionally disturbed African American pop jazz genius Ray Charles. Although the entire cast is wonderful, Mr. Foxx has earned more than just an Oscar. If it were possible to appoint an actor in successive years, I would consider that for Mr. Foxx. Not only does Foxx play Charles, he recreates it. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve a special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mom (the inspiration of his life) and young Ray. These two were the strongest support in the film. The dramas of Charles' guilt strikes, the death of his younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, addiction and success are neatly interwoven tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful, the script, as far as I can tell, is perfect, and acting is legendary. <br /> <br /> The directing method of the film justifies a discussion. Taylor Hackford - a director I am generally ambivalent about - had to decide which aspects of Mr. Charles's larger-than-life and complex life story would tell his story most honestly, dramatically, and comprehensibly. Although some disagree (apparently a documentary instead of a dramatic biography), I believe he has admirably selected his themes. Much of the success of this film is the consistent focus on some persistent issues in Charles' life - his deep love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his addiction and guilt complex, his musical genius. and his deep-seated fear of responsibility for others. Charles is portrayed as a man bravely fighting an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined that one of the men I heard on Sunday night with my dad on my old record player in his living room while watching football matches on TV. And in "Ray" nothing was sweet. The topics are continued with strength and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama that spans his long and enlightened life. The power of these themes, the strong script and direction, the music and the acting make this film one of the most beautiful and interesting biographical films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
