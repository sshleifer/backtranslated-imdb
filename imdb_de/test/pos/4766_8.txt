One of my favorites. As a child, growing up in Greater New York in the late '60s and early' 70s, I often had the opportunity to visit NYC with my grandfather or dad as they did business there. The bustling, busy, human reality of this city, especially in winter, has remained with me. <br /> <br /> This film aptly shows the austere, cold, business-like atmosphere of the winter season in New York City as it reveals the underworld of the region's notorious underworld of crime and policing. A great snapshot of a place, a time and a culture. <br /> <br /> And the chase is just amazing. At least at the level of "Bullitt" and surpassed the hunt in "The French Connection". I keep watching the suspension hang on the Plymouth Fury police driver approaching the GW bridge as he stumbles into the sharp right-hander and jumps into oncoming traffic. The stunt ride coordinator for this scene performed "Bullitt" and "The French Connection" as well as many other unseen movie hunts. Good action too and a decent action. The music is nervous and captivating, and the cinematography and direction are first-rate. A great, albeit underrated police drama of the 1970s. A guardian Not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> Comparable in style and content with: The French Connection and Super Fly. In the gloomy winter months of NYC played cop dramas of the early 70s.
