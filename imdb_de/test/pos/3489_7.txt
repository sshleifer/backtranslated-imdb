Alter Egos is no funnier than the creation of Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G. He is utterly misled by his insane and non-existent feel of the Midlands suburban environment that makes up his social background. He insists on living the style of a Los Angeles Gansta. While still living with his Gran in the London suburb of Staines, he retains control of his posse, the West Staines "Massive". <br/> <br /> He spends his free time with me Julie, his girl, the posse, and local eight-year-old scouts at "Keep it Real (advanced)" lessons at the government-funded John Nike Leisure Center. <br /> <br /> Here begins the story and it is said that government funding has been stopped. Ali G. then continues with a one-man search: "In the fight for justice, I am ready to settle down, as Martin Luther Van Dross did." His response to the local media crew when he interviewed him on a hunger strike while chained to a fence. Charles Dance plays David Carlton, the sinister and deceitful deputy prime minister, who is "even more disgusting than he is." Without wishing to lose Ali G three weeks before the general election, losing 18,000 votes to the Prime Minister, when he saw Ali G as a joking idiot, his plan fails, and Ali G suddenly becomes a sensation overnight and a savior The story becomes more sinister and with witty consequences. <br /> <br /> Ali G Indahouse is a great British film featuring the hugely talented attributes of writing along with Dan Mazer, executive producer and Acting by Sacha Baron Cohen, Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, as the PM play their roles with great seriousness among the gags and joys that Ali G. is ironic to see the parodies in a world that is really real is constantly preaching "Keep it Real." "Massive" is a true comic paradox of his own little world, the West Staines. <br /> <br /> Director: Mark Mylod, his first act Full-length feature film since directing television works like Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show, and the scent of Reeves and Mortimer, to name but a few. <br /> <br /> Very real and very funny.
