I am a history teacher and overall I was satisfied with the movie. My teens enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it juicy in some places? Yes, but it took my kids away from the computer and the game station to spend four nights watching everything. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were impressive and we met many historical characters. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all found Phillip Casnoff as Bent vicious and charming brilliant. We all thought Charles had stolen the show from Orry and George. <br /> <br /> We will enjoy the movie again!
