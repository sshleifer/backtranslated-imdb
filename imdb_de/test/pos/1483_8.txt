There was somebody in my family (who did not say for personal reasons who it is) who thinks that Mr. Bean is always so stupid, whatever he does in the comedy series. Imagine how I felt then. Immediately shocked. <br /> <br /> There are more reasons than one why I like to look at Mr Bean so much. As one of the earliest local television shows here in my country, where I first grew up watching TV, it's just one of those things that came to my mind. There were even my friends once and I talked about some of the selected episodes, and we only laughed together. <br /> <br /> It's always stupid, funny and funny, whatever Rowan Atkinson likes, as Mr. Bean does in every episode. Although there have been occasional repetitions lately, I've always managed to remember those childhood memories. In fact, I can say that this is the very first show that introduces me to the kind of shows that come from the UK when I was growing up. <br /> <br /> The comedy series ... definitely really evil, as what the British can say.
