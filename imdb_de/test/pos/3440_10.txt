I first saw Homeland 2 in the 90s on BBC2, when I lived at the art school and moved between artists and musicians hoping for future success. 'The Second Home' - from friendships made after leaving the home and striving for professional excellence - resonated with my living reality. I was fascinated by the characters, the storytelling, the lyrical camera work and above all the music. In it, I could guess the beginnings of German electronic music, the 50s Stockhausen, power plant, Can, New, fist of the 70s, the sound experiments of John Cage, Walter Carlos and the British electronic psychedelia of The White Noise. The soundtrack composer Nikos Mamangakis studied with Carl Orff of Carmina Burana-fame, so I found his taste contemporary in the world of electronic pop / sound effects entirely without before or after. As someone else has commented, it is both epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. Many favorite moments, including the wonderful voice of Gisela Muller (Evelyn), the Bach marimba by Daniel Smith (Juan), the piano playing of Henry Arnold (Hermann) and the cello playing by Salome Kammer (Clarissa). <br /> <br /> I could write more, but it has already been said here. Why can not British or US TV channels produce such masterpieces? The Wire had the realism and politics and epic impetus of a city, David Lynch and Dennis Potter also had fantastic tricks for their serialized TV work, but this is Kunsthaus and soap in their most cinematic and narrative sense. It is never included in the selection of the best films by critics, but it should be. Still as poetic and powerful as it was over 17 years ago. I watch the 3 box sets every autumn for their "mature fertility". Inspired and inspiring.
