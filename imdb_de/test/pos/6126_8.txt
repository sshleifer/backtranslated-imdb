What is there to say about "Pink Flamingos"? It's not to be criticized or even explained, because it's not really about being like any other movie you've seen. You will either get it or not, laugh about it or roll your eyes in disgust (or both). John Waters is a weird filmmaker (to say the least) blending innocent, childish humor with shockingly offensive moments that ... well, who knows what his intentions were. It's kind of an attack, albeit a funny one. <br /> <br /> What makes Waters' humor so contagious and effective is that its characters inhabit a world that may seem strange and completely familiar to the viewer. like the little rivalries that make up the plot of Pink Flamingos. Surely everyone has experienced these kinds of things before, but it certainly was not the title of "The Filthiest Person Alive". What makes the movie a fascinating sight to me is the way Waters creates dizzying, self-contained environments and does not let you in on the fun right away. The people in his films are perfectly aligned. For example, when Cotton tells Babs that she does not want to go to town with Crackers bringing his "girlfriend" to the trailer, Babs reacts with a knowing grin and tells her in a conspiratorial manner, "That little shed is just PERFECT .. "At this point, we do not yet know that Crackers wants to bring his" girlfriend "into the shed to push live chickens onto her naked body, while Cotton orgasmically peeks through a window, but this comedy is quite common and is used by the Characters in the fictional, degenerate world Waters creates are understood. Another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and Channing, the deviant butler of the Marbles. The first time we see her, Waters cuts off a scene in Connie's cozy office, while Channing descends to the basement, where we see that there are two women down there, a dead and a very vivid and crazy woman. Susan is not a crouching victim, but she is angry and offensive to Channing. She jumps up and starts a verbal attack on her jailer. Both have a strange understanding of the bizarre situation, and they are not so intimidated by their kidnapping than they are violently offended and genuinely angry. She does not linger for a second while Channing is in her eyes, and the two scenes showing her insane banter are two of the comic highlights of the movie. Later in the film, as Divine and Crackers enter the House of Marbles and discover their crimes, abducting women to keep in their basement, this represents the utter lack of support that Divine and her family have for the kind of depravity that exploit the marbles. There is something that is unfamiliar with the Divine, a corruption developed by its new rivals, and it despises it. Although kidnapping does not seem like Divine think twice, she is outraged that the girls are being held there, and happily frees them, enjoying the revenge they take on Channing. <br /> <br /> At the other end of the mire spectrum, Waters occasionally recalls the line between his twisted fantasy world and the "real" world. The first time we see Connie, she disregards a minor character named Sandy Sandstone, who has never heard of Divine. On the other hand, Cookie reacts with a witty, factual assessment of Divine's title as the "dirtiest man alive," revealing that she also inhabits this world of unspoken and understood insanity. <br /> <br /> Something must also be said about the way in which players interact with their respective roles, in particular Divine, who does not miss a note. Not even does he waver in the ridiculous garb and character he has received, and it takes "Pink Flamingos" to a new level or obsession. People actually believed that Divine was like that in real life, and it's easy to understand why, because watching the movie does not really make you think about the movie, but about those people who made it. Since they really do the rude things in the script, you think that maybe this is not a story, but a bizarre documentation. <br /> <br /> But even more: "Pink Flamingos" is not so much a movie as it is an event or something that happens to you. Although the shock is mostly gone for me (I say mostly because the scene and the chicken scene still make me flinch), I still find this movie funny and habitual.
