I had borrowed the three Sarah films from a friend and had seen her sick in bed one weekend. I really enjoyed each one of them. I enjoyed watching the last movie convey an impression of Caleb and his sister when they grew up. Also, I liked the performance of the "Billy Boy" song, which was first heard during the credits of the first movie, "Sarah, Plain and Tall." The only thing I did not like in Winter's End was the youngest daughter. She was a very sweet little girl, but she had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids, even compared to the talkative, but still good-natured Caleb when he was younger.
