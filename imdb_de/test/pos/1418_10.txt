I'm a big Errol Morris fan since seeing Thin Blue Line and hearing that he saved a life. To date, this film is his best work. <br /> <br /> The plot is a hybrid of Stephen Hawking's book of the same title that is interwoven with the man's life. The story is told through interviews with family, friends and Hawkings himself. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled; It sounds totally boring, but the whole package is dynamic and thought-provoking. The fusion of life and theories is seamless and absolutely entertaining. I was particularly moved by how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man. Physically powerless, Hawking's size and shear brilliance are anchored in a real human being who we can laugh about at the same time. <br /> <br /> Find this movie. Look at it and enjoy it. And if the studio that owns this picture reads this, a 15 year anniversary edition would be perfect NOW ...
