Joline (Heather Graham) makes her way to her husband Carl (Luke Wilson), who has disappeared to clear his head about himself and her marriage. Joline, who is committed to her marriage, begins her journey to find Carl, but discovers a lot about herself. On her journey, she encounters a wealth of interesting characters who unconsciously help her find her way. <br /> <br /> In my eyes, this is a classic road movie that moves at the right speed (some viewers may find it too.) sluggish). Throughout the film, it retains its humorous touch, while Joline reacts with a warm, knowing, sometimes sad smile to the madness of the world around her. All actresses give wonderful performances and the music is impeccable. 9.10
