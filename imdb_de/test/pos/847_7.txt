Ok, everyone agreed what the best season was. The first. And killing Boone was a bad decision. Killing others was bad too. Make the directors and authors responsible. Bad Boys. BUT. I still think that this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys, I can not help it! I see that the quality of the series decreased after the first season. Still, it's easy to accept Liam as your new main character when you stand above Boone. He is really ... mysterious. What shocked me the most was when Lilli was written from history and how. She did not deserve that! And what do we get? Some blond chick named Renee, with absolutely no character! But these Taelons remain mysterious, and you still wonder about their true plans to the end. Real suspicions The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant. <br /> <br /> I understand you may not understand this series if you jump into a 3rd, 4th or 5th season episode. But if you watch from the beginning, you can not tear yourself away! <br /> <br /> The show is great, the special FX are wonderful, the music is beautiful and the action is fascinating. Gotta see that, guys!
