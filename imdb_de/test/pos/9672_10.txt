Family Guy is my favorite cartoon of all time. It's definitely the funniest TV series ever made, and is better than The Simpsons. I have never laughed so much in a TV show in my life. The things that make the show so fun are the plot, characters, and themes that are covered in the show. There are very few topics that were not treated at Family Guy. <br /> <br /> I've seen almost every episode of Family Guy ever made and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons. My favorite characters are Peter, because he's very funny and the show's best character. If you love Family Guiy, you should check out American Dad because it's so similar and made by Seth McFarlane. I hope this show never ends because it's a weird genius! 10/10
