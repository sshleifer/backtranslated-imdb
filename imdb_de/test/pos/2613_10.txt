It's a talking, triggering, happy, alcoholic ASS COP! I saw the first and second episodes. The artwork and animation fit very well (note the facial expressions, lol). The main character is a weapon, a weapon, a badge, a pair of butt cheeks that shoot at the one he thinks is offensive or "guilty." So far, the episodes have had simple and trackable actions that work very well with Assy's investigations. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, is the sobering answer of Assys A. A.'s antics and random "I have a hunch" leads. The lines of Assy are very funny and clever, here is for example one: "I have a bullet and your e-mail address is in it. Do not send me off." * Bang * "looks like your mailbox just received a few new mail." The mindsets at Assy Mcgee's headquarters have been consistent and staged so far. The sound is perfect, the sound effects and the language work are 9/10. Assy sounds like Sylvester Stallone, the mayor, the police chief, Don Sanchez, all have voices that "fit" the person. I recommend it to anyone who wants to catch a few laughs before going to bed, as there is room for adults to swim on Sunday evenings. Very funny, imaginative, visually different comedy. 10/10
