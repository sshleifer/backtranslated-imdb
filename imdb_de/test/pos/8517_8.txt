If you can see a 1983 Bond movie, it's not as good as Octopussy, and enjoy it anyway. <br /> <br /> If you can accept production values ​​that are not so much above the level of a television movie. <br /> <br /> If you look at Sean Connery with forehead wrinkles under an obvious toupee and still see James Bond. <br /> <br /> If you come across an inexperienced Basinger, a weaker Largo, and a fun Q. <br /> <br /> If you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score, you're not with Barry at his worst day here. <br /> <br /> If you do not believe the hyperbolic reviews It was welcomed with the publication. <br /> <br /> When you face a poker fight and a video game, you can enjoy them both. <br /> <br /> Her is Never Say Never Again and everything inside. <br /> <br /> And more, you will probably enjoy it, son!
