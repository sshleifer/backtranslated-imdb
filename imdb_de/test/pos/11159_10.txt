This movie is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are really funny. The dialogues are funny and colloquial. The tension in the film comes not so much from the "murder mystery" planning as from the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel. <br /> <br /> The first story covers the characters of Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an aging drifter with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness, followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz, with many good-natured smiles. Many good moments in the film come from the contrast of the two characters, for example, when Trintignant Kassovitz teaches intimidation. <br /> <br /> The second story tells how a salesman, played by Jean Yanne, talks about his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend. Yanne plays the role with a kind of aggressive irony. I wish I could describe it better. <br /> <br /> After a while, the viewer understands how the two stories are connected, and in the end they come to a surprising but logical end. <br /> <br /> The film is a successful mix of the witty but superficial gangster films written by the director's father (the famous Michel Audiard) and the "typically French film" with a lot of psychological depth and care the representation of emotions.
