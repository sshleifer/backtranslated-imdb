15 Park Avenue, well the name initially baffles an address from New York and a movie that plays in Kolkata. Throughout history, however, one recognizes the thin line that the director seeks between relationships, social cause and, of course, the world of schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one of the directors who has much more to tell and less time to spend. No doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way, she lets us know that probably each of us is looking for our own "15 Park Avenue." It's an endless search in each of us ... <br /> <br /> The powerhouse performance of Shabana Azmi is a treat. Your screen presence brings a lot of life to the scene. It was indeed surprising to see her in such a powerful act after such a long time because I had expected that it was the whole Konkona Sen area. With Shabana you feel deeply in the skin of an older sister who runs the whole show for a rather unhappy family and during that time she almost forgets to live her own life. She is burdening all her ambitions and desires with a sickly 18-year-younger sister (who's more of a daughter to her) and an aging mother played by veteran Waheeda Rehman. As for the leading actress of Guide (I can immediately remember her), there is hardly anything to say except a few lines and tears here and there. The ever-reliable Rahul Bose plays another key role in the movie. He shows the emotions of a middle-aged man, who almost brings penance to perfection in the face. This man really amazes me with his varied work. From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr. & Mrs. Iyer and so many others. He is versatile and I really wish he had some more shots in the first part of the movie. The cameo of the movie is from Shefali Shah (remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding). She looks very beautiful and shows with ease the role of a mother of two children. It gives you a glimpse of today's Indian woman who is modern but still conventional when it comes to her husband's past relationships. <br /> <br /> The focus of the camera was on Meethi, played by Konkona. She and her schizophrenic world form the core of 15 Park Avenue. She worked really hard for the character, but sometimes she can not connect with the audience. The fateful accident of her life tries to involve compassion and was only partially successful. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to do a few things in one go, from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a woman even in modern-day India, to the twisted relationships in a ragged family. And I think Aparna has succeeded to some degree. The helplessness of Meethi, while working as a journalist in a rural eastern state, gives us all a nude image of the country we are so proud of. <br /> <br /> After I finished Park Avenue, I sensed I was not thirsty. I wanted more out of this movie to emotionally numb me. It was a commendable effort by the director, apart from a few minor problems. Must watch out for anyone who wants to see another movie, something with a strong purpose.
