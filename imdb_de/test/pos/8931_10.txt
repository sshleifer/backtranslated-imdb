Well, my dad drove Lee Evans back and forth in the hotels so I could see how something was done. It's a brilliant movie! Bob Pugh passed a shed with a lawnmower and accidentally let go. He went into a fence and he fell over. Lee Evans was also funny when he saw me and said, are you cold? and he said: Well put your hands in your pockets! I think it was really funny and it's going to be a well-known comedy. Like every other Lee Evans movie! They were really great people. They seemed to be quite polite and funny. I would like to see her again someday. Brenda Blethyn left her caravan with blood and twigs in her messy hair and I was really scared when I did not notice her until she was right behind me
