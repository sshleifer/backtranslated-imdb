This film shows some of the best ensemble work I've seen in film or on stage. The actors play each other out with a skill and vivacity that can not be achieved by editing in any way. <br /> <br /> "Love Jones" a good story, period. But it's also an excellent portrayal of the urban, twenty- or twenty-time Afro-American middle-income set that is not often seen.
