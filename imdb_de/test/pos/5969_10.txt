As you read the comments, I realize that this wonderful movie has the obvious impact on the audience. But how can one see this film and not reflect that the elaborate dialogue was a subtle and so daring reproach to the authorities, which were "in control" in the USSR at the time? It was not the souls only in the time and place of the revealed action. The superficial questions provoke naked when addressed to the here and now. Who are the real "employees"? I am surprised that the writer was not in prison. I read somewhere that great stress can be a catalyst for great art. This film is a masterpiece of misdirection and seems to point in one direction, challenging the audience to "look over my shoulder at what I'm really talking about." What courage.
