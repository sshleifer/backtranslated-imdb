"Gaming? Nicotine? Punches? We are moving in a descending spiral of iniquity!" So says the head of St. Swithen about the visit of Master Common in Nutbourne. The faculty and students of St. Swithen were commissioned to share facilities in Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II. Then there is the library of the masters. "The Journal of Samuel Pepys ... In a nutshell ... well, that's something to be thankful for What's going on here? The memoirs of Casanova? Was not this the book we saw reading Jessica James in the closet? "Decameron Nights! Well, really, whatever that place may be, it's not a place to bring carefully groomed girls!" <br /> <br /> Yes, the Department of Education made a terrible mistake. Nutbourne is a school for boys. St. Swithen's is a school for girls. And what makes this one of the best British comedies after the Second World War is Wetherby Pond, the boss of Nutbourne, who is played by Alastair Sim, while Muriel Whitchurch, the main wife of St. Swithen, is played by Margaret Rutherford. <br /> <br /> "St. Swithen's?" says pond. "You do not mean that your school is a school for boys and girls?" he asks one of the early girls. "Only girls," she says cheerfully. "Does that mean, sir," asks one of Nutbourne's teachers, "that we should expect 100 young girls?" "That means that not only did the ministry make a mistake when it sent a school here at all, but that it is a terrible sexual aberration!" <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford's Miss Whitchurch, as positive and immobile as a battleship, intends to make the most of it by, if possible, quickly taking over Nutbourne. Alastair Sim's pond is desperate to his big bald head and is determined to save his school. In the meantime, there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys who need to be fed to sleep there (along with their teachers). The cooks and janitors, who are fully dressed, go out. Miss Whitchurch and her girls, however, are responsible for the cooking tasks. "Come on, Angela," she says to a girl trying to stir something in a big pot, "have not you done a porridge yet?" "Yes, but nobody ever had to eat it." "That's a defeatist attitude, my dear, stir well and do not shit." <br /> <br /> It's hardly going well when Pond discovers that four governors of a school he wants to lead arrive at any moment to see how well Nutbourne is run. And Miss Whitchurch learns that just four rich and influential parents have arrived to see how their daughters in the new boy are doing - for free - they were told - facilities. The only solution? Miss Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and their students, persuade each other to make the point that Nutbourne has no girls and St. Swithens has no boys. After parents inspect a dorm and go to class, the girls duck in the beds, and the boys, who have disappeared, jump into their beds just as the governors come in. The Boys Are Watched in Rugby As soon as the governors turn their backs, the goalposts are dismantled, nets set up for lacrosse, and then the parents go over to watch the girls. One parent discovers her daughter in a science class, then later in a choir practice, then a moment later ... "There's Angela again," she tells Miss Whitchurch. "Why?" She replies, urging her parents to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner. "The child is omnipresent." <br /> <br /> When we leave Nutbourne, everything is discovered. The students are racing around. The teachers are stunned (except for two who are kissing.) The Ministry of Education has just sent some more busloads of students. The parents are speechless, but the governors are not. "We are waiting for an explanation," says one keen. Pond holds his head and shudders. "Can not you see that I'm trying to think of you?" <br /> <br /> The film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation to another, paired with a very funny script and two hilarious performances by Rutherford and Sim. Sim's droll desperation and Rutherford's relentless determination are so well matched that it's a shame that this is the only movie they've ever shot together. Joyce Grenfell as Gossage, St. Swithen's tall, awkward physical education teacher, gives them some competition. If you keep your eyes peeled, you'll also find some amusing credentials featuring director Frank Launder, including a gong in Nutbourne that looks like a small version of J. Arthur Rank, a faint echo of The Third Man's zither theme and a shot stolen by Oliver Twist from David Lean, except that the little boy holds his porridge bowl and says, "Please, sir, I do not want anymore." <br /> <br /> Frank Launder and his partner Sidney Gilliat were responsible for the best films produced in the UK in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. They wrote, produced and directed, sometimes one, sometimes the other. In one way or another, they've starred for top-notch films such as Green for Danger (with a masterful droll performance by Sim), I See a Dark Stranger, The Lady Vanishes, Night Train to Munich, Wee Geordie, The Bells of St Trinians, The Rake's Progress and many others. Launder wrote and directed with the happiest days of her life as both produced. It is one of her best.
