This is a gratifying project that does not suggest the title. Good performance by Nadia Dajani, who plays the role of Grace. I'm following the reenactment of what's going on with Mike and Grace in New York City. She leaves, but wants to contact her. This project is his way to get in touch with her. <br /> <br /> I saw it on the IFC. I heard that it will also be released on DVD. I like this trend of more independent projects. This is an example of a good project. <br /> <br /> I hope he finds her. <br /> <br /> Stop by and have a chat. <br /> <br/> KirbyEF
