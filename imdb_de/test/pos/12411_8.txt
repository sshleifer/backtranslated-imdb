This season's "TFTD" episode with the ironic title "Answer Me" is a pretty accomplished and memorable episode that ends in a shocking twist. They have Jean Marsh as over the hill and the actress of L.A., who has moved to New York City for an audition, and she lives in an apartment provided by an old friend. Oddly enough, she was kept awake each evening by a telephone ringing from the apartment next door, but strangely enough, the apartment, with the ringing phone still ringing, is vacant, as guests have been dead for many years. After all, she has to give in, only to have to go with her and not answer the phone with anyone, since it's bad to wrap herself in a phone with her own life! All in all, a good episode that is strange, although it is still exciting on a supernatural phone and turns well in the end.
