WARNING: SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This is written for movie goers who have moved away from "Mood for Love", bewildered and confused by the ways the main characters in life choose. By reading other reviews and reviews, it seems that many viewers and critics have missed out on some very important details that may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful story of a movie. We forget that there was a time when the filmmakers had the "Dirty Act" suggested by simply showing the floppy couples how they drive away with a sled or a hay wagon, and then return to the next scene with a plump belly or a fat toddler hip ... "Meet your child". <br /> <br /> The director took the same nostalgic approach when he told the story of Mr. Chow and Ms. Chan. Last warning ... SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> Mr. Chow deceives Ms. Chan into showing her true feelings as they rehearse his goodbye forever. Next scene: Mrs. Chan leans her head against Mr. Chow in the taxi and says, "I do not want to go home tonight." Why did not the couple just do the modern thing of emptying their cheating spouses, getting divorced, raising their love child and living happily after that? The answer is that this whole story is set in Hong Kong in the sixties. A bastard would live in dishonor in a gloomy life if he were a child of an adulteress, while a "legitimate" child could lead a tragic but noble / honest life if his mother pulled him away from his fraudulent "father" - the invisible Mr. Chan. In short, Mr. Chow and Ms. Chan sacrifice their relationship for the future of their child. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Mr. Chow learns that Ms. Chan lives alone with a little boy, has a knowing smile and finishes dreaming of turning Ms. Chan into his wife Chow. Then he also realizes why Ms. Chan has gone all the way to Singapore to be with him, to reconsider and leave at the last opportunity ... and decides never to see him again, living with this wonderful secret, without anyone saying anything. Nobody but a crumbling temple wall and of course the spectator ... but only if we listen carefully.
