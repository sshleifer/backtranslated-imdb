On the highway to the wedding of his beloved Betty-Ann, Adam (Eric Jungmann) is surprised by his former schoolmate Harley (Justin Urich) in the backseat of his car. Adam broke off because of Betty-Ann with the uncomfortable and idiot Harley. During the road trip, Harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar, and later their car is chased by a huge monster truck in the street. After a few incidents, they pick up hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks), and earlier the trio is being terrorized by an eerie monster driving the monster truck. Despite one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a horror movie the irritating Harley, "Monster Man" is a surprisingly good garbage horror comedy. The story is a collection of clich√©s, beginning with "Joy Ride" or "Duel"; then it turns into one of the countless rip-offs of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; There is a surprising twist that ends with a tick for a sequel. There are funny scenes, Aimee Brooks is extremely sexy and this movie really entertains. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Monster Man"
