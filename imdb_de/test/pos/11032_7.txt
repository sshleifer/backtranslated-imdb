I remember this movie. It was the first movie I saw in the cinema. The picture was dark in places. I was very nervous. It was in the year 74/75. My dad took me to Newbury Cinema in Newbury Berkshire, England, with my brother and sister. I remember the tigers and the amount of snow in the movie, as well as the performance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery. I think one of the tigers is shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find it on DVD, etc., please let me know. The movie theater has now been converted into a health club, which is a pity as the nearest cinema is now 20 miles away and would like to hear from others who have seen this movie or similar movie.
