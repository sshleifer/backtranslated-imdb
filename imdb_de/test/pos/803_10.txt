The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and usually find out who is killed and who committed the murder. While I found out who should be killed, I did not find out who did it. I was not satisfied with the portrayal of the Gerda character, but in the year the movie was about to take place, it was possible that the woman would have been so 'smart'. Please note that these Poirot movies are good, but not as dynamic as the series, because they have neither Japp, Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I saw every actor who played him. The worst thing was Peter Ustinov!
