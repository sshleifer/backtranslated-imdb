I have to admit, I used to have the opportunity to watch this movie, and after about five to ten minutes, I felt like many. I was expecting a Monkey movie similar to the TV show, but instead I got ... well, I did not know what I honestly got. <br /> In this movie, I realized that not only did I close the brilliance that he depicts, but I kept looking at it. It's the one movie I'm always interested in just because it keeps me awake as I try to decode its meanings. And when I think I found out something in the movie, the answer is destroyed as soon as I watch the movie again. Brilliance indeed. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people who did not like this movie want to see a movie that is mostly clear-cut. They want everything explained and all questions answered in the final. I'm sorry, if that's what you want, this is not the movie for you. But if you like movies like "The Matrix" (and even better, their sequels), you will stimulate the thought that you will experience with this breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> Remember that the movie is like a dream. In our dreams, things do not make sense, the things we expect them to not happen, people's places and things do not speak, act or function in the same way as they actually do. Complaining about "head" is like complaining about a dream that you think you can not understand. The mind is a complex system, and if a movie called "Head" is just as complex, is it so difficult to relate the two? <br /> <br /> The music (and music numbers) are particularly catchy The two compositions by Peter Tork, which are still the best tracks of the film, "Can You Dig It?" and "Long Title: Do I have to do it all over again?" <br /> <br /> This movie proves that The Monkees were far more than just four zanny guys in a "pre-fab" group (like their critics) called them on a TV show, but they're actually much smarter and more talented than the world would be worthy of them. There are so many messages that can be generally deduced from the film, both in terms of The Monkees and in the entertainment industry, that it is considered a masterpiece of filmmaking that was far ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> I believe that if this film had been released as an independent piece at that time, it would indeed win the respect and admiration it deserves. <br /> <br /> And one last note: <br /> <br /> This could be compared to the Beatles "Magical Mystery Tour" movie, because the Beatles movie seemed just as weird and bizarre. However, in my opinion, "Head" is way beyond what the Beatles put on celluloid.
