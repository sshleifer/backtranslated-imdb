It was a terrific movie! I watch it over and over again. The actors were great. The film kept me on the edge of the seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would bring this movie to DVD. I would definitely buy a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful with who you are connected to. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter saw the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime shows it. It's the kind of movie you stick to the TV movies with. I wish Lifetime would repeat the movie, but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen.
