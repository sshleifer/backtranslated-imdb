This is a classic animated movie from the animated series! Most main characters get a lot of screen time and extra characters. The movie focuses on the holiday of the superstar characters and everyone has their own summer fun! It's very funny from start to finish! It has excellent color, great music and believe it or not, I've seen this more than any movie. It is so great and in my opinion it is perfect!
