For the main criticisms of the film ... The love story: This was not a love story. These were two people who came together desperately and tried to find a humanity in EVERYTHING. The same thing happened to soldiers and the Russian boy. It added a feminine touch, but watch American movies ... no, where the love story is so close. There was no story: Does War have a story? I think that's a stupid criticism. The story is this. They start with 400 men and the film was limited to show the lives of about 10 men, and how each of them did their part and died. Death is the ultimate end of every story. Just because there was no happy ending does not mean that it has no story. <br /> <br /> There was a terrible truth in this movie. I would not necessarily call it "anti-war". It had a political message, of course, but the film was not just about politics. In fact, except for some incidents, when the captain? It turned out that Nazi Germany never came under pressure. They were far enough out of reach of the Nazi Party. The fat cats would not go to Russia! <br /> <br /> Maybe not exactly accurate and not a Hollywood hit, but they have a good knowledge of the ordinary soldier (I would speak of almost any nationality.) War and what they have to go through. It was a defeat, of course, the film is depressing. And to the person who said it was brave (and stupid) to portray Germans even as victims: in every war there are victims on all sides (every real soldier will tell you that). <br /> <br /> This film is a good balance between film and documentary. A few problems with that, if you only argue for one, but it brings out the best of both worlds. Look at it as such. But beware, it's a tough movie, if not graphic or emotional. I wait until they make a movie about Iraq. It will probably have many of the same themes and be very controversial. I want to see who has the courage to do so first. (Jarhead does not count)
