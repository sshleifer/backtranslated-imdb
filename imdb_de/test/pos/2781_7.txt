So we saw this on DVD in our apartment here in Paris. We are all here with an exchange program. We all laughed so hard because so much of what happened in the movie happened to us! I mean, sure that some of them were pretty cliched, but still true, I know what I'm saying the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France. She looks like a cool girl in the movie and really, after seeing her host at the Cannes Festival last month. Now I think I want to go to Barcelona next summer after watching this movie. I must also look at the sequel that has just come out here in France.
