very rarely does it happen that i sit down to write a commentary for a movie .... but this movie !!!!!! oh my holy god !!!!!!!! never was there a hindi film better than this ...... and never did a movie get better than this ...... it's the king of all comedies ..... Aamir Khan is arguably the best COMIC actor in Indian film industry ... although it's weird to say that he's a classic, not a comedian ... but what he's done in this movie is perhaps the most hilarious performance by an Indian actor in a thoroughly comedic comedy. .. <br /> <br /> salman khan has never been a good actor in my eyes .... but this movie made the best of it ... he was innocent weird ... if there was one at all Term like it .... exactly what the doctor ordered in relation to his role in the movie ... <br /> <br /> rajkumar santoshi I do not know why, I've never tried comedies again. ... he led big things like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Khakee, but could not restore the magic of Andaz Apna Apna ... </ p> <br /> I do not care why this movie bombs at the box office was ... although I am sad that a movie like "hum aapke hain kaun" was the reason for his failure ...... from now on I hope that the rumors will come true ... it will be "andaz apna apna -2 ", they say ....... we as an audience can only say AMEN !!!!!
