It would be misleading to find this piece between an obsolete prequel and a reconstructed 80's macho movie in the midday program of a UPN partner. It deserves more and definitely takes advantage of the best qualities of its talented leads. Bracco and Walken are working together to provide a film that may be predictable to those familiar with their genre, making the Streetwise routine "restless minds" that they can so well represent. To go on a psychological rollercoaster after Fuqua's "Training Day", dive into the world of television movies of the early '90s to find "scam"!
