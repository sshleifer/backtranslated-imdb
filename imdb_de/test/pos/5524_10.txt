The working title was "Do not Spank Baby". <br /> <br /> Wayne Crawford became a successful producer, films like Valley Girl, Night of the Comet and others, even though he was not that great in this little gem. And the little-known Abe Zwick would have got a lot of work from this movie, but he had not. Filmed at Moberly Studios in Hollywood, Florida, the early Tarzan films were also filmed. This movie is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. The film was originally filmed with some nudity and much more graphic slasher scenes. For reasons known only to the director, Tom Casey, the bloody Slasher scenes were given a tab with LSD, and the nudity was removed. Although this version is worth a look for those who tend to, in my opinion the original version would have received the necessary punch for the Slasher 70 classic Classic.
