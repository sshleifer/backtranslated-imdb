Sure, it has its presumptuous moments, it acts like a kind of house, live action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always been interested in them. I will now evaluate the segments individually. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg - "Un ballo in maschera" - This segment can affect the movie for some people because it is the worst thing. It's hard to follow, mostly because it tries to cling to a clear plot. The photography is not finished yet. The best part is the little Lesbian Homoerotica she never does enough with. This segment made me very nervous if I continued. 10.2. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - "La virgine degli angeli" - an unclear segment, but it does not matter. The film has the best cinematography of the gang, mainly because it is in stunning black and white. The segment is gorgeous and beautiful. 10.7. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - "Armide" - I chose this demure film for the Godard and Altman segments. At Godard I was much more impressed than I thought. I can not say I've seen so many of his films since he did so many that hardly anyone saw anything, but in my opinion, this may be his best work since the 1960s. It's the funniest segment in this movie and artistically accomplished. Bravo, Jean-Luc! 10.9. <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - "Rigoletto" - a very fun segment that is also pretty predictable. This story about a husband and wife cheating on each other in the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long, complex tracking shots that depend on the timely choreography of the actors. It also has a big self-reference about omnibus movies. The last scene is very weak. 10.7. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - "The Dead City" - this short segment also includes lovers in (I think) Venice. It's pretty, with some nice shots of pigeons flying through the city. It's easy, but nice. 10.7. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - "Les Bor√©ades" - not one of the better segments, unfortunately this is more a music video than a short film. The inmates of a madhouse attend a theatrical performance. The music and the pictures work well together, so I can at least recognize it as a good music video. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Franc Roddam - "love death" - somewhat unhappy for the Beresford segment, this segment is very similar to him. As you can see in my phrasing, this has hit me a lot more. It's about a young man and his girl traveling to Las Vegas on a fatalistic journey. 8.10. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - "Nessun dorma" - perhaps the most visually striking segment. It's more in a fantasy world than in reality. It's a beautiful story of a fallen angel. 8.10. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - "Depuis le jour" - I've heard a lot about Jarman, and this is the first piece I've seen of him. I hope I will see more in the future. This is also music video, but it's better than Altman's segment. It's mainly about an old woman who remembers her younger days. Editing and using different footage to show time and emotions is very nice. 8.10. <br /> <br /> Bill Bryden - "I pagliacci" - the sad clown, possibly one of the most famous arias (especially memorable for an episode of Seinfeld), serves as a material that separates each segment from the finale. It is simple and effective. 10.7. <br /> <br /> Overall I give a solid 7/10. It's not nearly as bad as you've heard.
