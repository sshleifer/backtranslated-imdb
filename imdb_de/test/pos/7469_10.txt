Very closely written, played and filmed. Powerful, but not too much. Who edited this, knew exactly what he wanted to portray. There is no wasted scene in this movie. "The Usual Suspects" was an outstanding ensemble. This is a collection of outstanding individual achievements. I rarely buy movies, but this is worth owning.
