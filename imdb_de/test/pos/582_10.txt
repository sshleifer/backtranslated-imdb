A review of Jim Henson's works after his death is like looking back to another time. Because unlike most of the so-called creative types who nowadays try to sell children to children or even use them cynically, Jim never really seemed to forget what it was like to be a child. And if there was a moment in which he demonstrated this, it is the Muppet film of 1979. Filmed as an allegorical story about how Henson came on puppet television as a puppeteer and eventually delivered his own half-hour show on primetime television, he receives Muppet film confirms everything that is more progressive Children who did not quite live up to the expected standard in the 1980s. And while we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and kept from talking about anything so that no one gets insulted, here is offered the open celebration of the difference or diversity that made up much of the Muppet Show. I said it in other comments, but I have to say it here. The day Jim Henson died, a great light went out. <br /> <br /> The Muppet movie begins with its cast to see the premiere of what was to be seen in the next approximately eighty minutes. In short, precise blows we are introduced to the main players as well as to some minors. And when the real story starts, we get a great song to bring us into the moment. The Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and a sad picture of what the Muppets, especially Kermit, were. These were not just a few felt dolls with unique personalities who came together for a show. They were living things that were based on a part of us all, and written so much bolder than we are used to. When each Muppet was introduced to us in turn, we saw a different reflection of a part of us, and of course the children in the audience reacted to each character differently. Therefore everyone had a favorite. When Animal appeared behind a drum set and tried to eat a pelvis, I knew I had found one of mine. Today I'm more of a Swedish chef, but what's up? <br /> <br /> To complement the characters, there were a number of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities. Can you imagine that? gave an insight into Dr. Teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of Henson. The most relevant song for me, however, was the number of Gonzo who was asked what he is and where he comes from. Many of us would look at the stars for a lifetime and, as Gonzo said, we knew that one day we would return there. Of course, not all songs were so deadly serious. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after deciding to combine their talent (or lack thereof) and take to the streets. If evidence were to be sought that today's musicians have lost the ability to use the pop structure to make something audible, that number would be. Never before and never again would the group dynamics of a cast and the music complement each other so perfectly. With the puppeteers and dubbers who fit in perfectly with their game, the human performers had a lot to do. <br /> <br /> All the more amazing is that the human element also lived to the end of the deal. Cameos maintain the film in the truest sense of the word. Everyone from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas is here to offer his support. Even Richard Pryor, the last man to be expected in a movie about the Muppets, seems to be having a fun moment. Mel Brooks' cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult, as it was when I was a little boy, but I suspect Henson knew why I found it annoying now. However, the great theatrical power comes from Charles Durning, who as Doc Hopper embodies everything that both Henson and his audience are determined to resist. At each intersection, Hopper either gives Kermit the chance to sell and betray his own species. Or offer stops as the right word as Hopper strives to make compliance with Kermit's compliance stronger and more violent. The whole thing is a great metaphor for how every artist has broken his heart out of the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, Animal also shows up to remind us that our friends are not cute and cuddly they are less of a friend. In fact, Animal proves to be the best friend Kermit has right now. And that's the core message of every good show or movie Henson has been involved in ever since. It could literally be the worst mistake others have ever made or simply been made for linguistic or cosmetic reasons. There can be little doubt that in today's world, where an idiot in purple suit can tell my sons that they are not good, if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons, and yet are not seriously investigated by the child protection authorities, Hensons Creature Workshop Doing This Never Taken Up To cite the title of the album incorrectly, it's one thing to be daring, to be stupid. The Muppet film shows how Henson dared to make us all think, both inside and outside the proverbial box. There will never be another, but he would never want us to stop trying. <br /> <br /> Therefore, The Muppet Movie is the epitome of ten out of ten films. If we were to send a movie into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being extinguished, that would be the case.
