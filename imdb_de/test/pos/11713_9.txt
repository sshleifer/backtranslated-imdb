In short, if you want to see Burt Reynolds' best films, they need to be recorded. If you do not like Burt, you still like it. If you love Burt, this can become one of your favorite movies of all time! It's home from Atlanta, but it's also nice to see a cop / action / drama happening somewhere other than NY City, Chicago, Miami or LA. The movie is fun at points with & good action & good performances from a great supporting actor (every character is real and the bad guys are not so sided that they are really well thought out). A nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half Some good old fashion shootouts and fistfights (no CGI thank God REAL ACTION!) <br /> <br /> When Clint Eastwood gets his best impression of a Burt Reynolds movie with "Every Who Way But Loose "and" Any That Way You Made "" Then Burt replied with his best Clint-type strip, and it's coming out great!
