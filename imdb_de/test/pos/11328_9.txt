The act of "In the Mood for Love" is simple enough: a married man and a married woman (albeit not with each other) are beginning to develop a romantic bond with each other. The tempo of the movie is stunningly slow, and there really is little between the two. However, the backdrop of Hong Kong in the early 1960s and the keen sense of director Wong Kar-Wai of capturing the beauty of the scenery and the main characters make this film a joy. The actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are both excellent. Wong Kar-Wai has done extraordinary work to capture the sentiment and nostalgia of the past (something that so many films and directors are trying to do, but mostly fail). There are so many small details that give the film charm (a trademark of the director), and it is the colors and the cinematography that transcend this otherwise simple story as a wonderful cinematic achievement. 10.9.
