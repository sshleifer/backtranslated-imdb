As with some of the best movies and series, I stumbled upon it by accident. It was late, there was a storm outside, and I was sitting comfortably on the sofa as I passed a canal that was showing one of the episodes. I intended to wait just a few minutes while waiting for the commercials to be completed on another channel before switching to another sitcom. About an hour and a half later, I remembered my determination and was so happy that I had not. Needless to say, I made sure I saw all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> John Hannah was brilliant in almost everything I saw him in, and he does not let himself down. All other performers also do a great job. My personal favorite (apart from John Hannah of course) is Gerard Murphy. <br /> <br /> The only negative side of this series is the limited number of episodes. Only 8 at JH and 1 at another person. I'd like to see McCallum back on the screens, though it would be JH!
