I do not know what the last reviewer is talking about, but this show is pure entertainment. Basically, 2 guys are used in competitions in a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios. They mix the scenarios for each show, so it's not the same every time. The four-member panel of judges is not afraid to call or admit people when they recognize the game. They will break what the guy did wrong and what he did right. Some participants are weak, others strong, but what happens is always entertaining. If you are a guy who is going out, you can relate. I have seen a weak game, I have seen a strong game, and this show is real. No doubt.
