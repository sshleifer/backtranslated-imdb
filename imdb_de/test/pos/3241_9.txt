Although a bit off the book, you can love the atmospheric music and settings. <br /> <br /> The scenes in Bath are exactly as they should be. But if you've seen it as many times as I've noticed, you'll notice that the background people are the same in every scene, but other than that, I like the scene in which they're in the hot baths, but the men and women do you really bathe together like that? You could see all the men squatting around the outside and staring at the women. It also seemed strange that they all put on their hats, but maybe that was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very beautiful, the dances and the outfits looked beautiful. I particularly liked the dress of Catherine in the first ballroom scene. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey looked appropriately imposing, but I liked the bathing scenes better. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance to Catherine Morland. Googie Withers offers the best performance that Mrs. Allen feels. <br /> <br /> Ugh Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, he just talks a lot of garbage and is not a clergyman as he should, it's hard to imagine he was in love with Catherine, but then the book never really did this impression. General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also performs well as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not perform well as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, he has the impression of a grubby and lusty man, perhaps not the figure depicted in the book, but I like it a lot. <br /> <br /> I can deal with scenes cut out of a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added, it usually annoys me. The marschionin I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and not her cartwheel page boy. <br /> <br /> Some of the scripts are peculiar. When Catherine Elinor asks Tilney about her mother's death, she asks, "I think you saw the body, how did it appear?" What a fool to say! Elinor's calm answer is also stupid. <br /> <br /> Please tell me anyway if you agree with me or not
