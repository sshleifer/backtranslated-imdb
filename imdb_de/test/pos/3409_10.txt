"North & South", the television series is in the 80s, which was "Rich Man, Poor Man" (the first TV miniseries) in the 70s. <br /> <br /> It is a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel of the trilogy by the author John Jakes. The story itself covers the two decades that preceded the years of President Abraham Lincoln's election and the impending proclamation of civil war - north to south. The interlocking stories evolve around the families of the Hazards (the "north" in the title) and the Mains and their two central characters, George and Orry, who make friends during their West Point training in 1842. <br /> <"North & South" is a wonderful historical timeline, and as I get older (and gets smarter!) it's very interesting for me to learn about the contrasting attitudes to such controversial aspects as "slavery" and " Abolitionisten "to learn this attitude originated. <br /> <br /> The series also shows some great characterization developments as we get to know the friends and enemies in George and Orry's life and also the women who stole their hearts as young men. This aspect of the story also reveals a romantic story set against the turbulent backdrop of the American Civil War. "North & South," along with "Rich Man, Poor Man," is overshadowed by 1977's "Roots" as the biggest mini-series ever. However, there is a close second / third race and share the same kind of timeline and themes as "Roots". But do not miss this, even if you just want to see the great scenery, costumes, and brilliant all-star cast, including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland, and Lesley-Anne Down et al. <br /> <br /> The series is beautifully designed and tied to historical events. It is a pity that Emmy's and Golden Globes did not honor many more actors and actresses for their depictions. Patrick Swayze and James Read, the two virtually unknown protagonists of the time, present themselves as Orry Main and George Hazard. However, it is Kirstie Alley's intriguing performance as Georges "abolitionist" sister Virgilia steals the show many times. Also, Terri Garber, David Carradine and Philip Casnoff as Elkanah Bent are the delicious villains of the piece you just hate. <br /> <br /> "North & South" Books 1 & 2 are now available on two DVD sets.
