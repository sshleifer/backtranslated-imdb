After seeing the uncut version, I found that this movie was beautifully done. It caught my attention from start to finish. The tension was wonderfully conveyed. Nasaan Ka Man portrays the typical Filipino family with an accurate account of secrets and lies. Even the religious culture, the human tendency to preserve appearances and maintain a pure reputation are reflected in Gloria Diaz's character. There is no small scene in this film that has no purpose - the cinematography is excellent and the writing brilliant. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is great, I personally realized that the twist in the end was the revelation that had to do with Jericho's character was not as much a shock as it should be. But then maybe it's just me, because otherwise Nasaan Ka Man is a very clever movie. <br /> <br /> The casting was good at first, but the show of Deither and Claudine was the icing on the cake. Not to be missed, if you are looking for a Filipino movie that will surprise and surpass expectations. Thumbs up to the director.
