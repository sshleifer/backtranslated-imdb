I agree with the guy above. It's so funny that I understand everything, but my friends just do not understand it. Go to Japan and you will see another movie after you were there. When I met my friend's friend in Kanagawa. I swear, I felt just like Jack. Terrified, but at the end of the day everything was fine, so I'm giving this movie a 10 out of 10 next month fly to Japan. One thing that is really good is the ballgames. Gives me the feeling of being there again. This is a must if you are interested in Japan and baseball. Too bad they will not do a sequel. Does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the quarrel with hirko in the walkway with a roof on it ???? I have to know that I can win a Japanese ex-wife with me. Many Thanks
