Yes, it's a Fast Times wannabe, but it's still a decent conversation. <br /> <br /> Some of the comedy parts are really funny. The scene as the three boys visit the Spaniard is hilarious, with some flamenco music in the background. The reaction when her sailor comes home is a rebellion. The boys' successes in dealing with crabs are also funny when they try to "drown" them and when they visit the pharmacist. <br /> <br /> The abortion scene is also a rip-off of the Fast Times, but it can capture the horrors of the situation well. They really have a feeling for what Karen is going through, and for Gary in his insane fight for cash to pay for the abortion and make her recover. The end is painful to look at, but refreshingly realistic. First time viewers will not be prepared and it will be a shock. There is a decent eye-catcher for guys with young girls and the spanish milf-lady, but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penis measurement contest. <br /> <br /> Also underrated soundtrack. Check out the early U2 (!), The Cars in Prime and a matching tearjerker song by James Ingram for the startling ending. <br /> <br /> Some people will hate it and it's a bit dated, but those who grew up like teen flicks or in the early 80's should like it.
