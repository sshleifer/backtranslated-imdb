This movie is remarkable for how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of a woman and a man and their pursuit of happiness in the midst of the boring, routine life of a housewife and a "man of the house." It could be any couple, every family, in every city ... but that's what makes the story so moving. It somehow touches each of us and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I could not stop thinking about it ... and what more could you ask of a movie? Especially a documentation. This is an excellent film that I can warmly recommend to anyone who loves documentary films, stories about families like yours, stories about love, life, parenting, loss, expectations, soul research, yearning, walking through life, and finding your way.
