I was surprised that I liked this movie. But it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first Friday of the 13th. There were some cheesy elements, but at the same time lots of cool ones. The plot was good - predictable if you've seen more than one or two horror films, but full of one-liners to make it worthwhile. There are some memorable scenes that are worth seeing. A few problems I had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters. For example, in the opening scene, the scarecrows (which involved people whose blood was drained to grow the crop) looked very real, but later in the movie, they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue masks. There were more than a few gaps in the plot, and the acting was mediocre, but at least it sounded like real people talking, unlike Hollywood movies, where the dialogue really sounds wrong, if you think about it. The climax of the last scene, when the main character says, "I'm not a baker, I'm a Connell!" and lop the scarecrow's head is satisfying as his friends were largely killed by these creatures at that time.
