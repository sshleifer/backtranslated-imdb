It is a German rocket scientist Gerhart Zucher (Ulrich Thomsen), who works in Great Britain in the United Kingdom advent of the Second World War. Fearing that Hitler could call him back to Germany in preparation for the war, Zucher and his slippery assistant Heinz (Eddie Marsan) are evacuated by the British authorities to a remote Scottish island. They are commissioned to build a rocket box that will allow the islanders to communicate with the mainland. Mocked and bullied by the islanders, they settle down with MacDonald's native wife, Catherine Mackay (the stunning Shauna), with whom Thomsen begins an affair, but complications arise when Germany calls ... <br /> <br / > The central romance between Zucher and Catherine is subtle and sincerely played, and the side cast is a colorful ensemble of notable Scottish character actors such as Gary Lewis and Clive Russell. <br /> <br /> Fine cinematography and a brilliant central theme song sung in the local dialect complete this film. <br /> <br /> Smart but modest, It's good for a quiet evening.
