I am sorry that SURFACE was not picked up for the 2006-2007 NBC season. I think the market's demand for inhumane gaming and reality shows on the air, a reflection of our culture, has made a good story. I hope and pray that a network will pick it up so that it continues like STARGATE and its spin-offs. <br /> <br /> I also hope that producers will find a place where they can produce the level of post production wished in a TV Guide interview. At the moment, the repetitions have to be done on sci-fi, marathons. I'd like to see where the story after the tsunami ended Episode 15. I want to find out how to disguise the true identity of the creatures. <br /> <br /> FYC Morningbear
