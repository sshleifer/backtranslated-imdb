I would probably say that this was on par with movies like "Devil's Rain" and this kind of movie, though this is probably going to be a little better. I love the 70s horror and this has the most elements that make up other movies I like, so it was pretty easy to enjoy. A family on vacation stumbles through a small town where people seem to be seized by a sort of hysteria. Seems like the kids are gone. After a first escape attempt, the family is somehow stopped on the outskirts of the city and finds its way back, but not without finding a house where the children are gone and mom and dad are dead. It looks like we have another kind of senior community center in this city, they are all Satan followers and they need the children to renew their lives so they can continue their ministry, I think. Not that anyone is too eager to give up his kids on this business. This is pretty great considering that it's scary and scary, with no buckets of blood or the loud, amazing events that are causing people today to jump into films that have replaced the real fears. We have Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) of "Green Acres" as Tobey, a sheriff's deputy who reads UFO magazines, and LQ Jones as sheriff and a well-known character actor as the father of the stranded family. And Strother Martin plays the doctor, who apparently does double duty without knowing his fellow citizens. This is pretty good stuff, but sometimes a bit confusing, but overall it works pretty well and is recommended for fans of the 70s horror. 8 out of 10.
