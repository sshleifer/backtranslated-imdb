I'm not an American, but Meatballs still hits me a lot. Maybe because it's a sweet, sweet movie. When I look at it again today, I became sentimental for a time when I can not really touch anything, and to a place I can not quite remember. <br /> <br /> Meatballs is just a great movie. It reminds me of innocent days when nothing was really important and everything was possible. If you're reading this, you probably know what I mean. All I Can Say Above I've already said that Meatballs have to be even nostalgic if you're American. <br /> <br /> I think you know what I mean.
