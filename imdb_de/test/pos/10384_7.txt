"Beyond the Clouds" is a superior artistic group of four vignettes, each of which provides insight into a man-woman relationship from thin to turbulent. Although the film offers superb cinematography, some exquisite visual beauty and a number of outstanding performers, there is little meat left on the bones of this fragmented work. A taste of a relationship can not convey the fullness of the relationship, and synergism suggests that one story can accomplish more in two hours than four. Nevertheless, "Beyond the Clouds" will be a dilettante feed and a feast for all, if only superficially, stilted and contentless.
