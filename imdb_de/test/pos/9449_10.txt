This is a classic American movie in combination with comedy, romance and dream. You can say, "There have been many such films. But just believe me, you think that's good because it's well-directed, scriptwriting and playing. Amanda Bynes is just amazing! She is humor, sweet and charming both inside and outside the screen. She is indeed the man !!! The message I get from this is to pursue your own fairy tale. What I mean by "fairy tales" is not the prince and the princess, but "faith". This means that we leave your faith, your dream and the things that you regret all your life, if you do not do that. one of those movies that you must not miss in your life.
