Hardly a cinematic experience can beat a good thriller with humor. Geena Davis is a home teacher who suffers from amnesia. She is even on the PTA! But then a car accident wakes the woman she once was, and it's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is weird as the little private investigator who helps Davis find her past just to find out he's over his head. Davis also has some weird lines, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well. <br /> <br /> Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse, who finally managed to remove his television picture in St. Elsewhere. The film is directed by Davis's husband, who seems to have built up almost the entire movie around them, but he works. <br /> <br /> I take off this DVD and often see it again. I still love the make-up scene. Is Geena hot or what?
