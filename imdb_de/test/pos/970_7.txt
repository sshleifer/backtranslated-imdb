SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> We all heard the legend "Boy Who Cried Wolf". But if the wolf were a person in the modern world. Well, it could be something like Big Fat Liar. 14-year-old Jason Sheperd (Frankie Muniz of "Malcolm in the Middle") always lies to protect himself from anger. One day, he is pressured to write an English essay, but in the hands of the gloomy filmmaker Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who wants to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. No one believes Jason when, for once, he tells the truth and goes to summer school. However, Jason is determined to prove the truth to his parents and travels to L.A. with his girlfriend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes). When Wolf does not want to admit that he's torn down his story, Jason plans to make Wolf's life hell. B.F.L. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of your time. I wish they could have done it a little longer and there are not so many pranks, though they are smart enough (I like the pool coloring best). If Paul Giamatti had not been, maybe I would not have liked it that much. He is just funny. If you have 90 minutes to kill, give it a try. You could just enjoy it.
