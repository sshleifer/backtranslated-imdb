This movie contains essentially all the elements of a great 1970s commercial movie, except that it was made for the direct video market in the late '80s. <br /> <br /> They have a young couple in love, but the whole world They are either involved in crack-shops or gang violence. When the friend comes to jail, the girlfriend is vulnerable to all the criminals who are all in this movie, with the exception of the police. First, she is hooked on a cracker by a dealer, and then, owing money to drug lord Jim Brown, she becomes Brown's property. Then she is basically enslaved in a military style rift house, after which the film is named. <br /> <br /> If this is not reason enough to see this movie, you also have Anthony Geary, who plays a seemingly conservative school counselor, but he really is a big crack trader. In a shady but funny scene he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a solution. In an earlier scene, he was found to be her advisor. This scene and another, in which Jim Brown forces her to take a hot shower because she stinks, is hysterical. Lead actress Cheryl Kay was really good in this movie. Tarantino, bring her back. <br /> <br /> It does not surprise me that someone mentioned in another review that Tarantino is a big fan of it. It has just the right mix of comedy, action, sex, romance and a central message to stay away from drugs. Jim Brown's rogue turn deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another big 1980s rogue, Wings Hauser in Vice Squad. Sometimes I think there should be an Oscar where such achievements could be recognized. In the meantime, let's hope that modern DVD filmmakers learn to use the same kind of humor.
