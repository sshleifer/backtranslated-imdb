"In 1927, a young man flew alone from Roosevelt Field in New York across the entire North Atlantic to Le Bourget Field in Paris in a single-engine plane without stopping. A distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles of triumph of mind, body, and spirit influenced Charles A. Lindbergh The lives of all human beings on Earth - because in the 33 hours and 30 minutes of its flight, the air age became a reality - this is the story of this flight. "/> <br /> Billy Wilder adapts to Charles A. Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize excellent novel of the same name, in which Lindbergh's historic solo flight of 1927 was modeled. Fueled by a remarkable lead performance by James Stewart as Lindberg and a clever script by Wilder and Wendell Mayes, Spirit Of St. Louis is a truly well-told story. <br /> <br /> Wilder, who at times threatens to become a monotonous film, makes sure that Lindergh's flashbacks are used. After the well-told construction of the event, such as the danger of Nungesser and Coli disappearing as they attempt the same journey in the opposite direction, we will learn how he buys his first plane and his first plane working with the flying circus. This is all relative to the understanding of the man and his obvious passion for flying. It also helps us to get a complete picture of Lindbergh, putting us on this dangerous journey in his isolated cockpit. Fight against isolation (his only company is a fly) and chronic fatigue, here is Stewart Lindbergh's dedication to the task. The film by Wilder, which is supported by Louis Lichtenfield with a grandiose result of Franz Waxman and the Academy Award nominated effects, proves to be an exciting story for people who received quite a professional production. 10.7
