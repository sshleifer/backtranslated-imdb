I've just watched a few episodes of this series on very bad VHS tapes on which I've recorded the series. But I am glad that I did that. <br /> <br /> Ramona is based on the children's books by Beverly Cleary and follows the adventures of the eight-year title (Sarah Polley). She has fun with friends and family and gets in trouble like many eight-year-olds. All ten episodes are pretty good. "Mystery Meal" somehow fuels me as a vegan, but it's funny to see parents trying to get their kids to eat cow tongue! And every episode in which Godzilla Versus's The Smog Monster is mentioned twice can not be all bad. I like Ramona's Bad Day even more. Although it is daunting when Ramona goes through a hard day, she imagines she is taking revenge on her friend Howie's Uncle (a Barclay Hope, a pre-psi factor) who always teases her. "The Perfect Day" is good too. <br /> <br /> Lori Chodos plays Beezus, Ramona's sister. I swear, I've seen her on something else, but IMDb does not list anything besides this show. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why is every fucking show that was made on DVD these days except something I'd like to buy? An injustice, if ever there was one!
