Unlike most people who commented, I was born after the last New Year's Eve Mccoy episode and could not compare the two centuries old doctors, who were not compared at first. I really enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the sequel to the series. I have seen old episodes of Doctor Who since then and some have been great, but like the Doctor, the series had to regenerate to continue. The 21st century doctor is great, I thought Martha was great, almost a match for the doctor, and when Jack's appearance is something, she gets great when she's in Series 4 or 5. <br /> <br Speaking of Jack, Torchwood's spin is also brilliant and you should watch both programs (though this is definitely more suitable for kids). However, if you insist that this is not the same and not simply Doctor Who, please stay in your basement. <br /> <br /> 10/10
