As someone living in a pan-Hellenic student community, I was not sure what to expect when I turned on this show. Having seen so much overdramatisation in "for TV movies" and the craziness of reality shows, I was curious as to whether Greek could show the true college and Greek life experience. <br /> <br /> I was very pleasantly surprised how the show gave the audience the satisfaction of identifying the familiar characters of the genre, but it also gave depth to the characters. Greek life is not just about parties and minor conflicts. Although these things happen in Greek life, they happen in every other social or professional life environment. To call it false to call it an exclusive experience for those in a Greek organization would be wrong. Most of the stories and situations that take place in Greek can and will take place anywhere, in any circle of friends, in sports teams and in real life. But I've seen both episodes and my "little sister", which I'm still very close to, and I've spent both episodes laughing and being reminded of how they really captured the spirit of our college years and our experiences to have. <Br /> <br /> I liked how the second episode showed the characters fighting the other facets of their lives. School, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie tells Rusty that the school comes first and goes to your brothers for help. You can not stay in an organization if you have bad grades. The way Rusty got his assignment to his professor was far-fetched, but it was entertaining. Even the dynamics between Casey and Rusty; It happens, you grow up and whatever your relationship with your siblings was, it changes, so you have to adapt. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Greek is a great show, a great entertainment value and having enough "real life" in it to be believable and definitely worth the time of the beholder.
