An extremely down to earth, well made and acting "Rodeo" Western. No star-drawn stars needed it, because all the characters were normal folks who told a real story about a rodeo robber and his entourage in the West of the 60s and 70s. But especially for Slim Pickens, it's a good idea that I think he has done his unmistakable job, especially given that he was a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he delved deeply into all the "ups and downs" of hard-core rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so often surrounds such a lifestyle. He and Mr. Coburn have partnered very well, not only on the track, but also in the real world outside the alley. Also check out Anne Archer, as Coburns Native American loves the interest in the last part of the movie. Must have been one of her first roles. <br /> <br /> Not as conspicuous as "Junior Bonner", but equally heartbreaking and influential in his portrayal. Many thanks to the Encore Western Channel for showing you this real sands of an undervalued movie from time to time.
