Note: After writing this post, I see that this listing is actually the TV series and not the original movie. My mistake. I thought of IMDb as a database for movies, not television. But as most people will look up this movie under BAGDAD CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which is strangely the name under which this movie is listed on IMDb, I leave that comment here. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something, but when I read the other review, it seemed to be a review of the CBS series - which should be based on this movie. I did not watch the TV series and I like it or not, but I'm sure it's very different from this movie. This movie is not at all like a TV show and Whoopie Goldberg is not there or in any other famous Hollywood scene (except Jack Palance, who was very charming in his role). <br /> <br /> This is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks "out of the box". It's not like a Hollywood movie at all, so why (who's a fancy for idiots?) Decide to market movies or not to market them. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film has captured my heart and my imagination from the beginning. From the music (which is really only a part of the time, so you can not really call it a musical), about the cinematography to the really cool story. <br /> <br /> A German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and rather clumsy) gets into a fight with the other German or Bavarian, with whom she travels with and through the Californian desert - he jumps by car and travels a deserted and desert-like highway starting in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> She finds the small and rundown but charming Bagdad Cafe in Baghdad, California, and checks in. The rest of the story is magic. I do not want to try to describe this movie because I want you to enjoy every surprise. <br /> <br /> Attention: If you are racist or have something against tall women you will not like this movie romantic character is a tall woman and characters of brown and red skin have big roles and are considered part of the mix "included without racism. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 10 for originality and entertainment and pure enjoyment.
