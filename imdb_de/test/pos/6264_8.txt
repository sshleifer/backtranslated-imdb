A nice movie about the coming of the early silent movie to China. SHADOW MAGIC cleverly combines a love story with the drama of the cultural clash between China's ancient traditions and modern Western culture in the form of a film. An amazing first film by Chinese director Ann Hu. When I understood Ms. Hu's remarks at the 2000 Sundance Festival, the film was produced as an American film co-financed by the Chinese government and filmed in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of movies like IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO - not necessarily in theme or plot, but it feels similar.
