In a Morocco completely conquered by Europeans and Americans, the Moroccan leader Mulay Ahmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) abducts the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), her son and daughter at the beginning of the 20th century. His intention is to get money and rifles for her to fight against the corrupt sultan of Moroco (Marc Zuber). In terms of election, US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. Raisuli, however, is betrayed and Eden helps him to be released from prison with the American soldiers. I do not like films about explicit colonialism and lack of respect for the sovereignty of other countries, but "The Lion and the Wind" is indeed a great adventure. The action scenes are very realistic. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American actress of the 70s, is wonderful and leads a kidnapped woman as in the remarkable movie "Soldier Blue" on. As always, Sean Connery is perfect as an honest and nationalist religious leader. Brian Keith is great as an American president. I do not know much about the history of Morocco to analyze if there is any truth in the story, but this movie is a worthwhile conversation. In Brazil it is only available on VHS. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Vento e o Le√£o" ("The Lion and the Wind") <br /> <br />
