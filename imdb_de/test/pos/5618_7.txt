I think Samuel Goldwyn was trying to do two things in this movie. At first, the film pays homage to Jascha Heifetz, who is considered the best violin virtuoso of the past century. Second, after he had brought the Dead End children to the screen with his film of the same title and seen them signing on Warner Brothers, he tried to create a second band of attractive villains. <br /> <br /> Although the film was good, there was certainly no requirement that the children from this film should be retested for another film. <br /> <br /> Leader of the gang is Gene Reynolds, who once played the violin but now leads a street gang of indecent villains. His stepfather, Arthur Hohl, breaks the violin that his late father gave to young Reynolds and threatens to send him to reform school because of the weak protests of his mother, Marjorie Main, led by the old music master Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They pick him up, but they have their financial problems with many creditors, who are led by Porter Hall. <br /> <br /> This film is mostly seen today because it is an opportunity for classical music lovers to see and hear Jascha Heifetz, who is the solution to all problems in collecting. Joel McCrea is also in this film, but has a pretty colorless role as a friend of Andrea Leeds. <br /> <br /> Apart from Heifetz, the film makes a difference, albeit cautiously with child abuse and abused spouses. Arthur Hohl is a common man, and Marjorie Main is clearly a very battered wife. <br /> <br /> The children in the cast are doing well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a young girl by the name of Jacqueline Nash who grew up as Nelson Eddy's nightclub partner Gale Sherwood. She already had a beautiful soprano as a child. <br /> <br /> But it's Heifetz you see the show for.
