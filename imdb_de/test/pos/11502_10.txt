This movie is great. Best acting I have ever seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigurðsson is the best Icelandic actor and of course Hilmir Snær and Bjorn Jörundur. Great music and sound. Cold hard reality about the struggle of a man who has many problems and people in his life. Black humor, paired with great acting and style of European art films, works, it comes together in one of the best Icelandic films ever made. I tell you: "Watch this movie, you will not regret it". I gave him 9 stars. If you see an Icelandic movie in your life ... see this
