I would not necessarily agree with the previous lame comment. I saw that this did not expect too much. The fact is that the cast was outstanding, especially The Lead Teen Female. The dark sides of everyone came through, all confused in an unobvious way. There was an underlying stream that moved through the film of adolescent anxiety and sexuality. The serial killer roll was also played well because you had the feeling what they had been through as children. What this movie is is a powerful drama / thriller. Yes, I agree that they do not do the obvious, but you could identify with the kinky teenagers they did, what they did, and it's believable. Also a decent dark end, in its place could have been opt-out luck so easily. The attention to detail in the movie was also fantastic. I am very good solid 7 out of 10. A bit slow, but lets a thinking person see where the characters come from.
