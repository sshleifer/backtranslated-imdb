Absolutely worth seeing. I saw it on MLK's birthday in 2006 and it impressed me a lot. Sometimes it feels like we are all trapped and condemned to repeat the past no matter how hard we try to change. All we can do is to go on and speak. Just go on. I do not want to be a downer, because that's not the point, but maybe we have to go down before we see how much we have to work on. What happens when the best people like MLK keep telling us what needs to happen to pull us out of our "dead end", but we are not listening. I know some of us are listening, but how can we get the rest of the world to see things as they really are? Just keep going, I think. In this movie, I've thought more about it, so he probably did what he set out to do. That's what I think is a good movie, or a good play, a book, a poem or a speech, or anything: something that makes you think and think in order to move in an active direction instead of being stuck, bored and hopeless.
