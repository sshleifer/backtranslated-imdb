This is a good movie, I will not go into details as the other user comments take good care of it. However, I do not agree with the statement that this is Eastwood's best work. That's just not a very defensible position based on the amount of strong films he directed and played in. I'd like to note that I find it interesting that two of the actresses featured in this film, Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier, never appeared again on another movie or television show, despite good performances. My curiosity makes me wonder what happened to these two actresses.
