Incredibly close to the real-life feelings and feelings that have captured Joseph Mazzello as a hemophilia-born child with AIDS and his new young neighbor, is a strong-willed redneck played to perfection by Brad Renfro. Although the story may seem a bit far-fetched (the two boys try to raft several hundred miles to a doctor who claims to cure AIDS), the emotions, actions, and interactions of all the characters involved are close to real life. As a "big brother" to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after the film's release, I recommend this image to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with AIDS. A great directing by Peter Horton creates the perfect mood and attitude for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions that are affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final separation of two friends who have fought hard against adversity.
