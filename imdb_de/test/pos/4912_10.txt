Attention, contains spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Italian Sleaze movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot has a young woman who is interested in occultism and has supernatural powers. Her mother is a member of the Satanist group and fears what influences she will have on the girl. You do not have to worry, the girl knows exactly what to do, and there is no return, she belongs to Satan. <br /> <During the film strange things happen in a typical Italo way, there is not too much logic, but that's just fine. It's amazing how entertaining these films are. In the last battle we see how she and her mother fight each other (naked Of course you can guess who wins ... The last pictures of the film leave your mouth open and wander, why can not there be more films like this? /> <br /> There's great music all over the movie and the actors are pretty good, better than usual in this kind of movies, especially Anne Heywood looks and looks good, she also has an unusual camera gles and stuff like that So it's not boring at all, my rating is 10. Hopefully someone will release this on DVD.
