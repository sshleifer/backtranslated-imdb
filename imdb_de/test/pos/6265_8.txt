This movie is about so many things. Most obvious is the footing a movie can have on an audience, and how filming life can be a kind of magic. There is also the tense relationship between China and the West as many Chinese (probably rightly) saw the "barbarians" as an attempt to take over and pollute their lifestyle. Liu even tries to preserve her lifestyle in the movie because he sees that one day it will disappear. It is also the internal conflict of Liu between the loyalties and traditions of China against the self-determination philosophy of the West. All these themes are cleverly interwoven by Hu into a cohesive and enjoyable whole. A very nice movie.
