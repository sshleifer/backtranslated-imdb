Best of all, a glossy soap opera follows the careers of four career women, Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Diane Baker, and Martha Hyer, a New York publishing house. The best for some women is not necessarily the best for everyone. <br /> <br /> This group of young mares is led by the wise old mare Joan Crawford, who has been on the screen and in real life a few times. She is home like the boss lady she should have at the time. <br /> <br /> By the time she made the best of everything, Joan Crawford became a widow when her fourth husband Alfred Steele died. It was a particularly traumatic event for her, she woke up one morning and found him in bed next to her. She inherited all of his supplies at Pepsi Cola, where he had the CEO. During the time that The Best of Everything was made, she wrapped up the queen in Pepsi Cola. Life sometimes imitates art. This authority, as she makes dictation and coffee orders to Hope Lange, is really true. <br /> <br /> In fact, all women here, with the exception of Lange, have something bad. It's also crude for Lange, but she literally makes the most of everything. <br /> <br /> What a collection of stinkers are the men in this movie. The best of them, Stephen Boyd, is a heavy drinker. The other Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans and Brett Halsey are such a slimy collection of rodents that were ever collected for a movie. <br /> <br /> I can not forget Brian Aherne, too. Half of this office today would have suits for sexual harassment. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful New York locations in the fifties make the movie a real treat. Catch it by all means.
