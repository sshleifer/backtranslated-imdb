Great, Chris Diamantopoulos must be the best Robim Williams I've ever seen. He plays it perfectly. It was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is. I almost cried when I watched him. <br /> <br /> I had no idea that Robin was as close to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand for itself. Very sad, what both went through. <br /> <br /> I felt very good for Val and Robin in his tough times. I am glad that you have finished it with a high grade! <br /> <br /> I hope Robin puts a $ 100 note in this guy's hat !! <br /> <br /> And it was great that it was filmed Vancouver!
