This film is a perfect example of great escapism! I loved this movie and loved it from the start. Sure, it's just an action movie, but is not it fun to watch movies? <br /> <br /> The cast of this movie is very strong with sympathetic characters. The friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing, it's heartwarming and weird to see a group of teenagers working together - especially this group of boys !! Sean Astin is a great rebel who avoids being a teenager early on. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun, watch this movie! I enjoyed it a lot, although I saw it on a very dirty and old VHS that was terrible quality (Go DVD's!)
