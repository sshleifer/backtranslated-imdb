I love dogs and the most interesting character in this movie is a Golden Retriever. He is smarter, looks better, and more interesting than any human character. Like many other contributors, I did not read the book, but I doubt that would change my mind about the film. It is predictable from the first five minutes. No surprises. Crazy scientists create a monster that breaks loose, and a teenage boy and his miracle prod come together to destroy it. All in all, the movie is a dog. But as I said, I love dogs and will rate this film therefore with 7/10. Take a look at it when it's on TV, rent it when you're bored and nothing else will catch your eye, but do not buy it unless it's special.
