Usually I do not like movies with / about aliens, but K-PAX is different. The actors are great in the movie - especially Kevin Spacey has played his character breathtaking! The film never falls to a lower level - the tension is always in the movie and you really want to know how it ends, what's with Prot ... You have to think a lot about the movie after the movie, because there are some unanswered questions .. Robert Porter is Prot or Prot only with Robert Porter's body as a means of transport. How can he see UV light and how can he know so much about astrology? But everyone can find their own end and decide what they want to believe. Very good movie with a great Kevin Spacey!
