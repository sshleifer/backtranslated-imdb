I am amazed that so many viewers have not found all the symbolism in the movie ... that made the movie an incredible piece of art! The story is about the saddest content a movie could contain, yet it's one of the best movies I've ever seen because you need your own imagination and brilliance in the plot. If you pay close attention, the message is there , The younger brother is killed by the stepfather. The older brother invented the story about the flying car to cope with his brother's pain. There are those who argue why he would lie to his own children with the story. For me the answer is that he does not want to share this ugliness with his own children or that he has blocked it and has replaced his memory of the terrible event with the thought that his brother is flying to safety. I've read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered. Even if this is an interesting idea - I love the imagination with which it was created. I do not think he lied to his own children because he had a little brother. But I find it plausible that he lied about the death of his little brother. However, I like this idea of ​​an end much better than the idea that the film had no symbolism whatsoever. <br /> <br /> There are many different attitudes that you can have for the movie, but if you take the movie on par ..... two brothers who build a cart that escapes an abusive stepfather - you have missed the shine. The fact that I could see the subtle messages in the script made the movie so incredible for me. It requires your own thought process and your imagination for it to work. You'll be astonished how awesome the movie is. The only other movie I've seen so close in symbolism and subtle messages is Pleasantville ... but that's a comment for another movie!
