I saw this movie with my family over a long Thanksgiving weekend. I'm thankful that someone insisted that we see him, even though I did not pay much attention until the end of the film, when a pair of scissors seemed promised but unfortunately did not happen. On the other hand, I saw this movie a few years later loved the vibrancy, absurdity, the sparkle and just fun. I think the movie has a feminine tone. Women are not exploited in this, even if I am sure that someone considers the film to be pure exploitation. I think the movie plays with the tropics of that time. <br /> <br /> I always think someone should make it new. And to work out some of the implications in the original.
