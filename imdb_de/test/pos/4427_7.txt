Video Vault By Shawn K. Inlow My Architect: The Journey of a Son 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn Not rated: 116 minutes Vault rating: 7 <br /> <br /> What a matter of being fatherless. "My Architect: The Journey of a Son" follows Philadelphia filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn as he desperately looks for answers from his father, the renowned architect Louis I. Kahn, who has died in the last 30 years. Louis Kahn died at a train station in 1974, leaving behind more than one family. The funeral, when the filmmaker was only a boy, was, as we should say, an unpleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> We find out that Nathaniel only knew his father from his sporadic visits with his mother. We are told that he loved very much. This film is about a boy who is looking for his father and maybe even while visiting his work, as if the great structures contain a secret. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn was a gifted architect, but "architect" is a cold word. The man was a large-scale sculptor who spoke in an airy way about silence and art about his craft. His remarkable works, which are lovingly explored in the film, include the Salk Institute (1965), The Kimball Art Museum (1972) and the monumental Capitol Complex in Bangladesh (1983). The part of the film that Nathaniel Dhaka, Bangladesh visited for the first time, finds the work, but not the man. <br /> <br /> The film benefits from the fact that it has a lot of material from the very public man who has worked in New York City and as a professor at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. Many of Khan's contemporaries and co-workers are also helping to expand the filmmaker's ghost father. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the viewer does not seem to be particularly satisfying. The answers Nathaniel Khan seeks seem hollow. Not good enough. <br /> <br /> In scenes where the director meets his half-sisters, who come from different mothers, you can feel the tensions of the years, the lightness and the pain. You might expect them to get angry, but only the camera saves them from hostilities. Each of these children has visibly lost something. <br /> <br /> It can be pointed out that Khan, who seemed to be a driven perfectionist, never became rich. Instead, he became notable. It was like sacrificing his family for his art. This is a very sad and great thing. <br /> <br /> April 28, 2005
