Although little Dieter is not as entertaining as some of Herzog's works, he is another good movie about one of the greatest movie artists in the world. In keeping with Herzog's usual themes, Little Dieter is a fascinating and uplifting study of a brave man and his endeavors to live on after a life-changing traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Dieter Dengler wanted to fly at a young age, and the Vietnam War offered him this opportunity, but instead of spending the war in a cockpit, he spent most of his time as a POW. Dieter tells most of the story eloquently and passionately, occasionally with the help of Duke. Herzog makes very little voice at this time, but delivers a lot of subtly powerful soundscaping effects and visuals - which is no surprise to those who are familiar with him. Dengler is a fascinating and extremely personable person. As a man and as alive as they come, I found the story of his life and his irreproachably optimistic personality inspiring. Thanks to Herzog for introducing us (again). <br /> <br /> The scale of the movie is not that big and the drama is not as heavy as in many early films that have made the Duke a force, but I recommend it to his fans and documentaries. It is a very interesting and well executed movie.
