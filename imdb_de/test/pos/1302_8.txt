It's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not lead the squeamish man, this has solid behavior from both the male and female lead roles, and although the story is a bit long and a little cliche, you can not help but like br /> <br /> I think the story was a bit rushed in the end, but an expansion would have made the story even longer. Consider other romantic comedies like 100 days with Mr. Arrogant and possibly with my friend the teacher. <br /> <br /> There would be an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as great as My naughty girl, but still good.
