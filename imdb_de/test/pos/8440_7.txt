The thirty years that have passed since the film's inception have lessened the tension a bit and will not make the audience as attentive as I certainly did in 1979. However, it is still entertaining enough - and gains some strength. It finds its sad relevance today (see the history of the FirstEnergy Davis-Besse nuclear power plant). With the best actors and steady pace, you can learn to overlook the dated 1970s environment and see it for the political critique it is. However, I doubt that it will survive the test of time. Thanks to its cast, it may not be forgotten, but dialogues, settings and scores make a remake of this film inevitable. With the oil situation now comparable to the situation in the 1970s and alternative energy sources becoming a hot topic again, we can only hope that the current generation will receive blockbuster warnings about the risks of (privatized) nuclear power like this one.
