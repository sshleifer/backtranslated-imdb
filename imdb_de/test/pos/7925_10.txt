I searched for this movie after reading Tom Clancy's novel Red Storm Rising. Timeless masterpiece about the Russians of the 13th century, which were occupied by the Germans. The film was shot in 1938 under the command of Joseph Stalin to warn the Soviets against Hitler and Germany. Battle scenes are wonderfully done and show that you do not need computer animation to create a great fighting scene. Probably the greatest work of Sergei Eisenstein. See also 'Battleship Potemkin'. Any history buffs or poli-sci-major should watch this movie. 10 out of 10.
