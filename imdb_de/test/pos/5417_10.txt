This short film was nominated for an Oscar, losing Anna and Bella. Not since Doctor Strangelove was the nuclear war so funny! Condie takes a situation, turns it off at the ear and gives it for a good measure. There are many visual gags in Condie's work, and I always see something that I've missed at every sight.
