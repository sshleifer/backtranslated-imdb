I found this movie pretty brilliant. Initially, I wanted to delete a "When animals attack" for "Frankenfisch" or even "Rogue", but it was delivered a really cruel ordeal that was not human. After being in the area, this was done (including the Croc Farm at the beginning of the film and even the same guide!). This added to the anxiety factor. These crocs are really all over there, though I do not think they had the "attitude" of this animal. Yes, there were some melodramatic moments, but they distracted some of the overall atmosphere. I really cared about the characters and shuddered while thinking about "What would I do?" Not knowing where your enemy was lurking or the crocodile that crashed at night was really scary. I would argue that this streak is one of the best horrors I've seen in years (just before relegation). I give four alligator handbags.
