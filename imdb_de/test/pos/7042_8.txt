When I was younger, this movie was always aired Friday afternoon on Channel 40 (this was the time Fox was a network and programming). I was always looking forward to it. I would go shopping with my parents and then enjoy my Swanson's TV Dinner and a Lady Lee Cola (the only time of the week I was allowed to drink Coke.) Of course the script is expected in the late 70s.) Little Darlings) but it's a fun movie and I loved Rudy and Tripper. Bill Murray kisses with little effort in the movie, but he's adorable. Pretty much the same character he played in "My Bodyguard," but he does it so well.
