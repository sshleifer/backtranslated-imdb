Alone the entrance fee for the rock-off worth !! Every D-fan will love this movie (albeit a bit short) and Cameos by John C Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (almost recognizable) prove that D-Rock is enough for everyone , Even Dio ... The Sasquatch / Mushroom scene is becoming an instant classic (I do not want to say anymore and be accused of using spoilers here). Fans of the original HBO series will see a few nods to the D's early appearances on screen in characters like Lee and the Open Mic host. I just wish they had played some of the songs from the first album, and the omission of 'the government totally sucks' from the POD album is a pity too. Otherwise, this movie rocks. Obey the D!
