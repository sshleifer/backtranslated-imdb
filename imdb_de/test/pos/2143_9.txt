I first saw this movie in 1980 when it was released. From other sources, I learned that the only release of the 219-minute cut was in New York City. After that, the movie was shortened to 149 minutes. I think I first saw the shorter version, which at the time I thought it was a very interesting anti-Western, though a bit confusing ... <br /> <br /> Well, it was with even more interest that I finally got a DVD in full length. I am glad that I did, because this second consideration has confirmed to me that the film is a true classic and that the critical joke cast at Michael Cimino was at least unjustifiable. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's a long movie, but many others too. For example: Once upon a time in America (1984), it was 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; Spartacus {restored version} (1960), 198 minutes; Gone with the Wind (1939) at 222 minutes and others. So it can not be the fact of runtime that so much foaming occurred when Heaven's Gate stepped on the map. <br /> <br /> But note that all these films have everything with their myths about history and heroes. Not so the heavenly gate: In this narrative, the American West is portrayed in all its grim and unyielding harshness, injustice and poverty. This is probably the first reason why so many did not like this film: He set out the circumstances of the Johnson County War of 1892 in Wyoming and showed how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 murderers to a large group of accused European immigrants to hunt and murder cattle rustling; all with the support and consent of the authorities, including the President of the United States. For an essay on this war, with the background and the events, there is a link at Wikipedia under Johnson County War. Very few may be reminded of the really dirty times in the history of their country, and which are flying toward the face of what the country is supposed to be. If it had been a documentary, it would have been barely tasty for most; for entertainment it was almost imperative to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and the unremarkable. <br /> <br /> Aside from the socio-political debate for a moment that Cimino launched here, what about the narrative? ?? the story of the three main characters? Well, it probably was not uncommon for men to fall on a local prostitute at the time, just as it is probably not unusual now. It's a pretty normal love triangle where Ella has to choose between the two men and ultimately chooses the younger man Nathan, who, although he does not pull out about cold-blooded murder, if he pleases, shows more spirit and commitment than the older one James (or Jim, as most people in the movie say). For some, this part of the story may be too slow; However, in the context of the wider story of the war, it is in my opinion quite appropriate. <br /> <br /> And this war is depicted graphically, cruelly and cruelly, with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly ?? However, in the last massacre between the Association and the immigrants, I am sure that some scenes of carriages will be repeated. An insignificant point that may have been raised when the 219-minute cut was restored? However you look at it, it hits you in the face with the noise, the dust, the chaos and the confusion of the war ... <br /> <br /> Which brings me to another criticism of the others: the noise and It is often difficult for the dust to hear the dialogue and even to see clearly what happens. I admit that at first I found that annoying and even rewound to play parts to capture the image or the words? until I realized that this was really not necessary, if you accept the director's intention: life is chaotic, it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations, and in war it is the indispensable prerequisite of this production. In short, it's like being really present in and within the scenes ... <br /> <br /> And what about the title? From Shakespeare this refers to a figurative proximity to God. So, if you equate God with the natural world, the breathtaking scenery that permeates the film? and it's breathtaking, tantalizing to David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965)? is a useful metaphor. However, I tend to think that Cimino had something more to say, namely the idea that the brave immigrants ?? the godly salt of the earth? He was denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life in the land that champions the champion of freedom. <br /> <br /> Was this Ciminos intention? to undermine the myth of the American West? To show how in America only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred in one way or another throughout history? Is that something new? Not really, as we all know. Where it really hurts is to show how America was not and is not the land of the free and the home of the brave. Instead, after we have absorbed that narrative, we have the impression that the foundations of America are more like a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for boys.
