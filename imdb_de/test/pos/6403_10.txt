Although idealized and fictionalized, this series has the peculiarity, sultry, and warmth that comes from living on an island. <br /> <br /> I've been living in a secluded part of Hawaii for a few years and found some funny, whimsical and funny people in remote (not touristy) areas. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the repeats of this series, I lovingly compare my memories of experiences in The Other Parts of Hawaii with the memories depicted and invented in Key West. <br /> <br /> This series is not a reality TV. I hate reality television. <br /> <br /> It's from a time when people are still writing creative TV programs. Give me a "young writer" who gets inspired every day by the "angels in the spray, wizards in the palms and elves in the shells".
