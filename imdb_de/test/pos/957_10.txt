I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie. I'm sure you know that "Malcolm's in the Middle" star Frankie Muniz and the ever so cute Amanda Bynes "The Amanda Show" starred in this children's comedy starring two friends. The film is about a boy Jason Shepard (Frankie) and his friend Kaylee (Amanda), who is going on an adventure in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> As it begins, Jason is a typical 14-year-old boy who lies to avoid the problems of everyday life. One day Jason is hit by Mr. Wolf (the big bad director). Jason's English newspaper is stolen by Wolf and starts the adventure with Kaylee to regain his father's trust. They fly to Hollywood looking for Wolf to bring him back. Frankie and Amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get Wolf back, and all he has to do is call Jason's dad and tell him he stole his idea. But the end is not really a surprise, because they are good prizes and profits. <br /> <br /> The story is cute and fifth grade, but what do you expect as a PG? I really think that this is one of the best family comedies of the year. The kids are not only great, extraordinary casting, well written, but also fun to clean. It made me laugh and fell in love with his innocent message. I highly recommend it and would not agree with the one who gave it a zero out of ten. The unemployed critic is not for nothing unemployed. I give it (well, I've chosen ten out of ten) perfect.
