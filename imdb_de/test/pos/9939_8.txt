I finally managed to get a copy of Dario Argento's opera, and I tell you ... that was time !! It was the last Argento movie I've ever seen, and I'm a fan of most of his work. I think most of his work is extremely important to the genre of horror, but some of his films tend to disappoint (like phenomena). But the action idea of ​​Opera has always appealed to me and it turned out that I was right !! I enjoyed every recording in Opera and was fascinated by this movie from the first to the last minute. Of all the Argento films, Opera has come straight to the top and I hope I can encourage as many people as possible to watch this movie as well. <br /> <br /> Opera's script and plot is pretty simple. Especially compared to Argentos previous film Phenomena, which had too many ideas and ultimately was a mess. The action of Opera is scary and daunting, but at the same time an excellent satirical commentary - almost a parody - against opponents of explicit violence. *** SPOILERS *** A young opera singer (the beautiful Cristina Marsillach) is being persecuted by a terribly sadistic murderer. In every massacre he commits, he forces Betty to watch his actions with his eyes wide open. Needles are attached to her eyelids, and when she closes them, they are torn apart. *** End spoiler ***. To this simple but effective idea, Argento adds many terrible elements, such as Raven, the classic piece (and curse) of MacBeth, and the overall atmospheric location of the Opera House and the music. Especially the presence of the scary ravens is of special value. Ancient masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew that these black birds have many secrets around them, and Dario Argento knows it too. <br /> <br /> Violence and Gore are shown very well in Opera and that makes them a real Argento image. In my opinion, with Profondo Rosso as a close second. I hope that I can recommend this movie to many people among you. Especially for fans of the (Italian) horror business this is an absolute must! Favorite scene "Rewind": Argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where Betty's girlfriend is shot in the eye as she tries to see who's at the door.
