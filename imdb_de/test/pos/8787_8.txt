You can not help but wonder about Hitchcock's early work. "Saboteur," for example, is so smooth and fast that it's hard to imagine that he shot this movie over 60 years ago. There are some propaganda elements, but they are so well worked up in the puzzle that the thing plays nicely years later. You'll also get some previews of things that Hitchcock would later do, such as using a national landmark as a background. This time it is the Statue of Liberty. Of course, in "North by Northwest" Mt. Rushmore You will also recognize things that later appear in "Rear Window" and "Vertigo" in "Saboteur", but do not betray the show. Robert Cummings is excellent, as is the oh-so-charming Otto Kruger. Look for Hitchcock's mini western in this one. It happens fast, so do not blink.
