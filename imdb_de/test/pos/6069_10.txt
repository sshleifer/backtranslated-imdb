I opted for "The English Patient" for additional loan allocation. I thought this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, it has become one of my favorites. It shows life in World War II pretty well and the love story is amazing. The love story made the movie so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling, out of passion or something. I wanted to watch the movie over and over again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are amazing actors and the way they play their characters is amazing. The look was wonderful together and actually seemed to be in love. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie that can be viewed as a leisure activity or a task.
