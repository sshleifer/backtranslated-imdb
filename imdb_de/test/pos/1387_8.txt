Okay, I'll just disagree with the earlier comments that have criticized this show. I think this show is great. (I mean, when Jasmin Weber was still on and Franzi was still alive, so addicted!). And I was surprised to learn that this was classified as soap because it just does not look like soaps in America. Soaps here are absolutely terrible! At least GZSZ is filming locally, offering real music and more plausible storylines. In addition, the spectacle on GZSZ is quite credible, especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff. (In addition, soap actors are among the hardest workers in the industry because they have the most demanding work schedules). If the ratings are so high, something must be done right. Soaps in America are shown during the day and historically have always had the lowest ratings. Give GZSZ a chance! Trust me, it's good!
