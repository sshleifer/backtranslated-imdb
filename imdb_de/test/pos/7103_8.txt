House of Dracula was created towards the end of Universal's horror cycle in the 1940s, and I've seen this a few times. <br /> <br /> Edelman grows plants to heal a serum that heals people. Count Dracula comes for a cure for his vampirism and Lawrence Talbot comes to see if he can stop him from turning into a werewolf at full moon. Frankenstein's monster is discovered and Edelman brings him back to life as the villagers descend to the castle and set fire to it. Talbot, now healed and one of Edelman's assistants, is safe. <br /> <br /> Like many of these films, we have a hunchback assistant and a thunderstorm to keep it moving. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Universal Horror regulars Lon Chaney Jr (The Wolfman), John Carradine (House Frankenstein) and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's Monster. With Onslow Stevens (Them!), Lionel Atwill (The Vampire Bat) and Martha O'Driscoll. The House of Dracula is a must for all the old horror fans. Have fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 of 5 stars.
