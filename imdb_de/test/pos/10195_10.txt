The combination of amazing special effects and Oscar-worthy action makes the Vindicator one of the most important science fiction films of recent years. For some unknown reason, this jewel was found in a bargain basket, so a worthless man thought it was right to pollute a modern classic by turning into a bargain basket. I've never been so scared of a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire. Forget about Terminator, Robocop, Aliens, and other movies that have demolished this masterpiece in no time. The defender is an unstoppable force.
