The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, who runs a boarding house and provides tireless support to a young boy, the narrator of the film, Ruben. Based on the experiences of writer and actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the New York boardinghouse in the hinterland and recalls the cultural climate of a 1960s world transition. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is practically non-stop music. The second half addresses the different characters in the boarding school. Nanny's ability to "take fragments and make them complete" affects everyone in their field. A particularly vibrant scene is when she confronts an abusive husband and emphatically tells him, "If you ever touch that child again, we'll dance!" As delivered by the actress S. Epatha Merkerson, this line is so stiff and determined that the husband with the hair driveline freezes in his tracks. <br /> <br /> Merkerson has an outstanding presence from start to finish. Her character connects the unequal life of the boundaries in her home. This was a touching, heartfelt movie with a wonderful cast. As played by Merkerson, the character of Nanny simply radiates love. This is a movie experience that I will remember for a long time.
