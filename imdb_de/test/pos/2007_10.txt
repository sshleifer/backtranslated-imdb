Drawn by Pain is one of the best cinemas I have ever seen. Here are my reviews of the previously released episodes: <br /> <br /> Episode one was even better than I expected, and from everything I heard about it, I expected a lot. I'm really impressed by the actors. The father was scary and played perfect. The little girl is so expressive that she conveys such an emotion with her eyes. The animation was excellent. The cinematography was amazing, every camera angle captures the feeling of the scene perfectly. The editing was so good that each scene blends seamlessly into the next one. The music captured the emotions very well and pulled you into the story. I can not say enough how wonderful this episode was. It definitely makes me hungry for more! <br /> <br /> Episode 2 was even better than the first! Everything I've said about the first episode works, only you see more character development. I can not wait to see Episode 3 or the rest of the show. What's developing is a captivating action driven by characters, with all the peculiarities of a major Hollywood production, but without the pretension. So much is said with so few words. This series is something you've never seen before to become a real success. <br /> <br /> This episode was FREAKING AWESOME! No other words describe it! IMPRESSIVE! Everything I said about the previous episodes applies to them, and yet it was even better! I do not know how you manage to do something amazing and make it even better! The further character development proves that this is a completely character driven piece. Cinematography, as always, excels in Emily's pain, fear, hate, and emotional roller coaster ride. I can not wait to see Episode 4 ... or the rest of the show. They really excelled! <br /> <br /> As much as I loved the other episodes, Episode 4 is the best there has ever been. I love the character development. I feel as if we really get to know Emily, her pain and her inner struggle. The other topics I mentioned in previous reviews will continue. GREAT Cinematography, the writing is outstanding, the performers are right with their depictions and have made the characters their own, and the animation is just amazing! Another great job from the DbP crew!
