For those of you who like stand-up comedians, you must have heard of George Carlin. He's really one of the best living comedians so you need to get to know him. <br /> <br /> But he's already died, God rest him in peace. Or hell He did not believe too much in religion, so he might as well choose hell for eternity. HAHA, just kidding, do not take it seriously! <br /> <br /> It's bad for you !! It's one of George Carlin's latest works before he died - <br /> <br /> I, one of his best works, a must for every fan and almost a joke of George Carlin. It's not a best of ... but it's really amusing. <br /> <br /> It has less political and religious jokes. It's just a great time! <br /> <br /> The editing is very good. It's not a concert, so there should be no quick settings ... The slow fading to other shots was well done. Fading is the best option for editing!
