I saw the movie at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (world premiere). <br /> <br /> A haunting, intimate portrait of loneliness and the effects of it growing and transforming into something darker. <br /> <br /> The show of the two leads (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent and makes you wish that you had met these characters before they got so damaged. <br /> <br /> Reminiscent of the theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where I am calling). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and enhances moments in the movie without making you aware of yourself. <Br /> <br /> Highly recommend the movie and the soundtrack.
