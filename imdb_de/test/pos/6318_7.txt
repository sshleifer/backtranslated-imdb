One of the most important quotes from the entire film is halfway spoken by the protagonist Titta Di Girolamo, the middle man of the mafia, a middle-aged, physically unprotected man, who originally came from Salerno in southern Italy. When we met him at the beginning of the film, he has lived for ten years in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland. He runs a business that we only get to know bit by bit. While this crucial but seemingly inconspicuous scene is taking place, employees of the Swiss bank, who usually count Di Girolamo's money, say that $ 10,000 is missing in his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. In the news, he threatens quietly, but icy his persuasive bank manager to close his account. Meanwhile, he tells us, the audience, that you have to bluff to bluffing to the end, without fear of being caught or acting ridiculous. He says: You can not bluff for a while and then tell the truth halfway. Having done this - half bluffing and clarifying the truth and accepting the consequences of life and ultimately love - is precisely the reason for the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's problems. <br /> <br /> This initially disagreeable character, a sinister, silent man, just before 50, a man who will not even kindly answer maids and waitresses who say goodbye, will someday be somebody, that of the onlooker cares very much. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to worry about being "ridiculous." The first half of the movie is sometimes referred to as "slow". It actually shows the days and nights of Di Girolamo at this hotel in a strangely separate, deliberate pace that reveals seemingly banal and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may seem unnecessary show how important they are as this masterfully engineered and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the disagreeable character that you love unexpectedly and love for the feeling when you least thought - is also enhanced by elegantly edited sequences and a very interesting use of music Particularly noteworthy is the theme of the Scottish band Boards of Canada). <br /> <br /> Never was the contrast between Hollywood and Italy, with which Mobster has more conflict than since the release of films like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way the film exploited the protagonist's insomnia. Unlike The Machinist (and in a much more explicit way, the Al Pacino film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional discomfort that has fallen so deep into the darkness of the unconscious that it almost impossible is its cause (if there is one). <br /> <br /> The young and likable hotelkeeper Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, granddaughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man he has not seen in 20 years Give a tiny window to life, which Titta finally (albeit tentatively) accepts to look through again. Although this is never explicitly described, the viewer KNOWS that accepting the consequences of love for a man like Titta will have unimaginable consequences. Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a film without a scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its time and does not admit the spectator's expectations. He is an outstanding representative of this small, quiet, discreet renaissance that takes place in this area. Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà in the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita è Bella films ... and refrain from exploring fine creations such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, world.
