Biodoc on the enigmatic singer / songwriter who, according to his friends, apparently spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life on a mission of self-destruction. He died of overweight at the age of 52 and dissipated from heart disease, after having been in alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and cocaine almost incessantly, bubbling parties, and a blatant abuse of his vocal instrument (he confided to a friend calling his lyrics at one Performance with such a force that spilled blood remained on the microphone. <br /> <br /> All this despite the fact that he: (1) widely considered the most talented pop singing ability of his generation; (2) after years Efforts to gain recognition for the industry - a Grammy, an Oscar, a decent record deal with a top label and at least two outstanding albums - 'Nilsson Schmilsson' (originals) and 'A Little Touch of Schmilsson at Night' (Standards and (3) married very happily (for the third time), with a handsome young family whom he seemed to love lms begin with the integrity of Nilsson's life presentation, including good use archive footage and many stills from Nilsson; The editors who do the stills are doing particularly well. We hear about his close relationship with John Lennon and later with Ringo Starr (Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician). <br /> <br /> Even more impressive are the talking heads, often the weakest aspect of the documentary. Here we get people like Perry Botkin Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams, who all tell amazing stories about Nilsson. many terribly funny, others deeply miserable - and anyone who gives him his deep affection. Equally informative and moving are the interview segments with Nilsson's women? Annie and Una, his son Zach and cousin Doug Hoefer. The best set of minds that I can remember in a Biodoc. <br /> <br /> The film's biggest flaw is that it supplanted Nilsson's music. Even the performance of his biggest hit "Without You" is interrupted after about 8 bars. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for that, not provided that the movie runs for two full hours. Lose a few head shots and we could at least have heard this song, and maybe one or two more, like "One" or his Oscar winner cover of "Everybody's Talking". The filmmakers are simply too keen to nilsson's psychological instrument to plumb mysticism and not to pay attention to his music. My grades: 7.5 / 10 (low B +) (seen on the NWFC Reel Music series, 01/07/07)
