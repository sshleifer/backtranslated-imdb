My two daughters (11 and 13 years old) and I were fortunate enough to see a movie show last night. We were all positively surprised at how entertaining and funny this movie was. David Duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and Minnie Driver performed their normally competent performance. Some of the scenes are funny funny - especially a scene that Minnie Driver made with a colleague "Transplant". I liked the fact that it was a movie that I could see with my kids, and I was not embarrassed by any scene. Everyone in the cinema laughed and enjoyed themselves. Thumbs up Bonnie Hunt!
