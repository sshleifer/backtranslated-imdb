Anyone who has ever seen Ali G should be well prepared for the full movie "Ali G Indahouse". <br /> <br /> Although I prefer to prefer Ali G when interviewing the rich and famous, his brand completely off-the-wall comedy definitely also entertains on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous storyline, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script that makes this film a revolt for fans of Ali G. <br /> <br /> If you've seen him and you did not like him then avoid this movie like the plague, because it's definitely more of it. for everyone else - look at Aiiii! 10.7
