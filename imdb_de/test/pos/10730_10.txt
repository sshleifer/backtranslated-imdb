When I saw this movie on HBO, I was a bit unpredictable in following the plot, but I notice it when I see Dustin Hoffman in it. Honestly, I'm not thrilled to watch old movies, but then my point of view changes in the long run. When I saw this riveting film, I had to lie on my seat again, unaware that my tears were suddenly rolling over my cheek, and then I let out a deep sigh as I realized what I just experienced , works. Kramer vs Kramer was indeed one of the best classic drama films I've seen in a long time, that even I myself could not imagine how it touched me. The story was very emotional, but not saturated. The characters were not unrealistic for their roles; They have qualities that make the viewer to every position in the film, such as the role of Meryl Streep. She was a mother who honestly admitted her mistakes in the past, but then she is confident that she will maintain her emotional motives to get what she wants in a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was far too outstanding, I can not even guess how this guy could seriously play difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role that is completely different and then performed well. Even though I've seen the movies many times before, when I sit back and rest at my house and scan valuable films to gain time and take a look, it will be another rewarding moment for me, a look at Kramer to throw against Kramer.
