Mike Nichols in the finest form. I was not a fan of "Closer", so it's refreshing to see him again with this comedy that plays in the darkest of circumstances. Only a single tone could have ruined this captivating image, but Nichols and his very strong a-list cast have made no mistake in this biography of a deeply flawed, but absolutely captivating congressman. Philip Seymour Hoffman as usual is sparkling and brilliant - here plays a damaged, but ultra-intelligent CIA manipulator, and in the exchange between Hanks and Hoffman's characters, the comedy rises. Seldom is film humor loud and also smart ... This always comes up with a snappy satirical edge that makes you laugh about the state of the world (often at the same time) and make you cry. <br /> <br /> Another big plus is the length of the image. The film is based on George Crile's fat book of the same title. The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim to fame is "The West Wing") must be a fat movie, but what we're getting is a stunning 90-minute grand story with far-reaching implications. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen and acknowledged because it finds an extraordinary balance between the darkest object and the ease of touching its sparkling, witty writing - even if it has the obvious connection between the help of this Breaking Herings and Delivering Wilson and the Ultimate Consequences (9/11).
