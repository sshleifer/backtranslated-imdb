My mom always told me to sit down and really see this movie because he's one of her favorites. I did not do it for years until I caught a night on TV. This movie was great, I do not even know how to explain it. The cast is not only outstanding (Julia Roberts, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt), but also the story is great. It's freaky, but not too scary and makes you think. I was speechless after this film and amazed at how good actors and actresses really are all five of these people. Where did William Baldwin go, he is great. This movie is a must for anyone, if you have not rented it, you will not regret it. Amazing!
