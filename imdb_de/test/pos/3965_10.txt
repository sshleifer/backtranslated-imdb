If I had seen this movie when I reached rock bottom, I would probably have plunged into the deepest depression of my life and might have been almost desperate enough to give it a try. The only thing is in the real world, when you are robbing millions of dollars from unsuspecting individuals does not get anything on the table (unless you are an investment banker or government-affiliated government). So how is that important? I was rejected from school after school, and it's on fire, and it's a brilliant subject for a movie. If you give yourself to the imaginary to watch this movie without real impact on the world, this can really affect someone, and let them know that they are not alone. The exaggerated soliloquy tears apart the established education system as we know it. All I can say is that I'm in school now, looking back where I was, and when I watch this movie, I really appreciate it in a way I would never have been able to do otherwise. It's youthful and contrite, but it's an emotional and uplifting fantasy about freedom, and I can not think of a better way to end my night.
