British director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America and is known for making films both popular and critically acclaimed. But in this little movie he started. And it certainly represented his talent, with his striking black and white cinematography and a chronological narrative that anticipates his later "Momento" in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanistically, the action reminded me of David Mamet's 'House of Games', but the film still feels fresh and sharp, except for the final twist of the end, whose taste was expected, but whose top is unexpectedly delicious. Acting, on the other hand, is not quite in the same class - the film has a stylized quality and possibly even more than the director intended. But it's still a nice debut, claustrophobic and beguiling at the same time.
