Focus is another great movie with William H. Macy. I first spotted Macy in Fargo and saw some of his films, and he has not fooled me yet. Macy is the archetype of "nice guy with something to hide". In focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a loyal and hard-working man who houses his disabled mother at home. The scene takes place after the Second World War at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the Human Resources Director of a company that is basically anti-Semitic. After he accidentally hires a woman of Jewish descent, he is asked to buy glasses to improve his eyesight. Unbelievable, the simple purchase of glasses has a big impact on his life and that of Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by a great Laura Dern). The moment the film develops, Newman will see a completely different world in which to be Jewish is like an animal. <br /> <br /> The film is disturbing in the way racism was something quite normal. The scary thought is that in some places it's probably still like this.
