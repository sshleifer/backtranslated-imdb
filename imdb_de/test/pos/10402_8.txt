A documentary filmmaker explores seemingly incoherent paranormal incidents linked to the legend of an ancient demon named Kagutaba. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like one of those camcorder movies that they were popular In the last few months, even one that will be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY) will be released! Unlike movies like CLOVERFIELD, REC, and BLAIR WITCH, where most of these films are in chaos and chaos with all the shaking, this is essentially shown in a traditional documentary style. There are TV clips and interviews, and the fear is very subtle, well, except for the last 20 minutes when we get into the chaos effect and where the anxiety factor is greatly increased. <br /> <br /> And it works. The film is very captivating and makes you think. Yes, you heard me right: it makes you think. You need to pay attention to these unrelated details that are given throughout the movie, and the payoff is great if those things intertwine in the course of the movie. The movie also moves very slowly, which is a good thing in this case. We as an audience can absorb the details on screen, no matter how subtle or blatant they are. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a scary little movie. I am a person who is afraid of ghosts and in front of the paranormal more than murderers who smash teenage victims. There are some pictures here that are really annoying to look at, including one that comes closer in the end where you set off: "What am I looking at ?!" Well, it is better left unanswered. There are about ten recurrent characters, all of whom displayed authentic achievements in their roles. <br /> <br /> The only thing I do not like about this movie is the end because most questions go unanswered. The question "is that it?" went through my head. It left a bad taste in my mouth. The rest of the movie is captivating and really scary. Do not see it alone in the dark, because you will regret this decision. I can also see in a few years that Hollywood would make this film new. That will be interesting.
