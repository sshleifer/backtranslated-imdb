Man, it's great to see only Young and The Restless star Melody Thomas Scott as something other than elusive Nikki Newman! A doctor with a brain no less! And super nice to see her with people like the great Lorenzo Lamas instead of Victor Newman! Mel plays a college professor of microbiology, who goes to the islands with her son for the spring break, only to find a prisoner on the island, which is infected by a rapidly spreading virus. Practical for her is the hunky figure played by Lorenzo, who has a daughter that matches her son's age. Mel shines, as does Lorenzo a little bit from the overreaction of the younger couple. Interesting premise in times of chemical and biological terrorism talk. Worth seeing, especially for Y & R fans.
