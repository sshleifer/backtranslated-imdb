Terry and June were in my opinion one of the classic British sitcoms. You knew what to expect - and that's not exactly typical! :) Unlike modern sitcoms with well thought out plots, this show is still a breath of fresh air. How nice to see or hear any remarks about physical functions or to see a family PERPETUAL for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers too late. And that's the secret: Terry & June was based on a middle-class couple who lived in relative harmony with today's tense conspiracies with the "de rigueur" dysfunctional family (supposed to look hip). Personally, I choose the "Bridge to Far" episode as one of the best. In a way, Terry's antics are reminiscent of Basil Fawlty - both sometimes become almost impossible to embarrass! <br /> <br /> Terry & June are highly recommended. Have your tea and biscuits ready!
