Travis (James Franco) is a young man traveling by train for business reasons (we expect him to leave his beloved phone behind). It is picked up by a prostitute, Terri (Rachel Miner), and when he goes to her city to pick up, there are a number of events that will surely stay with him forever. Both characters have barriers that they have built to defend themselves from communication. But despite their facades, it's obvious they both want to break them down. There are a total of about 30 spoken lines, but the way James Franco and Rachel Miner use their faces, you can turn off the volume as well. Words are unnecessary. One scene you should watch out for is Terri staring at herself in the mirror. You can just feel her desperation pervading the room. <br /> <br /> But the movie is not perfect. It is mostly taken with handheld cameras, which is a bit distracting. Mainly due to the acting of Mr. Franco and Miner and photography, the shortcomings of the script are not noticeable. But sometimes it seems that history does not really know where to go. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the kind of movie that really lasts long after you have seen it. An hour after you've seen it, you're still something for when for certain characters. It is not immaculate, but you still want more and wish it was at least 4x that long.
