How do you know if a movie is good or not? It's the impact it has on you that makes the difference. "Dead Man Walking" got me very excited. I saw it twice. I do not know if I'll be strong enough to see it again. No, I did not feel good after watching, but the movie was as successful as it can be. Robbins has been very good at including all aspects of this controversial topic. He avoided presenting an argument that could easily be considered biased or subjective. I hope many people see "Dead Man Walking". I believe that anyone who enthusiastically supports or rejects the death penalty should see it. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else it takes to convince everyone that this ancient relic has no place in modern society anymore. <br /> <br /> The film itself makes no argument for or against the death penalty. It describes the reality. Reality is the best argument against the death penalty. <br /> <br /> A 10/10 for great performances, good filmmaking and the most important movie of the years. <br /> <br /> Thank you. Tim Robbins! <br /> <br />
