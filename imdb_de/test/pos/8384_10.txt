That's what I thought when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I am from Germany as well as with films. <br /> <br /> This guy is over 50 and played almost mediocre TV shows - and even there he did not play the main roles. It has obviously not struck anyone what he is capable of. Well, thanks to QT, he got a try to change that - and let's just say - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great magician Tarrantino is. By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - to understand everything. And the German dialogue is almost as good as the Englishman. <br /> <br /> Now I could repeat what many others have already written here. I'll say it briefly: QT is finally back.
