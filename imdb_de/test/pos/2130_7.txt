I missed the four-hour version when it first appeared in theaters because it was played for a week. I had to content myself with seeing the shorter two and a half hour version a year later, and I was stunned by what I saw. I left the theater and thought I had witnessed a masterpiece, and wondered what the full version looked like. <br /> <br /> The full version is mostly good, but it has sequences that are so incredibly boring that the whole movie is pulled down almost sinks under the waves. <br /> <br /> The problem lies entirely in the processing, which should be termed the final word for oversize. There are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens. Shots of people in a city who spend too much time in the narrative without any purpose. We get beautiful views and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to our eyes, but too often they are used as placeholders rather than as punctuation marks or as placeholders. Much of the longer version seems to be on screen simply because it looked good. <br /> <br /> I tried to sit down and watch Heaven's Gate without resorting to the Fast Forward button, but somewhere along the way I can not take it anymore. <br /> <br /> I wish MGM would take pity on us and release the shorter version on DVD as well as the huge dinosaur. Maybe as a double pack, so we could see which one is the better version, and whether Cimino was crazy or not. <br /> <br /> And while they were at it, why not watch the once-rumored Johnson County War processing that was running 90 minutes. Presumably, the United Artists continued to tinker with the hope of getting some of their money back. Whether it was ever done or still exists is in the air, but it would be interesting to see.
