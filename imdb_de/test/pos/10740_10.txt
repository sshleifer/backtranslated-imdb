Although Dr. Seu the plot for "The Horton Hatches The Egg" should be stolen, this was a good movie. It touched both the emotions and the intellect. Mostly due to the incredible performance of seven-year-old Justin Henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character (and to each one), the elements that make us think long after the tearful tears come to an end. Overall, superior acting from a solid cast, excellent direction and a very powerful script. The right touch of humor contributes to the fact that a "heavy" topic is not boring or difficult to understand. After all, this film is a test of time and does not seem to be dated decades after its release.
