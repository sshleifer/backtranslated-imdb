I think several others have already commented on this film, but I liked it so much that I just wanted to say how good a movie is. I rated it 9 out of 10. It did not receive 10, because it starts very slowly. I almost stopped, but I'm glad I did not do it. Stay tuned, it's worth it to wait. <br /> <br /> This is primarily a film about relationships: cheating, trust and betrayal. Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards Everyone is doing jobs in this film. <br /> <br /> Jason Robard's character is a farmer in the Midwestern United States, a farmer whose grandfather first settled there. Jason's character is getting older and he decides to build a trust that shares the thousand acres of farmland among his three adult daughters. Then the plot of this movie really starts to boil. <br /> <br /> Sisters turn to the country for misunderstanding the greed. They also make some discoveries about the other's childhood and about today's marriages, including an adulterer affair, as the father becomes increasingly abusive, demanding and paranoid - until finally the terrible truth about everyone cooks out.> This movie really reached me emotionally I got angry with some characters and sad with them. I could feel her pain due to the excellent performances that were given. <br /> <br /> The end was a surprise for me, but consistent with the growth of the characters. <br /> <br />
