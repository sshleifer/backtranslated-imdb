For a movie shot in 18 days with a budget of less than 2 million, this is a small movie that deserves the "best price". Interesting premise (aside from the usual meteor stuff) with solid performances by a group of well-known faces. 2 thumbs up. Advice to the other reviewers: Do not be afraid to say that you liked something.
