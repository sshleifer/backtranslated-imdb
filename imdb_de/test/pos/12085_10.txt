I've seen this movie so long ago, but I remember it as the saddest movie of all time. I kept crying. My mother will never see this movie again because it's almost painful to look at her. Otherwise, the story is not exactly complex ... Ann Margaret dies and has to give away her 10 (?) Children. As if that was not bad enough, it's during the Depression and she has to dissolve the close siblings one by one. I think that was very sad for me because I, too, came from a very large, close-knit family and could identify with each child's pain when I left mother and siblings to watch this movie again because it was done well and the end is surprisingly happy (so at least we could smile and sob at the same time). It should eventually appear on TV so I can see it again.
