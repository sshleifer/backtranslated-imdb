Looking back on the year 2002, when "Furia" was produced, it is easy to see that today's "New Generation" will ring in Romania. <br /> <br /> The main qualities of "Furia" are in a very solid writing with an essential dramatic core and a truly professional development, as well as a number of outstanding actors. All four main roles are played admirably with depth and nonchalance: Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu confirmed that Dorina Chiriac is since then two of our best artists and Dorina Chiriac works closely with them, a graveyard manager!) Gabonu cast was a real revelation! <br /> <br /> In addition, Radu Muntean's direction is skillful and expressive, captivatingly creating the feeling of a "fateful night" and an inevitable fate. One can easily overcome the few awkward and even failed moments, as time has proved to be just the imponderability of a debut never repeated in his subsequent films: "Hârtia va fi albasträ" and "Boogie".
