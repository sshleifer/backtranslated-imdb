This movie consists of 4 parts and each is about 170 minutes long. It is based on the true story of Joe Bonanno's life and tells everything he has seen. In some cases we may find that we have heard differently. Film make you tied up for the chair to the end, I think it's possible to see all 4 in a row, and not to notice that I saw 2 in a row and 2 the next day in a row. Playing in movies is fine in some fantastic scenes, but in general it could be nastier, but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor. Real things and stories are shown in this movie. If you are looking for the same spectacular Rambo / Matrix / Titan movie, you can skip it. The good thing in the movie is that you follow the main story so that you will not have long and boring love scenes or other interrupts with anything that is not important to Bonanno's crime business.
