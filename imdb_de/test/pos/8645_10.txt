"twin peaks" and "blue velvet" have always been two of my favorite filmmaking titles, and although lynch's films have been somewhat disappointing in the past, they've always been worth seeing. to pretend, lynch can be like a good wine - it has to be enjoyed and considered. But in the end, you have to decide for yourself what you have seen, because Lynch never gives you the full answers. <br /> <br /> Many people will come out of the "Mulholland Drive" and may want to throttle themselves the stunning visual puzzle that has just developed in front of them. But there is a twisted logic to this movie, you just have to look for clues. betty (naomi watts) arrives in hollywood, doe-eyed and looking for fame. Then she finds in her bathroom an amnesiac who has escaped an attempted murder on Mulholland drive. Together, they try to uncover the secrets behind the life of the amnesicist. All this leads to a club called Silencio in which a blue box reveals everything. and then the movie throws everything out of the window. People we thought we knew were completely different people ... is this a dream? a reminder of earlier escapades of life? You will either love or hate this movie. David Lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his audience. However, since his universe is always about extremes, it is appropriate that his films evoke such reactions. <br /> <br /> It is best to look at this film thematically rather than as a direct narrative. And appreciate the fact that lynch is a filmmaker who still lets you draw your own conclusions. Lately, he has had many imitators, especially in "Vanilla Sky," where a stunning movie gives you all the answers of the last five minutes, and you'll probably forget that movie as soon as you leave the house. Mulholland Drive will track you.
