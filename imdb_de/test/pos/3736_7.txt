Despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that I thought were not well developed, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their lead roles. The basic requirement of the film is that both were after their collapse in the wake of broken marriages. Both are also looking for healing. Unexpectedly, they find that they can heal each other. There were aspects of the film that I wished I had played more - with simple flashes just suggesting subjects that my mind had to fill, such as the excuse for the bereaved and the reaction of Adrienne that I slept with Paul I felt that he would feel fine soon afterwards. An opportunity for a huge love scene was lost when it was only suggested that they would fall in love with the coming hurricane. But in the end, because of the movie, I was very grateful for the relationship that my wife and I share. And there were moments that moved me to tears. So I have to say that it is worth to be seen.
