Okay ... first to Anne Rice BOOK fans .... <br /> <br /> Sure Lestat's eyes are not blue ... Sure he's not blonde in this movie ... though Marius is not Lestat is manufacturer ... even though they have completely changed the story ..... <br /> <br /> how can you say it's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> this movie ... is the best vampire movie i've ever seen ... and lestat is perfectly portrayed in it ... maybe not its features ... but i do not think so to find a better lestat ... as he speaks ... and the way he looks at mere mortals ... his arrogance ... and the sheer love of fame is flawlessly portrayed ... you will love the movie as much as I do. <br /> <br /> now ... to the non-readers. <br /> <br /> willing to fall absolutely in love with this movie .... it has everything ... and the goth music ... is like an addition ... the dialogues ... are beautiful. .. and captivating ... and even though it's a vampire movie ... you'll see yourself smile ... at the wit of the characters ... and you'll sympathize with the vampires. <br /> <br /> All in all ... one of my favorite movies ... !! 10/10
