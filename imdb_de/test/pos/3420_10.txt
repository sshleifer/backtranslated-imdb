What was the quote from Archbishop Tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? It was very disturbing to see this movie in the sense that it was a true story and to believe that after all these years humanity is still so cruel that I am ashamed of their lives in peace and harmony. <br /> < br /> live and let live <br /> <br /> if anyone knows the quote, please let me know Thank you <br /> <br /> this movie should be shown much more public than true events that are as obnoxious as all shown in the film should all be known in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.
