I saw that (Video 2000) years ago and would like to see it on DVD. A good movie, but I would have loved it even more if it included the legacy of The Beatles and the Hollies, etc., to dramatize the story? <br /> <br /> I was only 3 years old when Buddy crashed and woke up to his music in the late 70's. Much later, I found out that our family moved to our new house on February 3, 1959. ,
