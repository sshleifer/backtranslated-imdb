Hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as leprosy sufferers. In condemning homosexuality, the film industry has reflected only what the repressive society of its time adopted as ideology. For example, in 1962, in the Otto Preminger melodrama "Advise and Consent", actor Don Murray was used as a queer congressman committing suicide instead of professing his alternative lifestyle. Gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since "Advice and Consent". In the film "In & Out" (** 1/2 of ****) from the year 1997, the heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is occupied as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day. While yesterday's conservative Hollywood noted that the congressional queer in "Advise and Consent" had to commit suicide, today's liberal Hollywood dictates that the gay English teacher should rather be adopted as mazed. <br /> <br /> "In & Out" declares good citizenship in the guise of a politically correct comedy. Director Frank Oz and the scenary Scott Rudnick advocate honesty as the best policy, because honesty always ensures happiness. High school teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline of "The Big Chill") will not be satisfied until he comes out of the closet, just as his once fat, but now skinny fianc√© Emily (Joan Cusack) will only be happy If she feels she can give up her diet. Ultimately, the film claims that pure society accepts gay men when homosexuals can treat themselves more honestly and sincerely. The happily-played gay tabloid reporter, played by pure actor Tom Selleck, dramatizes this open-minded comment effectively. Rudnick's easy script beautifies the real life incident that took place at the Oscars, when Tom Hank's a high school-worthy teacher. In "In & Out", Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a blond bimbo actor in the Brad Pitt style, wins the Oscar for incorporating a fruity foot soldier. Drake honors his mentor Howard Brackett during his acceptance speech. You do not have to stop giving up there. Frank Cameron reveals to a live TV audience Howard is gay! Mistrust, paranoia and horror set in as the media descend on the sleepy town of Green Leaf, Indiana. (When would the sexual deviation of a high school English teacher spark such media attention?) Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck of "High Road to China") lurks among these reporters, and he wants a one-week exclusive interest. Howard Howard, however, does not want to deal with the witch-hunting media especially with the annoying Peter Malloy. Howard denies Drake's gay charges to everyone, including his fiancee and his mother. Malloy stays because he smells a bullet. The revelation has turned Green Leaf upside down. Headmaster Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart) nervously winds up with the coverage in the media. Halliwell warns Howard that his marriage would not be imminent, he would have to give him a pink slip. In the meantime, Peter relies on Howard that his marriage with Emily falls through at the last moment and he will record the result in front of the camera. Howard uses tapes about macho men. He is fighting to reform himself. But Howard's efforts are in vain. Guilt swells in him. And then there's Peter Malloy, who gets him to clean up his homosexuality. Finally, Howard bursts before God at the altar. Of course, Emily Montgomery, the bride-to-be, is covered by Howard's gay confession. Predictably, the school fires Howard, but he appears. Drake also appears and hurries to Brackett for defense. The school not only robbed Howard of his work, but also gave away his prize as a teacher for the year to someone else. Drake appeals to the client and Howard wins the unanimous support of the community. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in Rudnick's fictional script is Howard himself. Rudnick has created a character that is too shy to be true, either through gray or straightforward standards. Howard Brackett is more a saint than a sinner. He helps a student gain access to college and he trains the track team. How often do you hear that an English teacher doubles as a trainer? Everybody at his high school loves Howard. He has no bad bones in his body. In addition, Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that no one else in Green Leaf is gay. Where are Howards gay friends? Are you too afraid to come to his defense? No, "In & Out" is not strictly aimed at homosexual target groups. Oz, whose film critics include cute comedies like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and House Sitter, and Rudnick jokes on a politically correct tightrope. "In & Out" is not a gay recruiting film. The filmmakers are not interested in what prompted Howard or Peter Malloy to favor the gay lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnick are only interested in supporting a thin premise: is he or is not he gay? They develop it to include the community's response to the answer. When Howard finally admits to being gay, the filmmakers devote the rest of the films to showing how a conservative, Norman Rockwell-like city can accept him despite his difference. <br /> <br /> The most shocking scenes in "In & Out" are likely to be when Boulevard reporter Malloy makes a lipstick on Howard. Heterosexual guys kissing in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as funny as they are spurious. Kline and Selleck grind their faces together, which seems more like a head-on collision than a kiss with the mouth. Nothing like the controversial British movie "Priest" from 1994, "In & Out", shows with its "okay-to-be-act" message as a captivating but laborious piece of social propaganda. If "Ellen" was not the equivalent of television, "In & Out" would probably be watching television as a new sitcom. "In & Out" is not so much about dealing with the subject of gay or straight as it is about being a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. What makes "In & Out" a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is equality of opportunity, making fun of queer and oxen.
