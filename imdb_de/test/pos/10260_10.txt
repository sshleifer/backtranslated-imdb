This film set standards for African American film quality. Over time, I've heard in various stories of the film that its publication was an Oscar nomination triggered. This movie plays with different emotions and you definitely feel all the characters. Sure, part of the acting is a bit wooden, but fortunately these parts are not crucial. The music is sensational, and if you do not believe that the end is a tear jerk, you do not have a heart in your chest. If you watch "Cooley High," you'll find that many, many movies have copied different elements of it to enhance their own movies. The biggest example is "Boyz N The Hood".
