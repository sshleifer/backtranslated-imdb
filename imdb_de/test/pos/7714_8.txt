I've seen three Animatrix episodes, and this is my favorite of all. The second renaissance gave the already thin universe a faint background story. The program was a stylistically impressive number, it just felt silly. I guess what gives it a special touch is the direction of Shinichiro Watanabe, the director of the incredibly popular (and with good reason) series Cowboy Bebop. It has some of the best elements of bebop: slick, sci-fi adventure, a no-nonsense, a little apathetic hero who can be hired, a bounty head (more or less) and a chase scene, all in an excellent The united area are film noir packaging. Watanabe's Tarantino-Style Slickness comes through at full throttle.
