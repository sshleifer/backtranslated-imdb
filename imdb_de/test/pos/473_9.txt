You Are Alone is a beautiful, almost filigree film, intelligently directed, sharply written, with two complex and intriguing performances and an end to an end that no one will see, but want to see the movie for the second time. Go back and find all the clues you misunderstood. <br /> <br /> The story of a high school girl drowning out her depression and awkwardness by working as a "schoolgirl" club for a few hours a week as $ 500 an hour. and the depressed neighbor who discovers her secret and hires her for an afternoon at a downtown New Haven hotel offers stunning performances by both Jessica Bohl as a girl and Richard Brundage as her neighbor. <br /> <br /> Bohl as Daphne gives a breakthrough performance equaling Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary. She captures a teenager's fear of growing into her own skin, and when she talks about being in control, she realizes that she has no control at all, but is at risk of overcoming the deep end, what I guess you do. <br /> <br /> Brundage as a buddy is depressed, angry, heartbroken, a clam of a man. But only after the movie's surprising conclusion do you have a full understanding of his pain. After a very short opening segment that will delight most independent movie lovers, and the religious right to it runs the exits we are brought to the hotel room. At first, you are not sure what these people or the movie style is concerned. Shaky, annoying ... like the characters. Until you recognize their background story, told in short flashbacks. At first they are confrontational for a reason, just like the camera. But as they open, as the story calms down, so does the camera. And I do not know, give or take after 20 minutes, you can not take your eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> After watching the world premiere at the Brooklyn Film Fest - - where the director asked the audience if someone had expected the end and not answered yes to a person? I almost wish the movie was already on video so I could watch it again. Now that I think of some conversations in the film, especially a very open dialogue about fantasy and climax, I really thought that things would go in a completely different direction. But I realize now that so much of their conversation meant something completely different from what I had imagined. I have to see it again !!! But as dark and sexual as the conversation is, to say the least, I laughed more than I might have expected from some openness, which definitely falls into the things we think, but I do not have the nerve to say out loud " Category It's very dull, especially when you realize that so much of it has a completely different meaning, some of which will make you uncomfortable, especially if you see You Are Alone with a partner, you definitely have something to talk about Maybe it should come with a warning: you should be alone while watching! The music is incredible, I would have come home and bought the soundtrack from my favorite online music store if I could. The film looks as good as anything that was shot in the film, after film director Gorman Bechard was asked which method he used to make the digital material look so good Answer: none. They could not afford it. <br/> <br/> I have to make Bechard credit. I'm a big fan of his two shorts The Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror, but even they could not have prepared me for the complexities and surprises of this movie. <br /> <br /> To all involved: Bravo.
