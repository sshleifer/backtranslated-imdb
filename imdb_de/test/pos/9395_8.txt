OK, it's easy not to confuse this with the lame movie "Death Bed" by Stuart Gordon that came out a few years ago because this one is "The Bed That Eats". And how do I begin to describe that? Well, for starters, of course, there is a bed that eats. This is a series of demon tears that naturally affect most things negatively. The bed is in some old servants' quarters or so, and was responsible for the disappearance of a few people of his time. We have a narrator who is a ghost sitting in the wall behind a painting collecting all the non-edible treats (jewelry, etc.) that the bed passes on. He died of eating, one of the few who lay in bed and were not eaten. Probably because he was ill, he suspects, when he sees him chopping blood in handkerchiefs. Bleah. The thing about this movie is that it has a very strange sense of humor, but it's all pretty much played dead. The movie is divided into several "acts", I think, "Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Just Desserts". For fans of the incredibly weird and bizarre being this might be just what you are looking for. All I can say is that you have to see this to believe it. 8 out of 10 stars.
