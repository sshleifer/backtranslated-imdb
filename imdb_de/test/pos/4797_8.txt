If you look at the best films in Mexico, you will most likely find out that the photography was done by Gabriel Figueroa. He is recognized in the world as one of the best that ever existed. His mastery of the cameras added an extra edge to the films he was part of. If you add the direction of Luis Bunuel to his participation, you will not find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world. This story, Nazarin, was written alongside Miguel de Cervantes (Don Quixote de la Mancha) by Spain's greatest writer. The story itself is great: Nazarin, a priest who lives by his beliefs, tries to lead a very Christian life, but as always there are people who do not accept this. He wanders through many places, preaching his Christianity, but usually finds people who do not accept him. Apart from the great story, it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that Bunuel sends us throughout the picture into scenes that make you shiver.
