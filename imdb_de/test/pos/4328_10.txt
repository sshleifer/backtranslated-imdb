Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past before sailing to the island is revealed through flashbacks. Sayid is planning a plan with Jack to surprise "The Others" if Michael crosses the group twice. John Locke convinces Desmond to break into the hatch guarded by Mr. Eko and not press the computer button to see what happens. <br /> <br /> This episode is one of the best of the second season. Unfortunately, Lost lovers can recognize the lack of respect that the producers of this stunning series have for the fans. In the US, the date of this episode's broadcast was May 24, 2006. Therefore, fans must wait for season three in a very exciting situation, with Jack and his group surrounded by "The Others" and finding the truth about Michael and the deaths of Ana Lucia and Libby; John locked himself in the hatch, with no intention of pressing the button, and Mr. Eko despaired outside the hatch. I hope that the fate of "Lost" is better than "Angel" and his very disappointing conclusion (or lack of conclusion) after five seasons. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
