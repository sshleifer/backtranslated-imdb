You know, before I saw this movie, I had little sympathy for those involved in criminal cases. I mean, if they were arrested and charged, "they must have been guilty," I argued. <br /> <br /> I formed this opinion for years. You see a good friend of mine, who once worked as a detective in some of the shabbier parts of Sydney. He often complained that his police efforts had been wasted by lawyers and magistrates with a bleeding heart. He would "rip up the crooks in the morning" and they would be "back on the street by noon". It took its toll ... they struck him down. He quit. <br /> <br /> He has been arguing since then I did not think unrealistically that collecting creative evidence to keep the villains "where they belong", ... well ... "acceptable" was not valid he claimed, "What are the chances that you'll ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime?" he would argue. And since he's a law-abiding citizen, the weight of his argument convinced me he was right. I or any of my family or friends who were charged with murder or a serious crime were zero to no, I thought. <br /> <br /> Hmmmmm. As already mentioned, this wonderfully enlightening documentation has changed all that. <br /> <br /> I will send him a copy.
