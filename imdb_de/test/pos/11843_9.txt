Joe (Wes) & Jim (Adam) again introduce us to the beauty, isolation (psychologically and physically) and absolute terror of the "murder of the most poultry" in Navaho Southwest. Characterizations, settings and diagrams are created continuously. Even if the personal side notes sometimes "more" wish .... with some interesting alternatives such as "who did it?" Flashbacks (eg Peter Fonda ... good to see) give hints, but they do not go where you think. Comic additions (such as the preacher) are mild and appropriate. Where "Skinwalkers" and "Coyote Waits" start to pull ... "Thief" locks into the next corner with the clutch and the four wheels, never quite sure what's there. I do not agree with Joe Leaporn's manic comment on Jim Chee to "slow down" the potholes. Wrong ... there are no potholes in the plot, only tracks that follow. On to the next episode! Great photography (as always), responsive characters and more to explore!
