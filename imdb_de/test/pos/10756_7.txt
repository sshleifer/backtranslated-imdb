It must be admitted that Harold Lloyd's best work ended in 1928 with his last great silent comedy "Speedy". After that, he enters sound films (like Chaplin and Keaton and Laurel & Hardy and WC Fields) and is better than Keaton, but not as good as the other three. Chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as a producer. Laurel & Hardy were under the protection of Hal Roach, so the production standards for their short films and sound films were pretty good. Fields worked first with Mack Sennett, then Paramount and then freelance. Lloyd tried the path Chaplin had taken, but with less success. <br /> <br /> He produced his own films, but unlike Chaplin, he did not own his own studio. Even his first two decisions were not good (especially "Feet First"). But he started to choose wiser, and "Movie Crazy," "The Cat's Paw," and "The Milky Way" were all good choices. These three (and possibly "The Sin of Harold Diddlebock") were his best sound projects. They are all entertaining, but there is no safety load, The Freshman, The Kid Brother or Speedy. <br /> <br /> Among the first four sound films, "The Cat's Paw" is the most controversial. Ezekiel Cobb's solution to the city's liberation, which voted him mayor, is very extreme for the taste of 2005. Or? When a movie is made, its politics dictate: "The Cat's Paw" dates back to 1934. In this second year of the Roosevelt New Deal (itself controversial for government involvement), audiences saw films like "Gabriel Over the White House "and" The Phantom President ", where our leaders outside the constitution have taken constitutional measures to rid the nation of internal enemies (and to force disarmament around the world). Even Cecil B. De Mille came into the act with "This Day and Age", where a few teens use rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes. <br /> <br /> For us the use of violence to force someone (including a bunch of crooks and crooks like the gang of Alan Dinehart) to confess is repugnant. Eventually, the Supreme Court forcibly protected us from confession. What we forget is that the reforms we are thinking of did not happen in front of Warren Court and Burger Court. Although Mr. Justice guaranteed Sutherland's opinion in the Powell case ("Scottsboro Boys") of 1932 that every defendant had legal counsel, Gideon v. Wainwright did not do this to complain to the defendant attorney until 1962. Miranda Case, with his now-known anti-self-accusation warning, dates back to 1963. None of this was considered necessary in 1934. <br /> <br /> If you study other films from the period up to 1954 (and even until 1960), tricks are used to get confessions - Kirk Douglas confesses his crimes to witnesses in "I Walk Alone," while Burt Lancaster holding out a gun to him. As Lancaster leaves, Douglas scoffs at the confession under duress, only to be able to see the weapon is unloaded. Suddenly he realizes that he (legal - 1948) confessed without compulsion. I hate to tell all civil volunteers who read this note, but what Cobb / Lloyd does with Dinehart and his buddies in the conclusion of "The Cat's Paw" was not only legal, but could have led to her imprisonment in 1934 call it hard-nosed, fascist or terrible, but it could have functioned legally if it had been thought up.
