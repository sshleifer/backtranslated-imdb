To experience Head, you really need to know where the Monkees were when they filmed it. <br /> <br /> This was when their series was about to finish and the group was about to collapse. Her imaginative and comic series (a kind of American idol of her time) recorded four unknown actors and formed a manufactured super-group stage Beatles. They always felt in a box, trapped and found no credibility despite their talent. <br /> <br /> It's also a damn musical trip, resourceful (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises. <br /> <br /> See it open-minded.
