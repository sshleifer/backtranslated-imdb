Under the direction of Michael Curtiz, Four Daughters are four musically talented sisters, their followers and their father, a small conductor. Mickey Borden, who speaks sardonically and quickly, plays John Garfield in the role that made him a star rain like Adam Lemp and the Lane sisters, Lola, Rosemary and Priscilla and Gale Page as his spirited daughters. His final scene takes place in the living room of Lemps. Borden hangs on his lips and plays one of his own compositions. Ann Lemp of Priscilla Lane tells him that the piece is beautiful. But he says, "It stinks." He continues, "It has no beginning or end, just a middle." Ann asks him to create a beginning and an end. Borden answers: "For what? The fates are against me." They have thrown a coin, I am poor, the tails are rich, but they have thrown a two-headed coin. " The audience loved the way Garfield said in his harsh city voice that it stinks. This scene created Garfield's screen personality as the eternal outsider. Four Daughters is a piece of Americana with Garfield in a compelling performance that delivers more than a hint of darkness. <br /> <br />
