Spoiler: This film has its problems, but in the end it brings the message over. I liked it because it ends the way it really works. The nice guy tries and tries to get his heart broken several times, but in the end there is no typical Hollywood ending. It ends up with such things always ending or at least always having the experiences of my and the friends. Anyone who thinks that the end is not really the way it really is, as the first comment seemed to be, believing that the girl would come over, and realized she was going out with an asshole that she being mistreated because he is not at all interested in her either being naive or living in a more perfect world than me. I give 7/10 points, simply because it was not afraid to end up on a down-grade, not a real solution, just the main character heartbroken, confused and confused alone like so many men of countless generations before gave.
