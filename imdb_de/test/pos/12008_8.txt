What can I say about this film beyond the narrative is one of the most exciting in film history ... and is based on a true story! This film is old enough to remember the Berlin Wall, while still serving a country, and gives you a dark insight into the dismal imprisonment of East Berliners and their desperate escape attempts, no matter how expensive. The film depicts the lives of two families who decide to flee with a homemade hot air balloon. Afraid of being arrested by the authorities, they must, under the supervision of the neighbors, calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall. An exciting and exciting story of courage and determination that really honors all those who have failed the treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom.
