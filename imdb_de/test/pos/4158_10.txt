I just had the opportunity to see "Nuovomondo" (previously known in the US as the "Golden Gate"), and I was very impressed with the dreamy and sometimes surreal story of a family that immigrated to the US in the early days of Sicially is the 20th century. It also functioned as a (proverbial) middle finger caught in the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably up to the third ankle), depicting the mistreatment of foreigners who simply want a better life than their own original motherland. The (mostly) Italian occupation works well with a few exceptions. This is a quiet, restrained film that is nice to look at (occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure) while the script is well written. This is a movie for those who are sick and tired of mindless escapism from Hollywood selling little more than popcorn (it's not like I have any burning problems with popcorn, mind you! --- I really love the stuff) , You would be wise to search for Nuovomondo / The Golden Door (or whatever it is titled in your area).
