"The Dresser" is perhaps the most sophisticated backstage movie. The film is full of wit and ghost, mainly through the "energetic" figure of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly gay and undoubtedly has an appeal to the lead performer (Albert Finney) he supports, the film never stays or makes him more than he is Peter Yates, who has worked so well in "Bullitt", is to be seen again and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence. This is greatly appreciated in a story that would have been so boring. In the end, "The Dresser" will make many people boring, but it will be a real treat for those who love British cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.7 out of 10
