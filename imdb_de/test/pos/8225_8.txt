Ronald Coleman had been a star on the screen for several years when talkies came in and what a boost to his career. His English accent in Oxford is so intriguing that I could hear him reciting the farmer's almanac and not getting bored. Coleman plays Willie Hale, a 30-year-old playboy from a wealthy family who spends his time with women and gambling. Nevertheless, he is a sympathetic villain - not only from the point of view of the audience sympathetic, but also from his family and friends. He has gone bankrupt again because of his constant gambling and is selling his possessions in a strange place to settle his debts and return to England. When he gets there, he is first hit by a father who insists he throw him out - he did it to Willie and his people. Five minutes alone in a room with Willie and his charm, and Willie is not just given away by dad, daddy gave him a hundred pounds. <br/> <br /> Willie then goes with his one day rest sister and her friend Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young). Dorothy is betrothed to Grand Duke Paul the same night, mainly because her father wants to have a king in the family and there is no special person in her life. This changes after their day with Willie, and soon a scandal sets in when Dorothy refuses to go through the marriage as planned. Ronald Coleman is always delighted to watch Sam Goldwyn in these early conversations he has made, playing the confident adventurer or Cad or both. He has a similar behavior to Errol Flynn, but he can not portray Flynn's physical agility due to an injurious wound sustained during World War I. However, what Coleman lacked in physical agility he was always in emotional agility. Loretta Young, who was only 17 when this picture was taken, shows the beginning of her typical sweet girl who can break out into a fireball as occasion demands. Myrna Loy plays Willie's girl from the past - Mary Crayle - a showgirl. Here Myrna still plays a role that is similar to the exotic vamp games with which she often came together at Warner Brothers, as she was active from 1926 until shortly before the contract in 1930 as a contract player. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty light and airy romantic comedy from start to finish. If you are in a mood for the kind of fleeting entertainment that enlightened audiences' hearts during the Great Depression, this little movie is for you.
