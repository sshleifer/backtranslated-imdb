Flowers! If it's one thing you're going to take out of this movie, it's the flowers. They are so prominent and used as plotter devices, and you become a connoisseur of daisies and black tulips when the movie ends. <br /> <br /> In Amsterdam, Daisy plays the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and 2 men in her life. One is a professional killer earning a living, the other an Interpol agent. With a pan-Asian occupation (Korean, Hong Kong) and a crew (director Andrew Lau from Hong Kong, writer from Korea and a Thai post-production team), I could imagine the headache in the coordination. <br /> <br /> Park Yi (Jung Woo-sung) is a hit man who has found a penchant for the painter Hye-young (played by the pretty Jeon Ji-hyun). It's love at first sight in the meadows of daisies, where their awkwardness caught his attention. However, being shy and always attentive to the perils of his professional career, he can only admire them from afar and anonymously do small (or perhaps great) things for them, but what brings the cake is that Send daisies every day at 4:15 pm. He becomes her guardian angel from afar, protecting her and protecting her from harm. Hye-young is in love with these mysterious strangers. She's always waiting for him to appear, but I'm really wondering how difficult the almost on-time delivery could be. Nevertheless, she is terribly touched and touched by this single act. However, as the stars would have it, detective Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) has a chance during one of his covert missions on Hye-young, and he too is fascinated by it. Similarly, because of his job, he is doubtful if he should take the first step. <br /> <br /> In that case, the audience would be frustrating. The lady would obviously fall in love with the wrong man (then it's the "good" guy again), Park Yi gets upset by the persecution of Jeong Woo, but still refuses to step out of the room and identify herself, and Jeong Woo is the opportunist who is interested in the matter for free anonymous identity unknowingly. It's almost as if you want to punch everyone to wake them all up. Apart from that, it's exactly this tension that fascinates you. And it's a lot of fun watching the two male leads find it hard to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers or their loved ones. But no action fans, there are plenty of cat-and-mouse revelations and unspoken comradeship in the form of Infernal Affairs, as well as numerous shootings, though I thought the end might have been scanned more closely. <br /> <br /> What rocks is the clever editing. If you tell the story on a nonlinear timeline (do not worry, that's not so bad, you'll still be able to follow the tale), from the perspective of all leads, hold in the balance and culminate in a three-way split-screen showing all their emotions in a single converging event, which I thought was very successful. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful film in terms of landscapes with lush meadows and busy city squares with lots of classical music to calm the soul. As with the love movies, all the leads are eye candy - the girls will have a field day with the two good looking male leads, while the boys have to settle for a little pudgy face (argh! OK lah, in certain angles) Jeon Ji-hyun , <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a love movie with a well-balanced balance in the Action / Suspense section, then Daisy would be your choice. If you prefer more conventional crying, the other Korean movie that debuts here at the same time is You Are My Sunshine, your alternative. And yes, I totally dig up the final scene that I thought only the Koreans can do that best? A little bit reminded me of the JSA.
