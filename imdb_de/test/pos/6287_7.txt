I've done several Pauly Shore movies, but this is the only one I liked. Of course it helps that he is far less annoying than usual, maybe even a bit personable. The rest of the cast is doing a good job, especially the undervalued Carla Gugino. The film itself is basically a harmless and stupid comedy, and although few jokes are particularly funny, the movie is quite entertaining overall.
