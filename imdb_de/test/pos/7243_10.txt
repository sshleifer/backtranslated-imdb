I completely agree with the other poster. NEMESIS is one of the best of the Christie adaptations with an outstanding plot and a cast of superlatives. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Liz Fraser is the mother of the murder victim is a study of acting at the highest level. This undervalued woman was a favorite in British films in the 1960s and never made a major breakthrough in US films. As a friend of Julie Andrews in 1964, look at EMILY'S AMERICANISATION. <br /> <br /> All the perfs in this idiot have a chance to shine with and without the incomparable Mrs. Hickson, who was never asked for an Emmy for her Marple work. Shame on you! And dig the lesbian CID agents! :)
