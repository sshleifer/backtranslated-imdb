This is a Hollywood movie. The references of those involved are not revolutionary. This movie will not change the world. However, it is well done, well planned and well handled, which counts for a lot. <br /> <br /> It's the cat-and-mouse story of a grumpy former CIA assassin who finds himself betrayed by the persecution of an intelligence agent who protected John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The agent was understandably disturbed by this failure in the following years of his career, and when the film was recorded in 1992 - or certainly in America today - this alleged assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a tour-de-force of horror) in the he makes a transformational achievement) was consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he will assassinate the president. He believes he has a common cause with intelligence agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood in his cool, quiet, good-natured grumpy best). for the assassination of President Kennedy. The tension is exacerbated by a few phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary that keep Horrigan close, but do not want to reveal his position and plans. Rene Russo is excellent because Lily Raines is an agent with whom Horrigan works together to develop an adult relationship. It's nice to see a relationship between two equally competent colleagues (even though Russo is a fair deal younger than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm, capable agent capable of engaging in friendly skirmishing with the nimble Horrigan. For Russo, this is a nice thing that allows her to play the role of a capable professional woman, not just the romantic interest of the older man. The acting by the main characters, the competent direction of Wolfgang Peterson, the thoughtful use of music in action development and the excellent cinematography make this film a film that I can see again and again.
