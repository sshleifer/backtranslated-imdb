This film is apparently meant for a young evangelical Christian audience as a teaching tool. I give 7 out of 10 points. It's a decent movie to show a youth group, but I do not think he's well received beyond that. For any other audience, I would rate it much lower. <br /> <br /> The reviewers who saw that this was a wonderful life were right, although I did not think about it until they mentioned it. I remembered more a "Chick Tract", these little 3 "by 5" gospel comics. If Jack Chick had ever made a movie from one of his treatises, he would probably look like "Second Glance." It has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence that each one of us has on Earth, but it is somewhat hampered by Christian stereotypes. The Christians are all very nice, somewhat passive and squeaky clean, while all non-Christians seem to be bad people. Muriel, the angel, plays a big role and he is the craziest, cheesiest character in the movie. He is the most unlikely angel I've ever seen in a movie, and the biggest negative. I do not know if the directors intended his personality to come across so badly, or if he just hit me like that. (I admit he reminded me of someone I know.) Dan's love for a very secular girl who is not his type at all determines the plot in that movie. Why he ever fell in love with her is the only question I wish she had been answered. <br /> <br /> But the movie shows positive Christian values ​​and your youth group will be entertaining if they look at something healthy with a good lesson.
