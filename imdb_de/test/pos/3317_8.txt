Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) is just taking the time to get a job. Her real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby. <br /> <br /> April (Diane Baker) is too innocent to stay like that for a long time, falling in love too easily, a dangerous combination. <br /> <br /> Greg (Suzy Parker) is a jerk and wants to be an actress. <br /> <br /> All three are lost to drama in The Best of Everything, a 1959 soap opera / moral play / sometimes solid movie that will age in seconds. <br /> <br /> Set in the crazy world of paperback publishing, not as trashy as "Valley of the Dolls", but not as sweet as "Three Coins in the Fountain". <br /> <br /> The men in the mix - Brian Aherne, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan and Robert Evans - are mostly smooth, well dressed and no good. Aherne is the resident sex offender who pinches everything that passes by and makes unwanted progress right and left. His character is hellishly offensive, but not played seriously at all. Presumably, harassment had not been discovered yet. Boyd works there as well, although you never see him actually doing anything. He's too busy being older, wiser and drunker. Evans is abroad just to make Diane Baker suffer - he's a rich boy who has put her into trouble. Instead of marrying her, as promised, he takes her away to receive an "operation." <br /> <br /> Jourdan is a director who mistakenly has an affair with Parker. They share a fight scene that is pretty much forbidden anyway in such a movie, but the scene is eventually ruined by Parkers Histronics. She was almost bothered, and she really did not deserve such a bad fate, despite her bad acting. Joan Crawford breathes fire while Amanda Farrow, the indigenous witch who is automatically rude, dismisses her legion of secretaries. Well, they are younger, right? Is not that reason enough to hate a person? Caroline does not think so, because she admirably opposes Miss Farrow with every chance she gets. Crawford is only allowed to let go once when she says to her married boyfriend, "You can both go to hell with the rabbit's face" and slam the phone. You can never see the poor soul who dares to cross it. <br /> <br /> Martha Hyer's "storyline" is extremely weak, so to speak, and she is painfully exaggerated as an unmarried mother. Since she barely wears a big "W" (for 'whore') on her cardigan, she walks around like a miserable mess most of her screen time. Worse, she does not have the courtesy of having tied everything "in one way or another" in the end. It's not that important, but it does. <br /> <br /> It is painfully obvious that all this took place in a completely different world. People were usually nicer to each other and the work was not exactly a challenge, but something exciting, for a girl outside of New York City. <br /> <br /> An unconvincing drunken scene by the way, Hope Long seems to be quite real Caroline, who at least has more than one side with her character. <br /> <br /> I admire that women have an opinion, an opportunity and a choice. Not that it is not wrapped in a nice bow, but there are some points for equality. That was probably remarkable and potentially controversial in 1959. 10.7.
