With Billy's famous humor, this rather modest comedy with heavy, bittersweet overtones is a great finish that is surprisingly surprisingly surprising to Billy Crystal. There are various tearjackets in this film, dramatic, serious underlying themes (especially in a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values, with a good portion of humor being thrown in at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy is not always maintained as it is with the new classic genres of this type, but the real message and motivation for this film remains solid. The discovery of Billy Crystal's Talent Scout / Agent character in Romania of a giant man is enlightening and the behind-the-scenes view of the film agent is intriguing. However, the focus is still on sensitive attachments of love and learning about oneself. Eight out of ten stars.
