Most people will think that Yul Brynner's greatest achievement as the ruler of Siam was in THE KING AND I. Surely he had a variety of moods to test his comic skills, from a funny to a tragic, from an avaricious to a domineering to a hateful one. It also proved to be a "talk singer" and dancer of advantage. Since it was also his Tony Award-winning performance from Broadway, the film also allowed us to capture some of Broadway's great performance. <br /> <br /> But he also did other films showing his talents, as well as THE KING AND I. His comic turn in FEELING ONCE was quite nice. Such was his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA or his Ramses in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. But he was terribly close to being a follower of Eric Von Stroheim's 50s as "the man you like to hate." A certain vulnerability in his acting and roles made him popular with the film audience, even after his best years as a star were behind him - and he withdrew more and more to repeat the King of Siam on television and on stage Me is his best performance in this 1959 drama starring Deborah Kerr, Jason Robards Jr., Robert Morley, EC Marshall, Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film takes place in a rather modern era - the powder keg of Hungary in 1956, when it soon appeared that the Iron Curtain was about to collapse under the reforms of the Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his followers. But the Hungarian revolution collapsed due to bad timing. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent in tanks to quell the uprising (and Nagy and other reformers were arrested and executed). The West stood by and let this happen: England and France had fallen into the Suez Crisis, and the US had berated them and Israel for attacking Egypt. The actions of three close US ally made it hard for the West to condemn the Soviet Union's overkill. It was an unfortunate situation and the Hungarians never forgot how they were exposed to it. In the film, Brynner is Major Surov, a Russian intelligence officer looking out for leaders of the Hungarian uprising, one of which is Paul Kedes (Jason Robards). Kedes could get help from some western people on a bus tour through Hungary by Robert Morley (including Marshall, Jackson, Howard and Kerr). The latter are kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired. Brynner mixes with them and hopes for a clue to the whereabouts of Robards. But Brynner is a human being - he tries to be enchanted with these people (who regard him as a monster), and when he drunk a little too much, he confronts them with the questions that historians have been bothering since 1945: how come? that the relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly (even if one notes that Russia was in charge of Stalin)? The Allies had by and large worked well together from 1941 to 1945, but after Yalta and Potsdam all kinds of mutual suspicion broke out. Did they have to? Surov is a good officer, but he is torn in half by his loyalty to the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and Hungary he supports, and his growing affection for Kerr, who hides Robards but also perceives the more human side of the Russian major. And as the movie reaches its tragic climax, we see Surov decide whether to follow his sense of duty or feel sorry for Kerr, Robards and the other Western countries who want to leave. It's going to be a real fight for him - and one he can win much too late. It was a great film about a tragedy of post-war Europe and possibly the most thoughtful role Yul Brynner ever played.
