Peter Lorre was born to play Stephen Danel with the following lines: "Mr. Smith, you should not hold my wife like that." and "I told you not to keep the monkey in the house!" The poster for this film is a weird green and Peter Lorre teaches you never want to go to his penal colony / island. This film is not available on DVD, although it is a classic and is rarely shown on television. What is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Why does the monkey bother him so much? We will never know. The film should be colored by someone and cutouts should be made into a Kinks video. The film was re-released in the 1950s, and few of the Peter Lorre biographies provide text for this film. Casablanca was just around the corner. Bogart could have been on this island, but they certainly did not have the budget for him
