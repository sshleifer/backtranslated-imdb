I really enjoyed this movie, which in several ways, as Hitchcock was, was a first attempt at an action that he later shot in his career. The most amazing thing, however, is how faceless the main characters are. After watching, remember Murray Alper as a Jovial Truck driver, Vaughan Glaser's touching phrase as a blind "patriot", the memorable walking freak show and, of course, Otto Kruger as the polite and cunning villain who completely overshadowed Bob Cummings as the one rather fleeting in wood (compare this bridge jump with Harrison Ford's similar stunt in Andrew Davis 'The Fugitive') and Priscilla Lane, whose change of heart and subsequent love for Cummings is never quite credible. <br /> <br /> Of course, the other major support player is Hitchcock himself, who books the movie with two extraordinary stunts. Many people criticize the older films because of their lack of realistic special effects. My feelings are that with a lack of technology, even trying and communicating what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement. Obviously, this film carries an anti-fascist message that was made at the time of the Second World War, but as Hitchcock it's never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action. It pays to look, especially for the support roles.
