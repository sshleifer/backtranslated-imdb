Hello! Since I was able to speak Cantonese, I found that very funny and could make all the jokes that you do not get because of language barriers. The fight scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie. However, I have my criticism. First of all, I find that it's not as good as the first project A -GO AND SEE NOW! :-) Reason is, SPOILERS AHEAD-DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM !!!!!), because Jackie is fighting his enemy in Project A; the man he should kill, Sanpao. That's what he's up to doing the whole movie, and the showdown is spectacular. But in A II, even though he fights with Chan, the showdown scene between Jackie and his nemesis is not long enough and most of the action is against the Empress's men. They are not nearly as "bad" enough and have played only a minor role in relation to Jackie. Although their combat sequence is spectacular, they are not the ones Jackie chases throughout the movie, so the movie left viewers somewhat unfulfilled. However, this is only my modest opinion, so do not take it word for word and see for yourself! It's a great movie for yourself! Take care and hope your admiration for Jackie grows! Best regards, Ian PS. You know the police chief in A II? He's the same guy in First Strike - nice to know he's still strong!
