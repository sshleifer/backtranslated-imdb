Outstanding story of a dedicated young teacher who teaches minority children in a neighborhood near South Carolina. Jon Voight is simply incredible because the stubborn, dedicated, idealistic teacher who takes on this challenge despite being a client believes in rigorous discipline and has little value in modern education techniques and a crispy old school superintendent whom the late Hume Cronyn joined Pleasure played. Madge Sinclair is the boss who loves her babies. <br /> <br /> Being a retired teacher I could in a way refer to this excellent film. The ignorance shown here and the lack of cooperation with officials is also evident in urban areas. <br /> <br /> Voight recognizes that these children need much more than the traditional lessons of a classroom. He went out and experienced life by learning outside. <br /> <br /> The end is definitely a downer, but so true in life to learning and well disciplined. I think that answers my question. The behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed in spite of their environment. <br /> <br /> The end will simply tug at your heart. It was unforgettable and so poignant.
