I do not see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor. You have to get your head out of the ass if you do not find this movie funny! If this is not your "cup of tea", so to speak, look for what it really is - a damn funny movie. Maybe they wanted to do another drug / T & A movie, but in that case, they're just about right. It's especially fun for the Ali G fans because it delivers everything we love and expect from him. So I say BIG UPS to Ali G, and if it's not your thing, do not complain - BATTY BOY!
