It was a very well written movie, and the actors had a very exquisite way to portray all the characters. but when the movie was over, I felt there was more, but they forgot to put it on the dvd. Maybe they're planning a sequel ... Well, even if this is not the case, it's a good movie and a good rental, but even a better buy.
