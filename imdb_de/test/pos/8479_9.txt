A talk about the life of the tormented magician named Ray Charles. His sounds on the piano made fire music and his nostalgic voice made for exciting, cool sounds. Every barrier Ray faced never stopped him, and he found all the conflicts. A real lesson. A great team of producers will help rebuild the era, and with great costumes, hair and settings, you'll follow Ray's story and believe it's direct filming! An icy music freezes and the goose bumps become by greedy sound processing to the greed. The most important part of the film, however, is Jamie Foxx. His spectacle is really great, the diamond polished finish ever seen. He lives his role. He is the ray of light.
