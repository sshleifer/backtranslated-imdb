Yes, I know that this movie is meant to be a comedy! And the humor is over the top! But the issue of people becoming less intelligent in the future may not be that farfetched! I can not say that it will happen, but if we do not care about our education system, this could be a possibility! I noticed that some schools do not communicate facts! (Like history, geography, basic equipment). The focus is more on learning practical skills! The theory behind most subjects may be boring, but is essential for understanding how it works! In the film, there is this ridiculous example of people who grow crops instead of water with Gatorade! We can laugh about it! But if you have never learned that water contains minerals necessary for plant growth, how would you know that? For me, this is a scary idea! Now you understand why this topic is no longer funny! It may be that Mike Judge is fun, but at the same time he warns people of a real disaster, if the training does not improve quickly. I take this movie too seriously! Yes, please! Everyone's own fun! I loved Mike Judge's work (Beavis and Butthead and Office Space)! In these he could be both critical and funny! In "Idiocracy" I missed that! Most events are too absurd and as I said, very scary! I think if you are in the mood, you will like this movie!
