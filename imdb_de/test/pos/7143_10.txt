Simply one of my favorite drama films, beautiful in many ways, yet sad, heartwarming and thought-provoking. This is a great dramatization of several years in the life of C.S. Lewis and his relationship with Joy Davidman. I found it incredibly exciting with excellent and "realistic" dialogues and situations. It all seemed very 'real', but there were also 'magical' moments that made you almost breathless. Ackland and Bloom as central characters were excellent, as was the side cast. It's one of those dramas that I find hard to criticize, simply because there is NOTHING to criticize, it just works on so many levels. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
