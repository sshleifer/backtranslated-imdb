I'm from the city of Phoenix, and when I saw this movie for the first time and read the book, it only confirmed the stories I had heard in my entire life. I asked my grandfather about the mob and he told me that after he returned from the fighting in the Pacific Theater, he founded a CPA company, the largest in the Columbus area. When he was just starting, he was asked by the mob to do some financial work for her, but he said that he gently refused. Even when the FBI and the army came through Phoenix City and cleaned it up, my grandfather would not mind if my mother, aunt, or my uncle crossed the river, but I assure you that it's all over now. Downtown Phoenix City is in need of refurbishment, and in the slums of the courthouse are all the shootings that still shoot furious, uneducated, lower socioeconomic people, and the 14th Street of the Phoenix Eagle Bridge has been closed for a solid 15 years replaced by a newer 13th road bridge, but on the fairer side of Phoenix City at summerville rd. It is very idyllic and the scenery is depressing. <br /> <br /> Another incident was told to me by the family of my best friend from high school, who lives in a nothingness on Highway 165 called Holy Trinity, Alabama, which is about 28 minutes of minutes outside of Columbus, Georgia. My best friend in high school uncle was a man named Old Man Davis. Regardless of how the movie goes, the fact is that there were 3 bosses and Old Man Davis was one of them ... you can even read it in the original book. According to legend, he was so cold-blooded that he went to downtown Phoenix to make a deal with a man, but the man had apparently completed the deal right in front of the Old Man Davis, and the Old Man Davis went on A Saw Off Rifle from the coat and shoot the man in the middle of the city at the courthouse in the chest. They say he even went away casually because the mob paid out every law enforcement official in the city, so he did not have to worry. Another incident involves a bridge where another of my friends owns a rental home next door in downtown Phoenix. It's the same bridge the mob killed and thrown away a black, and you can even read that part of the book. i also like to be asked in many columbus and phoenix civilian civilians to be in the film in addition to being. If the friend of the Pattersons is murdered before the judge and brought to trial and found guilty before the judge, but is still released, the judge is my father's partner at his Columbus office, which unfortunately passed away.
