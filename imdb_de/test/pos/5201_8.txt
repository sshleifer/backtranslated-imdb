This film tries to do the typical "I fight" because I have to defend the homeland. The NAZI's are all bad guys, I'm against them (typical of German war movies). As? By not talking too much about it and referring only to the war and the prisoners of war. Nevertheless, I would like to see a German movie between the end of Come And See and the "bad NAZI" boat. I say that because, apart from this factor, German films are the best that represent World War II and the German side. It is easy to see some of the German hierarchical relationships that are very different from those in the US Army. <br /> <br /> This is a movie trying to get a real insight into what Stalingrad was, and I was not there and I doubt most people were there now, but when I have a movie That would certainly not be the American enemy at Gates. Why do I say that? Because even the best soldiers are not heroes and, under the circumstances, can look upon their own lives instead of the motherland. This applies to all ranks, and in the end you see Paul as an example.
