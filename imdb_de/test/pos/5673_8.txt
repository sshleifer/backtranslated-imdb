The film begins with three people playing a bit after their holiday, who decide to first visit a crocodile farm and then go to a slightly easier activity, a "fishing" tour. <br /> <br /> You're picking it up Interesting information about crocodiles during their visit to the farm and the information just adds enough to increase the suspense later in the movie, if you remember what happened before was said. <br /> <br /> The action in the movie is well timed not over done. The tension is created by the "what if", the "unknown" and the sometimes violent decisions made by the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> I wondered what I would do if I was in the same situation boat, no pun intended. <br /> <br /> The movie quality was really good and the effects were realistic, believable and not over the top or cartoony look and not the right place, as you sometimes get with CGI. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie fan, I watch pretty much every horror movie I can get my hands on in almost every genre. This is one of the best "crocodile" horror films, if not the best I've seen. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not be disappointed.
