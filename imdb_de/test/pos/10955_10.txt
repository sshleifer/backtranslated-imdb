The improvisation was groundbreaking in this film, but only works as a novelty. There is no greater truth about the situation when the actors are asked to improvise. The performances are not improved by improvisation, as the actors now have to worry twice as much: not only if they deliver the line well, but also if the line itself is good. That's why appearances in many Robert Altman films are often very ugly - because the actors are not really confident in saying lines they've come up with and are therefore unsure if they're good. <br /> <br /> And honestly, often it's not very good. Often the dialogue does not really follow from one line to another or adapt to the environment. <br /> <br /> It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, I find it hard to follow and focus on it so badly. <br /> <br /> Still a fascinating bit of raw material and 100% commendable when you take power over the green light on the street. <br /> <br /> There are some great things in there. This joke for example: <br /> <br /> I'm a dancer. What dancer, like a ballet dancer? Oh no ... exotic. <br /> <br /> And the whole party scene is in, the following trip to the park and the scene where the boys look at statues. <br /> <br /> 2 / 5. I would not say they are worth 2 hours.
