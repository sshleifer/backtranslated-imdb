If you're an 80's kid and have not seen this movie, you've failed to be a true 80's kid. How can you not love these great chipmunks (lines), lines and songs? Years later I can still sing every word to every song. The plot is great and much better than today's children's films. It's just fun and worth the rent, even if you're all grown up.
