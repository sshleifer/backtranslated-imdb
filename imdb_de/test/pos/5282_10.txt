It's rare for a movie to take you inside its world and you want more as soon as the credits roll. Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is such a movie. <br /> <br /> The film is the story of a young goldfish named Ponyo who wants to become a human. She swims ashore and is found by a boy named Sasuke who promises to take care of her. Of course, Ponyo's father, an ecologically obsessed wizard named Fujimoto, tries to prevent Ponyo from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature, which in the end is turned upside down when Ponyo eventually turns into a little girl and causes a massive typhoon Ponyo is a very rich movie. It's full of wondrous imagination, loveable characters and a real heart. Director Hayao Miyazaki has narrated a simple, short story, producing authentic film magic. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is an enchanting experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. The environmentalist of Miyazaki is still as obvious in this film as in all his previous work. Miyazaki shows the dirt and grime falling into the ocean in an almost frightening light. Not to mention that Ponyo's father is on a compulsive mission to cleanse the oceans of the world. While the story is simple, Miyazaki manages to add that extra layer to ponder with specialized expertise. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautiful piece of art, each hand-drawn cell looks like a wondrous pastel painting. The film looks very different from many other Studio Ghibli productions, but the art is still more spectacular than ever. The underwater scenes are simply beautiful, the fortress of Fujimoto under the sea is very resourceful and the order in which Ponyo encounters the leaping fish in the typhoon at Sosuke is iconic. His wonderfully executed characters make this movie an unforgettable experience , Sosuke is a little boy who looks older than he really is, and the energetic ponyo is a laugh for a minute. Every character is just enjoyable and unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ponyo is a wondrous experience that captivates in every way. Although the film can be sold as a fairy tale for children, I believe that many adults along with their children are swept along in his fantastic world. While the film may lack the density of Miyazaki's earlier works, it remains pure and simple, faithful, and delivers a movie that is funny, heartwarming, and entertaining at the same time. This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give Ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10!
