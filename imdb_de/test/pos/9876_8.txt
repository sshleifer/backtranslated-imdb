This was a really interesting Halloween movie. I was not thrilled with the whole Thorn theory, but it still makes a good movie. I would like to see Tommy Doyle again, but unfortunately Donald Pleasance died right after shooting. The film had a really REALLY bad director who did not look back on the series, which I heard was treating Donald badly and that Danielle Harris would not come back as Jamie. It's like he just wanted to get the movie down, but I liked it anyway. There were a lot of cuts and music changes, and if you're lucky, you can get the Producers Cut, which has over 40 minutes. never before scenes. With these scenes, this is a whole new movie. Check it if you have the chance.
