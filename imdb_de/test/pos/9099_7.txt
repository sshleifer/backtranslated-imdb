For those who loved "Wayne's World" ... "The Blues Brothers" ... and hell, even "Raiders of the Lost Ark", you'll find much to like in "Tenacious D: The Pick" (but probably not love) of Destiny, "a fictional epic about the founding of the JB (Kyle Gass) band, two unemployed losers with a taste for Rock'n'Roll face a dilemma when KG's long-time supportive mother challenges him JB and KG make tracks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after a Sage Music Store (an inspired Ben Stiller) tells them about the track selection (a funny animated tapestry sequence gives the back story) Way, our zeros encounter a strange snaggle player (a game of Tim Robbins), Sasquatch, Stoner Security Guards, Sorority Chicks and Satan himself (an ironically occupied Dave Grohl) in a sounding order that must be believed to be believed (and preferably be played at high volume). Rarely do I see comedies in the theater, but "Pick" is a very nice change ... it can not go to 11, but it hums a good and good 90 minutes long. And the songs are inspired. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10
