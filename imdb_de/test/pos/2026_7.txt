Rock Star is a "beautiful" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who are not supposed to be nice are really nice. Chris is a nice guy who learns a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice. <br /> <br /> Despite all the beauty it is a good movie. Maybe I'm just used to the fear of X Gen music. In a way, the movie was a caricature of rock stars and not hard enough to be credible. Mark Wahlberg's acting is pretty good. Jennifer Aniston played her role well but was straightforward. She was a nice girl. <br /> <br /> Take a look at it. If you've ever been to a rock concert or spinal tap, have a look.
