Race Against Fear is one of the most moving TV movies I've seen in a long time. All appearances by the leading actors were outstanding, especially those of Ariana Richards (Mickey Carlyle), William Bullimer (Kurt Ansom) and Susan Blakely (Margaret Carlyle). In particular, Ariana made a very emotional performance, the facial expressions agree. She portrayed the feelings that made Mickey feel perfect, and it was easy to believe she had been raped, so realistic was her performance. RAF is an incredibly realistic film, due to the moving performances of the cast. Bullimer came across incredibly well as a rapist, and you hated him more and more in the course of the movie. Blakely also made an emotional performance as the mother of the raped girl (Mickey Carlyle), and the Carlyle family became more and more sorry because no one believed in the rape. All in all, RAF is a great movie. It is both moving and exciting, as you are always unsure whether Ansom will be prosecuted for rape for lack of witnesses, evidence and belief in the allegation. I definitely recommend this movie.
