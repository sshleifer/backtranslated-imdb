A very powerful drama in Faulkner's southern town, about the murder of an innocent black man at the local neighbor. Striking cinematography and good narration (via flashback) lead us through the troubled relationship between the suspect and the son of his lawyer. A still powerful story older than Sidney Poitier's films based on racial prejudice. Porter Hall has a big role as the father of the murdered man. Trivia: This was actually filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Missouri, with many of the residents used as extras.
