I saw Five Fingers drive-in in ... what 1973, '74? It was the first kung fu movie I ever saw and I was very entertained. I recently bought it on DVD and watched it again. The second time I was also very entertaining. I think that's probably who most of the kung fu films are based on. Rival schools, different styles, revenge, good guys and "black hat" villains. They have even thrown the Japanese (VERY bad guys) styles of karate and judo. I remember making fun of the dubbing dialogue like, "Hey you, you're a very bad guy!" and "You should not get away with it! I'll try this bad lot!" This time it was not so distracting, I think I'm used to it. If you value this genre in the least, you should see this.
