A SUPERMAN cartoon <br /> <br /> A huge gold shipment is sent by train over land. Using sophisticated techniques, a sophisticated gang of thieves tries to take the gold. With the intrepid reporter Lois Lane as the only passenger on board Superman is to rescue. But now that it has become a runaway move, can it even stop the BILLION DOLLAR LIMITED? <br /> <br /> This was another series of excellent cartoons that Max Fleischer produced for Paramount Studio. They offer great animations and tight, fast-moving charts. They are to be screened in cinemas and are far ahead of their colleagues at Saturday Morning.
