With Salinger's "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" ending with the suicide of a prodigy, this film begins with the death of star high school swimmer legend Matt, who fires a revolver at the opening scene. However, the death of Matt Travis serves as the key to opening the door of another prodigy, his brother Tim, who never seriously dealt with the question, "What should I do?" <br /> <br /> When he realizes his brother is dead, his head is broken like a watermelon, the Travis family begins to vomit their secrets. The movie focuses on Tim. He is a victim of bullying, domestic violence, family alienation, heartbreak, issues of sexuality and friendship. <br /> <br /> Tim reveals his wounds from bodily bruises, but these are not the only injuries of his person, as we are beginning to notice, as the script painfully reveals the origin and outcome of Tim's scars. Everyone who loves him hurts him. Hirsch plays the character quite well and reveals image by image in the visual expression of his body, a multitude of conflicting emotions in the soul of a child that no one seems to hear or know, and whose depth he does not know and does not know soul and amazing Talent. <br /> <br /> Two siblings sharing a doobie and curling up on a red, spinnable, playground saucer asks Penny, "What am I going to do with the rest of my life?" The scene is framed by a familiar, recurring image of the movie: the comfortable playground on which Tim obviously feels at home, filmed from a bird's eye view, because with every character, Tim feels comfortable sharing a part of himself, and we see In these intimate moments, he shares the red, wearable playground saucer, complete with pencil-cut childish graffiti from above. After Penny advised him to hand over the joint, he tells him, "Tim, well, the secret to the success of life is to find something you love, and you have to do that for the rest of your life? Hell, you should be good at it, because if you do not, you'll probably fail. "Penny's simple advice serves as the film's central theme, the responsibility of talent, and the potential for failure. Why does a person have a talent he can not stand, like Matt, who hated the attention his swimming glory brought, but nobody noticed Tim's talent? Nobody ?? nobody bothers him? Not even us. The movie makes us realize that we do not know Tim as well as we thought when we met this beautiful, sad guy for the first time. In our intimate understanding of Tim, we are reminded that not everyone is what they think they are. This is the other side of the movie, the failure of those who should? Parents, friends, teachers? whoever? to notice and see the gifts of those who claim to love them. Not even his mother Sandy, played by Sigourney Weaver, sees Tim's gift, even though she loves her son. Weaver does a skillful job for a middle-aged woman who deals with her own inner demons while she happens to be playing the role of domesticity and support. When Tim is bullied in school, she storms the boy's follower and threatens his life: "You can annoy, torture, beat, drive drunk with me, I can forgive you, damn, I can understand, I'm good Christian, You know, I can forgive and forget, but you start with my child and may God descend from heaven to protect you, because as long as I live, I will outlive you all, I will wake up and go to sleep at night and just dream about how you can bring your insignificant life to hell on earth. "After grabbing a paper cup in her mother's face, she looks around the trailer and looks at both, the boy and his startled mother, commenting "nice trailer" and walks as fast as she came. Weaver scores in her ability to combine the taste with the visceral joke, which is sour and funny. And Tim's father, played by Jeff Daniels, is blind to who his son is, treats him like a stranger, and does not tell his family he took the time to spend his days in the city park, listless, a chiseled soul and slept in Matt's bed and put him down with his high school wallet. Jeff Daniels does an excellent job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and a lovable person because we realize that even an incompetent father can show his love for his son. In an emotional scene, Tim confronts his father. Just when you think his father would beat him, he grabs him to hug him. He does not let him go and tells Tim, "I'm your dad and you're my son and I'm fine here, but you have to talk to me, I do not know how to do it alone." Here at this moment a father tells his son. You have to tell me what's going on in you. You have to tell me who you are. I want to know who you are. In this scene, the film reaches a cathartic moment, the visual movement of Tim, angry and alone, to his father, who embraces him as he breaks and cries, revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell. Tim experiences this moment of purification with his father as a catharsis, especially considering the mistreatment, manipulation, disrespect, violence and betrayal in the long year the film was treated. I recommend this movie.
