The role of the economy in the industrialized North American market has always been theorized in the home countries of engine production. People and industrialists such as Mercedes Benz and Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) have certainly recognized the opportunity of the North American market with the purchase of fuel and the number of cars purchased per household. This kind of economic phenomenon triggered the concept of the Speed ​​Racer. According to Japan's new constitution, the industrialization of the isolated island nation of Japan must once again look for an opportunity through economic partnerships with its global neighbors. This has also helped to develop economic opportunities in the European and North American markets, if not in the world market. Speed ​​is a young enthusiastic driver who, without knowing better, is driven by his demanding father Pops Racer who is challenged himself all his life to win a better machine to win races. It was actually Pops Racer who drove his first son Rex Racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of using the technology he developed. As a mature racer, Rex finally recognizes his own inherent values ​​and becomes independent, yet still feels obligated to his younger effort of speed. <br /> <br /> The exact relationship of Rex Racer with people like the Inspector is never really clear, but dramatized. Rex is eventually accused of being a kind of agent for a country or organization because sometimes he's in places where he has no other explanation for how he knew Speed ​​would be in trouble. Or the fact that the situations involving some kinds of illegal activity were his secret knowledge has an evil connotation. This brings Speed ​​Racer to some degree of mantle and dagger romance. <br /> <br /> The mixture of the speed of innocence with Trixy, Sprital and Chim Chim brings a level of funny human nature with it. This concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance themes and actions as they are played from episode to episode. Instead of a dry detective story, the thrill of the international race car, the romance of mantle and dagger, and the comedy of human nature are summed up in a single story: Speed ​​Racer.
