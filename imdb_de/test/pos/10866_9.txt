Here we have a smart mix of typical Hong Kong movie shootouts, world destruction issues and intelligent filmmaking. Not that the script does not have its big holes and a few special effects are a bit cheaplooking. But the cinematography is an optical pleasure and the soundtrack is first class. The mixture of fast action sequences and colorful slow, sometimes almost poetic parts has no comparison in their film type. The closest genre is a catastrophe or terror movie with deeper human and political scores than usual. It is worth to be seen in cinemas worldwide. But I hope that this applies to so many other (mainly Asian) films beforehand and nobody seems to believe me. Unfortunately.
