Alright guys, here's the deal with this movie. It is not the best, but for all the children of the 80s, there will be nice memories of your childhood. I personally love this movie. i still love rainbow brite and the care bears. In my opinion, if you are not a child now or were a child who loved and / or loved Rainbow Brite, you will not like this movie at all.
