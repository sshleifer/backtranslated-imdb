I seldom bothered to watch comedic films or television these days. They are bland, vulgar and, above all, not funny. This could be seen as a refreshing explosion from the past. It's worth it to see, and I do not think it's worth mentioning. Classic humor is classic humor, and good writing is good writing, regardless of the era in which the film was made. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie again; It occurred to me after watching the somewhat similar Summer School on TV recently. Like this slightly newer movie, "Meatballs" is funny, without being cruel, overly sexual or indulging in bathroom humor. The key, of course, is how the adult character makes such a big difference in the teenager's life - maybe even an almost life-saving change - and how both grow up in the summer.
