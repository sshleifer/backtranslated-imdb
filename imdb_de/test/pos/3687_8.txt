Minor Spoilers <br /> <br /> In Chicago, Grace Beasley (Kathy Bates) is a housewife who has been married to lawyer Max Beasley (Dan Aykroyd) for 25 years and a hysterical and psychotic dwarf daughter, Maudey (Meredith Eaton). Grace worships the singer Victor Fox (Jonathan Price), who will present a TV show in Chicago and will be awarded five seats in the front row of a TV promotion. Kate calls the show and wins a ticket when Max demands divorce at the same time and claims her life is too monotonous. Grace gets depressed, and as she walks into the show, the audience learns that a Chicago-based serial killer using a crossbow has killed Victor Fox. With a broken heart, she decides to fly to England for the funeral of Victor Fox. There she realizes that he was gay and becomes a friend of his former colleague Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They fly back to Chicago and try to find the killer. This movie is a delightful, original and funny dramatic comedy with bizarre characters. It has a huge potential to be a cult movie, with performances by Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow himself and a joke with Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece "Do not Look Now" when Maudey wears a red raincoat on the Chicago subway. The beginning of the film, in which Jonathan Price sings "Hitchcock Railway," is wonderful. I repeated it four times in a row. The cast offers a great performance that highlights Kathy Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. In fact, this movie is an excellent conversation. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Amor a Toda Prova' ('Love for the Proof')
