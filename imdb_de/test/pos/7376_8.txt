I originally posted the first user commentary on this movie, claiming that it was crap and it made no sense. I did not make sense. Campfire Tales is a thoroughly enjoyable movie (now that I was 2 years older and saw him last night). The actors were famous, but not too famous. The acting itself was more than acceptable, it was pretty good. I will rate the movie per movie segment. <br /> <br /> 1) The black and white scene (AKA- "The Hook") This was rather the case pointless it looked good, but did not hold too much grip, the only disappointing, I do not think that it was even recorded as a segment. Here's the Scare-O-Meter. <br /> <br /> --- --- (Bad) <br /> <br /> 2) The RV Story (honeymooners stuck in the woods) Perhaps the most entertaining of all stories, acting was good in this case as well and disappointed the typical sex scenes of the caravans. But it was exciting, you think "who knocked on that door". It was tension, not too bloody. Liked this here. <br /> <br /> -------------- ------------ (Very good) <br /> <br /> 3 ) Internet Chat Story (Little Girl Meets Psycho) This was a smart addition that left a minimum of gore. Although it was sometimes boring, the last few minutes were extremely entertaining. Do not get me wrong. It was still fun to watch. Really scary and could happen to anyone like this See who you're talking to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (Very good) <br /> <br /> 4) Ghost Tale (Man kisses the ghost) ?? Not the best, it was not too atmospheric for a ghost story. This was strange, the aspects were pretty good, there was music playing and the screaming, but everything was too real to be scary, though it was good, it was quiet and bloody could have been better with this idea. <br /> <br /> ------------- (Acceptable) <br /> <br /> 5) The End (the 4 Lost Teenagers) These are the two attractive girls and boys who tell the stories about the whole movie. The best thing about the movie is definitely the end, it made a great impression, the end was totally unexpected. Watch it, it was done so well The realism was spectacular. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (TOP NOTCH) <br / > <br /> 6) THE FILM TOTAL Campfire stories were more than I used to, I really like it so much, now I'm buying it on video because it's a really entertaining horror movie garbage you see these days, how many, me I'm disappointed that this was not really nowhere to go, it was right on video, for me it was better than all the hype "ho you see these days. Overall for campfire stories <br /> <br /> ------- ---------------------- (Very good) <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 points
