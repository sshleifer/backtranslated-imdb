This is not what you would call a happy story. The titled main character (Edmund Purdom as THE Egyptian) does not get the girl - although he obviously gets the last word (?), Does the otherwise tragic main character (Michael Wilding as a politically short-sighted pharaoh) tragically end the wrong? even if it's Victor Mature, winning wins all the marbles. Peter Ustinov may have received the best part (Kafka) and possibly some, if not most of the film, except Jean Simmons, who is a bit above average (on average) ball ?? intellectually and spiritually, as all others together. <br /> <br /> The brooding and pessimistic sinuhe of the doctor (that's Purdom) is portrayed as a dark, cynical, tormented soul that spends the entire conspiracy? Throughout his life he searched for the meaning of 'life'. (By the way, and to put it with John Lennon, "life" happens when you make other plans.) Forgive the lack of philosophical depth in the previous commentary of the clip, but in the end, the plot unfolds to reveal just that ! <br /> <br /> And philosophically, as if things were not grumpy and negative enough, John Carradine (as the unnamed grave robber) appears in a cameo role in the middle of the strip. "Life" is basically meaningless and only as a worth living alternative to the ultimate disappointment worth living. <br /> <br /> So we have over 200 words and I did not really have a friendly word. Why the hell did I rate it that high? Well, there are many Shakespherean tragedies and a lot of moral values. There are ethical contrasts, real friendships, true and unexpected (almost) love, and despite the limitation of the production capacities of the 50s, it is very well (sound) staged, pleases both the eye and the ear and very good / even. The drama is for the most part consistently very good? Given that this is a fifties costume drama, the interactions are credible right up to the characters' deadly mistakes - and there are many who do justice to the best of Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> There is salvation, Sinuhe discovers and hugs his son? played by Tommy Retigg that Lassie really needed, despite Ustinov's efforts to make it. A few other "misguided" souls only get desserts? the "foreign" casserole Nefer (Bella Darvi) ?? Apparently in Egypt on a carnal exploitation work visa that Sinuhe had earlier and even cruelly spurned mercilessly, and the Princess Baketamon (Gene Tierney as a sister of Pharoah Wilding), who knew a deep, dark secret about Sinu's ancestors, and then tried him against to use his friend, her brother, the Pharaoh? nice people, huh. Purdoms performance is actually something to see. He wears the lament so well that you can beat him over the puss before the end of the Pix, grab him by the lapel and say, "Dummy, pull yourself together, the glass is not half empty!" "and then find that you personally are disappointed with Horemheb - really Sinuhe 'best friend (Victor Mature as Pharoah's Top Soldier), because he himself has this flaw in his character that prevents him from achieving anything positive /> <br /> I wonder if the secret of the entire film is that it quickly reaches and then maintains the necessary "suspension of disbelief", and you understand and worry about the characters at an early stage, and so much take care that you really feel sorry for them and their missed chances of happiness, a luck that was not too far off their grasp otherwise. <br /> <br /> can not understand why it does not already appear on DVD, and I hope it will be corrected soon.
