Dead or Alive: The film that supposedly brings together the three films of the very laid-back Dead or Alive trilogy and is mainly associated with its stars, Riki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa, and that every movie has its share of Bizarro World fixtures and neurosis has, and any amount of violence is admittedly the weakest. That none of the three films is a disappointment is less a testimony to the creativity of the material than to the lolong minds that director Takashi Miike takes with the environment and the material. Here he presents an openly dystopian future, albeit reservedly, in which a gay mayor / dictator (Richard Chen) drugged the entire village beyond a group of rebels. There are also replicants - robots - this year in 2346, one of them is Ryo (Aikawa), a robot with deadly skill, but also with the ability to love and learn and so on. Then there's a cop, Takeshi (Takeiuchi), the mayor's top guard. Ryo is working with the rebels and Takeshi with his employer on both sides, although bloody mishaps have gone badly like a hostage compromise and Takeshi finds out that his wife and son are robots (not made) A stranger Mood, mind you, as if suddenly out of power), and that he himself is one too. And everything leads to a final, inexplicable showdown between the two men. Strange that there is another film in which Miike has peaks and valleys here and sometimes finds the middle ground of success that science fiction can hold a meaning to. But there is really nothing to tell from this story, except that the mayor / dictator is a dingbat with no backstory who sets himself apart from his stones and makes sure his drug does not make couples pregnant and keeps everything under control. He also has his love slave, I think, in the funny part of a saxophonist, who sometimes serves as a human game if he does not clog the moody blues. In the meantime, we get the classic sides of Ryo and Takeshi's stories, and they're never uninteresting, they just are not convincing enough to attract interest. Of course, Miike is not in the mood of having fun, like when Takeshi lets Michelle (Maria Chen) into the water to make her swim after an assassination attempt on the mayor, or if the original rebel leader does not speak English reason enough. At the beginning of the film, there is even a playful homage to old science fiction cartoons. But there's nothing very convincing about the substance, except for Takeshi's twists, getting "good" in the middle of the movie (having a couple help a child), and most of the time Miike's strengths are purely stylistic Choice of locations and sets. <br /> <br /> It's like a Japanese Alphaville, where everything still looks contemporary thanks to the special effects. And I liked the yellow-green tint that Miike used in the movie very well, as she worked very well outdoors and just added enough dirtiness in the interior shots. But as far as peaks and valleys are concerned, you can see this more and more clearly and the level of sci-fi movie channels with visual effects and maybe a few dollars more - during the climax. This contains some of the funniest materials in the director's most confusing, Freudian sensibility, though they must begin with unbearable means; The way Ryo and Takeshi finally meet is a kind of coincidence and only a means by which producers can try to cheaply connect the last two films, if that was not necessary. On the other hand, in terms of the guilty entertainment value of a movie like Miike's, where something totally unexpected and very grossly sexual is seen, the best scenes are in Happiness of the Katakuris and Visitor Q. Overall, Dead or Alive Final is a cheesy 90-minute effort that even TOO does not take seriously and is all the better because it shows evil inventions, militarist decay and cultural violations at the pulp level.
