Inglorious Basterds does not apologize, asks for no forgiveness, it is an unrestricted attack on the senses. Tarantino does not care if he insults, if he overruns stereotypes and stereotypes, filmmaking is the purest. It's great to see a filmmaker whose work is clearly not influenced by the powers. Tarantino effortlessly masters the tension and suddenly mixes it with loud moments of laughter. You are not sure if you should look away in disgust or roll over laughing, no matter if it's a roller coaster ride and you can not miss it! It's not for everyone and I'm not sure how the Germans will record the movie. If you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a bit hard to swallow, but it's still a movie that just has to be seen. No film fan who respects himself should miss this. And the performance of Christoph Waltz ... Oscar, do not dare to ignore him !!
