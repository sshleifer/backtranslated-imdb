I've had enough of series with young and unsuspecting people who are constantly talking about their "problems", self-centered, boring and absolutely annoying (Popular, Dawson's Creek, Beverly Hills, etc.). "Hack" is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different story, credible people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very, very good stories. I just love it!! I hope "Hack" will last for a long time, because it's a great adult television show, for a change.
