NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese Noir. It's about three salarymen overriding their heads as their innocent, drunken, cheap shots beat up three other men in a bar one night. When these three mysterious strangers, who tolerate much more disparate discomfort than even the movie, let the living daylights beat out of one of our "heroes," the trio decides to return the favor in kind - only she accidentally kills one of the other boys ! The remaining two villains then begin to systematically destroy what these poor fellows love, including their rapidly dwindling sanity. On the DVD case of Phaedra Video it says in a criticism quote: "A paranoid street criminal Freakout!" or something, and the term applies here more. Intoxicating, tense, very violent and reserved (but still fairly smooth), shot at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that advise the audience with the beleaguered protagonists (who, to some degree, earn everything they deserve) !). I give a 10.
