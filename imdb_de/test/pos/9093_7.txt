The basic requirement of Flatliners is quite simple. Several medical students are getting to the point of death to find out what the brain is actually doing. It sounds like something a mob of bored students would do for a joke, but it's the basis for some very scary sub-stories. In today's world, where Hollywood has to open up foreign markets for brainstorming a horror movie, Flatliners are one of those rare gems that shows that Hollywood can do something different if it strives. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Flatliner from a variety of films based on this premise that would turn out today is that they do not make themselves too condescending or arrogant. Flatliners recognizes that people go to movies to talk and not to moralize. With this kind of supernatural thriller, the difference that this restraint makes is truly incredible. Even more amazing is that Julia Roberts appears without being annoying or showing that she can only play Julia Roberts. The theory of darkness, that performing artists do their best to work with the smallest audience, is here in force. <br /> <br /> The subplots of what the characters find in their loss of just about everything that makes them alive, and how it re-enters their time, are doing surprisingly well. Particularly fascinating are the moments in which William Baldwin's character finds his personal video collection that persecutes him. That William Baldwin seems so perfect in this role says a lot about the script or direction. I'm not sure which one. <br /> <br /> Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, shines as the main character. One really feels for him the mystery of what past experiences intervene in the present and why this unfolds. When Kevin Bacon's character seeks out an old school whose life he has made to hell, and explains how sorry he is, it becomes clearer what the movie is about. We can try to change the past as we like, but that's what we do with the present, which is most important. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the Flatliner is how to achieve an atmosphere without the use of expensive. work out visual effects. Quite unusual for the actual horror movie flatliners have not spent their budget in places where this was not necessary. Much of what we see in the surrealist sequences is a case of professional pretense, simple trick photography or stock footage. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. If the film has a problem, it feels too short for about ten minutes. The end seems to be superficial rather than conclusive, as if someone in the studio had asked the director to put the film together so he could release it at a certain market time. Of course, many films have left sore spots, so flatliners should not be any different. The one-and-a-half-fifteen minutes we get is very satisfactory, if not brilliant. <br /> <br /> I gave Flatliners seven out of ten points. It works well as a date movie or a kind of late-night popcorn movie. Besides, it's a good reminder that low budget horror shows were not always sad trash.
