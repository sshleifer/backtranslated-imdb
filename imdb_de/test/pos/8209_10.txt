I loved this movie! <br /> <br /> Films and games serve their purpose when they uncover social, political and other issues that affect the majority. This movie served this purpose. <br /> <br /> I identify with the plot and know people who have. By the time this film was made, the concepts shown in this movie were being brought forward to the public, but it had already happened to friends of mine by people in powerful positions. And I know what it's like when people do with you what they did to Angela Bennett because they did it to me. <br /> <br /> I really liked Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx. She portrays a pretty, intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to not give up the overwhelming contradictions, fight hard for her mind and restore her life, and try to protect those she loves. Losing their self-image and succumbing to this centuries-old attempt to strengthen a declining self-esteem through sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality. The climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind of problem.
