I have just seen this movie again, I believe for the sixth time. I will undoubtedly see much more. This is one of the most brilliant French movies ever made. The film is mysterious, but even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director Gilles Mimouni. He has not made another film for ten years, and this was his only one. The story and execution of this brilliant film are perfect, and it is clearly a tribute to Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The split second of the moves is controlled just as carefully as the scene in which the side of a house in 'Steamboat Bill Junior' falls on Keaton, and he is not killed by inches. In this film, people bend and turn and pass each other, and if they had a second, they would have collided. So the plot goes so far over a series of random events that you can not even take your eyes off the screen for a millisecond, or you'll miss something important. The haunting, albeit intentionally repetitive music of Peter Chase recalls Hitchcock's "Vertigo", and the entire movie has the same uncanny quality, but while Hitchcock had a woman's two wives, Mimouni has two women who are a woman's plot structure. There are fluent references to other Hitchcock films, but it is 'Vertigo' that is central to the inspiration of this film. The theme may superficially seem like obsessive love, but the film is about the magic of everyday random events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the indescribable. Everything is overcharged with passionate love and desire, but desire exceeds its object and struggles against something behind and behind the object. So it's so easy to transfer from Lisa to Alice, when it's realized that Alice is more mysterious than Lisa and Alice really embodies the Eternal Mystery. The film is ultimately "made" by Romane Bohringer. She is so intriguing that she outshines Monica Bellucci, which really has something to offer, considering that Bellucci is a knockout beauty, while Bohringer is what the English call "simple". However, Romane Bohringer had already mastered the art of 'dominance of the personality' at this early stage, leaving beautiful girls on the line and not being noticed because novels are so intriguing that you can not take them out of sight enough, to look at the beautiful girls and all you have to do is think about them. Most of us remember her father Richard Bohringer, who many years ago was lying in the bathtub listening to operas in the movie "Diva". I would rather see novels than Richard in a bathtub, but it seems to be a genetic secret that fascinates, because Richard Bohringer is also fascinating and he is not even a woman. Romane looks like she's going to turn into Anna Magnani when she's a lot older, and that means she'll get an Oscar if someone can write only a 'rose tattoo' for her. The girl has so much passion for herself that she could set fire to the Seine. Would not it be wonderful if she and Julie Delpy worked together? This film made wonderful use of the locations of Paris. But where is this place in Luxembourg? It looked like place Furstenburg for me. Maybe I missed something. I have to watch the movie six more times, just to study the accuracy of the timing and the question of who passes by and make sure I understand it correctly. The whole thing is like ten gigantic chess games played blindfolded by a grandmaster. How exciting is it! Novels, you can always look through my window! Mimouni, come on, let's talk about impossibilities, improbabilities, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that is going on is invisible and how it affects the visible. Once again we have the spirit of Breton's novel "Nadja", which is embodied in a great French work of art. More! More! More!
