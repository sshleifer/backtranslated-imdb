Piper, Prue and Phoebe bring dr. Griffiths into the Manor to save him from the personal assassin of The Source, Shax. While Phoebe is searching for a spell in the Book of Shadows to defeat Shax, Shake's Prue and Piper are attacked and chase him into the street. Unknown to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a reporter and their cameraman with their powers and broadcast live on national television. With Phoebe in the Underworld, Prue, Piper, and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage they have done. Leo goes down to Phoebe and tells her that the enchanters have been exposed as witches. On the surface, Piper is shot dead by a manic witch-wannabe, and Prue has to take her to the hospital. The problem here is that the crowds block the driveway. So Prue has to apply her magic to the crowd and they go to the hospital. Piper is declared dead and a SWAT team moves in. Leo learns of Piper's death and goes down to tell Phoebe. Cole is asked to ask the source to reset the time, and the source agrees; only when Phoebe turns to the dark side. Phoebe agrees, but the deal will destroy her. On the surface, Prue and Piper fight Shax. Prue calls to Phoebe, who is in the Underworld without their knowledge. Shax throws Piper and Prue through a wall and dr. Griffiths from a window. Prue will not be declared dead until the season 4 premiere of "Charmed Again, Part One". <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a gripping episode and I had to sit on the edge of the seat. Sorry that Prue is dead, but happy that there will be another five seasons of Charmed. My choice; 10 out of 10. EXCELLENT
