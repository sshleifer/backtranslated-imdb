I thought this movie is one of those great heartwarming gems. The plot is tight woven and the character development is fantastic! Anyway, I'm a big fan of non-US movies and that's on top with: "Happenstance", "The Closet" and even "King of Hearts". Vlastimil Brodsky as Fanda is fantastic. It's a love story in the truest sense of love life and twists and turns to make the viewer understand / enjoy Fanda's way of life (which almost costs him more than he's willing to do)) are wonderful. His co-star Zazvorkova is memorable as his lush wife. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family - my kids loved it.
