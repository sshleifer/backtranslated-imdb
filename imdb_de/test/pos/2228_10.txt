I remember watching this movie on TV in my late teens or early twenties - probably HBO. I saw it with my parents, a brother and some friends. Since that was about 30 years ago, I do not remember much about the story. I remember the whole group agreed that this is the funniest movie we've ever seen. When it was over, our bellies ached with so much laughter. My dad worked in a hospital, so it got better. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch The Party on TV, I check to see if it's there too. To my dismay this is never the case. Although I loved The Party, I think it's funnier. Peter Sellers was great as a criminal hospital administrator. Why it was never released on video is a mystery to me. It's a classic, but it seems nobody under 35 or 40 years was allowed to see it. I would buy it right away if they ever released it on DVD.
