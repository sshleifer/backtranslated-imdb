I've been in the Hitchcock series a lot lately. I think I always lend one of his films when I'm at blockbuster or Hollywood video. As I said, Hollywood loses touch with it incredibly, I had to be reminded that there are great movies. Not to mention, I want to be a movie connoisseur, not a movie fan. Is there a better way than with Alfred Hitchcock's films? <br /> <br /> The man who knew too much is another great and exciting thriller with Alfred's favorite leader James Stuart and the woman stealing the show Dorris Day. They play husbands and wives who go on vacation with their son, but when a spy James shares some information that might arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and held in ransom. James just seems to doubt Dorris and her ability to come up with ideas on how to get her son back, but she makes a great comeback and ends up being the hero of the strip. <br /> would say that Dorris was the one outshining the whole cast. James did a great job, and together they made you sit down and never move through the movie. I loved the little bit of comedy that Alfred added. You will see what I mean. I would highly recommend this movie, although it's not the best Hitchcock movie, it's still a treasure. <br /> <br /> 9/10
