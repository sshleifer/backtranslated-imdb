In the early 1960s, as was the case in Chicago, we follow a group of high school friends who navigate through the highs and lows of their lives. The two main characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs). Both guys have promising future prospects. Preach is a great writer, but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. When they're not hanging out in the local diner, shitting friends with friends, hanging out in a friends' house or chasing girls, they go to school, take the trains through Chicago, or go to parties at weekends.> <br /> Es Goes wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of engaging with two hoods and having fun in a stolen car. The police are following them and they are being arrested. Thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (Garrett Morris of SNL), they are released. But the two hoods are not and the oath to take revenge on Preach and Cochise, because they think they have blamed the whole thing for it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very episodic, but it still works because what life is is a series of episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The movie never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic and the situations are believable and understandable. Just as Preach romantically chases after a beautiful girl, or a party that becomes violent, when an asshole decides to start a fight, or deals with a daring younger sibling. But even if a situation is not personally relevant, like the guys who pretend to be covert policemen to make a little money out of some money so they can put all their friends in a movie, the sequence is still funny. <br /> <br /> "Cooley High" was the basis for the classic sitcom "What's Happenin!" which was aired on ABC from 1976-1979. Although the series is especially famous for the figure Rerun, it is not to be found in this film, and there is no figure in the distance as he is. The humor of this show was very wide, but still funny. The humor of 'Cooley High' is livelier and therefore more entertaining. <br /> <br /> Also, the soundtrack is wonderful. Classical songs from the days of Diana Ross & The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & Vandellas and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film, adding to the movie's fun, youthful, lush tone.
