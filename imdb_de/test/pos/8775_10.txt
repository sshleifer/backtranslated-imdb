I really liked this movie. I think it's a brilliant, underrated Alfred Hitchcock movie. Everyone knows the famous Statue of Liberty, but before that there is a really great movie. Robert Cummings is great in my biggest role, and the beautiful Priscilla Lane shows that she also has a lot of talent. But I think Norman Lloyd delivers the best performance. His character, Fry, is so evil and deceitful. Even if he does not stay long, the movie would not be the same without him. "Saboteur" is a great movie that every Hitchcock fan should see. I give 10 out of 10 !!
