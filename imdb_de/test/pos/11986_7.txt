You have to take Martin & Lewis like a pinch of salt & pepper. Why does Martin like Lewis? Why do all the women in this movie like Jerry? Because he is innocent personable! Martin sings some good songs (at least once with the lip sync) and Jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all his other films together. In general, I find that I can take so much of Jerry's antics before they get worse. BUT .... Watch in this movie if Jerry gets stuck on a Marine submarine out there! EXCELLENT! Buster Keaton could have been proud. I give the movie a 7.
