This film is a brilliant retelling of Shakespeare's classic love story, complete with "confused sex, body piercing, and dismemberment." It follows the same spirit as all the other Troma movies [except Combat Shock ... that jerk was depressing], but it's not just for Troma fans. Anyone who appreciates lowbrow visuals and a witty script will no doubt fall in love with this film. <br /> <br /> Do not expect a sophisticated, artistically-craven crap like the R & J version with Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio; This one knows that it is a stupid movie and draws its humor from it. The drama is also surprisingly good and you can just feel the pain of Sammy Capulet as he tries to get his brain back in the head. The soundtrack that includes many original and energetic bands like The Wesley Willis Fiasco, Supernova and The Meatmen are also awarded four stars. This movie should be seen by everyone as it remains faithful to the original story while still filled with Troma's trademark and sex humor.
