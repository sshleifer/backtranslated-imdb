I am surprised by the relatively low rating of this film. It's a screwball comedy and romance film co-curled by someone besides Billy Wilder, but he does a really good job and even won an Oscar even though she's no longer the young bomb she had in her early films she's doing a pretty difficult job. This movie proves that she had more talents beyond her good looks. Goldie Hawn, who won an Oscar in this first film, as a Supporting Actress, is Dentist's playboy's modern, sophisticated, but quirky newest lover, and she loves Walter Mathaw. Goldie is delighted with all the senses in this role that has made her a slam dunk for this early career award with a great cast. <br /> <br /> This movie is not really deep, but a gem that has stood the test of time very well. I'm not sure why the average is as low as I give him a solid 8.
