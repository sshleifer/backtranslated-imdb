This trash version of "Romeo and Juliet" is going through these days. Romeo (Will Keenan) is a hole and a violent member of the Que family, and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy (with beautiful legs and chest) and a bisexual girl of the Capulet family. The skatological situations that this romantic couple will encounter are very funny. Although it is a cult movie (including the Rio de Janeiro Festival), it is not recommended for all viewers. If the viewer is a fan of Peter Jackson's previous films ("Braindead", "Bad Taste"), "Toxic Avenger", "Body Melt" and other trash movies, he will surely love this streak. Otherwise he will hate it. Since I belong to the first group, I have eight votes. <br /> <br />
