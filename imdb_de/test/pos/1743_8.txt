I was very disappointed when this show was canceled. Although I can not vote. I live on the island of Aruba. I sat down to watch the show on Tuesday. And was very surprised that it was not broadcast. The next day I read on the internet that it was canceled. <br /> <br /> True, not everyone was as talented as the other. But there were very talented people singing. <br /> <br /> I find it very sad for her. <br /> <br /> That they worked so hard and their dreams collapsed. <br /> <br /> It's a pity <br /> <br /> Ariette Croes
