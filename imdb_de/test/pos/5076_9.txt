The film takes up the horror of "and now" the "rendition" with a transglobal multi-cast report of all involved. No one gets away easily because we see the blindness of the players as they cut out their own piece of the global game that breaks hatred and misery into their "enemies" and themselves. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the sympathetic Senator's Aide (played by Peter Sarsgaard in dazzling style) and the real Washington creators is electrifying. In the meantime, the new CIA man (Jake Gyllenhaal) is experiencing a completely new take on the coziness of torture found in the US. Suddenly, though his rejection of what he first tacitly sanctioned is, one has to wonder why, in the world, someone who calls himself civilized watches someone being humiliated and abused in this way? The film has few heroes - perhaps Gyllenhaal's flawed and wavering CIA man is the exception and a necessary legacy to make the film a glimmer of hope. <br /> <br /> The sad fact is, of course, that this movie is not the case fiction at all, but a wake up call for those with a touch of decency in them. The terrible truth is that we have lost the moral conspiracy in Britain and the US and this film shows how deeply we are ready to go. All in the name of freedom! There is a wonderful line in the script that says torture is a sure way to increase the number of our enemies. This is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message this movie delivers and use our power and money much smarter !! The message seems to be that any of us who claim that rendition, torture and abuses of fundamental human rights are necessary to protect our way of life is as false and stupid as the jihadists and suicide bombers. Everyone praises the sensitivity of a talented South African director for the gross injustice of power and a cast of mainstream US and beyond actors. By the way, the movie has a sting in the tail and the end is a smart and thought provoking surprise (which I will not reveal). <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie in an early London preview so not yet written extensively, but I'm glad to say that the series of less than glowing reviews seems to be spinning. The BBC rating has been very much supported and they (and I) suspect that many of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specifications of Hollywood - where the good and the bad are cardboard cutouts. Therefore, many of the really great films of the year are increasingly indie and / or non-US images.
