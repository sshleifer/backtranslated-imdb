Since 1981, Nintendo has been developing great video games like Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would get boring after 20 years. Nintendo games never get boring because they always add something new. It went from arcade games to Wii and I hear that in 2011 a new version of the Wii will be released. What makes Wii games so special is the fact that you are actually doing something instead of sitting on the couch and pressing keys. <br /> <br /> And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is scheduled for release in 2010.
