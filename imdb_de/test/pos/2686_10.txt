This show is incredibly funny! I started watching in 2007 and had never heard of it before. After an episode I was addicted. I'm never home to watch it, so my wife bought the entire series on DVD. Non stop laugh, do I have to say more? I wish it was still on TV because it's definitely worthy and much better when it's on TV. The name of Kevin James alone will bring a huge fanbase to every movie that guy is (make your stomach hurt) funny. <br /> <br /> Just a really good, down to earth, believable show. If you have the opportunity to buy it on DVD, do it, it's worth it.
