It's by the time "Kate Jackson" got her credit for this movie. I can remember that I saw him and tried to understand him on TV. My grandmother was in bed and died of cancer. I was barely 15 years old. Years later, Richard had died a long time. I miss him in the other shows / movies he was in. <br /> <br /> I still have a copy of the VHS cassette, but it's NOT "CC'd" "or Closed Captapped for the hearing impaired & that's the ONLY bug in the movie I'm referring to today I can not remember a DVD or VHS copy that even has subtitles in English, so if anyone out there knows a copy of VHS or DVD that is CC'd or has English subtitles, please let me know . <br /> <br /> Thank you - Cofffeenut
