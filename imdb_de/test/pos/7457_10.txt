Duckman was a show that was played in the last hour or so before it was about ten years ago to sleep. It was a contrast to many childlike animations that I saw back then. I was still a little junkie for Disney and Looney Tunes, and most Saturday morning cartoons were still at the top of the summit since the days of Ninja Turtles and Batman. But even then, I began to realize that the more slippery, mature, surreal, obscene and (although I did not know the term at that time) satirical animated cartoons were more creative than what I was used to. Around the time of Beavis and Butt-Head, Ren and Stimpy and even The Maxx struck TVs over MTV. The US released two shows - one was Weird Science and the other was Duckman. I've always remembered a few key pieces from the show, and some of the lines are very quotable to those who have not completely forgotten it. Fortunately, I recently found a band with about six episodes that I recorded a long time ago, and the jokes remained very fresh. And the delivery of the jokes is often a quick fire in the better episodes. <br /> <br /> In the vocal department, the talent choices for the action are first-rate, which are usually just an excuse for rough, intriguing parodies of pop culture, politics, movies and TV shows and music, detective secrets and the dysfunctional family unit. Jason Alexander is a wonderful choice for Duckman, and his performance is a weird one out of his days on Seinfeld (though there are some similar features here and there). Also, the voices of Gregg Berger as unmistakably monotonous and dead Cornfed, Dweezil Zappa as an unrestrained Ajax and Nancy Travis as a sex-hungry, disgusting sister-in-law Bernice contribute all in full. Along with some great lyrics - even if a joke is not sure - the joke behind compensates - the animation style, while a distance from some of today's refurbished, computer-aided products is resourceful and often abstract. It has the homemade quality that Beavis and Butt Head or South Park would have later. And like these shows, when you're a little kid, I mean little like younger than I saw the show, you may not understand most jokes (ie there are enough stripper and VD credentials to sometimes fill two shows ). , But it's imaginative to watch TV late at night, and it works pretty well in that time window. You can only hope for a DVD box. <br /> <br /> So, to anyone who has barely or never heard of this program, here's a general note: Think of this show as if Dashiell Hammett met with Walt Disney and decided to enter the slum section from Vegas to go with a free mini bar and a collaboration in the spirit of Luis Bunuel and the Simpsons. Not to mention that it made the Rugrats of the group
