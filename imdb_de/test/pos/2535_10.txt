The film begins with the director who speaks with the camera and says he'll be telling a story about Brazilian street children whose families live in poverty and have to steal and kill to survive. In fact, the main character (Pixote) was played by a street kid who was only 11 years old. What followed was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrible movies I've ever seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double count with "Black Orpheus") and never forgot it. I do not think I'd ever want to see it again - it was just too much. <br /> <br /> SPOILER FORWARD !!!! The scene that will not leave me is when Pixote meets a prostitute who has to abort her own fetus. You do not see that she does ... but you get a glimpse of what she got out of it. It's almost 20 years later and I just remember that the scene excites me. SPOILER END !!!!! <br /> <br /> The film gets more brutal the further it goes and ends just like that. All the more terrible are stories like these, which really happened in Brazil in 1981 ... and still happen today. <br /> <br /> A cruel brutal movie ... but it should be seen if you can handle it. I am surprised that this received a rating of R - I have seen X-movies that are less graphic. A 10
