I saw this movie for the first time in the early 80's and we had it on Betamax. As we all know, Betamax chose the way of the 8-track band, sigh, it really had a nice picture quality. Anyway, I'm glad I found this movie again, I've been searching for more than 10 years! This film falls into the category of films like "Airplane": continuous jokes, oneliners, funny actions (body language). Mark Blankfield is absolutely funny. Unforgettable is his transformation from the shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll in the sex-crazy, partisan Mr. Hyde, complete with gold teeth, chest hair and gold chains. The part I loved the most was when he kidnapped the car from this poor guy and then drove to Madam Woo Woo's. Totally psychedelic experience without drugs! If you need a laugh therapy, this is the movie to do it. When I saw it for the first time, I had tears in my eyes and my stomach hurt because I kept laughing. This is a movie that I could watch over and over again. I highly recommend it.
