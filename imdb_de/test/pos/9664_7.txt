is not a bad movie, but the acting and the script can be better. I like this movie because I have a life that is like a good part of it in the movie. It's hard for a lost generation to lead a life in Romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else, and something else involves dealing with people with "bad habits" if you understand me, but that comes with the area , This movie represents me and I like it. I have a rage that I hardly talk to people, I live in a confused society and I can not fit in and I do not want to, and that's the story of the movie, if you like me understand the true movie if not, you will find it easy and cheap.
