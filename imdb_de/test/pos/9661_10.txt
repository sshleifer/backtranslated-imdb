My teacher did this movie. It is a new beginning. Look at it and you will not notice that it is a Romanian movie. The old boring style is over. Now it is something else. A postrevolutionary movie. It uses the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. You are unique. You do not even know that you are watching, you are simply moved across the screen and you feel every frame. Do not miss it, pay attention to the plot, but do not ignore the details. They make the difference between this film and the other Romanian films. You will hear music sometime. It is representative of a part of us, but it does not represent us. Please keep your head straight and release your body.
