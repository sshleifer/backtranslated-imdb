There are many things to admire about this film, but the one thing that got me above everyone else was the part of an eccentric hermitage, the kind that Hollywood loves and romanticizes, but absolutely convincing and unlike any character, I meet in the movie or in life. Also a very convincing and disturbing presentation of the Tourete syndrome
