Gilles Mamouni plays with the audience with the story of Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his greatest lost love (Monica Bellucci) just before he gets engaged to another woman. Mamouni uses many flashback sequences without warning. The best way to find out where we are in history is to look for the actor's haircut. Otherwise it can be very confusing ... Still a strong movie debut for Mamouni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (the 5th item, the messenger), and Monica Bellucci is a darling I can see so I gave 9 out of 10 ,
