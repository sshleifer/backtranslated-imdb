The last time I checked in, there was probably only one comment. I am very glad that now more people have caught on this film, and much more that you are digging it all. I caught this on the night of Christmas 2004, and I could not change the channel on my TV, though it was an Asian movie - and I'm sad, but really - very used to not giving any occasion any Hollywood products , However, I did that night and I deeply thank God for it. I could not get that movie out of my system - not that I tried or wanted to - and I'm still wondering in a most grateful way that such a great, beautiful experience came in such a way By the way, totally unexpected, like a Christmas miracle. Please, if you had the chance to visit this movie, buy it or rent it from Bootleg or whatever, but look at it. I guarantee that it will affect you. I'm not in time, but I'm far from finished with my assessment, so I'll be back as soon as possible.
