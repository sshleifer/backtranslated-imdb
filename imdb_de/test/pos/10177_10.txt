This movie warmed me so much. A real proof of the daily life of an actor in everyday life. It was truly a wonderful experience to share the actor's passion for film and respect for what he took off the screen. This movie is a reminder of everyone who chooses their dreams! Never give up! Hurray for The Stand-in !!!
