This was the second Cinemascope show Fox produced after the robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets for Egyptian sets are replaced. The film is produced with first-class elements, beautiful photographs and a rousing soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you know which composer has recorded certain scenes). The main behavior, however, is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as a one-eyed slave and the Polish actress Bella Darvi as Babylonian seducer "Nefer". I think this film is generally strong on the action, which is rare for these big glasses. All in all, the film is an interesting and entertaining task as a social commentary on what the Egyptian society might look like.
