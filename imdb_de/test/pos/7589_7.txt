Each Sunday is an 11-minute short topic featuring the talents of two young contract workers who will become players in the future. It's interesting and entertaining to see the contrasting styles of Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin at a Sunday concert for Deanna's uncle. Of course no one knew how big these two young ladies would become. I've always wondered why Mayer kept Garland and let Durbin go to Universal. POUND. I've always had a claim to culture, and this was the guy who had Jeanette MacDonald in his studio, and later made beautiful soprano voices like Jane Powell, Ann Blyth, Doretta Morrow, etc. Career at MGM, but she paid a heavy price for it. Deanna kept universal pictures together with Abbott & Costello and some Gothic horror monsters. She was smart enough to come out at the top and stop her. <br /> <br /> So on their salad days Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.
