I saw Le Conseguenze Dell'Amore at the Rotterdam Film Festival 2005. It was the first of ten films that I saw there. Le Conseguenze has left the strongest impression of the ten films. From the first shot you know that the movie will be special. The beautiful camera impressed me, what you can do with a camera. The music is also comparable to the visual elements and complements the colorful and stylish, architecture-like images. Toni Servillo plays the main character of the film, Titta. He is a tax expert who has gone wrong and lives in a hotel. Every week he brings a suitcase of money to a bank and the story goes around it. <br /> <br /> He is always very controlled and shows almost no one; Looks calculated and well-dressed. He has a habit of ignoring people who are irrelevant to him. For example Sofia (played very nicely by Olivia Magnani), who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives. Although she has worked at the hotel for two years, he never greets her, even if she greets him. One day she confronts him with it and the next day he sits at the bar, instead of his usual place at the window. From here the story really starts and will unfold in a strong history of love, sacrifice and mafia. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the rest of the movie. Watch this movie if you love stylish movies like David Lynch, The Godfather, and so on. Do not see that if you're an action fan.
