Guest from the future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, the struggle between good and evil - all with a small budget, children's actors and few special effects. Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth grader Kolya "Nick" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a rundown building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poems that are all friendly to each other and people enjoy all the technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows people and animals to read the thought. The device can be used both well and badly, depending on which hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates of Saturn, who want to dominate the universe, want to steal Mielophon, it falls into the hands of the schoolboy Nick of the 20th century. With the hot pirates it goes back to his time, followed by the pirates and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the hapless pirates try to mingle with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick is in and demonstrates superhuman physical education skills. The catch is, Alice does not know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. In addition, the pirates can change their appearance and literally become everyone. (Hmm, I wonder if James Cameron had the idea for Terminator here ...) Who comes first to Nick - and to Mielophones? Excellent storyline, non-stop adventure and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood had made kids movies like this ...
