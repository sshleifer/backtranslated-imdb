My brother hooked me on Carlin in the 70s. I have always loved his observation humor. This means seeing things and finding humor in them every day, such as the question, "Have you ever tried to throw away an old garbage bin? You can not do it! They keep bringing you back!" And asking questions why the word kill is more acceptable than the word "F", while the prefect makes sense in the discussion. <br /> <br /> In the 90s his stuff was less funny and annoying. What he seemed to do was to put a mirror to the face of society and say, "Look inside!" At the time, his shows were less of a comedy show and more of a grip session. But in all fairness, he always made a very big sense. He really made you think. <br /> <br /> Here Carlin was old and new. It starts with the fun one can have when one grows old and later strikes the state of the world. Again a perfect feeling. <br /> <br /> This has been his best since "Jammin 'in New York", and it turns out to be the last one. <br /> <br /> I think what "The Shootist" was John Wayne or 'A Prairie Home Companion' by Robert Altman: 'It's bad for Ya' is George Carlin. A heartfelt goodbye to a really great icon. Love him or hate him, I think he will be remembered.
