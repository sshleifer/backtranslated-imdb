This year's Royal Rumble was not really bad, but the last year was definitely a lot better. <br /> <br /> FIRST GAME-SHAWN MICHAELS VS. EDGE Even though this match took a bit too long, it was fine anyway. Edge wins after attaching Shawn Michaels to the ropes. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND GAME ENTREPRENEUR VS. HEIDENREICH IN A CASKET MATCH I do not really like casket matches now, this match was boring and sloppy, but in the end the pace increased as Undertaker nailed the tombstone and then rolled Heidenreich in the casket for victory. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD GAME JBL VS. KURT ANGLE VS. GREAT PRESENTATION IN A TRIPLE SPEED FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad match with three threats. Too bad that JBL wins again to retain his title after pinning a clothesline on Hell on Angle for the win. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH GAME RULES ORTON VS. TRIPLE H FOR THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONSHIP Great match between these two men, the match was a bit sloppy, but it was still good and it turned out pretty well towards the end. Although Orton had lost, the game was fast and great towards the end. HHH is setting the pedigree to Orton to receive the world championship title. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH GAME SERIES That was a cool Royal Rumble {Every Royal Rumble is good}. After all 30 men entered, the last four remaining superstars were in the Rumble Cena, Edge, Mysterio & Batista. Edge was able to spy on Mysterio, and Batista and Cena clad Edge. It was Cena & Batista now. After Batista undone an F-U, she went to the Batista bomb, but suddenly both men collapsed on the outside at the same time. After a controversial decision, Mr. McMahon made his way to the ring to clarify the matter. The game was played again as Batista & Cena, but Batista got the best out of Cena, hit a spine buster and threw Cena out of the race to win the Royal Rumble 2005 and on to Wrestlemania 21 to face the champions in the Main Event deliver . 10/10 This was a very good Royal Rumble, but last year would always surpass a Royal Rumble in history. <br /> <br /> All in all: I give him 8/10 & B +
