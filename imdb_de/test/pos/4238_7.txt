This is a 100% improvement over the slag of a third movie and it's a damn good time. This is a John Hughes movie that hits The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really is the savior of the show. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes makes this movie shine again. Actually, they are the only good parts of the movie. The scenes of Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable left me pretty bored. It's as if they were thrown in as a deflector and as someone who would save the day. But Chucky and Tiffany were great to look at and I really liked the black humor. I thought it would make the movie more stand out. If you want to spend a damn good time, you should check this. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
