I want to leave out my displeasure at NBC Canceling Las Vegas. The show has been first class in the last 5 years. Tom Selleck's encore was great. He really brought a nice change to the show. What does NBC have now? Lame reality and night game shows. I mean, come and hold the old and tired law and order? Not even putting Jack McCoy as a DA can keep the show interesting. Gee let us keep a quality program like Deal or No Deal or ED? He should be put on the pasture. NBC is worse now than in the days of Pre Seinfeld Cheers. With cable and internet, NBC can not afford to fall flat on his face. I remember when the murder life on the street ended like this. At least they had a two-hour series finale. Hey CBS are you listening? Please pick up Vegas, it's a great show.
