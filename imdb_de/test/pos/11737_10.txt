Cliche romantic drama film with a very simple plot, but very good cinematography and screenplay. The script, direction and drama were also good. The flow of the film is somehow manipulative, to bring the audience to tears by the excellent love music and circumstances, but works later after the movie, it feels like raped in a way. Jones makes her character very memorable and amiable. A deeper story might have taken this movie to a higher level, but nevertheless the film provides for its genre for hopeless romantics, big love story fans, big soap drama fans, 50's cinemascope cinematography fans and fans of the main cast .....
