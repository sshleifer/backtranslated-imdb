Martino, a young teacher on the island of Elba, was founded by Maestro Fontanelli, an excellent educator, to be his own man and to say whatever he thinks, something that puts him in trouble at school we first get to know him teaches revolutionary ideals. The island is in a frenzy of the arrival of one of the most influential men of European history of the 19th century. Napoleon comes into exile, not exactly a highlight in his life. <br /> <br /> With surprise, Martino is chosen to accompany Napoleon, who writes his memoirs and needs help for his own project. The young man comes from a maritime trade family. His brother and sister want him on a commercial expedition, but Martino has decided that his place belongs to Elba because he will try to assassinate Napoleon. Little detests him after his mentor Fontanelli was tried for treason and shot by a firing squad. Martino finds comfort in the much older Baroness Emilia, a beautiful woman. In his own interaction with the deposed Emperor, another man appears. Napoleon is seen as a more human person, who really enjoys the company of Martino, without suspecting with the plans the young man's own plans for him. Unfortunately, Martino can not put his design into action, as Napoleon has other plans. <br /> <br /> Paolo Virzi, director of "Caterina va in citta", shows why his early promise is still there. Mr. Virzi also collaborated with the script based on a novel by Ernesto Ferrero. The director shows that he is so good in both the intimate drama and the spectacle. Alessandro Pesci, the cameraman, does an excellent job with the pictures he was able to get. <br /> <br /> Elio Germano, a young Italian actor, is the best in the movie. He plays against experienced players, but he manages to convince us that he is the idealistic youth who seeks to find justice for what he considers a noble cause. The great Daniel Auteuil is a more subdued Napoleon than one would expect from an interpretation of this larger-than-life man. Monica Belucci is the love interest of Martino, but she has little to do. Omero Antonutti plays Fontanelli.
