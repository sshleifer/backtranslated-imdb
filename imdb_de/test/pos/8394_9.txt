I'm a big Gone With The Wind Nut, but I was disappointed that both Gone With The Wind and Scarlett and the mini-series are so different from the books. Gone With The Wind left so many things in the movie that were in the book, and they did the same thing with Scarlett. Both were good movies, but I liked both books better. There were so many characters in Scarlett, and the ages of some characters did not seem to agree with the book. The timelines also do not match. Scarlett realizes that she is pregnant on the ship to Ireland in the book, but she notices it when she vomits in Savahanna. Also, Sally is an ugly monkey like a woman in the book, and the movie has cast Jean Smart for her casting, which is obviously not an ugly woman. All in all, Scarlett is a good movie and will help anyone disappointed in how Gone With The Wind ended up seeing what would have happened if Margaret Mitchell himself had written a sequel.
