There are a few things in life that we can experience only once and the college experience is one of them. Especially when we live in a foreign country and in an apartment with 6 Wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier, the lead actor, leaves his tidy life in Paris, his former hippie mother and his beautiful girlfriend, and goes to Barcelona to learn Spanish to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a French doctor and makes friends who make him see things differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the housemates) comes from England, the movie becomes a lot funnier. Well, Xavier starts to see things differently with all his new friends, and he probably lives something he will never forget and change his life forever. All in all, a very nice nostalgic film that is even more interesting due to the multinational cast. I found it very interesting to see all these children from different countries, all speaking different languages ​​and having different cultures and having fun together. I rated it 9 out of 10 because I left the theater with a smile on my face and thought about things I did not do when I was in college and would do it before it's too late ,
