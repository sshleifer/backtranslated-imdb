Vincenzo Buonavolunta, a man who has worked for years in a steelworks, as a maintenance man, the Italian owners sell to the Chinese, comes at the end of the meeting, where the purchase is arranged, because he wants to communicate the new buyer of a mistake, he has discovered and he thinks he has the solution. He is not very popular with the Italian management or the new Chinese owners. He even fights with the translator for the exact term he wants to use to express his concern. <br /> <br /> Next we see that Vincenzo arrives in China and tries to contact the new owners. To his astonishment, there is a new controller when Mr. Chong, the man he wanted to warn in Italy, was released. His next job is to come to the woman who was the translator Liu Hua. He finds her working in a library, but she tells him that she unequivocally accuses him of being fired from her position. Liu, seeing the despair of Vincenzo, agrees to accompany him in the search for his steel mill. <br /> <br /> So Vincenzo and Liu begin a journey through some of the desolate landscapes that lead by train, steamboat, bus and truck to remote parts of the vast country. Finding the right factory proved to be elusive at best, but Vincenzo discovers a completely different life and finds a friendly soul who, despite her initial dislike of the Italian, does not hesitate to help the Italian. <br /> <br /> Gianni Amelio's film is a kind of travelogue. He leads the viewer into unknown territory. In some comments, Vincenzo is compared to Marco Polo, the great Italian traveler, although the similarities are not quite noticeable. The movie retains our attention in the early stages of the journey, but it gets a little less enjoyable when Vincenzo is stranded after Liu's breakup. Mr. Amelio is an interesting director, as he clearly demonstrates with this film, for which he worked on the adaptation of Ermano Rea's novel, which we did not read. Sergio Castellitto is the only reason for watching The Movie. This versatile actor brings a lot to the film, which in a sense is a feat of strength, as seen in almost every image in the picture. The combination of Amelio and Castellitto proves to be a successful combination. Ling Tai, who makes her debut as Liu Hua, has some nice moments and shows good chemistry with her co-star. <br /> <br /> Luca Bigazzi photographed the Chinese landscape in all its desolation. We see a China that is not pretty as a picture postcard. Mr. Bigazzi captures all Greyness, typical of the areas in which the film plays. Franco Piersanti's score serves the film as well.
