Michael Radford, the director of "The Merchant of Venice", makes a major contribution to the opening of the play, as it makes it more accessible for anyone to spend a great time in the cinema when he receives this thorny account of a terrible time in the cinema Look at history. The lavish staging of the Shakespeare play is a visual treat with its rich detail of the Venice of the XVI. Century. <br /> <br /> This is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice as presented by William Shakespeare. After seeing the play a few times, we were not prepared for what to expect. Mr. Radford takes care of presenting the story in such detail that it can be easily understood by anyone. He also used a version of English that makes more sense than relying on the original text. The way Shylock speaks in the film is not a shock as he is a member of a minority marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church. Al Pacino is Outrageous Shylock's portrayal shows a man who is vulnerable, arrogant, vengeful, mean and totally human, all at the same time. Mr. Pacino sheds light on the character of the man who is defeated by a technician in court. His own daughter has left him, and his whole world seems to be embarking on him. At the end of the film, we see a man who has been reduced by everyone to the goal of hatred and ridicule. Lynn Collins, as Portia is a happy discovery. She has seen her on a lighter fare and not only surprises, she also makes the most of her role and time in front of the camera. She shows us that she is a high intelligence woman who helps her husband and best friend who risked his own wellbeing when he tried to help Bassanio get Portia's hand. Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, the man who seeks Shylock for a "bridging loan". After all, he knows that his ships will soon return with wealth from abroad. Antonio gets much more than he wanted to agree with Shylock on the terms of the loan. Antonio's best plans are misleading when he suddenly fails to fulfill his obligations. Mr. Irons makes a subtle performance. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fiennes makes a good showing as Bassanio. His good looks and charm impress Portia, who clearly sees a soul mate in this young Venetian, knowing that he is the one for her. In smaller roles, Kris Marshall, Zuleika Robinson and Charlie Cox also contribute to making the film a pleasurable experience. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is the triumph of Mr. Radford for the vision he has given us of Venice and its city citizens during a terrible time in human history.
