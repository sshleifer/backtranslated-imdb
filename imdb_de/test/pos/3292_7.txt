This was on an odd movie. I liked the adventure, although it is aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the protagonist murders a federal official. Then he is a refugee while fleeing. Later, they blow up his house and commit suicide. It seems like they should have just made a movie for a more mature audience or more family friendly.
