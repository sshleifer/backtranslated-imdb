I'm a big fan of Indian films, especially Malayalam and Tamil. <br /> <br /> Shame on India for not sending this movie as an official Oscar. I saw this movie, and it clearly showed me the maturity of Tamil cinema in its screenplay and narrative that makes Bollywood better. On the way to all of us who are Westerners, the Tamil Cinema is of high quality and different from Bollywood, which is all about good looks, glamor and promotion. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, what does India think when they sent a movie like "Devdas" to the Oscars? That was really a masochist. I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges overthrew Lagaan last year. <br /> <br /> 'Devdas' is just a brutally colored but stale and predictable melodrama of love, destiny and destiny. I would stay away from it. However, if you do not broadcast a film like Kanathil Muthital, you will see how much change the Indian government needs to save it from poor administrators lacking in intelligence. Now I know why this country has so many problems. They are very talented but are not presented properly.
