After nearly 12 months of hype about his upcoming production, Jesse finally delivers the dark world of the Internet with more than a brilliant approach to amateur filmmaking. <br /> <br /> DBP is an original biting commentary to a disturbed child that is growing into an even more disturbed adult. If I had more than two thumbs, I would give more, but I think two will be enough. <br /> <br /> Great work from all the actors, especially from Marissa and Elizabeth, who has given the character of Emily as an adult. I'm shaking so far and I'm scared to see where she's going next. <br /> <br /> An excellent watch
