I ran to the library to watch this mini-series, having just listened to the wonderful "talking books" unabridged version of the book. The first half of this TV version is really good, but it stumbles pretty much in the second half. The relationship with the trustee is overplayed and conflicts are inserted between Jean and Joe, which do not exist in the history of Shute, which in my opinion is unwise as they greatly diminish the power of their love story. I was disappointed to find that the wonderful Bryan Browns Joe looked a lot bolder and less appealing than the man in the book, but Helen Morse's Jean was really good. I think they needed to do this 10-hour miniseries to get the Outback story right. But all in all, I took the whole thing in more or less a step and appreciated their merits, while always wishing someone would make a less soapy remake.
