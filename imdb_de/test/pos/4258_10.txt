The movie was filmed at the height of the Black Power movement and shows how African American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) is made the CEO of a company after the white CEO dies (the white executives hate each other and can not decide who the Success should be the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization. I do not know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! "Putney Swope" is the ultimate bang in America's power structure. That's what Richard Pryor seems to have come to mind. This is a comedy classic in the truest sense of the word. A true masterpiece. Hilarious
