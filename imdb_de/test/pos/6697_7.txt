A mix of alien and ghost busters? <br /> <br /> Starts very promising and then slows down to almost boring. <br /> <br /> LifeForce includes some fantastic special effects that you could do in the mid 80's. The story is intriguing, but in the end it gets pretty lewd. It was rated R because he was naked, sexual and bloody. The ethereal and wild (naked) beauty of Mathilda May is very evident throughout the movie. A bizarre movie and took a lot of time when it was made. <br /> <br /> This could have been a bigger classic with a better script, but unfortunately it was not a great hit, I think it was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Something went wrong, but it's still entertaining.
