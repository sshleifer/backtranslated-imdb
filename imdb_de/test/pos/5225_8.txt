It is quite enlightening to see and appreciate this today, how far we have come in the film-expected results, and to appreciate how many ideas of bedrock were formed. <br /> <br /> Here we have a full funky narrative film - the audio and visual elements are brought to their limits. The frame is limited to about belt height and height - no close-ups. <br /> <br /> The compositions are remarkable; There is an early cross-cut scene to present the dialogue. There is a treacherous descent into a ravine with some shattering angles of perspective; A sun-bleached skeleton lies in the dust while the wheels and legs march in the upper part of the frame. The tension in the showdown between the hero and the evil is visually captured by spinning over the long axis of a large tree lying between them. and so on and so forth - early visual treats abound. <br /> <br /> Today it is disturbing when the young Wayne is wearing a movie that is not burdened by ego or manners. I have to wonder if Walsh recognized the self-reference: the theme is the journey of a different group of pilgrims; Those who appear on screen are a diverse group of stage actors, variety comedians, shell game artists, and probably Carny barkers and ten-in-one show veterans. They all work together to find out how films should be made. <br /> <br /> This is worth at least one visit to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later films.
