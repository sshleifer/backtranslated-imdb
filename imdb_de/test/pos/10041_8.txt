Errol Flynn showed off his best as Robin Hood from the west. He fought military bureaucracy, Confederates, Indians and rogues out of carpet bags alone for his great and final heroic end. Not to forget the always reliable O. de Havilland as Lady Mary of the West. Never try to relate this story to the facts and the real people. It does not work. Just enjoy it, because no one claimed to make documentaries when Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn worked together.
