A nice little movie about the introduction of cinema films in China. Capture the astonishment of the film's first audience described as having been worldwide, using actual Lumiere films for the most part. I do not agree with other people that the British scholarship has played badly - I thought he was fine, but the Chinese lead really stole the show. In any case, I found myself through most of the movie with a smile on my face. People who fear subtitles may find that much of the film is in English (which is subtitled for some reason, as well as to the Chinese on the DVD).
