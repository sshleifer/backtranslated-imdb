Now I'm a bit biased because I'm a big fan of late-night TV. I have been a loyal fan of Jay Leno for 6 or 7 years and think he is one of the funniest and most talented comedians. And David Letterman is also a damn good comedian, although I have his show (except Jay is just a repeat) only during commercials or when he has a better guest than Jay on the show. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are both good actors and they looked very much like Jay and Dave, but did they disappear in the characters? Nope. Roebuck barely nails Jay's voice and facial expressions, murmurs at high pitch and sounds like a marathon brando. Higgins nails David's facial expressions (such as his trademark), but Dave's voice is not recorded. Those who are not big fans of late-night TV may be less biased. There are a few comedians who can imitate Jay. Why could not they have chosen one of them for the role? And the same goes for Dave. I'd prefer Norm McDonald played the role. Norm does not look very similar to Dave, but he has a great name as SNL. "Hey ... do you have chewing gum?" That was so funny! <br /> <br /> However, I learned a lot about the late-night wars, of which I knew very little at first. I've never seen The Tonight Show in front of Jay Leno as host, so I did not know anything about the fight to finally replace Johnny Carson and the countless negotiations that eventually led Dave to switch to CBS. I knew very little about what was happening behind the scenes, and found the film very enlightening. And Kathy Bates gives a knockout performance as the foul-smelling ex-producer of "The Tonight Show." She basically steals the movie. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10) <br /> <br />
