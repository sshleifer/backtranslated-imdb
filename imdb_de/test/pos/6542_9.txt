This is a top car movie (it's a work of art / YER a work of art!). All classic cars are not a fantastic plastic. I have looked at him over and over again. I have worn two videotapes and will carry much more. Many more car lovers, young and old, will love this movie and see it more than once! So rent it or buy it (just watch it) I wish they would make more (auto-) movies like this V8 power that gassed not small whipper snippers !!!! <br /> <br /> (she has a 351 right?) (motor magic) (the heap of carriages) <br /> <br /> (you need to learn to feel the power)
