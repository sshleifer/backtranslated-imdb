Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine fantastic writing, great production, and an emphasis on clever ideas over youthful papers. The two stars work great together and - what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Bringing "Irkel" and Lee Majors into the film were brilliant accents. Watch this movie with your kids. If you do not laugh, you must not have paid attention.
