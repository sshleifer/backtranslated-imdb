Everything about "Choose Connor" was top drawer, especially the script and the very good work of the 21-year-old director, writer and producer Luke Eberl. , , a talented young man, from whom one can expect great things. The whole action was credible, the dialogue was wise, the topic important. Loved it !!! <br /> <br /> I saw it at the Woodstock Film Festival 2007, where it was shown twice and had a lot to do with the audience. It's more than just a movie of coming - this kid learns a hard, heartbreaking lesson on trust, politics, and "the system" - how things really work to suit the personal agendas of those in powerful positions I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a functioning brain.
