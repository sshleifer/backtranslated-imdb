This is the biggest movie I have ever seen. Davey / Mr. Slaussen is at the same time: <br /> <br /> 1) Tormented by his talents (eg "I can control it, I can! I should not have to, I think it's good!") ; <br /> <br /> 2) Desperate to find friends, eg. B. <br /> <br /> "What is the soup? <br /> <br />" The soup is very good. "<br /> <br />" Would you like some crackers with your soup? "<br /> <br />" I'd like more crackers. "<br /> <br />" How is that? "< br /> <br /> "Yes, the soup is very good." <br /> <br /> 3) Proud of his accomplishments (eg "Pretty neat trick, right?") <br /> <br /> 4) A lady-man (eg "You are so pretty, why do not you like me?") And <br /> <br /> 5) Sometimes very, very angry (eg "You can not get away!") <Br / > <br /> Connors should have won an Oscar for Best Actress for this film, I mean, who was better?! Tanya Roberts got into the Stratosphere after her appearance in TT The stars of this masterpiece no longer had brilliant careers, I recommend it very s film! It is available on amazon.com Everyone should own it Make a night out of it and take a bowl of soup while you watch.
