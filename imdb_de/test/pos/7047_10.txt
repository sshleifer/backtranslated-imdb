I saw this movie for the first time in the mid-80s and thought it was a funny movie. As I got older, I watch this movie for a variety of reasons. I like to look at it when I'm sad / nostalgic about my "lost youth". I was a teenager (14) at the time of this movie's release, so I can identify with many of the issues / dilemmas that campers / CITs have in this film. I enjoy seeing the clothes worn at that time and hearing the same old legends from the city, as the canoe tour said overnight. The movie is also full of funny liners. I can recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the late 70s to early 80s.
