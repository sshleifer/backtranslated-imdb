People need to learn to see what's on top of the screen. This is a great movie based on a slow, meticulous collection of details designed to identify the personalities of these two men. The passivity of Yusuf (Emin Toprak), the country's cousin, is well described by his fear of talking to women. He has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman, and loses all. He has many decades of bachelor's thesis and maybe even unemployment. Mahmut is another case. He came out of the town by working very hard (we introduce ourselves), and his resentment about loafers like Yusuf is palpable (he leaves crumbs on the expensive rug - the slob!). We see a group of friends talking about Tarkovsky, among other things, and we find that Mahmut regrets - but with a small regret - that his work has become commercial over the years. The gap between cousins ​​is widening. The subject of the mousetrap is wonderfully vivid and brings out the compassion and confusion of Yusuf, as well as the cold-blooded problem solving of Mahmut. Chabrol's Les Cousins ​​(the rich boy with Hitler's claim, played by Brialy, is always in my head) and Kiss of the Spider Woman (William Hurt can not figure out why they're all so mean). Nuri Bilge Ceylan takes his place among the dozen important directors who are now active. I just hope that in the future he will rely on employees instead of directing, writing and shooting his own films.
