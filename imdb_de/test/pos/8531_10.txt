You have to love this movie! I mean, what another Swedish Splatter movie could be so evil, bizarre and totally cruel ... The whole movie is filled with a weird sense of humor, like: The old Cencoreguy blows his head off and the boss just wipes the blood off his glasses and says in a mean voice: - They have shot !!! wouppie !!!
