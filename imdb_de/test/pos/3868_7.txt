Of course, the Simpsons started with the Christmas special "Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire," which had basic drawings and no loud jokes, but this episode is probably the first loud joke in it, and from here, the show just gets better. This episode is about Bart, who in this episode exchanges a test of Martin and goes to a school for highly gifted. As a result, Bart cleans his friendship with his father and loses all his comrades. The episode is very humorous and shows what the biggest show that ever came out is. The entire fans of the series will love this episode as it contains the characters exactly as they were 20 years later. Watch this episode in Season One's set and enjoy that Simpson does exactly what he wanted and make people laugh. I rate this episode at 73%.
