While all "Superman" cartoons by Fleischer / Famous Studios are excellent, "Billion Dollar Limited", the third in the series, is probably the best in terms of animation, plot and tempo. Why it was not even nominated for an Oscar as Best Animated Short for 1942 (incredible enough, just the first was) is inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Here Lois Lane is used for the transfer of one billion euros of dollars in gold to the US Mint. Masked gangsters in their super-powered (for 1942) car take off after the train, determined to get this gold. Without betraying too much, it's an exciting ride for both the characters and the audience, with Truth, Justice, and Superman victorious in the end. <br /> <br /> Like all butchers / famous superman cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who have played Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane on the radio, have the honor here, and butcher Staude Jack Mercer must be considered as Villain also do something.
