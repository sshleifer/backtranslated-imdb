I really like this movie. I do not just like it because it's a great movie from the early '80s with a great soundtrack, but I've found that it's a source of thought-provoking moments. They are only moments. not the whole movie. It's definitely not like "less than zero". <br /> <br /> The scenes deal with typical peer pressure and also with more difficult issues, such as the betrayal of trust. These problems are not easily solved or forgotten by the characters. Certain scenes will stand out and make you think about your own teenage experiences and how those experiences influenced the adult's character and looks and your own experiences. Or you can just watch out for the boys' aspiration to deflower themselves! :) Anyway, it's a good movie.
