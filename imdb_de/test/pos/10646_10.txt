/ * may contain SPOILERS, but of course it does not matter :) * / <br /> <br /> Battleship Potemkin is a breathtaking spectacle of haunting images. The visual orientation is (good and has always been) inspiring, the sheer volume of the film is impressive and the technique is certainly groundbreaking. What is really amazing, in my opinion, is the depth and effectiveness of a film, without the proper literary scripts, the sound (save the soundtrack), the decent image quality, the faux-deep (self-) referentialism of today, extraordinary spectacle, illusion, etc. What you get is a purely visual experience to remember. By the way, the previous poster stated: "Eisenstien felt a great deal of suffering to give the hero what they wanted, the problem is you think Eisenstein is preparing for a big final battle, and it's a little cheap, I'd rather have seen a big graduation scene. "<br /> <br /> I must warn you the end is not cheap and Eisenstein was not generous with the hero. The story, however, was. Potemkin really went through the squadron, as it was shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, anyone who was more or less seriously interested in cinema would definitely recommend Battleship Potemkin. See it with a filmmate who entertained me for hours. If you refer to movies that are generally considered "great" or "classic" as "slow" or "boring," this movie may not be right for you. Not much cheap entertainment here. <br /> <br /> For me it is a full 10/10.
