So WWE did it. They went into the movie, the first, See No Evil, with their own Kane. I caught this movie and did not expect it to be a great movie ... It just seemed like a clich√© and did not look new. To my surprise, it was not that bad. A viewer said above that it's fun to watch the B horror movie, and frankly this is the best way to describe it. The question I asked myself was how Kane should behave. Well, let's just say, he made the character "Jacob Goodnight" an absolutely bad ass. He sold the roll really well and looked really menacing. But what can you expect from someone who is almost three meters tall and weighs around 320 kilograms? The drama was decent and the story was not new, of course, but we all know that. The direction and the cinematography were very good and the hotel backdrop looked really dilapidated and good. Given that this was directed by a director of a pornographic film, I was quite surprised. I would recommend this movie if you are looking for pointless gore and murder and just some fun. Consider this movie as a modern day on the last Friday, the 13th movie. And also saves space for the end, because it is a good one. And even after the credits stay ...
