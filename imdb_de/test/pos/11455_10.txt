This movie surprised me. The opening balance sequence contains nicely rendered animations. Afterwards we plunge into a semi-dairy production and betray the low budget. The characters, typical American teenagers, are slowly being introduced, with more personal details than is normally found in films like this one. By the time Shlitz meets the fan, we know each of the characters and may or may hate them according to their individual personality. It's a slow climb, a sort of climb to a really big roller coaster. Luckily, as soon as the action sets in, it's Old School HORROR! Steve Johnson's make-up effects are fantastic. Equivalent to much larger films. And the fear shakes. Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie of all time, with groundbreaking surprises and sinister, exciting setups. The tongue-in-cheek, sometimes cheesy humor characterizes this film as a pure horror of the 80s, in contrast to the gritty tone of earlier genre-food such as "Night of the Living Dead" or "Hills Have Eyes". But for real horror fans this is worth a look. Play it as the first entry on a double bill with the remake of "House on the Haunted Hill" from 1999. The setup and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder which movie they actually made?
