A new man in a tank company is involved in an armor drop by his passengers to make quick money. The problem is that they really do not have a big plan, and when complications occur, things get deadly. First of all, the movie lasts less than 90 minutes, so the movie does not really have the time to get lost in the storyline. It turns everything on and just goes. Next, the movie has some great action sequences, moving you to the edge of your own seat. After all, the film has a stellar cast, including Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Lawrence Fishburne. It's a top-notch cast that sells and covers when stories come up short. <br /> <br /> This is not a brain operation. Worth a look.
