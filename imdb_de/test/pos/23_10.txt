Anyone who appreciates good acting and ringing dialogues will love this movie. It's from Ronald 'Taking Sides' Harwood and is a funny <br /> <br /> and ultimately shocking analysis of a relationship between two very "theatrical" types. Albert Finney is sublime as the despotic Shakespearean actor, barely noticing that the world war is raging around him, so he focuses on the crumbling fortunes of his theater company and his own psychological and emotional collapse. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtenay is second to none, just like Norman, the "Dresser" of the title, <br /> <br /> whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless. <br /> <br /> Really a must.
