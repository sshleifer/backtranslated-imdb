We all enjoyed the movie. It is a very charming family movie with many funny cameos. It was fun to see Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely, and Robert Earl Keen in the film, as well as filming of the famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially cute in the movie, but all the kids are good. The landscape in western Texas is great, as is the soundtrack full of Texan artists. The last half seemed a bit far-fetched to me, but my son was interested in the whole movie, which is not so often with him. Something in the plot was fascinating for kids. After showing calves as a child, I really liked the end. This is definitely not how it really works, unless you have heifers.
