I love this movie. I love everything about it. It has a great soundtrack, many recognizable faces and it's hellishly funny. There are so many acts in this film, and each one of them is funny in one way or another. <br /> <br /> Where Spicolli illuminated the screen two years ago, Drake is almost as memorable to a character. Everything he wants is fun. He moves out of the house without parental consent, he leaves work whenever he feels like it, he is obsessed with sex, loves drugs and alcohol, and tries to be a good friend. It is his lacquer-like attitude that makes him so happy. And he comes out with some great lines. And there are so many tiny observations that you do not see them coming, but they make you laugh with the speed when it hits you. A special moment is when Tommy and Bill talk about Bill's ex-girlfriend, who now goes out with someone else. At the end of the conversation, Tommy takes his huge beer bottle and casually casts it over his shoulder. He says good night and the scene ends. It's a perfect scene. Tommy's world is his own. He really lives to party and has fun. When the conversation is over, his time is over and he does not care who he insults. He has an innocence about him. "It's casual" is his favorite saying. <br /> <br /> Another classic scene is that Reggie Bill gives a donut. He says something to him that I and my friends will never forget because we rewound the film ten times and watched that part over and over again, hurting ourselves laughing. It has to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Wild Life is a throw back to the time when teen comedies were funny, wild, had a good ear, talked to us and wanted us to get lost in their world 90 minutes. Wild Life does all these things perfectly. If this is a movie you have not seen before, give it a shot. It is a classic. <br /> <br /> Also, find out about the army shop Jim is having trouble with. He is now a very familiar face and it is his first role on the big screen.
