I did not know much about this movie in which my roommates were involved. I was so pleasantly surprised! The action caught my attention and held it, and the characters are well drawn and realistic. The script is very clever and funny, and the performers do great things with it. And the best part is that it has managed to entertain without explicit sex or violence! If this movie happens anywhere near you, be sure to see it.
