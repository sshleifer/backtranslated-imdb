In 1972, when it was announced that the Dismissal would take place, there was a storm of controversy. This was an event that left open wounds in the hearts and minds of the Australian people. After a few changes (pay attention to the well-timed phones to disguise names), the dismissal was broadcast. It was nothing less than brilliant. The leads were perfect. Max Phipps as Gough Whitlam went first, closely followed by John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and the evergreen John Mellion as Sir John Kerr. Time was well spent, people's emotions were well done, and the political elements were not two-dimensionally transformed into melodrama than in so many American series. The dismissal was a faithful reopening of a time in Australia that some would rather forget and that we can not forget. She took no party and pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides. You want to keep up the anger and change the Constitution, which still makes everything happen. The dismissal is now available on DVD in Australia. Watch it, learn from it and get to know our modern history.
