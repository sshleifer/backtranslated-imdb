This film has an excellent condition and really wants to be turned into a Hollywood blockbuster. As far as I remember (and it's been several years since I saw the movie), the action starts with a London bus filled with people. There is a terrible crash and a passenger dies. The rest of the movie is then told in a flashback. 13 characters on the bus have researched their recent lives in detail. At the end of the movie, we return to the crash and find out which of these dodgy, lively characters has found a cruel end. Great stuff, a bit like a good tabloid made in precise, even hands. If it were only on video ...
