It Came from Outer Space II is a very good movie that has a good cast. These include Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Peña, Jonathan Carrasco, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Dean Norris, Dawn Zeek, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones, Iilana B'tiste, Jerry Giles and Howard Morris! The spectacle of all these actors is very good. Kerwin and Norris are really outstanding in this movie. I thought they were good. The thrill is really good and some of them are surprising. The movie is shot very well. The music is great by Shirley Walker. The movie is pretty interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and exciting movie. If you recommend Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Peña, Jonathan Carrasco, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Dean Norris, Dawn Zeek, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones, the rest of the film's cast, mystery, sci-fi, thrillers, drama and interesting action movies I urge you to watch this movie today! <br /> <br /> Movie Nuttballs NOTE: <br /> <br /> I've noticed this is the second movie where Dean Norris and Mickey Jones were in a movie together. The other is the classic violent epic Total Recall!
