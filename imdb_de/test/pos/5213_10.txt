The only reason I chose this film is because of the great theatrical talents of Karen Sillas (Alyson Haywood), "Bad Money," 99, who is closely associated with Gary Cole, '05, who is a great war hero and has every opportunity to make money, and never seems to have stopped telling LIES. Alyson and Dave are trying to rebuild an old house and bring it to a comfortable living. The relationship becomes annoying and Alyson decides to find out what's going on and the plot becomes very mysterious. If you are a big fan of Karen Sillas, this is the movie for you. I just wish Karen would appear in more movies, I miss her great talents.
