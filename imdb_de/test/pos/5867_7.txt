When I was very young, my mother had a series of four Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies short films on tape and I've watched them all several times. A Coy decoy was one of those shorts, and I was really shocked to read in another comment that it was banned. When I was young, I probably did not even understand the Black Beauty gag. This is probably why it was banned, though I did not remember the gag until I saw it on a video page. As I watched the video, I remembered certain shots - especially the shrinking of Daffy's hat and Daffy's eyes, which acted as a clockwork as the decoy circled it in the lake. The gag, which was probably the reason why the gag was banned, did not bother me. Instead, I was flooded with childhood memories that I had looked at so briefly. Since I liked this short time as a child, I rate it with 7 out of 10 points.
