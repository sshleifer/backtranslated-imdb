The best years of our lives perfectly capture the time of my youth and the feelings of that time. The cast was equally wonderful. This may have been Dana Andrews best role in his career and he should have been nominated for an Oscar. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie that it's almost impossible to list them all. Cinematography is one of the best films. This movie is a time capsule of what was in the 1940s. A must for every real movie fan. Some critics have said that this movie has aged. I do not agree with you. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles for veterans returning from the war will always be with us. This is just a great movie - one that can be viewed again and again.
