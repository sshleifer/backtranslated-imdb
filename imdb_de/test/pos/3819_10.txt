I first saw The Outer Limits at the age of 95 when I was 10 and it blew me away every week with every episode, every episode had a twist and every week I could not wait for the next one. How the authors managed to make each episode so good that they differed in seven seasons is unclear to me. This show teaches us something about life, robotics, encounters with aliens and humans and an insight into more paranormal and how it affects people. What makes this show really good is the characters in each episode, they really show emotions and are really good actors. What you will notice every week is an actor / actress you know from a past show that is pretty neat in its own way. <br /> <br /> If you want to relax, and sit back with a good sci-fi show, then the outer limits are for you
