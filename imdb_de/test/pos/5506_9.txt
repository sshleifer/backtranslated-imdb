Many people have said that this movie was not a good movie. From a horror perspective, I agree, it was not very scary, he had some cruel torture methods (yes, hooks that should not go there), but not scary. But it was a good movie from a comic perspective, I thought it was weird, so bad of Dee Snider with his stupid theological questions and every other word he said was "What is ____, define ____", then the angry mob In his house, where one of them has a sign that says "we do not take it" (that's a song of his twisted band), but I think the part that made me laugh the most was a man's wife, who was dead and dee snider held her up and made her dance when I saw that I was crying ... so I would not recommend this for avid horror lovers, but for those who love horror for their comedy, I recommend this movie 100%
