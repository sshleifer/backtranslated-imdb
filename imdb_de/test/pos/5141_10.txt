I brought my younger niece to an early show and she loved it (I enjoyed it myself). I do not have to explain the plot as the film remains completely faithful to the award-winning, best-selling book by the famous author Carl Hiaasen. The movie takes the popular book and layers it up with beautiful movies (I'd like to go to Florida now!), Humor (thanks to Funny-Man, Luke Wilson and some newcomers) and great music! I have to get a Jimmy Buffet CD now! I know that a movie is good when I get goose bumps in the end. Overall, it was a great family movie that made me feel good when I took my younger niece. I would recommend it to everyone.
