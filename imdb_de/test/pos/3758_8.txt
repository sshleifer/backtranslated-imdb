What a surprise. A basic imitation of the comedy classic "The Nutty Professor" is just more naughty. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as a Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men in Tights) is downright witty as the anal retentive dr. Jekyll and the sexiest Hyde. <br /> <br /> The one scene that's really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) Jekyll gets caught in bed with his daughter and says: <br /> <br /> "How dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter." <br /> <br /> Jekyll replies: "But sir, I'm moving on with the operation." <br /> <br /> Lanyon replies, "Oh, well, in that case, * your mind's out !!!"
