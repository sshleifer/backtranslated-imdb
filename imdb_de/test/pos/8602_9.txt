I have not really focused on the larger aspects of the genocide of history (though the terrible images are very powerful at the beginning). I was really excited about the human story of the girl and her family. Imagine, you do not live your life and do not know if you have a time bomb that is ticking in you. I was really scared that Yasuko was rejected by the bomb as "stained". The picture that stays with me most is when Yasuko stands in front of the mirror and combs his hair.
