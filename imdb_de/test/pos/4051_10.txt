In the '80s and mid-'80s, an OAV title "Bubblegum Crisis" (which I think is a military term for technical equipment rather than his drama) made his debut on video, referring to "Blade Runner," The "Terminator" and maybe even "Robocop," with a small shot of Batman / Bruce Wayne - Iron Man / Tony Stark and Charlie's Angels girl power for a good measure After eight episodes, the overall story was that in the 21st century in Tokyo, Japan, between 2032 and 2033, did live machines, so-called boomers, doing handicrafts and sometimes causing problems, but a special SWAT-like department of law enforcement agencies, the Advanced Police (AD Police), was formed to deal with the boomers largely ineffective, causing the millionaire scholar Sylia Stingray, the daughter of the scientist who had created the boomers, to create four powered combat pa dancers (hard suits) worn by women to fight against the Boomers and GENOM against the evil corporation that spawned the Boomers. This group is known as the Knights' Saber, and next to ringleader Sylia, she was one of the rebel women Priss Asagiri, a fighting rock'n'roll girl with a passion for motorcycles and a contempt for policemen, Linna Yamazaki aerobics instructor with an eye for money and the tendency to blow friends, and Nene Romanova, a young ADP officer and a seasoned computer hacker (the first in a long line). In the meantime, GENOM is represented by Quincy, a tall, skinny old man who happens to be owned by the company, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3), and an annoying boomer man named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD police detectives (Leon appeared in a spin-off / prequel anime, "AD Police Files," which I heard was very dark), her bald, overweight boss Chief Todo, Sylia's younger brother Mackey and a funny little mechanic named Dr. Raven, who apparently helps Sylia maintain the suits. Apart from the entire history of Knight Sabers & AD Police VS GENOM, there was another story involving a friend of Linna's, who was apparently a daughter of a large criminal family, the annoying Largo, who wanted to grab GENOMA, and different Priss-Want-Revenge. for an A minor character story. Oh, and did I mention that there is evidence that Sylia herself may have been a boomer? <br /> <br /> Well, it was a great clock, full of chaos and chaos and even some very nice pop songs, but that was not without its mistakes, some of which were unfortunately due to the series episode after episode 8 was set when she was originally scheduled for a total of 13 episodes. Thus, some of the storylines, such as Largo's scheme (or schemas), the family of Linna's unfortunate friend and Sylia's ancestry, were never resolved. Another problem of the series was that at that time Priss was the most popular figure. As a result, much of the series focused on them, and unfortunately most Priss-themed episodes essentially focused on Priss, who was selfishly seeking justice / revenge for some, a secondary character who had never appeared before, but happened to be a friend of her was, but she seldom went out for her, the knights' sabers, who always rescued her from trouble and for some reason took great care of her. His (just to be fair, she rescued Linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend was killed by a boomer, and the ADP acted wrongly in the investigation). This meant that we could not really focus on the more interesting background story of Sylia or even on the everyday antics of Nene and Linna. Linna had two episodes that related to her as her friend was with the Mafia family, while Nene had managed to catch the last episode for herself, showing that her eternal good mood was really good-humored and not stupid was. Nene also had to use her computer skills pretty well, or sometimes she acted just like a lovable stupidity, putting her screen time and character development over poor Linna several times, often overshadowed by greed and her tendency to eat friends to get their attention. Do not get me wrong, I like it and I love the overall concept, but it annoyed me a bit. This is also one of the runners-up for "worst English dubbing ever", which means you're better off with the Japanese. Some voices were fine (some really agree with their characters), but others were shallow and dispassionate or, in the case of Priss, really overreacted. <br /> <br /> Well, Tokyo 2040 is making good progress and is throwing everything out the window. A few years ahead, the story here is that after the earthquake of Tokyo earthquake, the boomers of GENOM have rebuilt the city into a great old paradise, except that the Boomers still have the tendency to fly out of the grasp of the AD -Police caused to form the knights saber are formed. The overall story is the same, but the characters' backgrounds and the look and attitude of the characters have changed a lot. <br /> <br /> 1) Originally, Sylia had short purple black hair and brown eyes dressed like a strict, neat business woman and was far from others. 2040 Sylia has a more supermodel look, provocatively dressed, and has white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (ranging from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally purple or gray). and even in 2040, Sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies out of her grasp when she's out of the public and may have even more secrets than before. Sylia does not take much risk on the battlefield as she's more of a guy staying in the mobile boxes, but she fights when she has to. <br /> <br /> 2) Originally, Priss was a small woman with an afro and a really bad temper. She always struggled with people who insulted her, biting off more than she could chew, and so on. 2040 Priss, however, took the path of the Clint Eastwood loner - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia, you could say) so that she is not really connected to anyone. Also, her hair is more stingy and feline (a big improvement), and she's clad in leather like Trinity from "The Matrix" (though she's less annoying than before, and unfortunately the writers eventually screw them together when they see their reasons hates for that hates the ADP). <br /> <br /> 3) Originally, Linna had this big black hair for her, but now her hair is shorter, tan and, well, more like the '90s. 2040 Linna is also an office lady who is unlucky with sexual harassment. To apologize for the way they were treated by the OAV authors, the 2040 writers dedicated Linna the first 6 episodes. She wrote her as a new country girl to the city, but decided to meet the Knights Sabers and win a place with them, which she ultimately does. <br /> <br /> 4) Originally a short red-haired girl who was often a victim of ridicule and had eaten lots of sweets, Nene is now a short blonde girl who likes to tease and take pot-shots with ADP detective Leon McNichol (revenge for him to play with her in the OAV?) And other characters, even her big sister Linna and Mackey, Sylia's "brother", with whom she falls in love with her. Cockey and arrogant, she still eats a lot of sweets and is a master chopper, but eventually she is bloated and outgrowing the status of her comic relief. <br /> <br /> 5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic, robust, handsome man with long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul from the Highlander of TV), replaces dr. Raven from the old series and now serves as a man who maintains Sylias hard suits. Nigel is also Sylias lover, but you would not recognize it by his appearance. He is a kind of father / big brother / mentor to Mackey. <br /> <br /> 6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course different. The original Leon was a tall, handsome boy, built like a baseball player with polished brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket and tight blue jeans. He always wore a revolver that magically packed more whaling than a howitzer when needed. He was not really a villain deep inside, but he was kind of an idiot, but mostly served as comic relief when he tried to romanticize Priss (just what he saw in her is a mystery), but occasionally he and Daley also served as guides to important plot points. The original Daley, too, was a rather muscular red head dressed in pink / purple suits because he was an extravagant homosexual character who always struck Leon if he provided no important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a handsome boy, but rather a typical, robust, tough guy with black hair, brown eyes, big, athletic muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dockers (he actually looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger) or maybe a bloated one Colin Farrell or Hugh Jackman), and he still wears a revolver, a BIG, but he is not as strong as before. Although Leon still has a certain attitude problem in 2040 (especially near Priss), he is not nearly as stupid as in the old series, but he has a bad temper and gets slightly annoyed by Nene and Daley (Also he drinks too much coffee). Oh, and Leon is still behind Priss, but this time he's much luckier. Daley is now a taller (but not as tall as Leon), a rather handsome boy with red glasses, a white suit, green eyes, and light brown hair, and he carries a big machine gun (he actually looks like James Marsden from the X.) -men films); Daley is much smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the OAV. Although it is not completely clear, his homosexual tendencies have almost completely disappeared, except for a moment of jealousy when Leon hears of Priss's email. <br /> <br /> 7) Brian J. Mason (what does "J" mean?) is back and Quincy too, but Mason is much more the main villain, with Quincy as his fellow villains, since he's no longer a huge terror, but a vegetable with a bundle of batteries and cables that are stuck in it. Mason is now wearing straight brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the OAV (he actually looks like OAV Leon in a suit) and he's very much of the Alan Rickman School of Bad Guys. <br /> <br /> 8) Although Mackey is a pervert in the first series, Mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, there are many things that will affect Mackey in 2040, but they will not be revealed here. <br /> <br /> 9) Sylia now has a companion, an Alfred the Butler guy named Henderson, who worries about her and the gang. <br /> <br /> 10) In the original series, boomers were like the replicants in Blade Runner. Armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, by 2040 they are more stupid monsters on the tide. Mostly, it's only big robots that do what they're programmed to do (hard work, fight, clean up, etc.), and they tend to go "villains," meaning they're trying to evolve and become monsters to be there. <br /> <br /> What remains the same, is the subject of Humanity VS technology (do machines have souls?). Unfortunately, although it's well animated and well-written, this series only runs 26 episodes, so it goes faster than you'd like, especially those of us who are used to more than a season of our favorite characters, and unfortunately it still ends on a cliffhanger with unresolved storyline bits (which I'm not going to talk about here.) What saves the show and makes it what it is is the characters, a colorful cast of screwballs made by Stoic loners, psycho-women and genocide rich madmen, policemen, sardonic intellectuals, wise old wise men and lovable innocents, much more varied than before and with much more rip off, are enough to make you wish this show would take longer. <br /> <br /> It's not great, but it's a good clock. Also the English dub (from ADV) is pretty good, though not without a few flat spots, but certainly better than the dub on the original.
