This is a pleasing movie. It is very realistic for the "wonderful world of music" that I have been there and done that. It shows a human element in every figure and the realism that nobody is perfect. These amateur musicians were not so bad players. The character of Cleavon Little, Marshall Tucker, was played very well. Marshall was not a saint himself. Here he was paid to do a job, and he makes it difficult for these guys to do anything in the van on the way there. They do not bite the hands that feed you. I can hardly believe that a player with his jazz experience knows none of the Dixieland melodies. He has a tremendous feeling of predicting chord changes to tunes he does not know. Not common, but not unknown. He gives a real and harsh message at the end of the film when he tells the clarinetist, "It's not a religion, surrender is not enough." He's right in that respect, though I think the clarinetist could have done the job. He practiced his butt and vocal music is not that hard to read. Very nice movie.
