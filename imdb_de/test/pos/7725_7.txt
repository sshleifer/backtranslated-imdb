This is a nice movie with good performances by Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaraglia. Of course, Vicente Aranda is a legend in Spanish cinema and certainly one of the great directors of Spanish cinema, but I do not think that's one of his best films, even if it's okay. The script plays with the introduction of Merime√© as a character, it's a nice touch, but it's incredible. The music is composed by Jose Nieto, the national Spanish prize for cinema. I mean, this movie is very good in all technical aspects. There are very good actors in supporting roles like Antonio Dechent, Maria Botto and others. I give 7 out of 10 points because I think this could be a better movie, but as it is, it's not boring at all.
