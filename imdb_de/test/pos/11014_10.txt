One of the best movies I've ever seen - a classic "Matrix" movie. For many years I try to get it on VHS or DVD - without success. The German film / TV industry still prefers to make valuable cultural contributions (and that's Fassbinder after all!) And collect dust in an archive instead of distributing it commercially (and earning a lot of money if that stimulates it they instead of promoting creative thinking). The WDR told me once, if I have paid 200.00 DM for the review of the copyright (not refundable), and then 8 DM per minute deduction plus the cost of the material. Then they will consider, one (only!) Copy for me. A way to sell something! We have the same problem with many other television films or series such as "So far the feet wear", "Sunday parents", "Kellerkinder" and others. Excellent TV series that will never be heard again. Germany, wake up! <br /> <br /> UPDATE March 2007: Last year I was finally able to get a DVD copy of the WDR "Mittschnittservice" for about 50 Euro. Great!
