The new voices scare me! Kuzco does not have to pass a frickkin academy to become an emperor again! It's the same thing over and over again, right? This is a children's show, right? Yzma turns Kuzco into something stupid, like an animal. He is learning a lesson. EVERYTHING IS THE SAME !!!!! David Spade and John Goodman never returned ... * sniff *! Nothing changes because Disney does not do anything about it. It's probably one of the most retarded shows ever! The first movie was so damn better! Malina is probably the only person I like. Kuzco is such a crybaby! Kronk has stayed behind! And Yzma's retarded ER (if that's a word at all)! What I wanted to say is ... how could you, disney ... why?
