The movie eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a pod system that is almost virtual reality. The only copy of the video game will be damaged if an assassination attempt on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is made. If it can not be repaired, the many years and $ 38 million spent on development will be lost. The only way to fix the game, however, is to actually get involved with the only person who they believe can trust (Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but it does not recover until very late in the movie. The best thing about this film was the twists and turns towards the end. Definitely worth seeing. 10.7
