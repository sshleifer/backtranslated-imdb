I saw this movie when it belonged to the Santa Fe Film Festival. Heavy movie! The presentation of a completely dysfunctional family brought to another level of extremism would have depressed me to the utmost, if not for very funny sight goggles and dialogues along the way that brightened the overall tone of the film. The relatively "uplifting" end gave hope to those affected by the original tragedy. Nevertheless, I did not go out of the theater to go to a fun party. The movie stayed with me for several days. <br /> <br /> Memories of "ordinary people" brought along, but humor mixed with tragedy. I found the acting excellent, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsh. How each character dealt with the tragedy was sometimes sad, self-defeating, but sometimes weird. Smart dialogue and situations.
