This is one of my favorite movies EVERYBODY ... I have seen it about a million times and would never refuse the opportunity to look at it again. In fact, I love it so much that I really wanted to see the resort where it was filmed on my upcoming vacation ... does anyone know what it's called? If yes, please email me !!! I saw this movie for the first time when it was first released, and I was about Nikki's age. For the longest time, I forced my father to take me along, because of course I expected the same thing to happen to me. It's just an amazing backdrop and a cute puppy love. This is an absolute must for DVD collectors!
