This calm and unpretentious Danish film is flawlessly directed, written, performed and filmed. He is an example of cinema at its finest, and if there is someone who can look at BABETTE'S FEAST without any fundamental touch, I am a person I do not want to know. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. In the 19th century, two older girls (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities and personal happiness to continue the religious ministry of their long-dead father in the small herd he served , One of the adolescent women's admirers sends them a Frenchwoman, Babette (St√©phane Audran), whose husband and son were killed in France and who fled their homeland so that she would not suffer the same fate. Although they do not really need their services, the sisters engage them as maids and cooks - and over the years their wisdom and tireless efforts allow the aging community to stay together, and the sisters can live in more comfort than they had imagined; In fact, the entire village admires and is dependent on them. <br /> <br /> One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now a rich woman in the village. The sisters know that their new wealth will return them to France, and she wishes them to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their small gathering. The meal and the evening on which it is served is indeed an unforgettable night - but not for reasons one might expect, as Babette's feast proves to be a nourishment for body and soul and is ultimately her gift of love to those Women who have eaten She is in and the villagers who were so kind to her. <br /> <br /> The film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in every detail, but not overwhelming in its presentation. As the film progresses, we love the characters both in their simple devotion to God and in their all-too-human weaknesses, and the scenes in which Babette prepares their feast and consumes the food are powerful, beautiful and unbelievably memorable. There have been several films that use food as a metaphor for love, but no one approaches the simple art and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things of humanity and proves the nourishment of body and soul. We recommend. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
