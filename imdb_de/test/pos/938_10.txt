It's almost impossible for me to get attracted to writing a scrupulous review of THREE COLORS: RED without alerting people to some of the ideas that Krysztof Kieszlowski explored in the last two entries of this intriguing trilogy. The more I see her and think of her and introduce myself to her world, the more I get her theme: that we are more connected than we would like to think of ourselves, and all it takes is a bit of fate some events set in motion. In BLUE, Juliette Binoche played a grieving widow, whose plan to live her life without connections to the past was to meet someone unexpectedly. In WHITE, cruelty leads to an unlikely friendship between two men who conspire against the contradictions in order to bring the perpetrator to justice and to reach the whole cycle. In RED, all of the elements of fate and apparent coincidence meet at the meeting of a young Geneva model and a retired judge who has a habit of plunging into other people's lives. <br /> <br /> This young girl is appropriately named: Valentine (a resplendent Irene Jacob) who has that charisma and even smiles openly while she works the runway. Not that she has no luggage: she has a friend who is not seen, who always wants to know what she's doing, she has a brother who worries her, and she rejects the progress of a photographer's image works for a huge billboard. She bumps into a dog while she drives and keeps her well, but if she takes her to the owner, a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he does not want her. "I do not want anything," he says coldly, and elements of BLUE suddenly show up as this arrogant man, who also lives in anonymity and seems to float freely, conducts surveillance of unsuspecting people. This male version of Juliette Binoche's character initially shocks Valentine - she says that she can only feel compassion for him when she leaves in horror, but a chance event has its back and here it begins to reveal who he is and his great loss. <br /> <br /> At the same time Kieszlowski unfolds a parallel story: the story of a young man, Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), who is about to become a judge, and who lives directly across the street from Valentine - but she miss again and again. Chance is the word. Like Valentine, who wins the jackpot in the food story she visits, elements of chance are her life and Auguste's. He has a girlfriend who also provides people with telephone reports about the weather. One of them happens to be the old judge. He knows more about her than Auguste and he never met her. Like God or Prospero, he slowly creates a storm that breaks the walls of this present state of correspondence and adds a new meaning to the phrase, "We'll meet again." It is this parallelism between the old and the young judge that makes RED so beautiful and transcendent, because time is actually much more fluid than we would like. There are people whom we encounter in life who, if we had been born in similar periods, would be so different. <br /> <br /> This is the case with Valentine and the old judge. I think there is definitely a strong bond of souls holding them together in a close bond: she is the woman he has not met - whether by accident or not - and whether he knows it or not, and tries to make amends Therefore, he takes the great risk of abandoning his surveillance and becoming a social outsider. But it does not end there. One of the many connections between the three films is the character of an old woman going to a big dumpster. Where Julie did not see her (and would not have helped her either), and Karol, humiliated by his public humiliation, mocks when she thinks, "Someone is worse off than me," Valentine helps her. Frailty in distress can happen everywhere, and Kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor character. <br /> <br /> Now RED is much more than a story. Valentine, the old judge, Auguste, even Rita, the dog: These are not figures that are limited by telling stories. An American version would ruin the idea and commercialize random encounters and even lead to a rundown ending. RED has so little linear, defined action that anything could happen to anyone, and the possibilities that this story could have been averted in so many directions if a crucial element had not taken place right at the moment and in the place. <Br /> <br /> The concept of characters that are reflected in time frame or location is the subject of sexual treachery. This is also an important and defining element in all three films: In BLUE, Julie's husband had a lover and she also reveals Olivier when it is clear that she is emotionally dead. In WHITE, Dominique Karol makes her moan over the phone (which becomes an important device in RED) while having sex with a man while the billboard of Brigite Bardot's CONTEMPT looks around. In RED, the story of the old judge of love and betrayal is reenacted. And all the while, Valentines's flyer appears as if she wants to know exactly what will happen at the same time that Rita, the dog Valentines car hit, wears seven puppies for the six main characters in this complex trilogy that was obviously filmed with the movie that has renewed life caring and love. Why do I say six? You have to see the movie and be surprised.
