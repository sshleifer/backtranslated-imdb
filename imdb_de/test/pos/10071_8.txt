That's no joke. Yes, "Who's That Girl" has the distinction of being one of Madonna's films being bombarded, but I actually liked this movie more than "Desperately Seeking Susan." In Susan, Madonna's character is banished to Rosanna Arquette's second fiddle and does not get much work. No disrespect to Rosanna, but in WTG Madonna plays this crazy, vile character that is only made in the style of the 80s. It may seem cheesy today, but it's actually one of Madonna's best and one of her most underrated films. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an ex-con who is sent to the Slammer for a crime She has not committed. She is released from prison after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underrated actor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the awkward task of picking her up from the prison to take her to the bus station. When these two come together, of course, the madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as a wealthy businessman who has a huge mansion with rainforest (???) on his roof in the middle of Manhattan. <br /> <br /> This film parodies everything. Rich people, the grubby characters who live in Harlem and completely destroy Loudens Rolls-Royce, the gay police officers who follow Madonna and Dunne in the city, and Dunne's fianc√© Wendy Worthington, who supposedly slept with every taxi driver in New York City played by Haviland Morris (Jake's girlfriend Caroline in Sixteen Candles). Hilarious! In addition, Dunne is responsible for a rare species of leopard reminiscent of "Bringing Up Baby". In addition, Madonna had a great platinum-blonde '80s look at the time and the movie has a great soundtrack. Throw all this into the mix and you have the zaniness of WTG. <br /> <br /> Madonna is the queen of the dead drama. There are times in the movie where she says a straight line and surprising that she is funny! So one of the best comedy should be played - directly. Madonna should have done more comedy, and it was a shame she did not decide. Later, she became much more controversial and became more involved in the dark, sexually charged roles in the notorious "Body of Evidence" and "Dangerous Game" films. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Madonna can not act, and that's a good thing, people have a right to their opinion, but I think the real problem is that people do not realize the difference between Madonna I still see only Madonna and that is the main reason why she has more respect for her music than for her films. It's still a fun, screwball comedy from the 80s. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you will not like it, so I would recommend it mainly for Madonna fans, but you never know, you'll be surprised and like it! <br /> <br /> Interesting Note: One of Madonna's New York club day friends of the early '80s, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member of the bands Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.
