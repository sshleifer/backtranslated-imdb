Hell to Pay is a bit bloody for my taste, even if it is not worse than in many movies. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the parade of experienced stars and the western landscape. But the story was very weak and I could not recognize the meaning. However, the music that accompanies the film more than compensates for the lackluster film. <br /> <br /> Where did the guys - Nate & Noah Cryns - come from, who wrote this music? They are amazing!! From the moment the music starts, it's far better than anything I've heard in years. I think maybe it's the best I've ever heard! Although the action in the movie did not impress me, the music aroused the emotion needed for each scene. I was put on the opening balance in time to the old west and really had the feeling to live through these old times through the music again. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a purchase and a visit to the beautiful music and a journey into the past to see the old western stars again.
