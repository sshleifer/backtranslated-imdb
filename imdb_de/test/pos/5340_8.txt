This scene shows how Wallace's experiment with his brain manipulation invention goes terribly wrong and produces the "Were Rabbit". His desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better, thus creating a "brain manipulator" machine. He risked his own life helping to solve the rabbit problem in Tottington, and above all to overcome the overcrowding of rabbits collected and stored in his cellar. Although he believed that his experiment worked, it meant he and Gromit exerted more pressure to find a solution before the vegetable competition risked his life again. Gromit, a silent loyal dog and a loyal helper, is always thinking of innovative ways to save his master. His radical crazy inventions go terribly wrong. What is interesting in this film tries to identify: who is entrepreneurial, Wallace or Gromit?
