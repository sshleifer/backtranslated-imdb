"Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island!" is a fun show that takes place on Saturday morning on WB. Inside is Coconut Fred and all his friends on the island, and every episode is a very funny mishap of them. Most of the time it's because of Coconut Fred's effort to make a fool of himself, which makes it fun, and other things that happen on the island at the same time. The humor is great and no one on the island is very bright, which makes it as amusing as it is. I do not think that could be funnier. The vocal talents of the characters are outstanding and exaggerated, which increases the exuberance of the show. If this is ever on DVD, I get it A.S.A.P! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for a good laugh.
