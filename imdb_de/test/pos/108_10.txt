The movie is really about choices. In the suppressed situation in Fire, where good women had to be obedient and do what was right in the eyes of tradition, Radha and Sita seemed to have few options. However, it was acknowledged that this was not the only option. What is a life without desire? Asks Radha Ashok. Yes, it is true that life offers us a range of options, but how many we can take depends on a number of external factors. If your world is limited to a small Indian household, you are a dutiful daughter-in-law of a quiet but attentive yet powerful matriarch, a conscientious wife of thirteen for a man who has sworn celibacy for having a child because of your inability to have one Man just wanting you to lie next to him to prove his strength in eliminating his desires. I felt that the ladies had no choice but to find solace in the other's company. I think the fact that so many women hailed Mehta's work was because it gave them the opportunity to think for themselves. An option for what may be unacceptable. The lesbian scenes that I felt were just to convey that point. Every scene in the movie, from the first in the Taj Mahal to the last in the mosque, is imprinted in my mind. How frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. To feel that you had to give up the human touch to be a dutiful wife just because it is expected of you. To suppress any desire and long for the human touch. What is the meaning of our existence? In the scene where Sita cries alone in the room and Radha comes in to comfort her, her lips accidentally bump into each other and it awakens a feeling in them. Something they had both been robbed of. Bravo to Mrs. Mehta to translate her vision so clearly. I especially like the flashbacks on the young Radha trying to "see" for the sea. It is a metaphor for freedom. Freedom of choice, freedom to take us to places we would not normally be able to reach. In these scenes, we are gently told that her conscience was also handed down by her mother, whom I believe lives within the rich Indian traditions of duty in marriage. The film is beautifully filmed and through the music of A.R. Rahman Since the movie I have become enthusiastic fans of the two leading actresses and the director. I am looking forward to further future productions of Ms. Deepa.
