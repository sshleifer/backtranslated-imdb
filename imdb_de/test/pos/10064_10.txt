I've seen this movie before, but I did not remember it was so fantastic: it has a funny plot, Madonna fumbling around town with pumas, etc., causing a stir. And the music is just perfect! And the happy ending! Who this girl is is a good choice for a romantic like me. In my opinion, this could even be the best Madonna movie I have ever seen! 10/10
