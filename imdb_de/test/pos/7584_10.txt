Horses on Mars is a stimulating animated short film show that sometimes looks funny at the development process through the eyes of those who are still evolving. The story is personal and sometimes sentimental and is supported by powerful digital animations and narratives that engage the viewer in this science fiction story. I was fortunate enough to see this short at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival in widescreen format, and I have to assume that it loses some of the ability to pull the reader into the no less contemplative story and stunning graphics when being transferred to the small screen ,
