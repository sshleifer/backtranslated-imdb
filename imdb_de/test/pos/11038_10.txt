This Popeye cartoon from World War II had some very good visual acuity and was clearly above average for his genre. It was also beautifully drawn, with some great angles, good details and ... well, lots of interesting sights. <br /> <br /> The point is that Popeye is in his small boat at sea and accidentally runs into a small Japanese boat with two boys. (Why did the "Japs" always be depicted with large round glasses and cracked teeth?). <br /> <br /> These harmless-looking Japanese sailors want Popeye to sign a peace treaty. Oh boy, thinks the gullible Popeye, "wait until the admiral sees that!" In one of those great art scenes alluded to above, we are beginning to see how this little Japanese ship really is a great destroyer ... and Popeye is deep in the water ... er, water! "Yes, you cross Ja-pansies!" Cries our Sailor Man. <br /> <br /> How he gets out of the situation is fun to see.
