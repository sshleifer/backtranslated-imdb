The performances of the male leads make this long trip to the west consistently interesting. The soundtrack of the Sons of The Pioneers is one of the finest I've ever heard. The journey itself is somewhat episodic, and Joanne Dru is a heavy failure. Overall, this is a very heartwarming and heartfelt West.
