It was high time to do a film about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar, and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. At first, I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 rebellion and add the traditional Hollywood flavor of Titanic-like love between the main heroine and the Burmese male lead actor who happened to be an old man. Luckily, there was nothing like that - which could explain why the film was not financially successful. <br /> <br /> The movie was honest with God and I was happy with the accuracy of the events. Apart from the fact that filming took place outside of Myanmar in Malaysia and Thailand and I missed the exotic Burmese locations, I could not find any big flaws in the movie and the resulting overwhelming actions. They are real events of a civil war. The music of Hans Zimmer is definitely the unique selling point of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it. <br /> <br /> I've been in Rangoon (now Yangon) for only a year in this turbulent time. When I heard that on my real-life experience, a film was made that I was too young for, I had to get the DVD, and I do not have to say that I can hardly complain about it because it's an eye-wonder for me ,
