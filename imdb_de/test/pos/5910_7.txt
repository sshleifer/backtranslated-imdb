Everyone knows that Lindburgh was successful in the first transatlantic flight. So how can there be tension or intrigue in this film? Well, that's it. Do not ask me how, but there are. Partly because the storyteller's expert told of the story, but mainly because of Jimmy Stewart's pervasive performance, we are drawn into the story as if it were unfolding before our eyes for the first time. Despite the fact that half of the movie is shot in a tight cockpit, it's as dynamic as any action-action movie. So if you are worried about watching this movie because you think you already know the story, try it. I think you will be impressed.
