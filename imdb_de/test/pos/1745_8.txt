While Disney has been THE animation studio for 70 years, there has always been a rival for its supremacy. For example, when this review was written in 2009, companies like Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman launched animated films that could challenge Disney dominance. At the beginning, in the heyday of the late 30s and early 40s, when Disney served filmbanks like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was hosted by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite the release of two highly recommended films, they have never completely cornered the market? Many attribute their demise to the commercial failure of Mr. Bug Goes To Town, released the same week as the Pearl Harbor attack (which made the American public think something more important than going to the movies to watch a cartoon !) That this film has faded into relative darkness, a travesty. <br /> <br /> In an overgrown garden in the city a few insects are in danger. People use the land as a shortcut and discard rubbish and cigars as well as other dangers directly on the houses of the beetles. Mr. Honey Bumble, owner of the Honey Shop, fears the future is bleak, and wonders how he can raise his daughter Honey (voiced by Pauline Loth) in a secure environment. Bagley C. Beetle (voiced by Tedd Pierce) offers a highly unscrupulous creature to offer her a safer place to marry, but Honey is more interested in her childhood sweetheart, the ever-happy and optimistic person Hoppity (voiced by Stan Freed). Hoppity believes that everything will be better for the better, but it looks stupid as Bagley Beetle and his two weird companions manipulate the crisis to their own devious end. Only at the end, when their stain forms the basis for a huge new skyscraper, do the bugs change loyalty back to Hoppity as they look at him to bring them a new, safe home away from the destructive influence of man. <Br /> <br /> What really works in this movie? All bugs are sophisticated and designed for maximum audience appeal. The bumbling baddies Swat the fly and Smack the Mosquito (weird names if you stop thinking about it) are especially memorable. Equally admirable is the storytelling drive? Even the youngest children can enjoy this story while skillfully teaching the older audience how human carelessness can affect the survival of wildlife. Time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film, and the audience must accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of general aging and wear. But by and large Mr Bug Goes To Town is a successful, witty and very well presented animation with a worthy message.
