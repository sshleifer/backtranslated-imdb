Well, that's new ... The famous Italian horror movie Lucio Fulci shoots a movie about a famous Italian horror movie called ... Lucio Fulci. After years and years of horrific horror sequences, Lucio finds it difficult to separate reality from fiction and often hallucinates about violent murders. He quickly climbs further into a seemingly endless spiral of madness and undetectable poison. Even the dedicated psychiatrist does not seem to be keeping Fulci on the right track ... When it comes to fun and entertainment, Cat in the Brain is certainly one of Fulci's most enjoyable films. The throat is overwhelming and abundant, to say the least. The number of dirty massacres is impossible to describe, especially if you get the completely uncut version (called "Nightmare Concert") in your hands. Everywhere decapitations, the guts of the victims are spread out on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws are working overtime! The movie soon becomes unintentionally funny (because he is so exaggerated) and a perfect experience to see with a group of friends when beer is in the fridge. From a professional point of view, of course, this production can not be described as a masterpiece! There is not the slightest tension or atmosphere to discover, and the characters are completely empty. To create more space for the gussets, the characters are only introduced for 5 seconds and then die terribly. Especially compared to the highlights of Fulci - like "The Beyond" or "Do not Torture a Duckling" - this movie looks like a quick-warmed snack. The best way to interpret "cat in the brain" is like a personal statement from Fulci and a direct attack on censorship. Maybe after seeing so many of his films? especially the latter? Since he was cut off by censorship committees and beaten by pseudo-artistic critics, he wanted to take revenge by delivering a bloody mess that just can not be cut! If you remove all the explicit acts of violence and the really sick make-up effects, you only have 10 minutes of material left! Especially because the insane killings reappear later in the movie as Fulci hallucinates again about her. You can almost hear our director say things like, "Let's see how you censor this now!" Even the entire development of the murder investigation takes place in the background. Are the victims of friends or relatives missing? Are there any police officers looking for clues that lead them to murder? They do not know and Lucio does not bother to inform you, because this would lead to sequences that do not need to be cut. Oh, and it's also presumptuous! The name "Mr. Fulci" or even "Lucio" is mentioned every 3 minutes (throughout the movie 34 times, to be exact), and our director seems to be in the limelight for a change. Hey, I'm not blaming him ... After more than 30 years showing amusing films; He deserved to have a little more fun. You are a god, Mr. Fulci!
