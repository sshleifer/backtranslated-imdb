The film is about Paul (Páll), a young man who sinks into the rough world of madness and his stay in the mental hospital "Kleppur" and his friends. Victor (Viktor), who started his education in England to believe that he was Adolf Hitler. Peter (Pétur), who took too much LSD and tried to fly from a roof, left no broken bones or physical damage, just insanity, he is obsessed with China. Oli Beatle (Óli Bítill) Oli spent most of his time in the hospital, although Viktor is a bit older than him. He claims to have written and sent every Beatles song through telepathy. The film covers the entire life of Paul from birth to his death. It's been a long time since I saw the movie, but if I remember correctly, the movie does not cover Paul's childhood "is funny, sad and powerful if you have not seen it yet! the movie better
