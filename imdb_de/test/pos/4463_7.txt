I did not know what to expect when lending this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult, but I also saw many of the director's later works, which were delightfully bloody but also quite incoherent. NOT TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear plot and a riddle that puzzled me almost to the end. And after all was said and done, it was a truly disturbing and scary experience. One important limitation: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the irregular dubbing found here.
