I have not seen it since 1998 and yet I can NEVER get it out of my head or stop recommending people to find it, which shows what an impression it made. <br /> <br /> Just a wonderful story. <I just hope to see the stairs at least once in person ... <br /> I did not know much about Mr. Petersen before I saw this movie since I had not seen any of his previous work, but his subtle acting has impressed me, and I think his presentation of Grissom on CSI shows only the same. He knows enough to let the character shine through instead of letting the actor shine through, making him a better actor. <br /> <br /> I can not remember enough of the "bad accents" to comment on, but I have to say that I have always enjoyed Barbara Hershey in all her roles and I thought she was did a phenomenal job in this movie as well.
