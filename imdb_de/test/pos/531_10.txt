I just came back from this fantastic movie !! I can relate to it so much ... It reminded me when my sister had to go to college, we had to move from place to place and my mother behaves like Adele August! Boys do not like this movie because it brings tears to your eyes. One of the best real movies I have ever seen !! and Natalie Portman rules !! 10/10
