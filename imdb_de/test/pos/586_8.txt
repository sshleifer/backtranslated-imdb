A pleasure from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the muppets, then I just have to regret them. This terrific movie does not only pay for the popularity of the Muppets, it is a well thought out and well written movie for itself. It has great songs, and it has that thread of wistful melancholy that has always been present in Jim Henson's creations and that is most personified in the character of Kermit the Frog. I've always responded to that as a kid, and that still makes the Muppets as an adult still enjoyable when other material that targets kids drives me crazy. This movie feels like a kid-sized version of "Around the World in 80 Days," only that he is about 80 times better. <br /> <br /> Note: A
