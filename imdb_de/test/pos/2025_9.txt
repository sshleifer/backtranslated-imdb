I was very excited to see Rock Star because I'm a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I was surprised that I liked it more than I originally thought. The script left something to be desired, but the film's performances made up for it. There have been a few moments when visions of Spinal Tap came back, and I can not help but believe that this film as a documentary would have been even better. But I digress. Wahlberg continued to prove his talent, because he plays with credibility an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true. He does it with the wonder and innocence that not only make you believe him, but also that you really care about his character. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston, who has not impressed me so far in movies, is surprisingly good as a girlfriend / manager. She shows more real emotions than I have seen in her latest films. <br /> <br /> But above all, it's the music in this movie that really attracts you. Peppered with some '80s songs (let's be honest) - Bon Jovi would rock all the music fans of the' 80s in their seat, the movie really rocks with the original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlberg's performance. <br /> <br /> I plan to watch this movie again, but first I'll go out and buy the soundtrack!
