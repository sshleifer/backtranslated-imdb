Some people say the tempo of this movie is a bit slow, but how is it different from other Hitchcock movies? They all move very consciously and have sporadic suspense and brilliant montages. This movie gives us just the right amount of comic relief that makes the suspense scenes all the more exciting. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema in Hitchcock's collection (the best is probably almost everything from "Rear Window"). Pure Cinema for Hitchcock was a series of mostly short film pieces that had no dialogue to tell the story visually. This, of course, is the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence and the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the image. <br /> <br /> Not many slip-ups from Hitchcock here, and the drama is particularly outstanding by Doris Day in a surprisingly serious role.
