I remember seeing that when it was done and thinking it was brilliant at the time. I see it for the second time almost twenty years later. Traffik is still more brilliant and far better than the US movie based on this drama politicians of tomorrow, who believe they can win the war on drugs, as the issues raised in this film are as relevant today as they are back in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Well written, well done, beautifully played and superbly filmed. A drama that makes you think and punishes some of the harsh realities of drug trafficking.
