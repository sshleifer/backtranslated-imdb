I have not seen such a film in which the creators put so much passion in their work and have paid very long attention to the details. <br /> <br /> Everything was well thought out and perfectly implemented. Cinematography, editing and compositing worked so well that it was just amazing. The titles were so funny and perfectly choreographed. <br /> <br /> This movie just blew me away. <br /> <br /> The showdown, however, could have been reduced by 10 or 15 minutes. <br /> It's an almost perfect tribute to the early, quiet noir. The story, the drama, the scenery and the costumes were perfect and believable from the time of the silent movie.
