I liked this movie. I was not really sure what it was about before I started to see it, but I liked it anyway. It was about a girl (Meredith Monroe) whose mother did not want her to turn out like she did. She meets and falls in love with a boy (Riley Smith) who is a city for a charity football game. It's a good movie. I just hope it works again or appears on video.
