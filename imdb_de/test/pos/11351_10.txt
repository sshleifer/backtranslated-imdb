I will not bore you with stories and storylines since they have been featured on this site many times, so ?? It has been a long time since I saw such a movie. Nice, elegant and reserved, with a narrative pace. A film of subtlety and inconspicuous qualities that is rare in times of clich√© conspiracies. The beautifully subdued photography, in rich, luxurious colors, and for lack of better words, every frame is filled with excitement. The settings and settings are used repeatedly, but the film manages to breathe new life each time they are introduced, there always seems to be an important prop, a lamp, or a set piece to show the audience a bit where we are in the figures world. <br /> <br /> The acting reminds me of "The Bicycle Thief", not the style, but the fact that you forget that you are watching two actors who are in their craft. Behind every gesture there is meaning, and almost every movement has meaning to explain the inner world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings and the situation of the two lovers. The dialogue is sparse, but like the rest of the movie, it matters. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is contagious. Used here, it becomes a storyteller. And although the film is of Chinese origin, even Nat King Cole, sung in Spanish, gives the film a subtle meaning. The orchestrated soundtrack repeats itself, but the repetition makes it pleasant. It is used in conjunction with the story and is not just a means of putting music into action or getting the audience to take a particular path at a particular plot point. I would not recommend this movie I'm afraid most people would be shaken by the quiet flow of history, but I would recommend it to someone looking for an alternative to the romantic beat of multiplexing on our planet Fills in the world. I have to say that I was completely absorbed in this movie and saw it going on night after night. The story takes time to present and to see repeatedly, because very few films in this genre are open to such interpretation. A very nice movie.
