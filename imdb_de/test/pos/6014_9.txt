I'm not a big fan of movie musicals. "Annie" was a stage show that I loved, but the movie was a flop. The "Phantom Of The Opera Movies" (and I think there were three) failed because of the Weber staging. But I loved that. The DVD will take a place of honor among my "keepers". Although it is a film adaptation, it somehow captures the taste and atmosphere of a live theater. Bette Midler is always special in this role. There is great music, a lot of laughter and even one or two tears. I have seen most of the great musicals of the eighties and nineties. Somehow I missed this, so there is no comparison. But when it's revived, I'm in the first place for tickets! But this movie is so good, I wonder if the stage production will keep up with the movie.
