Aug. 26, 2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-John Cassavetes): Cassavetes' independent, independent film introduced a style that was very different from Hollywood audiences. This film also introduced some very taboo topics, in particular the actual racism that was probably prevalent throughout the country, but was not shown by the mostly white filmmakers of that time. The only black actors to have much respect at the time were personalities who acted like whites (also known as Sidney Poitier). Apart from that, the idea of ​​ending a movie without really closing the relationships that have begun to complete, is astounding, but actually makes the viewer realize that life is like this (it continues ...). I prefer this kind of end because it allows you to think more about the characters and what can happen next, and the conclusions are not just for you. The film shows the lives of people (especially a few of people who have a short relationship and happen to have different skin colors). Then we watch what happens when the white man realizes what he has done. This is very well done and makes the movie something very special. The drama is supposedly improvised, which makes the movie even more amazing. I think you can say that I liked the movie if you can not say it. If you can find it, check out this classic early independent movie.
