An excellent debut feature for the director of Batman Begins is the sequel, a film about a man who follows other people in order to be inspired by the stories he writes. A man he follows decides to go further, and the man turns out to be more than he expected. <br /> <br /> With a cast of non-actors and his uncle, he wrote, directed and produced this in a different way. A movie that works without its own budget and is produced independently. This movie is much more than you would expect. <br /> <br /> For those who like memento and complex twists, turns, shocks and disarray over time, this is definitely a movie for you.
