I saw this movie last weekend on the A & E channel. The puzzle was fine, I could not guess the culprit before the end. But I enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery. There was a mystery to some of them, especially George Abernathie, played by the wonderful Michael Fassbender, and Georges cousin Susannah. In fact, the story of these two characters let me know more. From what I've tried to rejoice over the Agatha Christie book of the same name, I believe this movie did not follow the letter. Very good performances of the actors involved, especially Fassbender and the lady who played Cora / Companions.
