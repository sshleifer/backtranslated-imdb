It was a sweet intro for the smartest Sailor Soldier, Sailor Mercury. It consisted of a new "in croud", Merciurios. He, in the beginning, wrote a love letter to Ami who would (of course) be starltling, and now Ami is a Chibi Einstien, and he is attractive (He looked like Umino (Melvin)). This was a halarios (expesialy minako "It's not a skin of my neck" scene (HOT!)) Well, I really like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon series, personally I think it's the best anime ever! funny, but not as adventurous as Sailor Moon R - it was more like the "S" movie. I saw this @ Sailor Moon Univewrse, with real player, and it was pretty good. (Above all)
