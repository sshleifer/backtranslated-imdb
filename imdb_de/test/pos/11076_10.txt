I just wanted to tell anyone who is interested that the movie "New Jersey Drive" was my personal favorite. I admire the work that Nick Gomez and Spike Lee put into this masterpiece of a movie. This movie really impressed me because it's real and it's about life in urban New Jersey. That hit me a lot personally because I grew up with friends like the ones pictured in the movie. It made another impression on me because I spent some time in Teaneck some years ago and some characters were considered "real". Sometimes this movie was like a documentary because you did not know if it was a real event. Although films such as "Boys in the Hood" and "Menace II Society" attract more attention, I personally find that these films have been "improved" a bit to appeal to a wider audience. "New Jersey Drive" was an uncompromising reality. Lee and Gomez have treated every detail of music, clothing, slang and location in this urban drama. Unlike some of the films I mentioned earlier, actors acted as if they were not "actors." Nothing was compromised to create good "theater". The only misfortune from this film was the fact that many people "slept" on it. I look forward to more artworks by Nick and Spike in the hopefully near future.
