As I expected, too many reviews of this film (from professionals and amateurs) focused on the ideology of the film, if not more. That's because The Sea Inside (aka Mar adentro) is a movie about euthanasia. It's a true story about a notorious Galician named Ramón Sampedro, who fought for years for the right to support suicide, who was denied this right by the Spanish Constitutional Court and who - well, I do not want to ruin the end of the movie for you. <br /> <br /> The real life Sampedro catalyzed a national debate about euthanasia in Spain. Now with the producer / director / writer / composer / editor Alejandro Amenábar (Abre Los Ojos (1997) and The Others (2001)) "Biopic", The Sea Inside, another rhetorical help has been provided in the international debate on this topic. <br /> <br /> But as I say over and over again (to deaf ears?), your opinion, whether it is the ideology of the film, should not affect your rating of the movie. They should not judge the philosophical or political messages that Amenábar wants to make. You should rate the movie as a movie. Maybe that's a bit too idealistic, as none of us can probably completely separate our ratings from our ideological prejudices. Idealistic or not, that's the goal. <br /> <br /> So forget the philosophical and political questions for a moment. As a film Amenábar has recorded one of his most elegant and mature works so far. He does not focus on social debates. He does not focus on Sampedro's legal / political struggles. He focuses on Sampedro as a man and spends his time in his brother's bed in a bed. <br /> <br /> Sampedro, played here in an amazing performance by Javier Bardem, was a tetraplegic. At the beginning of the film he has been a tetraplegic for 26 years. This state was reached by Amenábar through wonderfully shot flashbacks from a diving accident - Sampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman, charged the water, dived in, grabbed her neck and almost drowned. As a tetraplegic, he eventually began writing poetry, some of which were published in a book called Cartas Desde El Infierno ("Letters from Hell"); In real life Sampedros book became a bestseller in Spain. Amenábar may have taken Samprod's artistic work as a model and created an elegantly poetic film. <br /> <br /> Most of The Sea Inside is in the bedroom of Sampedro. The focus in these scenes is on Bardem's complex and sublime performance. As a lateral thinker, Bardem is limited to moving his head and speaking. He has mastered subtle changes in expression and expression to convey a deep character with a diverse, intellectual attitude to life. Bardem and Amenábar have often philosophically developed Sampedro in reserved language, but there is always a combination of wicked humor, a passion for aesthetics - including music and women - and a sadness and sometimes even bitterness not far below the surface. Various underlying emotions occasionally break through like waves on the skin of the ocean. <br /> <br /> The people with whom Sampedro interacts facilitate this in a complex way. These include his sister-in-law Manuela (Mabel Rivera), who has been his chief janitor since the Sampedro accident; his brother José (Celso Bugallo), who is one of the most vocal objections to Sampedro's desire to die and with whom an unsolved problem is related (it seems José may have saved Sampedro from drowning?); his nephew Javier (Tamar Novas), perhaps the most sympathetic to him; a legal representative, Gené (Clara Segura); a lawyer named Julia (Belén Rueda), whom he has wanted for a degenerative disease, CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarction and leukoencephalopathy), in whom he falls in love; and Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a local woman who works as a DJ in a cannery and moonshine that has heard of him from the media, wants to make him live, and falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> The main part of the movie consists of these characters interacting with Sampedro in his room. There are also a few other minor characters, including Sampedro's father, who is strangely far away, and a notorious and media-conscious priest, Padre Francisco (José María Pou), who does his best to teach Sampedro through philosophy / theology (in one language) Changing scene often mistakenly referred to as "comic" - it has an accompanying comic element, but the scene is, in the first place, very serious.) The fact that most of the film plays in Sampedro's room genuinely gives the couple significant changes Setting a bigger impact. Sampedro's room has a nice big window, which makes him happy as a viewing point in the world. Perhaps more importantly, he regularly imagines the window as a launch pad, flying over the hills to the ocean he loved and which was the most influential force in his life - making his living younger and removing his mobility. Amenábar gives us a fantastic sequence of Sampedro imagining a flight to the sea. It is beautifully shot at low angles (presumably from a helicopter) of the rushing hills until we follow a brook to the wide open ocean, which in this film represents freedom, the infinite and the forces of nature. <br /> <br /> The other significant change in attitude comes when Sampedro finally gets into a wheelchair (he otherwise rejects her and says they "ridiculed his immobility") to appear in court for his case support. Amenábar gives us a poignant, melancholy travelogue by Sampedro, who looks at life and the world in action from the car window. <br /> <br /> Whether you agree with the legalization of euthanasia or not, it's hard to deny that this is the case, a well-rehearsed, well-written and well-constructed movie. You may not believe it is a ten (and even more unlikely if you disagree with the legalization of euthanasia), but it's still worth considering as a good example of artistically demanding filming.
