With the relatively recent release of Carlos Saura's "Fados" in the United States (Albiet, a limited edition art house), it's high time for a re-release of this beautiful documentary about Amalia Rodrigues. This film is a treasure trove of old vintage Amalia clips on Portuguese and American television, as well as several other movie clips, including one by her and her mother, that could tear the macho man to tears most of the time. I saw this beautiful documentary for the first time a few years ago when it received the unjustified "Art House" release (which was far better). Fortunately, there are several recordings of Amalia's best recordings on various budget line recordings (usually available in places like K-Mart or Best Buy). If you're looking for something, you can enhance some of the original releases either at E-Bay or one of these distribution services specializing in expensive imported European CDs. There are at least two versions of this documentation in circulation (the original Portuguese version without English subtitles) and the English version in Portuguese with English subtitles, except that the European version can not be played on most USDVD players because of the PAL color. , Not rated by the MPAA, but contains nothing to offend.
