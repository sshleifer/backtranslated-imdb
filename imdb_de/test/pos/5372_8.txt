Ben (a fine Charles Bateman), his young daughter K.T. (a cute Geri Reischl) and his new girlfriend Nicky (the very attractive Ahna Capri) are on their way to a birthday party for K.T. You are unexpectedly taken to a remote city in the south where nobody can walk, and no one except Ben, K. T. and Nicky can enter. To top it off, children disappear and adults are murdered at an alarming rate. Ben helps some locals - Sheriff Pete (LQ Jones), Tobey (Alvy Moore) and Jack (Charles Robinson), the local priest, try to solve the puzzle. <br /> <br /> This devil of the early '70s The themed horror movie is older than "The Exorcist" and combines a "Bad Day at Black Rock" protocol of a rural town with a large, large skeleton in the closet with interesting horror elements Results. It actually sent a few shivers down my spine as he walked steadily along his sinister path. The moody and festive atmosphere is quickly established and applies to the duration; The growing sense of panic gives him a real kick. Among the memorable backdrops is the bizarre opening of a toy tank that turns into a real tank and flat crushes a car, not to mention Nicky's twisted nightmare, which is vividly and stylishly implemented by director Bernard McEveety and the crew. Jaime Mendoza-Navas' music is subtly eerie and gives her the extra feeling of eeriness. <br /> <br /> The steadfast and professional cast is doing a good job, especially the ever appealing Strother Martin as the friendly Doc Duncan and producers / actors LQ Jones and Alvy Moore. <br /> <br /> Just the fact that the plot is right under our heroes' noses makes it all the more frightening. Jack, the priest, begins to lead them in the right direction, but will they be on time for the things? It is a nice little cooler that is worth a visit again. I appreciated it much more after giving it a second chance. I can say now that yes, it is indeed undervalued to tell an interesting story in an interesting, unconventional and effective way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
