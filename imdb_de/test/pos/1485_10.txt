The 1990s were a great decade for the British sitcom featuring many popular creations such as ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, ABSOLUT FABOULOUS THE THIN BLUE LINE, the BRITTAS EMPIRE and MEN BAVY, who are arriving on TV screens for the first time. <br /> <br /> However MR. BEAN is undoubtedly the biggest sitcom of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> MR. BEAN is the first big attempt to overcome the era of dumb greats like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for decades. It brings the audience a single figure - Mr. Bean - which is played to perfection by Rowan Atkinson. <br /> <br /> Many people who have commented on this page as well as the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not Mr. Bean has a mental disability and he has significant learning difficulties resulting from such disability. However, I believe that this debate is not necessary, as I very much doubt that the show's creators expected that a single moment in the audience would even consider Mr. Bean in such a context. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and decides to solve problems himself without being instructed by others. Some of his methods of approaching daily tasks such as preparing lunch or visiting the dentist are bizarrely addressed to anyone looking at the show. This is where the humor derives. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he can only be an eccentric person accustomed to treating things in his own way. And, of course, some of his methods of completing a single task often lead to a catastrophe that Mr. Bean then tries to solve. <br /> <br /> Sometimes we see that Mr. Bean often tries to show a mean or petty argument to compete with those around him, or to play tricks on those who least expect it. But at the end of the day nobody really gets hurt and the results are always reassuring. <br /> <br /> Unlike most British comedy examples over the past 30 years, MR. BEAN is a simple, harmless, harmless U-rated entertainment suitable for all family members. That's why the TV series has become a hit in dozens of countries around the world. It is also the reason why it will be remembered in a few decades when many other television programs have come, gone and been forgotten. <br /> <br /> Some critics say that the series only addresses children, but I'm just laughing so much at Mr. Bean's antics right now as I did when I first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson has used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that look as funny as they were the first time around. The TV series has produced two spin-off films to date, BEAN and MR. BANES HOLIDAY. As you are familiar with the kind of humor shown in the TV series, this may not lead to success on the big screen. The two films do little justice to the television series and can not really capture the magic of the episodes. The biggest failure in both films may be the change in attitude. In both films, the producers lead Mr. Bean from his normal British environment to America (first film) and France (second film). As a result, the movie characters around Mr. Bean react differently than his counterpart in the television series. In both films, gags from the television series are reused, and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time. In the second film, Mr. Bean shows that he behaves out of character, with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point that some jokes seem stupid rather than funny. At different times, I thought the character I was watching was not a Mr. Bean but a pale caricature. It's clear that Rowan Atkinson was not as amused as in the TV series. His heart just was not in the performance. After the second movie came out, he publicly stated that he would not play Mr. Bean anymore. I understand how he felt. <br /> <br /> Back to the TV series, each episode shows evidence of careful planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene. Even the weakest episode is still very pleasing and well ahead of the two films. <br /> <br /> My favorite episodes are the top three - they set the high standard that should persist. I think the last episode is the weakest, but funny. <br /> <br /> In summary, MR. BEAN is a really great sitcom for the whole family. Rowan Atkinson is a true comic genius, and the 14 episodes of this TV series prove this. My recommendation - watch and enjoy. But just watch the movies if you consider yourself a diehard fan after the TV series.
