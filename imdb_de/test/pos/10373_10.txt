For those of you who are still in the dark, I will not ruin this Christie, as this is definitely one of her finest works, and I stress that you should always see it next time you have spare time! If one of the adjustments is before (or instead of) reading the book, I would suggest "After the Funeral" for the following reasons. <br /> <br /> I wanted to praise the performance of Monica Dolan (Miss Gilchrist), whose employer colleague Cora is brutally murdered at the beginning of the film. Her portrayal of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman is indeed moving, especially if she has a personal relationship with Poirot, another person who travels alone on "The Journey of Life." And when the murderer is revealed in a typical Poirot-Denouement manner, Dolan's reactions to the revelation at its finest: you are as angry with the murderer as you are with Miss Gilchrist ... something unusual in the Christie tradition. Although there are a number of discrepancies between novel and filming, as usual (the business of the will may make less sense in the film), the incredibly elaborate replica of post-war England is certainly top-notch acting and directing as well as preserving (if not aggravating) Christie's mystery and intrigue make these discrepancies insignificant. Bravo Seek, Dolan, and the entire team to make this masterpiece of the murder mystery theater and the producers gave it the green light! Encore!
