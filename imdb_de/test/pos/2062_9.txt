I did not plan to post a review before, but having seen some of the other terrible reviews for this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the end or everything, but I'll give you some important action points in this report, so you should be aware of that. The short version (without spoiler) of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both appear in this movie and it's a lot of fun. Look at. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Geena Davis is perfect as an action heroine, torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother and the memories of her former life as a CIA assassin. Their performance is outstanding as it perfectly plays both facets of this relatively complex character. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson's performance is, as always, also honored as a Private Investigator, tasking Geena Davis's character with her forgotten past. He's doing a great job to help the unwanted buddy against Geena Davis' tough character play. Some of the lines he utters in this film are the best he has ever used in a movie he has ever been to. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do it seriously. It's a fantastic story with many unexpected twists and turns, and it's very well directed and played.
