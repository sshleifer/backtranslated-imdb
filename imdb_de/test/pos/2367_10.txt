In the '80s, a lot of "alternative" comedy in Britain was insular, misguided, overly political and unstable, and the worst of comic strip presents ... things fell into that category. <br /> <br /> But this is at the other end - a remarkable movie that works on different intellectual levels. <br /> <br /> Is Dennis a criminal thinker or is he lying? <br /> <br /> Is he telling the truth and bluffing, double-bluffing, counter-double-bubbly-bluffing-whats? <br /> <br /> I've probably seen Supergrass 20 or 30 times and still can not decide 100%. That's the wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> In addition to Ade Edmonson, there are also big roles for other early comic strips - French & Saunders, Pete Richardson, Alexey Sayle, Keith Allen, Nigel Planner and Robbie Coltrane curious enough not Rik Mayall. <br /> <br /> All comic actors - however I disliked the hidden plans of some of their members - convince the actors and perform well in this big movie. while the work of the Richardson Richens writing team is so often pure genius, with nice little details in detail. Ultimately, this is a study of crime, criminology and human nature in all its amazing complexity. And very funny with it. You will not be disappointed.
