So it's not an epic event, but for people who experience something similar (sibling suicide), this could be an interesting type of therapy. A <br /> <br /> imaginative narration and some fine acting make it a good time <br /> <br />. For some reason, it has not really arrived at the audience, something I believe is a result of the main theme. Why did she commit suicide? Obviously, this is hardly something that US moviegoers will flock to if it were a European production that would probably have reached them in a much larger area. It is, however, a film that, although the realism marred by a shimmering, romanticized glow, gives the viewer a very warm <br /> <br /> impression.
