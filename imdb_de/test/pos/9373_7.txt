Crossfire (1947) <br /> <br /> Great message, great symbolism, very good movie <br /> <br /> It's hard, with Robert Mitchum, Robert Young and Robert Ryan, who are all three together, totally Male lead roles went wrong, and director Edward Dmytryk put together a complicated murder and detective thread. Reason enough to look at it once and even twice. <br /> <br /> You may need a second look to fully grasp the plot, as it is explained (too much) or shown in Flashback (too much), as this is a little complicated for no good reason. But it makes sense overall, and we see early (probably too early) who the offender is, and even why. Besides the drama, well done in typical noir lighting effects and filled with these short jokes to make postwar films dramatic, there is the social message, the anti-anti-Semitic point. It only adjoins once or twice to preachers, and it's obviously a good point to see how it's made affirmative, and wait for action and dramatic action to get in the front row. What they do, especially Young, who is a brilliant, laconic and patient detective, and Ryan, who is brutish and furious in common (Ryan is good at it, his typography is reasonable). Mitchum usually plays a watered-down version of what he's famous for, and Gloria Grahame, the fourth known acting force, is a great, short-lived presence, even if it's somewhat expendable. <br /> <br /> Although the film is dominated by the sequence of events and the message that both are getting stronger and stronger, it is very easy to provide only lighting, camerawork and acting the classic fight scene that opens the first seconds of the game movie, all done with shadows. <br /> <br /> The archetypes of the featured soldiers are very intentional, and this was something that people knew very well at the time and could refer to the anti-Semitic thread. The shocked soldier became helpless (but still incompetent), the modest boy without confidence (but capable) and the tired but outwardly capable veteran are all there. And, of course, the angry, violent soldier who is also a product of the war. The latter is also a social responsibility - even the army will do everything to eradicate the injustices, not only because they are criminal, but because they result from the erosion of a long terrible war. <br /> The public could really get more than today, but it is still appreciated.
