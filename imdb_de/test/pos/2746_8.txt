Loved the shots of airports - Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings named in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors and well-dressed passengers. Almost 75 years forward .... <br /> <br /> However, what really appealed to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and a Chinese ideogram next to the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Do you remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill meet says that Jim became General of a Chinese rebel army? That, based on hammer and sickle, could only have been the Revolutionary People's Army of Mao Tse Dung !!! No matter what underwear and unkempt pair in bed, would that logo and reference survive during the Cold War? <br /> <br /> Additional Note 12/27: This 1930s film with the Soviet emblem may / must also reflect the influence and charm of Communism in Hollywood and much of America during the Depression. Adds to the historical value of this great movie. <br /> <br /> I, too, liked the American Dream aspects of two guys from Winnemucca who took at least part of the world by storm, Red-Blooded (literally and abundantly in Jim's case) American Boys. <br /> <br /> Others have been more adept than I have commented on aerobatic planes, etc. I loved everything. <br /> <br /> This gem earns more than the 1.5 stars that Osborne and Co. have rated on TCM, albeit only for inclusion in parts of American history of the early '30s.
