This movie shakes your back, even if you do not understand German. I saw this for the first time in my German lessons at high school and found it for $ 5 at my local Wal-Mart. I've seen it at least 20 more times since * just a few years ago * and it's great to see it on a movie night. The plasticized bodies are mostly real and used by Body Worlds. This movie was an absolute eye-catcher. A German Dr. * nicknamed Dr. Death began to plasticize the human body for display, and now Body Worlds is a travel deal, right now in Chicago, IL. Many people were against it and so a great German horror movie was filmed. I personally love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes Thriller Slasher movies.
