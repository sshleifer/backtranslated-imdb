The Squire by Gothos is one of the "dark" episodes of Star Trek and therefore one of the most entertaining. The entertainment factor is generally fueled by the altercation between William Shatner and comic guest star of the episode, William Campbell. During an unspecified routine mission, Sulu suddenly disappears in the air and Kirk soon follows. Spock begins immediately to search for his missing colleagues (and though he hates hating having friends) while the two stranded crewmembers engage with the mysterious, all-powerful, extravagant Trelane (Campbell), the self-proclaimed Squire of, Gothos Being capable of creating or destroying anything he wants through his sheer power. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the plot from previous episodes seems to be recycled (honestly, are there any sci-fi shows?) that did not have at least a god-like character), but that feeling disappears pretty quickly, thanks to the fact that the script has gained with exaggerated humor conveyed by Campbell's deliberate camp performance: his Trelane is essentially the Trek version of a spoiled child's adult body, while his curiosity for the human race (his knowledge is rather limited) as inspiration for Gene Roddenberry served when he found the character Q for the Next Generation pilot about two decades later. This episode was aired. <br /> <br /> In short, the key to recognizing The Squire of Gothos is: "silly" does not necessarily mean "bad".
