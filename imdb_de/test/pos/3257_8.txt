This deceptively laid back, restrained, casual-looking Aussie crime thriller lures with laid-back serenity and relaxed self-esteem that you'll love to see. The avid beaver student of the working class Jimmy (an appealing hopeless Heath Ledger) wants to make something of his inanimate ordinary life. Jimmy gets his big break when local criminal king Pando (a brilliant Bryan Brown) assigns him a simple courier appearance, where he has to bring an old lady $ 10 grand. Jimmy is in deep trouble when he loses Pandos money. Writer / director Gregor Jordan tells with his fascinatingly simple story that things are not always what they get involved in, young love, all the actions that have consequences, and this old thriller about crime not being like magic thanks to a movie There is a wonderful abundance of well-observed small, quirky details, a strong subtext of man's duel for good and evil, a nice sense of casual irony, the cold, factual way in which violence is depicted, and the wonderful foundation for the assorted complexively drawn warts and not all inconspicuous characters in an instantly recognizable and completely believable banal everyday life (for example, Panda is shown playing Scrabble with a flunky and at one point has a business conversation with a colleague to speak with his son on the phone). Bryan Brown is not only involved with Pando, but also one of the best performers who ever owned celluloid. A robust and satisfying little sleeper.
