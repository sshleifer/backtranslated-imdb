Did not sound like it was from a fantasy movie. The movie is dark with dark overtones. The soundtrack is too much to the point where he got into the visuals. I'm sure they wanted something militant, but it just did not work. The scene in which Astin tries to escape is a perfect example. Why does it sound like the goonies? There is no comedy, no brightness !! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is great and the acting is also very good. I enjoyed the performances of all. It is available in the online display of Netflix. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a visit, but write your own soundtrack !!
