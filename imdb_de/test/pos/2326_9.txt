"Down Periscope" has been in our library since arriving in the VHS. Since then we have purchased the DVD and a digital DVD from Cinema Now. <br /> <br /> It's a bizarre movie that does not go overboard as a pro or a conversion. It's primarily a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I'm pretty surprised that never was a sequel offered. <br /> <br /> The film has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. This became clear to me during a visit to the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama, in 2002. A group of Cub Scouts, including my grandson, had taken over all the roles from the movie and planned to re-live them during their overnight stay aboard. <br /> <br /> It's a fun move that will take you to our Navy as well Hollywood makes pride ... a rare company. <br /> <br /> Many thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider, who did what could have been an otherwise inconspicuous movie, so great entertainment!
