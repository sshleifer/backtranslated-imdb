After leasing One True Thing the other night, I learned to respect my family and not take their health for granted. I've never seen such a representation of a cancer patient like Meryl on the canvas. She deserves the Oscar nomination, but she has some strong competitors in the race. All I can say is Beautiful film, great show by Streep and Zellwegger. Meryl Streep has shown her true strength in this great movie!
