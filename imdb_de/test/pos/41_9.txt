What a wonderful movie, filled with eccentric, unique characters, beautifully performed by a great ensemble ensemble. The director has also done a great job keeping the story together, making those wonderful performances (not talking them around) and using music (and what wonderful music it is). S. Epatha in the lead role is great. I've always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is, and although I've enjoyed her at Law and Order, it really shows what she can do with a full, complex role. Macy Gray is great, Mos Def wonderful as always. Lou Gossett, great. Jimmy Smits, great and does not try to focus because he is a star. A true piece of ensemble drama. <br /> <br /> Borrow it, enjoy it, enjoy it and appreciate it. Something special.
