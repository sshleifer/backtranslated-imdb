This is definitely a touching film and a great expression of Charles Darwin's personal struggle. The film is not just about publishing his book, The Origin of Species, but also about his relationship with his eldest daughter. His daughter was initially the only person in his family to approve of his views, something she also had to pay for. Sometimes more than him. <br /> <br /> Well, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, in fact I believe that it has managed to remain very neutral. A difficult thing in my opinion. Of course, it does not tolerate how the figures were treated by the church, on the contrary. If you need me to use the big words to bring light into this movie; It is valued by deists and atheists alike, but goes away from theism. The movie talks about evolution and that's it. <br /> <br /> Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course, we all can think of Darwin as that old man with the funny beard, but this movie revolves around the man late 20s, early 30s. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great as always, but the actor who impressed me, Martha West was Annie Darwin, Darwin's daughter. Definitely one of the best children's actors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and she is beautifully played. Apart from a few leaps in time, which were confusing at the moment, the production of this film is pretty flawless. In some scenes, Darwin's observation was that nature is just wonderful and almost taken out of a national documentary with high geographic production. as title. I doubt it's ironic, the film is too respectful for that. I'm sure there is a meaning, do not let that put you off. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 9/10. This is really a great tribute to Charles Darwin, and please give him a chance.
