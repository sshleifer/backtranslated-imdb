If this film is scrutinized, it's a bit sad. It's detailed enough to address the very real issues of children growing up in poor, dysfunctional environments. Nevertheless, it retains its comedic value with spirited performances by Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones. The sadness is in the mother's (Carroll's) struggles and dysfunctions, which can not really help her children, not because she does not want or tries, but because it's obvious she does not know how. Remember, this is a comedy, but if you've never seen it before, have a look at this movie and see the humanity in the characters. Good movie.
