This was a very faithful representation of Lewis's life in the mid-50s. The dialogue about theology and the banter with his follow colleagues was exceptionally good. Michael White's book "C.S. Lewis: The Creator of Narnia" deals with this timeframe in a very parallel manner. Joss Ackland's acting was superb when he caught the unemotional Lewis. The film had great difficulty being presented in a precise English setting. The development of a strong bond between "Jack" (his favorite name) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, Joy's son from their previous marriage, was pleasing to watch. The movie drank the vile element of "Warnie" Lewis (Jack's older brother), but that would not have gotten the story any further.
