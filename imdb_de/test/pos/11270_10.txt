Thank goodness for the Internet Movie Database !!! When I got this movie for the first time, I saw it every night just before going to bed and each time got something different from it. But no matter how I cut it, it bothered me. The black and white and all the twitching really drove me crazy. You stare at the screen and do not know exactly what you are looking at. And if you think you have understood it, it becomes clear and it is something completely different. The pictures are very disturbing, twitching razors and razors sit well in any movie with me. Whenever I saw it, I interpreted it a bit differently (there is no dialogue, you know), so I decided to check the IMdB for the plot summary. Boy throwing me for a loop, I had no idea that God should be. Now I will observe it in this sense and see what happens ....
