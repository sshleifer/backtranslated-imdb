Silent, historical drama based on the story of Anne Boleyn, a newly arrived woman waiting for the Queen, who awakens the lustful look of Henry VIII, the ill-tempered King of England, who loves to feast, drink, hunt and entertained by his farm is joker, watch knight games and hunt for young beauties who jump out of cake and sort out attractive women around the castle. Well, he soon abolished his marriage, married Anne and told her it was her sacred duty to produce a male heir. She fails in that regard and he soon has another lady in the queue in mind. Meanwhile, Anne spends the entire movie quite hesitant, distraught or almost ready to burst into tears. It just does not look like a happy camper (or is it just a bad acting ?!). <br /> <br /> This movie is a solid conversation, with a gripping story that interests me for two hours - I also enjoyed watching the elaborate medieval costume on a beautiful sepia print. Emil Jannings is in his well-made depiction of King Henry the eighth quite striking and memorable - he really seemed to be the Henry of the eighth. I'm not sure if the actress Anne plays seems a little over the top. The DVD of this film contains a fitting, well-made piano score that fits in perfectly with this story. Very good movie.
