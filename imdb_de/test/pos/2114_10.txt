It was easy to lose yourself in the simplicity and carefree humor of the best family movie of the year ... Grand Champion. The story of a 12-year-old boy (Buddy) who, with the help of his sister, mother and best friend, is determined to raise a Grand Champion. It's a whimsical trip to the big contest. After being named Grand Champion, Hokey Pokey will be auctioned for $ 775,000. pay for the children's education. Buddy finds out the next time he sees Hokey ... it would be on a roll! The kids conspire to steal the award-winning ox and vow to rescue him from the grill. Here's the fun ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Strait, Natalie Baines, Steven Bland, Tommy Guy, Tuff Hedeman and many other stars are the backdrop to all the antics. You will not believe who actually won the ox at the auction !!! (he looks good in a mustache) The soundtrack is rich in sounds of George Strait, Natalie Maures, Willie Nelson and others. Where else can you experience movie stars, country & western stars and rodeo stars ... only in Texas ... only in Grand Champion. <br /> <br /> It's a masterfully crafted "simple" little movie that may be the best movie you'll see this year. The film will open in selected cities on August 27th. 2004. <br /> <br /> Another great movie by Rope the Moon and Michaelson Productions is IN A WHISPER. Keep track of the cable networks for this one here!
