The proud and defiant working-class porter Perks (Mr. B. Cribbins) is eventually convinced of the happiness of the upper middle-class family. Father (Mr. I.Cuthbertson) was imprisoned for high treason - the punishment was then death, so he will not be forgotten), mother (the very beautiful Mrs. D. Sheridan), courageous and resourceful, loyal and loving and above all, older daughter ( Miss J. Agutter) staggers on the threshold of youth - hurt and confused about her father's fate. Mr. Perks, like many workers of his time, will have nothing to do with anything he smells of "charity," and it's a defining moment in the movie when he finally accepts that the kids made the birthday gifts. Do not compromise his principles , Although the beautiful Miss Agutter has received all the accolades, it is Mr. Cribbins and Miss Sheridan whose appearances dominate The Railway Children. You both know how Edwardian society works from the other ends of the spectrum, but there is unspoken mutual respect and understanding between them. But this is basically a movie about the family. At a time when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and make her a ransom, she is considered "socially incapable" and not incapable of living in a decent society, and if two "people" can do so "Homicide" can be seen as an old-fashioned, elitist, racist and even homophobic concept, but a century ago it was the glue that kept society together at all levels. Mr Cribbins and Miss Sheridan's families are archetypal to old age. Strong and loving, cohesive against external influences, integral units with a moral certainty mocked in the 21st century. What appears to be a boring, preaching political course is made a joyful hymn of hope, faith, optimism and courage by Mr. Lionel Jeffries. That all these qualities were once considered norms and too often subject to contempt and cynicism is a reflection of our society and not that of Miss Nesbit. Nobody who has more than a passing concern for the human situation can not be touched by this thoroughly perfect film.
