This version of Hamlet is part of the BBC filming of all Shakespearean classics. It does not matter to dispel my impression that it is one of the most valued pieces of Shakespeare, and Hamlet himself is a not particularly moving and tragic figure. I have no sympathy for him, and I did not do it after I looked at it. <br /> <br /> Even if you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde As Rosencrantz she can not hide the lack of passion in the plot. And when a good actor like Jacobi's passion is in it, he makes the whole role incomprehensible. I just could not connect his physique to what he said, and that killed me. That is, he correctly gets the language "being or not-being" because his actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at this point in the game. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles, better written for me and therefore better played, are pleasing, especially Lalla Ward's sleepy Ophelia and Stewart's detailed interpretation of Claudius. <br /> <br /> At four and a half hours, it is very long and is best seen in bite chunks. Check it if you are interested, but be prepared for a long watch.
