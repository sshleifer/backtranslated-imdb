I loved this movie when I was a kid. I saw it theatrically. Randy Edelman has composed the soundtrack well. David Seville is the father and manager of the Chipmunks. The Chipmunks are made up of Alvin, who is best known for playing the harmonica, Simon, who is a smart and hardworking chipmunk. There is a woman named Miss Miller who takes care of the chipmunks and has three daughters known as Brittany, Jeanette & Eleanor who all have the same character as the chipmunks. My favorite songs from this soundtrack include "Diamond Dolls," "The Girls of Rock & Roll," and the touching "My Mother." Alvin wanted to see Europe, if Dave had to go there In 30 days around the world a video game that made them compete each other in the real race.
