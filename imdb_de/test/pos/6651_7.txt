The original premise is based on the American Civil War but is ultimately a love story. We begin at the beginning of the war, when the main characters (Kidman & Law) are obviously aware of each other and there is an obvious attraction. You have a passionate kiss the day he leaves the war. The main focus of this movie is that Law's character returns to Kidmans and his struggles to achieve this and their battles for survival until he returns. The reason why it can not be convincing is that we do not see enough of this relationship before Law's character goes into battle. It is hard to believe that two people long so much for having so little contact. Everything else is just fine, Renee Zellweger and her acting father and his entourage are lovely additions, as well as the threat of the gang that is hunting deserters. Sure, it's a long movie, but it holds the interest and the cinematography is great. An honorable attempt that does not quite make it, but still worth a watch.
