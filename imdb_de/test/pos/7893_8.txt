If Archie Bunker was armed, he might have been "Joe." However, "All in the Family" would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed them to go in the direction of this movie. Joe is a working-class type, a racist and a fanatic, and has a big mouth, especially when he's drunk. One night he meets a man in a bar, Bill, who has just had a drink to calm his nervous nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's junkie friend. What happened is that Bill's daughter was living with the junkie and she was taken to the hospital after an overdose. He goes to the apartment to pick up her things, but does not expect that he will actually meet the friend who comes in fresh from a big drug deal. In the ensuing fight, the friend is accidentally killed, and Bill, of course, does not want anyone to know. But he lets Joe slip, and when the newspapers and TV reports come out, Joe sees them, puts 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes. He joins him later and Bill is obviously worried that Joe will blackmail him, but not for money, he wants to hang out with him. That's almost worse in a way. Now Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she's in and slips home. She happens to overhear what happened and is then on the run. Most of the film consists of Joe and Bill trying to find "the subway" theirs. This results in a rather shocking ending, which was completely unexpected to me and ends with the right note or a wrong note, depending on your point of view. A kind of decent, but weak, view of life in the early 1970s, mostly from a working class perspective, which does not suit everyone, but it's not a bad movie and a decent watch at all. 8 out of 10.
