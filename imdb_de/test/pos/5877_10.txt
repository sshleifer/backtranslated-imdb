This great 1940s postwar classic is rather overlooked these days. When it came out in 1945, it was cleaned up at the 1946 <br /> Oscars, mostly at the expense of "It's A Wonderful Life." Both movies stood for the best movie, the best <br /> <br /> director and the best actor, all won by "Best Years". Frederic March, <br /> <br /> and Dana Andrews play along with a amateur actor Harold Russell (a real soldier who lost both hands in an explosion) as the <br /> Returning Soldier who finds life very much of what they remember. Myrna Loy is outstanding as March's wife, who has to keep the family together while he's away. The teardrop scene, in which March and Loy are reunited, is great. All three <br /> <br /> men find themselves having trouble adapting to post-war life, not least that Russell makes do with artificial hands, and his finances. <br />> (Cathy O'Donnell) tries to be too helpful. Sam Goldywn is quoted as saying that he does not care if the movie does not make any money at all, as long as everyone in America sees the movie, so they'll appreciate these guys went through. If a movie is worth 10 out of 10, that's it.
