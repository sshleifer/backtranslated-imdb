In the Universal Series of Modern Sherlock Holmes Stories with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEOPON are not among the top films - though it's entertaining. I think the problem is that much of the "duel" of the film between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty (played here by Lionel Atwill) seems to delay the actual point of the professor's work. Moriarty appears in three of the Holmes films with Rathbone. In the ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES he was played by George Zucco, who gave the love of the villain out of his own interest the role. For my money, Zucco's appearance as a professor was the best of the three (there's even a brief moment of comedy in his performance when he's disguised as the "Sergeant of Police" towards the end - as if he were singing "A Policeman's Lot") Gilbert & Sullivan) Next comes the performance of Mr. Atwill - more of them later - finally, there's Henry Daniell's intellectual Moriarty in SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE LADY IN GREEN - it's a typically cool, stylish performance by Mr. Daniell, but his Confrontations with Holmes seem like a boring boredom, preventing him from completing the main plan, and in the stories the professor appears in, he really senses that Holmes is a nemesis that remains a threat as long as he lives. Because of the intellectual tennis match between him and Rathbone, Rathbone (in his autobiography) actually felt that Daniell was the best of the movie Moriartys - when Zucco's love Daniell seemed to demonstrate to the weary Oxford Don (in the stories the professor is a respected mathematician whose band had a "European fashion" about the binomial phrase and wrote a fascinating book, THE DYNAMICS OF THE ASTEROID) , Atwill demonstrates the professor as a pragmatic businessman. At first he sold his services (apparently) to Nazi Germany. This has never been tackled, but it is believed that he believes they will win the war. Second, he is not a fool. As Dr. Tobel (William Post, Jr.) Having shown that he has almost physically collapsed from the torture of Moriarty's gang, the professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who support Tobel, because he is and would be as good a scientist as Tobel able to assemble the bomb site. I can not quite see how Zucco makes such a sensible decision on the spot, and if Daniell had to do it, he would be upset that his plans are again delayed. <br /> <br /> By the way, a trick used in all Holmes series regarding the professor is how he can rid the film of him. When you read the Holmes stories, Moriarty appears three times as a villain: in the recent story of THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, in the first story of THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE ADVENTURE OF EMPTY HOUSE ") and the last of the four novels / short stories (THE VALLEY OF FEAR). It's amazing how many kilometers the professor has had from so few appearances (he's also mentioned in two or three other stories - by the way). But because of his destiny at the Reichenbach Falls in "THE FINAL PROBLEM" and "THE EMPTY HOUSE" we always see him in death. Zucco falls from the White Tower on Tower Hill. Daniell (with more imagination) tries to flee Gregson and the police, but is shot dead jumping and does not hurt himself on the wall of an adjacent building. Atwill (not seen here, but heard here) seems to fall down on a trapdoor that he has built into an escape tunnel). After a while, it's really boring to see the professor always fall into these movies. Turn to the Gene Wilder comedy (admittedly a comedy) SHERLOCK HOLMES 'SMARTER BROTHER, in which Leo McKern is a wonderfully crazy and villainous Moriarty (complete with Irish accent), who in the end is not killed but is just left in thinking about a rowing boat about how his cautious plans did not work out. I liked that better. <br /> <br /> The use of the Dancing Men code, such as the use of "Devil's Foot Root" in DRESSED TO KILL, takes up part of the mystery of a short story. "THE ADVENTURE OF DANCING MEN" appeared in RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES and deals with a customer of Holmes, whose wife has received strange, blood-curdling messages in this code. Charles Higham, in his biography THE ADVENTURES OF CONAN DOYLE, indicates that Sir Arthur took the code from a 1870s magazine game, but we do not know. The code is essentially a correspondence for the figures of the dancing men. The story in the short story is dramatic, but treats a triangle. The only novelty in the movie is that Tobel makes a small change that baffles both Holmes and Moriarty. <br /> <br /> The movie is entertained but I still think that THE HOUSE OF BEAR, THE SCARLET CLAW and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH are better movies.
