Brilliant Biographic FILM ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Well, that's certainly one of my favorites. Biographical film. This movie was a complete surprise for me. I had avoided this movie for a long time. Well, that was because I'm not a fan of Jamie Foxx. I'm still not a big fan of him, but I'm sure I'm a FAN now. <br /> <br /> Well, he has earned every Oskar's BIT. His performance is one of the BEST achievements I've seen in a long time. He is really sensational! <br /> <br /> Well, the narrative or the flow of the story is brilliant for a biographical movie. I'm a DRAMA fan so I was not bored at all. <br /> <br /> I was too surprised because I liked the movie so much that I saw no flaws in the movie. I think there is no mistake in the movie. Maybe a few event errors But hey who cares? <br /> <br /> The performance of the woman who plays ray's mother was also really GOOD. And good, Kerry Washington? She has so much potential. If she plays the right role, she could just be the next Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> Well, the story of them was so emotional, so touching. I cried very bad ???? <br /> <br /> I do not mind if things were crazy or not, because this movie makes me cry? And that's a lot for me! <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie ???? One of the best of this century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
