This film is a pure work from beginning to end. Forget for a moment the famous 28-minute dialogue without dialogue, forget that he plays in Paris, and forget that he is Noir. The movie itself, the premise and the execution make this experience a pure gold experience. It is sharp, intelligent and well thought out, just like the robbery. It represents real characters that are not only credible but empathetic. It's a movie that does not glorify the idea of ​​a robbery, but shows it for what it is ... theft. It shows that a robbery is hard work and ultimately not worth it. Well, all that needs to be considered is a daring 28-minute sequence that does not speak a word and that plays in beautiful Paris with a lot of love for detail and fantastic camera and scene ... when you see the trees ... wonderful use of raw and basic film techniques ... in my opinion, it is a masterpiece and I am glad to have seen it.
