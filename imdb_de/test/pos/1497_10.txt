STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world, but not by This world. His mind just does not seem to understand things the way an average person would, and his life is a long catastrophe because of the constant misadventures and distant, crazy situations that he has to leave to himself he seems to be to mix with nobody and rarely speaks. But he never gives up, and despite the simplest of tasks, which is a constant struggle for him, in the end it always pays to use his own crazy methods to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> The Sorrow of Looking At The state of modern British humor, with all its focus on sex and general vulgarity, would make you forget to forget that a show like Mr Bean was made at one go. There is nothing inappropriate here, just good, clean Tommy Cooper humor and the like from the 50s. And I think it's just as funny as it was in the early 20's, when I was a little boy in the early 90's. <br /> <br /> Although I can now look a little deeper and see it there has to be more to this character than appears at first glance. There must be a reason why he does things the way he does, and it seems that things are going wrong for him. As others have noted, he seems to have some kind of autism. I'm so convinced of it that I really think a professional psychologist would be analyzing it. I think Mr. Bean could be the first famous fictional character to have diagnosed something like Asperger's Syndrome. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny British humor before being obsessed with sex and vulgarity, this would be highly recommended. Shows like Little Britain work because they are well implemented, but they are just as vulgar as the others. Shows like these show that we were once more cautious and civilized, and hopefully we could bring that kind of humor out soon. *****
