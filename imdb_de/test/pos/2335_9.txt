This is one of those films where the critics really missed the mark. This movie is practically McHales Marine for the 90s or the Police Academy at sea. Grammer proves that he can play other roles as a Frasier when he trumps and outwits the Navy to get his own submarine. Rob Schneider is as threatening as ever, in every role he is equal and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot, albeit with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as ever, with almost every line a buzzword. The film has a wonderful intelligent storyline and an unpredictable script that surprises me every time I look at it. However, many of the Navy phrases and expressions go over my head, but it's a small obstacle to the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters.
