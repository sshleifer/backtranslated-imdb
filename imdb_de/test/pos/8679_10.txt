I have to say this is the best movie I have ever seen. I know that it has received only negative reviews on this website, but I would like to be the good person who gives the best movie in the world a good rating. I think the movie is extremely funny and it has the perfect mix of everything. I feel all sorts of emotions when I see them, and I can not get enough of them. the soundtracks brilliant. I love it, I understand why people may not love it as much as I do, but I do not understand how people could hate it. The movie is 100% brilliant. Out of focus is incredible. I've never realized that Australian movies can be that good, and I've never realized that I can watch a movie so many times in a single day without getting full. I think everyone should look at it to get a sense of what life was like in the younger days, or whether it should be when you reach the end of year 12.
