The Cure is one of the few films that I rated 10 out of 10. I mean, everything is immaculate in this movie. I've seen it almost a year ago, and yet I remember a lot of scenes, especially the last moving scene associated with the credits. The two boys actor clearly gave everything they could, and this contributes significantly to an excellent plot that makes the movie perfect. <br /> <br /> The message is clear - friendship, and it will be displayed throughout the event. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say here. Simplicity is one of the things I love about this movie so much. And of course it's fun and moving at the same time. It suits people of all ages. <br /> <br/10 10/10, nicely done!
