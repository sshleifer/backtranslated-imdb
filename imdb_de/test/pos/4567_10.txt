Claudine is a movie that at worst represents the American system. The social system was initially created as a springboard for families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet. The film showed an accurate representation of how the social system breaks down the family unit. In other words, if the father or male figure is in the lives of women and children, their systemic financial support would be jeopardized if left unchecked. The struggles of the poor can be seen all over the world. I would like to see a replica of this movie in stores that anyone can rent or buy for their library collection.
