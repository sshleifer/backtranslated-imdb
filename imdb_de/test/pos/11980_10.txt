I saw "On the Run" in the New York Screening Room and was immediately seduced by his true, independent spirit. "On the Run" with Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia from The Soprano's Cast takes us on a 24-hour, wild ride through the city that never sleeps School Companion, just out of jail. In fact, he escaped and is "on the run" in search of some action and a glimpse into life in the middle of the big metropolis. Driven by great performances, this film conveys the old feel of the 70s pictures. Both characters rediscover themselves as they whiz through the city, encountering wild events and locals. "On the Run", an elegy for a certain side of New York that seems to be disappearing, shows great sensitivity and humor. I assume that this is a cult classic that wants to be discovered: Future viewers should definitely surrender to this nocturnal journey.
