Evil Ed is a Swedish film about a man named Ed (of course) and his collapse in total madness after making a series of B horror movies called "The Loose Limbs". Ed gets so angry that he thinks he sees demons and monsters, but in fact they are people he knows and people close to him, like his wife and daughter in 1998, and was stunned by what I did had seen. To date, this film is considered one of the darkest comedies ever. Since the movie is almost slapstick funny with its bloody scenes, there are still some scary moments left. <br /> <br /> This is a cool movie, but does not expect anything wonderful. It's just a funny movie that's good for showing some of your friends for some laughs. 8/10 stars
