This one started excellent. The photography and the audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially amazing is the use of "warm" and "cold" colors in single sequences. Getting Jennifer Lopez to whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to do with it. The script was awful. Lopez's part proved irrelevant or completely worthless to the plot. She seemed to see the movie just to sell herself and the picture. The three beds just seemed too obvious. The baptism of the child Carl was a psychologically too underlined way to understand the motive under which Carl "worked". And so on. In any case, the movie had a great way to show where Singh comes from. Why do the most talented directors seem to come from India nowadays?
