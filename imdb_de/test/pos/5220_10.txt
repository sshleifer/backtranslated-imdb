Father Hood <br /> <br /> I can understand why many people hate this story of a father who kidnapped his two children and carried them across America, but I have seen much worse and - when I saw those years I did not think it was terrible. Patrick Swayze is the worried father who chases away his children for personal reasons, and Halle Berry is the policeman who persecutes them. All in all a decent way to spend a few hours of your life. You could certainly do worse - ever hear of the movie "Pod People"? <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of ***** <br /> <br /> with PG-13 rates some traumatic scenes, adult content, violence and language.
