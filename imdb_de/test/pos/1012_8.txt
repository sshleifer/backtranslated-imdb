Despite some truly scenic locations in the Orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film does not quite reach the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts while remaining equally garbage-laden. The author of the original book Emmanuelle: The Pleasures of a Woman, Emmanuelle Arsan, has directed and played a minor role in this film, which usually shows a very young Annie Belle pornographic as she performs in a number of unusual sexual situations. Her friend, played by Al Cliver of ZOMBIE, actually agrees that she slept around and even persuades her to continue her practice, even though the two are married! Orso Maria Guerrini passes by as a professor, who is usually married to two women at the same time, one of which is played by Arsan himself. Although they started off promisingly and did some funny dialogue lines like "Can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I can see you better naked!" Schlottert the film to the less spectacular finale plottlos there. Similar to D'Amato's EMANUELLE AND THE LAST CANNIBALS, the main characters are looking for a lost tribe, but do not let them hope there's no violence or sex in this movie. Only a lot of nudity and stupid dialogue. I could not help finding some appreciation for this little movie, if only for the perfect Cornball logic the movie goes through.
