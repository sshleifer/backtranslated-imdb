FBI agents Mulder and Scully are assigned to investigate the mystery of an Arctic drilling team. In this early "X-Files" episode, David Duchovny himself considered one of her first "rocking" episodes. It's a lovely tribute to the acclaimed John Carpenter 1982 feature film The Thing, and you can see the similarities. Optically, color and lighting schemes combine the story to a hellish quality. Production Design / Art Direction are particularly impressive; The outdoor scenes of the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film that it automatically creates a Deja Vu feel for some viewers. Of course, our heroes are threatened by the weather, so the sound design that includes the wind evokes memories of "The Thing". The culprit is an ancient worm that was exposed to the team; Once in a host, it stimulates aggressive behavior. This allows the paranoia aspect to take full effect, and when we set up the script we can not know exactly who is infected and who is not. This leads to the inevitable testing phase. This episode certainly shows how group tensions can lead to failures. It even allows Mulder and Scully to have moments in which they are not sure if they can trust each other. <br /> <br /> Guest performers are a good small group of actors: Xander Berkeley, Felicity Huffman, and Steve Hytner as The scientists had to accompany Mulder and Scully on the mission and Jeff Kober as a pilot to take them to the camp. Once you see Jason Voorhees Portrayer Ken Kirzinger as one of the unfortunate original team members. <br /> <br /> By the way, there is a direct connection between 'Ice' and 'The Thing': Art Director Graeme Murray, who has worked on both projects. <br /> <br /> 8/10
