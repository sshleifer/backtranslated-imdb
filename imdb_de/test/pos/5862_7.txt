Barbet Schröder "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock is a solid piece of work, if not particularly convincing. I'm a big Sandra Bullock fan and she's here as a forensic detective, Cassie Mayweather, who's not very personable and also a broken person. However, there is a sense of distancing inherent in the story structure. It's about the perfect murder done by two spoiled sociopaths, Richard (Ryan Gusling), the coolest, and Justin (Michael Pitt), the likable geek. Basically Richard and Justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better to do at school. They are very smart and very arrogant, which is usually not a bad thing, but it just does not work here. The screenplay by Tony Gayton is a great work to detail the investigation into a mysterious murder. We have these two punk kids showing off their superiority and we just want them to fall. <br /> <br /> This is not a great exploration of the dark side, like Schröder's "Reversal of Fortune" about Claus von Bülow. There are interesting twists in "Numbers". The movie is not so much a thriller, but rather a character study by Cassie. Sandra Bullock balances Cassie's courage, her fear of letting people in and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character. Her partner and a kind of love interest, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is more of a nondescript act than a real character. Although Chaplin makes the confusion very admirable. The other nice touch is that Richard and Justin have a strange sexual attraction. The most interesting thing about "Numbers" is Pitt and Gusling. <br /> <br /> There are many entertaining twists in the movie. Everything is done very competently. I saw the movie about a week ago, and in retrospect I like it a bit more than I saw it. However, it is not inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve much better than us.
