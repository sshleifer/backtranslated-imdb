Jennifer Gray seems to be the most unlikely of the romantic leads, and that's probably why this popular movie is such a hit. It's all very well to make a version of Montagu's and Capulet's with sweeteners like dancing and glee-baiting Jewish family trolls, but there usually has to be an X-factor. Swayze is likely to make sure of this film. His rugged movements and the temperament of Travolta are convincing for this curly Penelope Pitstop teenager who has achieved the dream of the stunning market. The super (dated? Maybe? Immortal?) Soundtrack helps and of course the cunning idea to put the film in a place that gets from everyday life into everyday life and completes the imagination. 10.7
