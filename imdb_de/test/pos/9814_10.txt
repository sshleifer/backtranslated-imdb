In response to "confusion," the dog's injuries seem to have abruptly disappeared, but this may just have been a continuity mistake. But for the kids trying to make a plane out of junk, it's just a matter of imagination. These are two very young children who have extremely active ideas and must rely on these beliefs to escape the reality of their stepfather's abuse in their own home. For the stepfather, it is very interesting that the director does not show his face. That makes him more monstrous. When you show your face, this character becomes a person and not just this "monster" that terrorizes the childhood of these two innocent children. By showing children only the notions of abuse and not focusing the scenes on the abuse itself, the children are at the center of the film. This film has no loose ends, but runs like a father's story to his children. It has ornaments. This is a beautiful American classic.
