Well, unfortunately, I can not help being a bit disappointed after expecting a lot from Just Before Dawn. Jeff Lieberman is a terrific filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things on a small budget, but I still expected him to be far more sadistic and cruel. But actually, I'm beginning to believe that Lieberman is not to blame, but WE are the ones we have! It is more than obvious that Lieberman intended to make the Backwoods Slasher look like "Deliverance" and absolutely NOT like "Friday the 13th," which made the sub-genre immensely popular the year before. The horror and constant sense of threat comes not primarily from the crazy lunatics with their machetes, but from the truly sinister and isolated forests of Oregon where this movie was filmed. If the movie seems slow and uneventful, that's just because Lieberman takes the time to introduce the dark woods and sinister mountains as additional characters in his film. We barely see the killers personally, but it always seems like someone is luring behind the trees or under the mountain lakes. With that in mind, "Just Before Dawn" becomes a highly admirable horror effort, and indeed much better than its modern, blood-soaked counterparts. In the midst of an almost endless selection of bloody and ailing slashers, Lieberman focuses on suspense and character development. The story revolves around twenty-five friends leaving for a camping holiday in the woods of Oregon, where one of them owns a small piece of land. The forest is deserted and of course the campers ignore the Waldlanger Roy (George Kennedy!), To return to civilization. Shortly thereafter, they brutally meet an inbred family whose twin sons have murderous inclinations. All five main characters are surprisingly sympathetic and convincing! No irritating stereotypes for which you do not feel sympathy anyway, like nasty girls or football jocks. Because of this "natural" nature, they cheer automatically, even if they almost turn themselves into savages. The sublime camera work gives the film a sometimes unbearable level of tension, and Brad Fiedel's cooling electronic score only adds to this effect. "Before dawn" is a fine piece of horror of the early '80s, as long as you do not want blood dripping from your TV.
