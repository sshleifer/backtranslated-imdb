The first time I saw this DVD, I was not only happy that the band released something for the first time in decades, but also because the DVD itself is extremely loud. Jimmy Page obviously can not live with soft music, I think. However, I have to say that during the concert at the Royal Albert Hall they built up too many "how many times" and "moby dick". Besides, it was exquisite. My favorite song of all time is now on this DVD. Trampled on either this or "In my time of dying". In this song, Jimmy plays the thing really well. Ever seen Randy Rhoads play? Well, Jimmy plays just like him, only his guitar is lower.
