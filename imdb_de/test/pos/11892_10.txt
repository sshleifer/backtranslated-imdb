We just tested El Padrino in Australia. A phenomenal film work. We look forward to many more films by Mr. Chapa in the future. It was wonderful to see such a well-made film with such tension and a story that should remain an instant classic. Seeing Chapa's serious potential and his ability as a writer, actor, director and filmmaker really characterizes Chapa's quality film. Chapa has impressed many with his triumphant performance in "Blood In and Blood Out", and now he has proven to everyone that his works show his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with real artistic control. Featuring Kilo Vasquez as the perfect combination between Milo Velka of "Blood in Blood Out" and Al Pacino of "Scarface," the film will do wonders here in Australia.
