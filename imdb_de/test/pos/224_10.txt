I still count "police cadre!" as the funniest TV show of the 1980s. Somewhere on BetaMax I have all six episodes. I knew that a show that is so good is not going to last and that I have to keep it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers did not know that "police cadre!" was a comedy because there was no laughter! Law! If Drebin puts up a line like "You take a risk, just get up in the morning, drive to work, or put your face in a fan," how can THE COMING?!?!? I've watched every episode at least ten times and still see something new that I've missed before. Even the deep backgrounds always have gags. Do not miss it if you have the chance to see an episode, but if you're reading this, you probably already have copies of it like somewhere.
