After The Funeral was absolutely great and by far the best episode of the season. I was disappointed with Cards On the Table, which started off so well, but had dropped significantly in the last half hour. I did not know what to make of Taken After the Flood, though I remember being confused in the end. After the funeral, as I said, it's one of my favorite episodes of all time, with Five Little Pigs, Sad Cypress and The ABC Murders. I was afraid that they would ruin the story, but it is very faithful to the book. Now, I'm going to say that I do not mind making changes to books, and not trying to compare movies and adaptations to TV sources with their sources, unless the book is a masterpiece and it will not suit just. So I did not like some marples like Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far outside the Poirots. The murder of Roger Ackroyd, Taken At The Flood and cards on the table are the only ones that were really disappointed. Everything else ranges from good to excruciating, even the recent appointment with death was surprisingly good, despite the many deviations from the book, which I do not consider favorites, thanks to the excellent production values, outstanding ensemble performances and outstanding music. Back to After the Funeral, the production values ​​are fantastic. It really feels cinematic, and the stunning photography and gorgeous scenery and costumes make it a feast for the eyes. The music was very moving and even insistent and the whole cast gives wonderful performances. David Suchet is as immaculate as Poirot, and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are just as great. But for me Monica Dolan as Mrs. Gilchrist was the outstanding role. She is with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best supporting actress in a Poirot episode. So good was her performance. All in all a must, one of the best Poirot episodes by far and also one of the more faithful. 10/10 Bethany Cox
