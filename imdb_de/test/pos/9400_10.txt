This movie is on my top 20 list of comedies. This is a really unique movie. To the reviewer who said "I really need to miss something" - you're right. They miss something. If you do not have the humor that this movie demands, that's one thing. But do not give a bad rating because you think it's "looney," but it's not intended. Loony is an apt description of what it should be and what it manages to be. I've laughed about this movie much more often and much more intensively than most other funny movies. Michael Almereyda, in this first major movie for which he was, nominated the best of his cast for an Independent Spirit Award for the Best First Film. Crispin Glover is, as usual, absolutely brilliant in an inexplicable way, and some of his funniest lines have been said in this film. Glover is clearly the best comic actor working. Harry Dean Stanton delivers an excellent comic performance. William Burroughs is unbelievable in a small role. Dylan McDermott was ideally staffed and Lois Chiles is absolutely excellent. All of the above is perfectly funny in its perfect way, but this is one of Crispin River's Edge and Willard's best performances. If you're a fan of Crispin Glover, but have somehow missed this movie, you'll have to stop what you're doing and see it immediately. <br /> <br /> But remember to relax first and maybe a beer or something. This is a great movie, but it is very unusual, and I recommend that you create or create a reasonably stupid state of mind before looking at it.
