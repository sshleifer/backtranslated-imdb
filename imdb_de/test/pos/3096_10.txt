Successful films on metaphysical topics are rare, but mirage is a good case. You can cross the big theme with youth ambitions, but Duke does a surprisingly good job. The film is intended to show people and even the world from a nonhuman perspective. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three parts: Creation, Paradise and The Golden Age. The images of each contrast with the voice-over. Although the text of "The Creation" (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the original wasteland, the scene does not go on to illustrate the myth. It lives on garbage and on various objects of destruction (fire, smoke, destroyed vehicles). The images of "Paradise" are anything but that, and "The Golden Age" is darkly funny. The highest culture is the strange musical act on the roadside. <br /> <br /> The Popol Vuh suggests that humanity is the central object of creation, but the film does everything it can to reverse that idea. Their mythological framework has no relation to human time. There are no human characters to talk about. If a boy is standing in a longer setting with a dog, the original suggestion is the boy's point of view. In the end, it's more about the dog. Likewise, the lizard is a stronger character than the human that introduces it, and the turtle's partner looks barely human with its large fins. <br /> <br /> Animal stories and nature documentaries are always anthropomorphic. Certainly the dunes look like a female body, but the parable cuts both ways. Presumably only man can easily distinguish between his creation and his nature, and here planes and factories are presented alongside mountains, lakes and waterfalls. Man and civilization are part of a broader natural landscape. Herzog reinterpreted the idea in 1979 when he reissued Nosferatu from the perspective of the vampire.
