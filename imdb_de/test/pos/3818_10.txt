It makes no sense to compare this with the original series. Although they differ in appearance and content, they both correspond to the original idea. This is a SF / horror anthology series. Due to different schedules in Australia, I was only able to catch a small number of episodes over the first few seasons. The very first episode really got me goose bumps (nightmares at my age ...!), But some others fell flat; Generally when the stories moved into horror areas and away from SF. I just hope the DVDs reach us sometime.
