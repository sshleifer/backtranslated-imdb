This delightful, well-written film is based on a New York stage play bearing the same title in which Sir Aubrey (in 1944 the knight Sir Charles Aubrey Smith) played the role he plays in the film. Here, in 1931, we see him at the beginning of his acting renaissance in the very early era of the "Talkies" and in the role that he would make his own in 1949 until his death in 1948 after his last appearance in Little Women , <br /> <br /> This captivating piece is about an elderly British aristocrat who finds his illegitimate children and introduces them after he has brought them to his mansion in England. Marion Davies plays his erroneous daughter and it is a show of strength for her. She is suddenly adorable, impatient, flat, charming, wise and compassionate, while creating an indelible and beguiling character that has been well remembered. <br /> <br /> The 26-year-old Ray Milland appears here in a small room A prominent role, however, has been seen in seven other pictures in more than two years, not just in movies. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film was to be enjoyed as a representative of Hollywood factory production in 1931, and this is not immaculate. It is, however, a charming pleasure from the first to the last scene.
