The Hookers have been a great everyday story for me, like someone you may know. I'm just trying to make it, my big litter is just around the corner. Then the little temptations of life sneak in, the spoiler stumbled again. How much can your love take and give to the guy who really is not that bad, after all, just a human. I liked it, I was also paid extra in the movie. I played drums in the bar, did several walking shots with the band, my green 66 'Corvette was in the motel party shots. Wonderful cast and crew, first-class people, down-to-earth movie. I had lunch with James Coburn on Mother's Day. What a wonderful man, as I have known him for years, I will never forget him. My father spent the day with Slim Pickens and exchanged horse tales. Slim was really down to earth as well. I love these guys, we really miss them. Real people who make films about real people, Thanks Levy, Gardner and Laven.
