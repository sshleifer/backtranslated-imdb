My Architect was nominated for the best documentary film of the 2004 Academy Awards and follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his search for his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974 when Nate was 11 years old and left an incredible but limited amount of work, unpaid debts and three separate families, all living only a few miles apart. <br /> <br /> My architect follows Kahn's life by chronologically examining his buildings and permeating their beauty with the story of a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius. As the son whom Lou never publicly recognized during his lifetime, Nate has cautiously entered history without overcoming the main focus. <br /> <br /> Exploring the magnificent Salk Institute in California, Nate evokes the mythical use of space and light in his building, making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for the audience. The shot of Nate rolling in Salk's smoke-white central hangout underscores the building's harmony with nature. It's breathtaking. My architect also reveals the difficulties Louis Kahn had in adopting his designs. Some fantastic buildings exist only on paper and are discarded by more practical architects and developers. Only when Louis Kahn went east did his visions become enthusiastically received. In India, where he built the Indian Institute of Management, a former employee named him a guru. In Bhangladesh, where he built the magnificent National Assembly building, the citizens regard him as the father of democracy. <br /> <br /> My Architect's reputation is a wonderful way to explore the architecture and meaning of the space. But it is the irony of Lou Kahn's selfishness, coupled with the transcendence of his work, that will inspire you. 4 stars
