I would suggest that Only the Valiant is one of the most original and intriguing and in some ways crazy movies Peck has ever done. daring, surprising and one of his few best westerns (no, of course no Western, but a military chronicle that is sometimes better). It's pretty cheap, but oh, very original and striking. It's one of those treats that a true buff sometimes gets; Films that no one has ever told you exist. They say "that sounds fascinating or interesting" and exceeds your expectations. <br /> <br /> All in all, the script shows a maturity that's unusual for the Westerns, and it somehow reminded me of ULZANA; It is also no nonsense tension. <br /> <br /> Peck looked smart as a young and tough, somewhat gloomy and stoic officer; and there are many unexpected touches? Like the blonde who kisses and flirts with the one she has decided not to marry, maybe a sense of her for justice and retribution? <br /> <br /> Even genre? JUST ?? is so much more than a military story, it's also an action drama, a suspense movie, a commando / action thriller - the funniest combo you can imagine; a bunch of soldiers in a special mission to counteract and stop a potential Indians attack? - the crazy decision not to bring all available troops to the place where these natives could be stopped - but only a handful of people? - and this action never takes a crap path as most would and would do. The interest for the people, for the people and their reasons and actions never sink. <br /> <br /> A fitting word about Peck himself; he performs on brio, and although I usually find his famous movies rather bland and boring, on such small trips I find all Peck's sombre and even chilled glamor intact. He was an unusual star. I like to recommend this extraordinary film.
