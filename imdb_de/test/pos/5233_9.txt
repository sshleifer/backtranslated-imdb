This film is important to those of us who are interested in Western history as it uses authentic techniques in its production. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the wagon train are especially authentic. As far as I know, it contains the only scenes ever filmed to illustrate the techniques for river crossing on a bluff. The horses and mules must be lowered at river level and the wagons are lowered by ropes and pulleys. The scene is such that I kept watching how I tried to get a sense of what a crossing was like ... and the early travelers kept repeating it as they crossed the land. <br /> <br /> Aside from melodrama, this image is as authentic as it looks in terms of clothing and style, and that's why it's worth looking at.
