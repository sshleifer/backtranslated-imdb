It carries the tone that sets the book in the jungles of Vietnam and the wild-looking gaze of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity around Colonel Kurtz (I'm not telling Marlon Brando because he's the documentary "Hearts of Darkness" skeptical of how much credit Brando pays for this quality) The tone I'm talking about is brutal and dramatic, without being overbearing: "Everyone gets what they want, I wanted a mission, and for my sins they have me It's forgiving, without being tight and alienating, a good example of this is Hopper's indulgence in aphoristic madness by generously installing lines from TS Eliot and Rudyard Kipling in his stony monologues Sometimes, he walks right past you without saying a word, and sometimes he grabs you by the collar and says, "Did you know that?" "If" is the remedy word in "life"? If you can hold your head while you are around you lose your "and then" I mean, he's a wise man, he's a great man; I should have been a couple of ragged claws flitting across the floors of still seas. "(The first Kipling, the second Eliot.)
