I saw Peter Watkins Culloden and The War Game a few months earlier and was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same or at least very similar, describing a case against California dissidents in the (apparently) near future, as well as attempts by a group of convicted "criminals" to wander the fifty miles Desert to gain their freedom in a state-run "detention park" as an alternative to jail. Watkins films everything in a documentary style that leads to more than a bit of awkwardness or requires a strong suspension of unbelief: how come the camera crew spend two days with the group of starving and parched prisoners without offering them help or themselves? to participate in misery? And that's just the most obvious example. But questionable storytelling aside. No matter, you have to be interested in political filmmaking to really get involved, but the movie really is not like anything else of its time: it does not pull punches and offers no easy solutions. The leftist political figures are certainly at times broadly painted, but they are not all the same; The right-wing government officials seem a bit more cartoonish, but even they may at least show a bit of humanity. Overall, the film gives a lot to think and leaves an indelible taste ... 8/10 DVD rental
