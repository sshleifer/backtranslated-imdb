Okay, the first time I saw "Talk Radio" was in a video shop for only $ 2.00 on VHS, believe it or not, and I looked at it and thought it might be Howard Stern Because I saw it about thirty seconds, it just did not look anymore. Then one month later I went to another store and found "Talk Radio" on DVD for only $ 5.00. I see it was directed by Oliver Stone and I picked it up. After the movie, I was speechless. I have never seen such a movie. Here's the main picture, then I'll tell you what I thought about it. <br /> <br /> This is a radio station in Dallas, Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio host who talks about what other people and he is talking about and takes everything seriously. Well, a network wants to put its show live throughout the US. So, Barry's show gets many interesting phone callers like Chet (a neonatzi), Kent (a rock'n'roll drug kid), John (rapist) and others. Some of the callers now sound like the same actors. Nevertheless, I think it fits well. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. The dark music in the background fits very well. It also has a flashback scene in the movie about how it started with radio, which worked well in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But the great thing about the movie is over. I was surprised, and somehow you feel paranoid about the callers from the air and everything about it is wonderful. You'll also learn how to tell people in a big city like Dallas the right things. One of Oliver Stone's underrated / weakest films was mentioned, but I think it's his best in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But you should definitely get this movie if you like movies with paranoia - movies like in a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background. I still watch this movie a lot when I'm bored, and I saw it tonight. Yes, if you really want to get the weird impression of the movie, look at it in the evening with the lights off. I may sound crazy, but it makes the movie better! <br /> <br /> Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason why I think the movie did not go so well, maybe from my point of view, is because of the tracks. 'Talk radio.' It does not sound very tricky or anything, it's kind of easy. A better title like the book "Talked To Death" or maybe "The Missing Radio Host" or something catchy and not easy "Talk Radio". Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Normally, Oliver Stone did not do Universal, I do not think so. Paramount was possibly a good company. I do not know, something about this movie did not work that well, but I love it. <br /> <br /> "Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause permanent damage."
