I'm not sure why this movie has so little IMDb on average if it's absolutely everything you could want in a horror movie. This is the definition of a horror movie. I consider myself a big horror fan and I have to say that this house delivers the goods. Wax House is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game who decide to camp for the night and meet with a local cracker. When they wake up the next morning, they make a cruel discovery and decide to go to town for a broken car part. The city is scary and I'll just stop there. Because that's when the really cruel mess begins. Trust me when I say that if you go in search of a horror movie you will see that you will love it. It is wonderfully devilish and imaginative with its deadly scenes, the story is interesting and the characters are subtly drawn by the actors, which give them a touch of personality. Including Paris Hilton, who does quite well with her part. The film is a bit flat, but it's so much fun and who cares. This movie should eat the box office and all horror fans should be involved. Look at House of Wax, a skin-peeling film, super-glued lips, dead carcasses, hot wax sprayed on a living person, a finger cut off, a beheading, a pole through the head and head much more. I was fortunate to see this movie at the Tribeca premiere, and all the actors were present to promote the film. And they have something to be proud of. House of Wax is the scariest scootercoater ride of the year! 9.10
