This was one of the most emotional movies I have seen. Passion, pleasure, pain, despair, grief, healing, purification and love. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fascinating. Everything was done so well; the adaptation from the book, the actors, the sets, the camera shots. <br /> <br /> This film has touched me deeply in many ways. It reminded me of the despair that the loss of your love can have and the time it takes to heal this wound. You may love again, but you always risk the pain that comes with the separation. Is not this one of the most important ancient questions? Is it better to have love and have lost? have already loved? "<br /> <br /> -Akension
