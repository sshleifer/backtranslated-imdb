This episode is currently the best in the series. The story was told perfectly. I especially liked how the authors made a Desmond episode; It was his best performance so far and he definitely deserved the Emmy for his performance. <br /> <br /> In this episode, we had answered some of our questions, but since the show is called Lost, we know that there will be more questions, too, grown up First, the answer: Walt is finally united with his father Michael, secondly Michael's betrayal is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurly, and because of this betrayal, Kate, Jack and Sawyer are all captured by The Others. This was a great way to end the show. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the island, we see Locke undergoing a mental breakdown with the button. This leads to another answered question as to how the plane really crashed. There are, however, a few unanswered questions: First, what happened to Locke, Eko, and Desmond when Desmond turned on the security key and what about the Arctic scientists looking for electromagnetic annamoles. I think we'll find out next season, but it's a great ending to the best show on TV.
