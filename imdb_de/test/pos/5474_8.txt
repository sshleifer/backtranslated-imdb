Wolfgang Petersen (The Boat, Air Force One) shows us a thrilling movie in which the supporting actor John Malkovich is honored. His criminal attempt to assassinate the president was first-rate and credible. That does not mean the efforts of Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo or Fred Dalton Thompson, who is a real idiot of a white man, belittle Chief of Staff of the House. Eastwood was great and I love every movie Russo plays. <br /> <br /> The film features original music by the five-time Oscar winner (Mal√®na, Bugsy, The Untouchables, The Mission, Days of Heaven), Ennio Morricone. That alone makes it worth your time.
