Mr Bean was a lot of fun, I loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for that role, he's a fun looking guy and his facial expressions were hilarious !!! <br /> <br /> The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997, which incidentally was pretty funny !! <br /> <br /> It's fun to see all the adventures and situations in which he puts himself, this series was certainly a classic, and I'm still watching an episode. <br /> <br /> Mr Bean is worth 10/10 in my book, fans of unusual comedy need to check this out.
