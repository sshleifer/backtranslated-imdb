Hey, it's just TV. Sure, it's STAR TREK, the most popular blah blah, and that's a great one, but it's all relative. What matters is that a guy in elven ears crouches with a pattern of pizza-colored tufts of carpet. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of DRIRD MAN Noirishness in tunneling, and it's scarier than many episodes is after all one of the better TV shows. The tension is really exciting. The danger really feels dangerous. I think as a small child I cried when Spock told me that this vile creature was as sad, scared and horrified as the people who ate it. This was one of my first lessons in empathy, a lesson reinforced by the EMPATH episode, which, though less exciting, was even more melancholic. Like meat and tomato cutlets, actually there is more or less rock. This kind of choice may now seem visionary, but the idea of ​​a hippie designer pulling a universe through the mirror might just think of the drug time.
