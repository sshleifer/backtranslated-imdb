Beautifully filmed, the extension of Gypsy culture in the context of their music. Travel through a continent and experience the amazing musical styles of various groups of Gypsy peoples. It's kind of misleading to say that this movie is not told. It is masterfully narrated by the music itself, the soaring melodies and subtitle lyrics tell a story much better than a narrator. Watch this movie.
