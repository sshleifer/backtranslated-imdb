There's a running thread in the movie comedy that all the great comics are missing the law or going to jail. Think of the Conman W.C. by Conman W. Fields in THE ALT FASHIONED WAY or the Marx brothers in A NIGHT OF THE OPER or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER by Mae West, in which she made it. The edge of the law is inevitable, and when they land on the side of the law, the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic. Think of Lloyd in his first talk, WELCOME DANGER, trying to 'assist' the San Francisco Police Department in the midst of a crime wave and get police sergeant Edgar Kennedy to kill him. Imagine Laurel and Hardy being unlucky policemen in MIDNIGHT PATROL. I find that this kind of hostility in all of these comedies of these giants (and their colleagues) is so patented that even a fake title for a movie has to do with it. Think of Jerry Seinfeld in an episode of his series, in which he creates a three-short short film, SAPPY PAPPIES, in which the boys are electrocuted for murder. Buster Keaton often draws the forces of law and order to his opponents in his comedies. Look at STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. Where he tries to pull his father out of a calabash. But he actually had more conflicts with the police in his shorts. In CONVICT 13 he is dragged to prison if he is believed to have been a refugee convicted. In COPS (perfect title - if you understand it, you understand), the police in a big city are repeatedly looking for Keaton (mistaken for a terrorist). And in THE GOAT he can not avoid the police most of the time. <br /> <br /> Keaton is a tramp that is just looking for food. But he is absolutely unlucky. When he sees a stranger throwing a lucky horseshoe (which Keaton ignored earlier) over his shoulder, and then finds a wallet full of money, Keaton tries the same and hits a cop in the head. The policeman gives chase, and Keaton (as luck would have it) meets another policeman, tries to behave normally, but ends by throwing the other policeman in the path of the first policeman. He soon has three police officers following him. He briefly shakes her and walks through a window in the local jail where the murderer "Dead Shot Dan" (Malcolm St. Clair *) is photographed. Keaton walks past the barred windows and is stupid enough to stop and look straight into it. The Desperado notices this and ducks as the picture is taken. When Dead Shot flees from the police, it is Keaton's face on all the wanted posters. <br /> <br /> (* St. Clair would eventually be a successful director of dumb and early sound comedies, though this would be the case in his later biography a stint at 20th Century Fox, where his work with Laurel & Hardy Keaton flees by train to another city (separates the passenger cars with his pursuers from the locomotive and the tender) This is the movie (incidentally) that has two famous Keaton jokes and arrives on the locomotive in A distant setting that is coming closer, and suddenly the audience sees Keaton on the Cowcatcher. <br /> <br /> The second famous sequence goes later (and may have influenced Chaplin at the beginning of CITY LIGHTS). Keaton accidentally did A man who had argued too hard with a pretty woman with a dog (Virginia Fox), when he sees the poster calling him a murderer, believes he killed the man adt is chased by a suspicious police chief (Joe Roberts) and temporarily loses Roberts in the park. A statue of "man-of-war" is being built, and the sculptor is revealing a clay model. Keaton sits on the clay model, trying to maintain his dignity as the horse's clay legs collapse under his weight. <br /> <br /> Keaton meets pretty Mrs. Fox, who invites him home for dinner. Only he does not know that her father is Roberts. The last five minutes of the movie deal, when Keaton flees and Roberts gets out of the way while he and Fox get away together. <br /> <br /> It's a funny comedy and a wonderful example of Keaton's best work.
