I thought it was awesome! It was great to see the moderator tracking each one of them. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had barely changed, not even Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as rude! I thought Mr. T looked thinner, but it was still great to see him look the whole time. I thought it took a while to track down the other cast members, like Decker and the lady Amy played. It was only a shame that Mr. T. could not do the actual reunification. It was also a pity that George Peppard had died leaving a gap, so to speak. I only wish that I took it in to keep it. Let's hope they repeat it again.
