I love the mockumentary format that Chris Guest and his crew have developed over the years. I like that and "Waiting for Guffman" actually better than "Spinal Tap", that was the first of the group (and was made by Rob Reiner, but had guest and some of his regular players). This humor is not for everyone. IT is rather subtle and not too physical, so some people may not get in touch with each other. As a dog lover (and dog fans) I really liked this movie. There are so many funny lines! My daughter and I often quote them together. I find it amazing that these people can offer so much fun material for every movie! What fun they have to be. I recommend it to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side.
