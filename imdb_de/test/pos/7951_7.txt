I have seen this movie with high expectations, but was a bit disappointed. Although I like this movie and was intrigued by the story, I did not find it moving and thought the end fell flat. <br /> <br /> The story consists of the friendship between a man who runs a photo shop and his best customer. Who is a traffic cop? The location is a picturesque Korean village. <br /> <br /> This film is somewhat realistic in that it has an element of tragedy and yet is not melodramatic. In the end, however, I was not moved by a movie showing a man so loved by a woman, but she does not even have the choice to enter his life. In my eyes, he is a sweet, noble loser. <br /> <br /> Good points - Excellent acting in the two main roles, enjoyable snapshot of village life <br /> <br /> Disadvantages - End of the apartment> <br /> Overall - good, but I prefer the movies " Before Sunrise "and" After Sunset "(or before sunset and after sunrise).
