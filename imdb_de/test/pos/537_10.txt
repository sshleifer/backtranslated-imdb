Most families will find similarities between their own family and those created by brilliant portraits by Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Natalie creates a picture on the screen that honors her as one of America's best actresses and a Golden Globe nomination. Control over their emotions is so in tact that they can address them at any point in the film and release an unforgettable scene. Susan is also amazing in this movie when she once again chooses a role that is different from everyone else and that she does with true professionalism. <br /> <br /> Any Natalie fan would have seen the movie because of its past successes, but you should also see it for the emotions that are triggered during the movie. It is a really humiliating experience.
