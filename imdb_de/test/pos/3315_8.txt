I saw the first few moments on TCM a few years ago, but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw that it was performed at the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto, and I promised to make the 40-minute drive. The Stanford is an old-fashioned movie house that starts every movie with closed curtains. Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When "The Best of All" appeared in huge pink letters in front of the New York City skyline, I knew I was right to wait. <br /> <br /> I got this movie. There were so many little moments that supported the look and feel of the film: When Hope Lange first enters the publisher, the titles of the magazines published there are pressed onto the glass (The Teenager and Elegance); Joan Crawford's fancy apron she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without messing up her outfit; the way in which the camera declined to show how crazy Suzy Parker was (she was almost sideways at one point); how Hope Lange lived in this seedy apartment she shared with the others, even though she obviously made a lot more money than at the beginning of the movie (presumably it was too scandalous for a single girl to live alone). <br /> <br /> Hope Lange was so beautiful. So was Suzy Parker. And how about Mark Goddard in a non-speaking role. I fell in love with him when I was a kid who saw Lost in Space. <br /> <br /> When I saw this gem on the big screen, I arranged to plan another hike to Stanford to see The Old Dark House. Incidentally, I bought a small soda and popcorn at the concession stand, and I was stunned when the worker asked me for two dollars.
