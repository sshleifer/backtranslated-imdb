This film tells the story of several couples coping with life after World War II. Through many moving accounts, the audience learns how the war has changed people while their human spirit triumphed. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene where a young serviceman who came home as a double amputated man came home with both arms down to his elbow) is sure he will love his sweetheart, who still wants to marry him would do no good. His girl simply said that she would help him with things he could not do, but that they would be fine. Moved by this true love demonstration, the man hugs his fianc√©e in tears. <br /> <br /> The scene in which a service employee applies for a bank loan is also a highlight. When initially rejected as "high risk", a senior bank official takes over: "They fought for our country and brought us to safety - that's good enough for me, your loan is approved!" "The best years of our lives" won 6 Oscars, including a special statuette for the disabled actor, which has shown us that life goes on and remains worth living even with a serious handicap. It's a pleasure to see this movie again and again. A true classic! Highly recommended!
