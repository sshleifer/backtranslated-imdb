I'm sorry to repeat myself over and over, but here's another great Columbo episode. I think that's why I'm such a fan - most episodes are really great! The best consequences always have one outstanding quality, and in this case, the killer and his accomplice may be the youngest villains in Columbo. <br /> <br /> After watching a lot of episodes in which Columbo and his opponent behave like that, it's good to see an episode of emotional struggles and bad emotions surfacing. There is only one episode a bit more drama and bite. Columbo quickly relies on the fact that the two students who claim to help him are not laughing very secretly at him and giving him false hints. He plays happily and deliberately turns the bumblebee in order to underestimate him! But of course he immediately knows when they talk about nonsense. <br /> <br /> The murder itself is another complicated murder, similar to The Bye Bye Sky High IQ episode, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill you the intended target while using the assassins with one supply seemingly watertight alibi. Between 1978 and 1990, the technology of turntables and fireworks has evolved into remote-controlled auto-locking systems and hidden cameras. Stephen Caffrey performs excellently as Justin Rowe, the disgusting spoiled student. Gary Hershberger is cautious, but good as his "yes-man" friend Cooper Redman. And it's nice to see Robert Culp as Mr. Rowe, Justin's father. <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in every way.
