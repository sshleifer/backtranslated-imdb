Not every line in a comedy is funny. This film takes on a serious topic, vindicating the electorate, and exposes it to the light while telling jokes about it. It's the movie The Daily Show would have done if they wanted to make a movie out of it. I thought that Robin Williams is a lot funnier in this movie than in RV. And while my wife and I share some opposing political views, we both have twice laughed in several parts of this film. The scriptwriters here could give Fox News some lessons in a fair and balanced manner. Lewis Black was okay with his part, but never seemed to be able to bring out his special kind of comedy for his role. Christopher Walken was also good, playing his relatively ordinary, subdued supporting role and pushing a story.
