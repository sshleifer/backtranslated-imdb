Giant movie about filmmaking. Shows the intense and strange relationships that can arise between directors and their actors; the manipulation and thought games; the selfish selfishness of the interpreters. As in any workplace, sexuality complicates matters, but here in the last degree, as they film a sex scene. <br /> <br /> Absolutely fantastic performances by Gregoire Colin as a fragile, wannabe macho male lead and - towering - Anne Parillaud as a self-portrait of the director. The picture of how she laughs in the end and eats a banana and finally got from her dolls what she wants is a true pleasure.
