80s comedies (especially with John Cusak) are fantastic. Almost all are intoxicating and instant classics, and this movie is no exception. Numerous nods to other movies (ie, Godzilla and Jaws) in this movie that are so great that you will laugh for hours. Some may complain that the film is sometimes a bit cheesy, but hey, it was in the 80's and things were always a bit cheesy. Throw a young Demi Moore and a louder Bob Cat and have a laugh party with your fans. If you have not seen it yet, you'll feel better !!!!!!
