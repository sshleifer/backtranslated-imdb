I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows ahead of me and about 12 "x 10". So I really would not see it. But I like Malcolm in the middle, so I thought I would only see for a few minutes. Next, I know that I'm tense and have a great time. I was glad how good it was and how fast it seemed that time passed. I agree that acting is very good for this entertainment level. As one of the older baby boomers, I was also very pleased to see Lee Majors star in the movie, as did some of the other actors who were famous ("Yesterday"), but are now out of the spotlight and enjoying it yourself. <br /> <br /> It's your basic "kid is wrong, kid even gets (and then some) and everyone enjoys the process". No hard thinking, no great analysis needed. Just a good fun to pass the time. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 5.
