Okay, this series takes the path of "here we go again!" Week in, week out, the character of David Morse, who is in a cucumber, helps - but what's wrong with that? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors and certainly the coolest, and it's heaven to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - love for this show from many, I can not see her turning into a season Series goes - but you never know? The amount of garbage that went beyond baffles me - let's hope that something good passes a first series !!!
