As for most women, this movie is the ultimate chick movie. With hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs I mean a timeless classic like (I had) The time of my life & the wonderful She's Like The Wind makes this movie. I love Patrick Swayze in this movie and he shows that he can sing and dance, it's so hot. He sings in the film "She is like the wind". The chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Gray is amazing. I love dancing and everything that goes with it. But to say this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is great too, but Patrick Swayze scenes do. I love the songs, the dancing and everything about it, but it's not Dirty Dancing. Like I said, it's a great chick movie. Please leave a third place because I love to see what happens to Patrick's character Johnny. Jennifer's character could have been sexier, but hey Patrick makes up for it, if you know what I mean !!! Great movie and I am so happy that Billy Zane did not win the movie role. I heard whispering that he was meant for the role, but they found out that he could not dance.
