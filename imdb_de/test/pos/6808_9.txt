A sentimental, heartbreaking family movie set in England in the 1920s. A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter her in the Grand National. Fortunately, ex-jockey Mickey Rooney is helping Liz. Director Clarence Brown shows a remarkable control with material that could have been excessively maudlin in the hands of another person. He and screenwriters Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves are committed to creating real characterizations and developing the story in a natural way. There are one or two scenes that seem a little forced, but overall, they are pretty impressive and filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is pretty exciting, and like so many great classics, there's a wonderful three-tank fade-out in the end. Liz proves that she was a real soldier from the start, and Rooney - whom I tend to annoy - is surprisingly muted and really good. Donald Crisp is terrible because Liz's grumpy father and Angela Lansbury as an older, boyish, crazy sister are a joy. However, most acting kudos include Anne Revere, who won a deserving Oscar as a supporting actress who played Liz's smart and caring mother.
