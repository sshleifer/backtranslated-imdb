Jack Frost 2 is probably the cheesiest movie I've ever seen in my life. The full title of the movie is Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman. Horror movie fans who are fond of camping stories will be pleased. This movie was shot directly on video for good reasons. Here is the reason: Acting was so cruel and so terrible that you could make you cry. The main character had no personality, and the actor's bad drama made everything worse. The script was cruel too. Every character always says a cheesy line and adds the bad choreography the cheesy lines, then you have something bad. Second, the story is not really impressive, but since this movie was shot directly on video, it's forgiven. The director and writer could have turned the idea of ​​a killer snowman into something cool, but they did not. Your story has many storylines. In the beginning, a cup of coffee with the melted Jack Frost is beaten into the fish tank. Scientists are trying to restore their lives, but they could not. After the cup of coffee had fallen into the tank, Jack Frost was completely restored. Now he is immune to frost. In Jack Frost, Part 1, the main character's DNA was mixed with the antifreeze that killed Jack Frost. Since the main character is allergic to bananas, it is also Jack Frost. So here's my point. They say that Sam's DNA was combined with Jack Frost. However, one of the scientists had some saliva in the cup. If he fell into the tank, the DNA of the scientists would have been combined with Jack Frosts. Besides, the special effects were not very good. Here are the good points: Jack Frost 2 has a lot of blood, which looks pretty realistic. Although this movie is flawed to hell, it's still entertaining. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is an entertaining horror movie. The first one was better. 7 out of 10.
