A raw, edgy thriller that aspired to great philosophical heights he could not quite reach. I still enjoyed the movie very much. It had great elements of tension that left me with the gratifying backbone I expect from thrillers, and this was accomplished psychologically without any escalation of blood and blood. The soundtrack and setting added perfectly to the excitement. At times it was a bit unpolished, especially the acting and character development. It could only have been a better movie if we had known more about the nightmares of the past, which the characters see when they close their eyes, and why they desperately wanted to search for the "answer" that they wanted the action is so important. After all, they seemed to be looking for it, although they knew, or at least suspected, what might happen if they found it. I would recommend watching this movie if you're ready to look over the sand to see the potential of a diamond in the rough.
