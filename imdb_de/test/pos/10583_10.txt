I bought this movie last night and I love it. Everyone played great, especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera. The whole plot was great, and as Dunn said in the extras on the DVD, it seemed like he was going to relive the whole thing. This movie has made my number one in my favorite movies! I can not stop playing scenes over and over again just to see them again. I've never done that with another movie. I would definitely recommend this to other people because it's such a great movie and if you like Bam Margera it's a perfect movie for you !! The little montages they show between each scene are just great. I think that this must be my favorite parts of the movie. They are very sad, mainly with music from the band "HIM", which of course is my favorite band.
