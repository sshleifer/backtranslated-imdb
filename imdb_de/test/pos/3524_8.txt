Five teenagers set out to camp in the Oregon wilderness, and despite being warned by the Park Ranger, they quickly realize there's something lurking in the backwoods just waiting to strike. <br /> <br /> When it gets old horror movies, the only one that keeps coming up in every conversation is Friday, the 13th, so I've made it my mission to find those good old horror movies that are going down just compared with Friday the 13th, just before dawn I was one of those I found, and was really very impressive. It was not as boring as some of the stuff you find today, it was very spicy in terms of character development as it had some sympathetic ones and it has this very casual pace, it's not in a hurry to get it It takes time to set the right mood and tone, and it's very atmospheric and creates excitement when you always feel like you're scared out there, but you do not know where it is or when will trike. <br /> <br /> Where I live, it's definitely an overlooked gem, simply because people never heard of it or gave it a shot, but I say it's not Friday the 13th rip-off. The two concepts are not even approaching each other, but in my opinion it is one of the more impressive slashers I have seen for some time.
