An undervalued, unseen gem. Estevez has done a remarkable job of painfully and heartbreakingly illustrating the tension between a son who was in hell and back and his parents who can not understand the emotional scars left behind. Born is not dissimilar on July 4 because it is an emotional and psychological collapse of a soldier after serving in Vietnam, while focusing more on politics in Vietnam (anti-war speeches, etc.). this is about a much more personal topic: family. A man's struggle to return to normal after a life-changing experience, and his parents' failure to see the change that has taken place. Estevez makes a smoldering performance as Jeremy Collier. You can feel the pain and frustration bubbling under the surface. Centimeter by centimeter he is comparable to his real father Martin Sheen. It's a journey where they play each other while feeling like they're constantly trying to make a difference. It is as if the presence of the other inspired the couple to do their best, and their accomplishments triumph. <br /> <br /> Recommended for anyone who appreciates solid acting, writing and directing. And to every Vietnam war fan. <br /> <br /> **** / ***** (8/10)
