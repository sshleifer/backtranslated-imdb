I think it's quite an achievement to be able to present a real dick to an audience over a frail man. a tail in which the protagonist will spend most of the movie on his back, in a bed and is completely unable to move. And yet, success in the film's effectiveness is a dramatic piece. as a reminder of a true story and I think as an argument why people should have the right to die if they so wish. But the film is not a political statement, and maybe it's too shy to debate, even though it's an argument anyway. What's more, this is one of those foreign-language films that presents its main character as a cripple, who can do nothing but talk to the people around him and still be able to seem captivating and convincing at first sight. <br /> <br /> So it's not a pure argument, but rather a sweet, but contemporary, dramatic piece about another person who wants something or is looking for something; The only difference is that achieving this "goal" would mean ending one's life, and it would be achieved by going nowhere. Javier Bardem plays the real Galician Ramón Sampedro, a person who, at a much earlier age, got into a water purification that was too shallow for such activities. This made him bedridden for the rest of his life and his desire to die is the focus of Chilean director Alejandro Amenábar. We've seen so many movies in our lives that characters have certain "goals" or goals to be met before the movie is over to provide a satisfying experience for the audience. The variety in The Sea Inside is gentle; It's not about young, energetic, attractive heroes going off to fight in distant places, but a real person for something that means so much to them. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a strong policy, pro or anti-euthanasia, you can hope Ramón gets what he wants in the end. The film sets its tone very early when Ramón gave a speech on why he wants to die of family members to immediately present the situation and show the audience who may not know what the movie is about. Interestingly enough, some of the family members are "anti", which he desires, which could follow in their own footsteps any audience that engages heavily with the topic. The purpose of this lineup, however, is to tell the audience, "No, this is not a man for something who, by the way, supports his whole family to the end." Quite simply, the film could have followed a path where the Sampedro family is against everyone else, but some are anti-Ramón's idea. Some are too young to realize what's really going on, and others are apparently too desperate to have any other opinion than to want Ramón to stay longer, they love him anyway. <br /> <br /> The Sea Darin is a sequel to a story about some kind of sacrifice. Ramón is a tetraplegic and from his perspective we see things. This is something that makes viewers incoherent or makes the movie look pretty weird when we see a movie from the perspective of a victim and not an instigator or a protagonist in a movie that always causes the cause and effect. However, this is not a criticism, and it is the Director's credit that he makes such an approach in the effective way he is. The film asks questions. It offers the audience a scenario. If you were in Ramón's position, what would you do, think about, or dream about or talk about? Dreams about the lawyer Juila (Rueda) are therefore not so much shot for the pleasure of the audience, but they are such a weak window in the fleeting fantasies of a man from his predicament. Julia's studies intensify A little later, when she begins to have some similarities with Ramón, she starts having strokes due to her own illness. This trait seems to be current in the evolution of their relationship and adds another link, in addition to an existing friendship. That's because Julia feels physical pain and limitations, not in the sense that she can not get up and walk, but I think she recognizes the value of life, considering how emotionally she felt before. While based on a true story and dealing with euthanasia, the film feels more like a down-to-earth drama about a man in a situation where he is ready to fight for what he wants, but he has to do it verbally , It's refreshing to see films like The Sea Inside, because they not only refer to the story and provide an insight into it, but as an independent film on an emotional and engaging level.
