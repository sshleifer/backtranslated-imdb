"Quai des Orfevres", directed by the brilliant Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a film that can be appreciated for being one of the best representatives of post-war French filmmaking. M. Clouzot, who adapted the novel by Steeman's "Longtime Defense," shows his genius in the way he connects the story and the way he connects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie, pointing out that DB Duumon in this forum has pointed out how influential Cluzot was and how much the next generation of French filmmakers is committed to the master, especially Claude Chabrol. <br /> <br /> The crisp black and white camera from Armand Thirard has been great on the Criterion DVD we recently saw. In collaboration with Clouzot, Thirard uses the dark tones and shadows in most key scenes. The music of Francis Lopez, a man who has created light music and operettas in France, works well in the context of the film as the action takes place in the world of music halls and nightclubs. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet, who is considered a police officer, is perfect in this part. This was one of his best performances for an actor who was a pillar of the French theater. Jouvet has well understood the mechanisms for creating his police inspector, who is smarter and can look deep into the soul of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from others. In an unfair comment by someone on this page, the Jouvet inspector is compared to Peter Falk's Columbo, the television detective. Honestly and without regard to Mr. Falk, it is like comparing a big champagne with a good house wine. Bernard Blier is perfect as a jealous husband. Blier had the face that could be associated with the man who had awakened the passion of his wife, Jenny Lamour. Martineau is vulnerable and does not act rationally. He is a mild suspect because he did everything wrong when he was in the midst of a crime he did not commit, but all the evidence points to the opposite. <br /> <br /> The other big character of the film is Dora, the photographer. It's clear how she interacts with Jenny where her real interest lies. Simone Renant is tragically appealing because this troubled woman makes a big contribution to the film. Suzy Delair, who plays Jenny, is appealing as a singer who suddenly jumps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts men like Brignon, the old Lecher. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best Clouzot directors outstanding career and one that will live forever because he has brought all the elements together.
