Black Day Blue Night was actually a good, modern noir. Three young nomads fleeing their own lives are making a kind of road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere (as most modern Noir do). A woman realizes that her husband is cheating on her, and after finding him in a hotel room, decides to get back on her way. Strangely, she travels with her husband's lover, who is forgivable because the sleazebag never told her he was married. And as they drive in the pouring rain, they meet a third, very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets. While they are dizzy and free and are suspicious of each other, the cops call them suspects in the death of a police officer. Black Day Blue Night begins with instant confrontation and throws up a pretty good story with all its twists that cause you to mislead one person after another, which leads to a very unusual ending. In other words, the movie begins with an immediate action confrontation, and if you feel that the story is resolved, you will instantly be thrust into another twist of the plot and show just a little more than you expected before the movie closed End is. <br /> <br /> But as some viewers have written, the end is a bit confusing and a bit disappointing. The killer is not the one you would expect immediately and, after being revealed, becomes somewhat confusing by a rather sparsely explained review that reveals all the necessary reasons to solve the puzzle. But in fact there is a finale beyond what I would consider the most interesting of the film. Since modern Noir always includes a circle of criminal suspects who are almost always guilty, it is also a genre that always has to do with money. And so the question in these films always becomes - how far are the characters willing to pay? <br /> <br /> If you like this rendition of modern movie Noir, I would suggest Red Rock West (it is too.) has JT Walsh and a few events in the devastated desert!)
