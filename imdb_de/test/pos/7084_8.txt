One True Thing proves that it's the characters that make a movie. Streep will surely receive an Oscar nomination for her role. One True Thing is a beautiful drama, a great example of filming in the late 1990s. There are still people who are interested in making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million-dollar special effects. It's not the best picture or anything ... do not be stupid. But the amount of emotion triggered by both the actors and the author hit me like a shockwave. I cried twice in this movie, which means a lot for a 24-year-old man.
