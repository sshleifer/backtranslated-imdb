Photographing and editing the film is extraordinary for the period. Eisenstein builds on every scene in the film that led to the uprising of the sailors and the massacre in the city. As much as film is a highlight in cinema, it is also an example of socialist realism. In 1925, the Soviet government actively used the arts, including film, as a means of spreading the message of the revolution. Eisenstein's presentation of the rebellion on the battleship Potempkin offers the viewer an insight into the message of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are portrayed as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society. Much of the film demonstrates the Communist Party and the use of film as a propaganda tool.
