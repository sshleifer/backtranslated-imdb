Apart from the disadvantages and shortcomings of the movie that other viewers have mentioned, I have to say that I felt like a movie about power, which in my opinion is one of the most enticing illusions. I saw the drama of an emperor and people. It seems to me that the director wanted to ask a question, what is the benefit of the nation and what is the price of "happiness" for all. Is there a justification for the forced benefits and the "happiness"? How much can be forfeited for the security and peaceful existence of the nation? Is the idea of ​​a powerful empire worth reducing misery and killing thousands of its citizens? It seems to me that the Emperor himself does not know the answer and wants to learn it during the entire filming period. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time mentally harassed by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to hate his subjects half-heartedly because he has to renounce his father and his love, half of the people who should be a good emperor. No wonder his actions are controversial and emotions are confused. It seems to me that film, as another film that poses the problem of man's power over other men, is a success.
