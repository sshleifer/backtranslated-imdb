I've always liked this movie and I'm glad it's finally available on DVD, so more viewers can see what I've told them all these years. The story is about a high school virgin named Gary (Lawrence Monoson) who works as a delivery boy at a pizzeria and is with his friends David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Antin) together. Gary notices Karen (Diane Franklin), who is the new girl in school, and one morning he drives her and at that point he is totally in love. That evening at a party, he sees Rick with Karen and now he's jealous of his best friend, but does not tell anyone of his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Rick asks Gary if he can borrow his grandmother's empty house, but Gary apologizes that Rick Karen can not get alone. But one night, Rick praises Gary for pinning her on the football field and Gary getting angry. A few days later at the school library, Gary sees Rick and Karen arguing and asks Karen what's going on. She tells him that she is pregnant and that Rick dumped her. Gary helps her by bringing her home to his grandmother and paying for her abortion. Finally, Gary tells Karen how he really feels about her and she seems to be open-minded, but later on at her birthday party, he meets Karen and Rick again. Gary goes off without a girl! This movie ends with a much more realistic version of life. No matter how nice you are, you do not necessarily understand the girl. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Boaz Davidson, who would later become a fairly competent action director film. First, he made sure there was a lot of unpleasant nudity, so that it is marketable to the young men who usually go to those movies. Second, he had finished the film with the young Gary without Karen, and I think the men in the audience can relate to messing up no matter how hard you try to win a girl's heart. Yes, this movie is stupid and exploitative, but funny and sexy. Actress Louisa Moritz almost steals the movie as a sexy Carmela. Moritz has always been a popular "B" actress, perhaps remembered in "One flew over the cuckoo's nest". Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" this has a very good soundtrack and the songs played reflect what's going on in the story. The focus of this film, however, are two very good performances by Monoson and Franklin. Franklin demands nudity, but she still conveys the grief of a young girl being dumped at a crucial moment. She has always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this movie. But this is still the story of Monoson and you can not help feeling for this guy. When the movie ends, its performance stays with you. It's a solid act of acting that makes it more than just a teen comedy. Despite the stupid scenarios in which teenagers want to have sex, this movie still does what it wants. An underrated comedy hits the bull's eye.
