I like money! I stumbled upon this brilliant movie last week in a local video store. I was not sure what to expect. Put home, set up the player and then began my journey into stupidity. At the first sight I laughed a lot, did not really laugh out loud. It was not until the second movie that the movie really started, got me started and the humor was so much funnier. It reminded me of Austin Powers, when I first saw that everything was alright, then the fun started telling people about just about every scene and setup. I let all my friends see this movie, everyone I know. This movie may be one of the most accurate "Future" movies ever made. This movie is more than just 84 minutes of entertainment. He is a warning for the future of our civilization. Mike Judge, the fantastic mind that brought us Office Space, has given us a vision of life in the automated future. Luke Wilson's deadpan humor as "Average" Joe has improved the movie even further. Watch this movie when you're done, READ MORE! Write more! Think more! For the future, if not for yourself!
