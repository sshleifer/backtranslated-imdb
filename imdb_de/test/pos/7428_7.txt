This was the third time I tried to watch this movie. The previous two times I found the beginning so disgustingly sweet and "schmaltzy" that I just stopped watching. Now that I'm a bit older and more obsessive, I've forced myself to watch the full movie, and I was very surprised to see that I actually enjoyed the movie pretty much. So I watch the movie exactly as I would swim in the sea when the water temperature is 70 degrees (that's about 21-22 degrees Celsius for all metric lovers out there). Sure, the water is terribly cold and shocking at first, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, you'll get used to it - so resist that urge to jump right now !! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a lengthy exchange between Flynn and his daughter, played by the lispy Patti Brady. Some find conversations very sweet and adorable, although others find that they are a bit hard to take, since those moments are so cute! In a way, it was an amazing acting by Flynn, because it's hard to imagine that in real life he has children or acts domestic, especially that he wanted to be faithful to a woman in this movie - well, THAT DO! Never say that Goodbye refers to the divorced couple Flynn and Parker, and their mutual desire to remarry. Since both love each other as much as their lispy kid, it seems like a foregone conclusion that they will reunite. However, there are some serious issues that stand in their way: Lucille Watson (who plays her usual cocky and controlling mother-in-law), Flynn's girlfriend (after all, he's Errol Flynn and he's divorced, so you must expect him to be a girl ( Somewhere) and a Marine (played by Forrest Tucker). <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, all of this is resolved to the end and everyone lives happily afterwards. Despite its formula and predictability, the movie is a winner because of it Despite his reputation as an action-adventure hero, Flynn is very good at comedy romance and fun to watch, and the movie has the eternal scene of chewing Cuddles Sakall - he's just so cute sweet and sweet that he's perfect in this kind of movie, and despite the sweetness, the film is pretty well written, the bottom line is that the movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Therefore recommendMe, that you are watching this movie and forcing yourself not to remember the disgusting sweet aspects of the movie. Once you're done with it, the rest of the movie is a picture worth your time.
