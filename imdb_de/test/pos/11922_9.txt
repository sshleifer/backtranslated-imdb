This is a nice thing to see, even if it is cheesy at times. It's great to see a young Sean Astin, and this is a pretty entertaining and humorous action movie. I've often seen it when I was young, and now I still enjoy it when I put the old vhs in the machine (I happen to have a copy). So sit back with this movie, let the reality run a bit, and you'll have some good laughs and a pleasant hour and a half hours.
