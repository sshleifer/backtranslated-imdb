The 13th and final RKO Falcon movie begins with the mutual consent of Tom Conway as Tom Lawrence alias the Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie of "No dames!" while they prepare for the holidays. While you're still wondering what they're going on vacation with since they did not have a job since the first movie in 1941 (with Sanders as Gay and Jenkins as Goldie), they come across a woman and are being dragged on promising to Help her when her uncle is murdered by taking an envelope with the details of a formula to make his business colleague in Miami replacement industry diamonds. Probably everyone here except the cops who are after Lawrence? and Goldie for the murder. To comfort herself, Goldie initials in brochures again and again: "On the coldest day you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice, cozy electric chair". Some beautiful, tired atmospheric night club scenes interact with particularly bad behavior of the bad guys. Favorite piece: the dignified game of hide-and-seek with the thimble that the unshakable and polite Lawrence has with the wicked in the train. The smallest favorite piece: the most embarrassing scene of the entire series in the Alligator Wrestling Hut? definitely thrown for the kids! All in all, not the best in the series, but another entertaining excursion with an overall satisfying storyline and many episodes that I wish they could go on for just a few years, as Columbia did with it Boston Blackie did, though RKO got them out faster. Absolutely no sex, not much violence (in fact, by no means high according to today's high standards), and definitely no message turns this type of movie into serious people who can only view films as an art form that must be based on these three pillars. <br /> <br /> Three diet hawks were later made in the title role with John Calvert. I do not mind, but I never got around to counting her into the main series that Tom Conway had made with it. It was also sad that everything went downhill after that for Conway, who played quite well in the TV Plaza Voice Voice in 1953 and even played Norman Conquest in the Park Plaza 605. He also had serious eye and alcohol problems. I do not know if they were connected? he was plagued by poverty and found dead in his girlfriend's bed after hospitalization in 1967. For us folklore, who want to have at least ten more entertaining falcons, as well as a number of other worthy, even classic RKO films from 1942 to 1946, with which we can remember him.
