This DVD set is the entire 15-sequential widescreen series of "Surface", a television program from Universal 2006. The total runtime is 10 hours and 34 minutes and some bonus features (deleted scenes, cast interviews, special effects)). This was a relatively high budget show and much of the budget comes in the form of quality design and special effects on the screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, more than 10 hours are a lot of time, and as is usual with this stuff, the overall quality decreases in later episodes. I found the first 7 episodes (Discs 1 and 2) extremely appealing and the rest a disappointment. "Surface" was produced, written and directed by Josh and Jonas Pate. and it seems that they were surprised by the success of the series and were unable to assemble sufficiently good follow-up material as they hurried the sequence for more episodes. It even appears that additional authors have been called in for the later episodes because the characters (who were already the weakest part of the series) have no match with the way they were played in the early episodes. The series has been canceled and although the last episode provides some kind of conclusion, many things still depend on it. <br /> <br /> It's basically a sci-fi story about genetically engineered dragons; a kind of TV mix of "Jurassic Park" and "ET". The story begins as a mystery, when a Navy submarine is found at sea, boaters are sucked into a hot tub on a Texan lake, a lighthouse in Africa is destroyed by a giant monster, etc., etc., and so on This vaguely there is a lot of tension and tension. A human element is being introduced in the form of three American families, one on each coast and one on the Gulf of Mexico. Laura Daughterty (Lake Bell) is a California marine biologist who discovers a strange creature rising from a subterranean thermal sink on the ocean floor. Rich Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson) dives with his younger brother in the Gulf as a similar creature carries his brother along (never to be seen again). <br /> <br /> Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a Wilmington teenager who finds some weird eggs in the ocean. He takes a home where he slips into an ET-type kite. He will spend the rest of the series hiding his strange pet from his family and local authorities. While looking like lizards, these dragons are more like indestructible electric eels that emit electromagnetic pulses, trigger lightning strikes, empty the sea of ​​fish, and reproduce like a bunch of horny rabbits when they find a submerged thermal boiling water valve. As long as it is uncertain whether they are intelligent, extraterrestrial or harmless or not, the premise is interesting. As soon as you suspect the origin, everything becomes very tired and predictable. <br /> <br /> Jay R. Ferguson (an amazingly bad actor in the tradition of David Hasselhoff) essentially plays the character of Richard Dreyfuss from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," so you know that with a better actor and a Better Director, it could have been an interesting character. With each episode you will hate this character more. Unfortunately, what starts out as three parallel storylines, will soon be condensed into two, as Ferguson and Bell (a low-budget version of Sandra Bullock) are soon crammed together and involved in a series of moronic adventures almost as unlikely as that Stuff "Jason Bourne" Imagines Itself You expect action holes and the need to lift the disbelief in this kind of show (this can even be part of the fun), but their adventures are not only completely implausible, they are absolutely and totally boring. There are three consecutive episodes in which Ferguson and Bell are seen together in a submersible that will yearn for a full-day actuarial conference. <br /> <br /> Jenkins (Miles) is the strongest member of the cast, and the segments with his favorite dragon (Nimrod) are often cut together with the boring Ferguson Bell stuff to help you watch. And these segments benefit from the presence of the gorgeous Leighton Meester (recently known as "Gossip Girl") as his sister Savannah. Apparently, the producers have recognized the importance of this audience for their "teenage target audience," and the positive thing they did with the series' later episodes was the introduction of Linsey Godrey (Caitlin) as a "First Love" interest in Miles , As Savannah's screen time decreases, Catlin is gradually being introduced. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, they needed a third plot to keep the audience busy enough, and it would have been better to limit the melodrama of the adult to a second group of young actors. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
