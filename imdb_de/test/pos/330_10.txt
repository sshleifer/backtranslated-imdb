To be honest, I do not speak Tamil and I did not understand the movie. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name) explained everything to me. What a great movie !!! After seeing this movie, I felt I should have seen many more movies from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry). The war scenes were amazing, the camera work excellent and the plot beautiful. The actress "Simran", what a beauty. Give her a prize for the best person. Ding, Ding, Ding, come on, I smell an OSCAR winner. I did not understand the songs, but they were excellent. Mani Ratnam is a great director, and I hope his next film was a success.
