Anyone familiar with horror movies knows that most are not scary at all. Some people enjoy gorefests with subordinate storylines and character development. Personally, I like horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts (eg A Tale of Two Sisters, Cairo, etc.). Whatever the kind of horror movie you personally like, there are only a few that really scare you. Noroi is one of them. <br /> <br /> This is a documentary film, which means that the entire movie is a compilation of video clips associated with the legend of a demonic entity called Kagutaba. The premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba, and then compiling material from other sources related to his research. The result is a relentlessly refreshing experience that feels very real and very disturbing, though the story itself is a fake. Some have compared Noroi with The Blair Witch Project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. An obvious difference between the films is that Noroi scares the viewer by linking events from different sources. For example, the journalist records the exterior of a house he is researching and sees something alien on the porch. Later in the movie, a clip from the home video of another character introduces the same strange event. The memory of the viewer connects the two incidents, and the goose bumps run down her back. Another example concerns a television program with a child addict who answers every single question except one. In fact, their answer is so wrong that the viewer might wonder what the filmmakers think. Later, however, it turns out that this wrong answer is related to a very disturbing event. This is indeed a smart movie. <br /> <br /> Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi does not provide just one, but two very long finals, the second of which is placed one minute after the start of the credits and is the biggest scary scene in the game History of horror cinema. I do not say such things lightly. It totally ruined me in a miraculous way. <br /> <br /> Other aspects of filmmaking are well done. The legend and the ritual background of Kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors have done a good job. The only outstanding achievement comes from a guy who should be crazy anyway, so that's to be expected. The cinematography is intentionally bleak, because the entire footage should be videos that were recorded on camcorders. Japanese movies are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were fantastic. In some cases they create a sense of the other world (eg static interference or the first finale), but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic (eg the second finale). <br /> <br /> When all is said and done, Noroi is the scariest movie I have ever seen. I would go so far as to say that there is no film that provides such terrible terror from start to finish as Noroi. See it now.
