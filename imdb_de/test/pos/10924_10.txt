First and foremost, I would say that before I saw this movie, I thought I was an accepting person. Someone who cared for others, valued others, found no or little judgment against other people, and this movie has (I believe) dramatically changed my life or my point of view. When I saw it, I did not know exactly what it was about, I knew it was a kind of forbidden relationship, but otherwise I was unaware and when I started to see what was wonderfully portrayed between these two characters, I was shocked, disbelieving, confused and surprised. The first time I saw it, I was blind. Blind for their love, for their intimacy, for their connection, for their purity as humans, for their relationship. I saw it a second time because I had finally figured out how hypocritical I was, and said to myself and others, "Oh, I accept all kinds of people and try not to judge them," while still seeing this wonderful and amazing judged revealing story. I suspect, out of fear. The second time I saw this movie, I opened my eyes, which had been closed the first time, and really did not look at the kind of taboo part that I had heard in my entire life but fell in love with two people. And I loved it, I loved the plot, I loved the slightly broken but strong individuals in the movie, I loved sharing emotions and I loved the strong bonds. It's a really eye-catching, beautiful movie that sometimes made me cry, and I hope the people who read this and see the movie someday, remember that everyone deserves love, in whatever form or in which one Form he is presented ....
