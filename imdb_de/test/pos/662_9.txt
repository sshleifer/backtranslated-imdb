OK, the following test is more a summary than really containing spoilers but safer than sorry to avoid being blacklisted, right? Law! Consider yourself officially warned and read on ... <br /> <br /> In this parody / tribute to the greatest time in the horror movie history of the 1980s, a group of stupid teenagers meet for a seance in the house of the notorious murderer McGee, who slaughtered his entire family a few years ago and buried them in the backyard. I'm sure you can assume that things get worse faster than you can say, "Where's the beef?" and in a typical 80s horror movie fashion, the deaths are bloody, the dialogue is cheesy, and beautiful women undress at every opportunity. Good Times ... <br /> <br /> No clique or stereotypical 80s horror movie characterizations are shown here. In fact, no stone was left on the other at all? We've got the cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, the goth chick, the hard thug (think, John Bender), the hot blonde who's constantly losing her shirt, the shy dork falling in love with the hot blonde who's constantly falling in love she loses her shirt, some gorgeous half-naked lesbians and two big freaks. <br /> <br /> As you can clearly see, the cast is pretty big. Usually with larger casts, things can fall apart quickly, with one or two sour apples annoying the whole barrel. Not in this case. Not a single cast member has disappointed me. The acting was very well done. Anyone from the cool hero in his thriller jacket, played by Jovan Meredith, to the great Goth chick from Renee Dorian to Geeks One & Two, played by Cory Assink & Jonathan Brett? They all played directly, brought their A-Game and knocked it out of the park. If you're a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science, you'll instantly fall in love with the geeks. <br /> <br /> The director / co-author Jeff C. Smith is a guy you need to look out for in the US Future, trust me in this regard. If he can do this on a low budget, he will only be well off if he gets more money for future projects. The characters were dead on; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughter was huge; the blood flowed and splashed and sprayed nicely? It was like a horror movie from the 80s. Call this "The Breakfast Club Meets Night of the Demons" !!! Tagline says it all and says it honestly - "EXCEPTIONAL VIOLENCE; GRATUITOUS NUDITY; ZERO BUDGET" - no false advertising here, people! As fans of this genre, we need to look at the indies and support those hardworking people who bring their humps out there on the street and bring us original stories, so we will not be stuck forever in a world where the PG213 studio is full 'Horror' or meaningless remakes like The Hitcher. No, thanks - no more for me. <br /> <br /> Finally I have to say that stupid teenagers die! is by far one of the best indie films I've seen this year. It's a damn good time and withstanding repeated considerations. From dialogue to characters to cloakroom ... even the final love theme over the credits (which, if that does not cause laughter, reminiscent of REO Speedwagon's mid-80s power ballads) - exaggerated R values ​​on each word Starting with the letter 'R' - then I'm going to eat my DVD now.) ... The bottom line is: If you're a fan of the 80s horror or the horror, there's no hesitation - this movie deserves to be in your movie to be collection !!
