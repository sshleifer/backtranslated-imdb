I own this video and the concert version of the musical with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is fantastic in my book, as is Angela Lansbury and composer Stephen Sondheim. This musical is operational and shows a lot of ingenuity in the composition. Of course I hope that this VHS is available on DVD !! Hearn's performance is incredibly sympathetic. The one annoying idea is the young woman singing the role of Joanna. I believe this performance was performed at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles rather than on a Broadway stage, and I'm not sure the minimalist set was used in New York, as in this production. But I found the scaffolding that was pulled across the stage very effective in "portraying" the streets of London. I highly recommend this movie.
