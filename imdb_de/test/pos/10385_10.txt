looks like the betting movie I've ever seen. not too much for the intelligent perception, but so rich for the perception sensitive. Antonioni is comparably wise to his film. Malkovich is so organic, roles are so true, situations are so real. I have changed my world view to this cinema. I'm a novice literary student in Russia - the land of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky - and I'm pretty sure seeing Antonioni is good and fun for Russian women because I and we understand his point of view. Therefore, I do not understand his lesser raid on IMDb. I'm sure when we talk about Russia and our people, we like Antonioni for his romantic soul and the positive feeling of the surrounding reality
