Have you ever wondered what it feels like to be FREE? I am sure that each one of us knows the meaning of freedom and never seriously considers using it to our advantage. HARI OM shows the audience what freedom really means. This film describes freedom in the form of style represented by Isa's discovery of India. Isa discovers her inner true love when she is on a rickshaw trip with Mr. HARI OM. She looks at life differently and portrays the freedom that restricts every woman in herself when she is in a relationship. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely "worth watching" and I saw this for the first time in the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF), and I left the movie theater with complete satisfaction. <br /> <br /> "Watch it"!
