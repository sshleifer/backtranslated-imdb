Let me first say that I am a big fan of the original Lonesome Dove series and the book from which it originated. I've postponed this successor's sequel for the best 10 years because of the bad reviews I've heard. If Tommy Lee Jones is not Capt. Call played, I did not see the meaning. If Larry McMurtry was not involved, why should I care? How wrong was me. <br /> <br /> This is in many ways a worthy sequel to Lonesome Dove, perhaps even more than the dark mood of Streets Of Laredo. The story, the acting, the production and the cinematography are all first class. Of course, the script is not as colorful as Lonesome Dove, but it does have its moments. And to my surprise there are a few pieces of Lonesome Done in this series. The relationship between July and Clara, which was completely rejected in the prequel, is here presented almost identically to the book, a most welcome surprise. The story is not all roses, she also has surprises. By far the biggest surprise is Jon Voight's interpretation of Capt. Call. Although not a direct copy from Tommy Lee Jones, his reputation is faithful and unique to Voight's credit. The cast is fantastic on all levels, and I do not think Rick Schroeder has made acting better than this series. Oliver Reed is practically stealing the show here, he's great in a role where you care as much about his character as you hate him, bad reviews, especially that the DVD is so cheap (I have the 2-disc set for $ 10.99, you can probably find it cheaper). It's not the disappointment that Dead Man's Walk (well, it was for me) proved. And MCMurtry was involved!
