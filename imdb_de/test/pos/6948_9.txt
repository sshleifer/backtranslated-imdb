This show came to Canada via PBS in the mid 90's and I really loved it. Even 10 years later, I look at the various news channels, but I can not help but think of the cynical manipulation that takes place in the name of the reviews and the various "show ponies" that we all see on TV, as well as in different ones Frontline episodes are shown. The scripts are rigorously written, and the actors all have flawless comic-timing, and none of it is burdened by an idiotic laugh-path. There is a lot of funny material that is really well executed and we do not need to know when to laugh and what to laugh about. I do not understand why this show never originated in North America as a true gem! I was really excited to see the available DVDs, even though they are in PAL format. I thought I would rip them on my computer and then watch the converted files. I dared and ordered it from ABC? 6 to 8 weeks later I had all three seasons. Even better it worked with my NTSC DVD player. I suspect that any player who has bought xvid / divx in the last 2 years will play it. Great stuff! 10 years later, the episodes are all really good! You do not need to know anything about Australian politics to maintain your sense of humor, as this is familiar to Western audiences. My wife and I had a 10-day frontline party and chuckles weeks later after seeing all 39 episodes
