I think this is a great movie when viewed as a whole for its ideas and analysis of the current two-party system and political process. Granted, the movie was not the expected comedy, but once I finished, this movie really made me think. So much of what we see and hear in every election is such a joke. In particular, there is a discussion scene in this film that, in my opinion, was a masterful critique of our political debates and the "discussion" of policies with them. I encourage anyone who thinks our process is alright to see this movie. However, if you want to laugh, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not their usual selves. In this movie they show us that the truth hurts, not that the truth is funny.
