This film is about a teenager struggling with his social status at school. He is a "good Christian" and feels that he misses the fun of high school. He wishes he had never become one. After achieving his desire and attempting a worldly lifestyle, he realizes that his quality of life has been dramatically reduced and he wants to be the person he was. A good family oriented movie with the positive message of being proud of who you are, even if you are not the most popular.
