I was first introduced to John Waters movies when I saw "Female trouble" at the IFC. I was disgusted, but for some ill reason, I enjoyed it. Then I bought the Pink Flamingos DVD in the John Waters Boxed Set. The film is about Babs Johnson's "The Filthiest Person Alive," who lives in Maryland with his obese egg-obsessed mother and disturbed son "Crackers." In the movie you'll see sick sights like sex with chickens, drag queens, people eating feces, torture and all other kinds of arbitrary humiliation. The film contains a soundtrack of rock and roll artists of the 60s. The only problem is that some parts of the movie seem bored and boring. I found "Female Trouble" a bit more fun. Rated with NC-17 for explicit sex, violence and disturbing pictures. Enjoy.
