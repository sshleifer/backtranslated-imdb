This seething drama, based on a real incident, concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to leave their families temporarily by stowing away on an outgoing ship. They believe that if they successfully complete the journey, they can improve their lives by making enough money in New York to send their families. Unfortunately, the ship you choose is a run-down Russian freighter that has already been fined in a former port because of the stowaways. The captain and the first officer are determined not to let this happen again because their jobs are on the line. The group of blacks begins their adventurous journey in the hold and is eventually discovered, escaped from hiding and murdered by the reckless buddy (an outstanding performer of Sean Pertwee) and persecuted mercilessly by the ship if they lose their lives when caught become. All in all, a thrilling film in which viewers bite their nails and grit their teeth, wondering how such dreadful events could take place in modern civilization.
