This movie is complex and interesting in many ways. It is an infinite wealth of emotions and taboos. Sex and love. Women's Emotional Abuse of Men, Physical Abuse of Women, Child Sexual Abuse, New Approach to Real Life Religion, and All Associated with Very Raw and Powerful Blues Music Sit through the first 20 minutes of finding the same and better of all the characters. And the end will be more pleasant than you can expect. The music is superb, the writing is powerful and the spectacle of all was brilliant. <br /> <br /> And the DVD has some great features, including Samuel Jackson's background, learning guitar and blues. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for kids and I even warn parents of teens.
