"Only the Valiant" is a good western. This Gregory Peck Cavalry against the Indians is a solemn suicide mission without humor. Experienced director Gordon Douglas, with an ideal cast of tough guys, has staged a ferocious, lingering outdoor epic under considerable pressure. Even Lon Chaney, Jr., excellently reports as a powerful Arab soldier. The alleged "Colorado Territory" scenarist Edmund H. North and the writer "A Place in the Sun" Harry Brown drew the screenplay of Western filmmaker Charles Marquis Warren's tense novel about a group of die-hard cavalrymen cut off from any escape route Must prevent murderous redskins launch a devastating attack against helpless white settlers. For the most part, North and Brown are following Warren's novel, and the last minute of revelation - if it seems our heroes can not survive any other onslaught of Native Americans - is a corker! This turn-of-the-century story develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action. Douglas and Company are convinced by studio sets and convince them during the night hours. The crisp black and white photography of "Going My Way" cameraman Lionel Linden gives this western a dark look that emphasizes its tension and atmosphere. Actor Michael Ansara, who later became the main villain in Guns of the Magnificent Seven, is extremely effective in a small role as hated Indian leader Tucsos. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" opens with vocal story by Army Scout Joe Harmony. I'm an army scout I've done my work for a long time, behind this pass is the entire 'Pache nation' (There is a graphic of the area with the Flinthead.) Mountains that interfere with They came out of the pass and killed everything in sight, then we built a fortress - Fort Invincible, which clogged the pass like a cork in a bottle, was alright for a while - but she "Paches is pretty smart. One day the bottle smashed the cork plum. "We see the burning remains of Fort Invincible with a dead man attached to a stockade and a lance sticking out of his belly." Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck of "12 O 'Clock High') and his men dig in on horseback and capture Tucsos (Michael Ansara), Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") wants to shoot him on the spot, Harmony points out that Tucsos is "the guy is who founded this whole business. "Captain Lance intervenes:" The army does not shoot any prisoners, Joe. "Predictably, Harmony is appalled by this prospect." He's no ordinary opponent. He is as close to a god as a guy can. If you shoot him now, things will calm down. If Tucsos does not shake her up, the rest of these Indians will be as fast as they can get you alive, you have every pach in the area behind him. We've had three years of it, you can stop it now. "Equally predictable, Captain Lance refuses to kill Tucsos, and Lance's decision to take the Indian backbone puts things into action." Colonel Drum (Herbert Heyes from "Union Station") surprised Lance when he told him says he should have shot Tucsos As it is, they have to take Tucsos to another post, everyone, from the soldiers to Joe Harmony, knows that the death of Tucsos after Fort Grant demands death Bergen and the fort are under power, and in the meantime, we will be joined by the daughter of Captain Eversham, Cathy Eversham (Barbara Payton of "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye") and young Lieutenant William Holloway (Gig Young of "They Shoot Horses, Do You?" Lance and Holloway want to marry Cathy, Cathy clearly wants Lance, Colonel Drum refuses to let Lance take Tucsos to Fort Grant, as Drum Lance does not spare Drum changes orders and Holloway receives the mission at the last minute and everyone is shocked. Lance never changed an order. Lance also saw Cathy and Holloway kissing in public, and everyone thinks Lance has re-assigned Holloway out of jealousy. In fact, one official states that rewriting commands is a possible transcription of the Bible. Tucsos flees ahead, and the surviving soldiers and Harmony bring back a dead Holloway. <br /> <br /> Although Drum expects a relief column of 400 soldiers every day, Harmony Lance points out that Tucsos will attack. Tucsos has seen the fortress and knows its lack of strength. Lance asks for 6 or 7 men of his choice to occupy Fort Invincible and prevent Tucsos from assembling a war party. The bottleneck in the mountains prevents the Indians from riding into power; Instead, they have to come through individually. Lance believes that his men can thwart them until the relief column arrives. Drum gives him permission and Lance selects the worst men. Everyone hates him and would kill him voluntarily. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" is an example of the new generation of the Western military after the Second World War. This is not a gung-ho John Ford Cavalry. In fact, Lance's own men want to kill him, and this indicates the attitude of the troops during the Vietnam War as they break their own officers. Lance bears the burden of all but the few who know the circumstances that led to the change of orders, which is why Holloway is responsible for the detail. The black and white photography underlines the terrible nature of this western. "Only the Valiant" amounts to a last western stand until the last minute. According to reports, Peck hated this movie, but in Technicolor this is not an outspoken Western. If anything, "Only the Valiant" lives up to its origins with Warner Brothers. It's small but significant and it's grubby with a lot of drama and unappetizing characters, practically a "dirty dozen" western.
