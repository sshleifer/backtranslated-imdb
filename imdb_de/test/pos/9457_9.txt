I'm a fan of Amanda since All That and she's still funny. It's that easy for me. If you like the Bynes, you will like this movie. It is harmless and in some places pretty funny. Vis crazy Sebastian accent and behaviors are totally unrealistic, but I had to laugh so hard in some places that I almost swallowed my popcorn. <br /> <br /> And everything that makes teens to read Shakespeare (maybe) is a good thing for me. <br /> <br /> In short, Tatum Channing is pretty scared hot. He also does a good job with some of the film's harder scenes. <br /> <br /> Some of the minor characters are very wide, but in "Twelfth Night" they are wide, so it's cool.
