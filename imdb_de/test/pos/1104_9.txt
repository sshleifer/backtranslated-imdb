I saw this on Friday at the BendFilm Festival, in the midst of an unsettled crowd that did not help with a bad decision by event planners who chose a totally inappropriate short film for the film. And it really impressed the audience when Modern Love came up with a light, quirky short film (name I forgot). <br /> <br /> people !!! It was really stupid to mix this short with Modern Love - a serious drama movie. A film. <br /> <br /> So the audience gets the teaser, which is a comedy and then ... modern love. Hmmmm. Despite my reservations (strange ending, a bit too tangential), Modern Love needed a short film that suited his odd strangeness, so I recommend to programmers for the next year to plan the show with more care. <br /> <The people who watched Modern Love really did not know what hit them - they were on their way and that's not their fault. <br /> <br /> Modern Love has some great performances that work well against the film's tangential entanglements - a movie that its maker seems to have "asked aloud" rather than being executed in the normal way a movie is shot and shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad the audience was misinformed. Wrong session placement, wrong short film, wrong approach of the well-intentioned programmers, who despite good efforts see many more films and have to travel to other festivals.
