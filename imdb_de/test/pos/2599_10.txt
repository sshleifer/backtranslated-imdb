Daffy Duck has signs hanging on every inch of every available tree, announcing the rabbit time. But you guessed it - it's really Duck Season. Elmer Fudd appears: He is the only hunter who is dumb enough to fall into the gag. <br /> <br /> He's even stupider than that. When Bugs Bunny walks up to him and asks how the rabbit hunt is going, Elmer admits he has not seen a rabbit yet. That's more than Daffy can. He comes out of his hiding place and immediately points to a hare: Bugs Bunny. "Shoot him now!" Daffy screams. "Be quiet," says Bugs. "He does not have to shoot you now." Daffy insists he does that. After Daffy has brought his damn beak upside down again, he is sentenced to further arguments that are infected with "pronoun problems", all of which have the same result. Later, Bugs disguises herself as a sexy woman and begs Elmer flirting for a duck meal. Will Daffy get the last laugh? "Ha, ha, very funny! Ha, ha, ha!" What's funny about this classic cartoon? Bug snaps back in fear as Daffy cries into his face. Bugs Bunny says "Yes?" while dripping with complacency. Daffy Duck stands on tiptoe and demands to be shot. Elmer Fudd whines that he "can not wait for a wonger". Daffy sees bugs in women's clothes and makes that little sound with his tongue. Carl Stalling plays during Bugs' Drag Act "You must have been a beautiful baby Daffy calls" pure honesty "of bugs Stalling plays" Home Sweet Home "at an inappropriate moment Daffy tells bugs that he is" disgusting " . <br /> <br /> In five words: every detail of this movie. <br /> <br /> NOTE: This short version is available on "Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume One."
