Meryl Streep is possibly the best actor working today. Their chameleonic representations are always amazing. She actually seems to be the characters she brings to the screen. In "One True Thing," she gives life to a deceptively straightforward, profoundly complex woman who does her best to play the hand life she has studied. Surviving with cancer is not an easy task, and it's even harder to live not just to survive but to live - and that's exactly what Kate Gulden (Streep) wants to do. Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire") not only asserts herself in this upscale company, but also shines as the daughter of Streep, who is learning to see her parents' lives and her own in a new light. Streep is a powerhouse and rightly received an Oscar nomination for her work here; Your dialogue "I'll say that only once" with Zellweger will leave you devastated. However, Zellweger is the true revelation - her face communicates every emotion, every conflict, as she begins to experience the many truths about her parents' strengths and weaknesses. Director Carl Franklin ("The Devil in a Blue Dress") treats the extremely difficult story material with certainty and delicacy.
