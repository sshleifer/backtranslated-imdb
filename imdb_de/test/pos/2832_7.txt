On the whole, you wish it was a better movie, but it has enough flashes of power to make it worthwhile. Peck shot this film at the same time he was making The Gunfighter before apparently deciding that he was a monument rather than an actor. A shame! He was a good actor who was willing to fight characters who were not very likable and make them extremely good. The character he plays here is driven and, if necessary, ruthless. Given the mission to which the character has been assigned, and the "men" with whom she is supposed to do it, these qualities are essential Dirty Dozen genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is a bit shameless, but atmospheric and intense, and definitely tells a story worth telling. It contains good work from all character actors, and even Barbara Payton makes a credible performance. <br /> <br /> This is not often shown on TV, so the local video store may be the only place where a copy is found. Go straight ahead! Dedicate an evening with it. It is worth your time!
