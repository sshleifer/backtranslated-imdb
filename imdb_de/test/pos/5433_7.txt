I thought this would be a great comedy and a comeback for Robin Williams, but when I saw it, I realized that I had been lied to by advertisers, as this is more drama than comedy, though it's a couple of really good ones Laughter has it. It felt like I saw two films. One was a funny trumpet with Robin Williams, who was supposed to be the whole cymbal for the movie, but you also get a techno-thriller movie with political fears in the middle. I really do not know how to classify this movie. But I can tell you that it was good and I laughed, not as much as I had hoped, but at least Williams is back in the right direction. See this but you know, before you get started, it's not just a comedy and it's a little intense.
