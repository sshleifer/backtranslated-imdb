This is a romantic, if cheesy, movie that's one of my favorites. It is one of the many classics of the 80s, like "Pretty in Pink" or "Some Wonderful". <br /> <br /> Nic plays the traditional punk guy who falls in love with the traditional valley, the neat girl Julie. It's a heartwarming love story that makes you win the girl in the end. <br /> <br /> It's true, most of the actors are shit but ... <br /> <br /> I've been I'm in love with Nic since he saw this in theaters and I almost did seen every movie he has been in since. He's really grown as an actor, but in his early movie, it's obvious he had a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> If you love movies from the 80s, you'll love this classic. <br /> <br /> Go rent it !!!!!
