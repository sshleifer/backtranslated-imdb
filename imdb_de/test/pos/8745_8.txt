I've read countless reviews about the superiority of the mini-series. I certainly can not agree with such a blanket statement. When analyzing all aspects of video / film production, there are countless areas where the movie may be far superior. <br /> <br /> Many of the comments certainly apply to certain areas of the mini series. Especially in terms of more threads (customs officials) and more developed threads (such as the Pakistani farmer and his family). Nevertheless, I found Catherine Zeta-Jones' character far more convincing than the desperate women, from poverty to wealth, who "do not go back." This is a much more sympathetic character than this cold woman, who did not seem to have much cause for her quick turn to evil. (And yes, I understand ... her children, she was desperate, I just did not consider her desperate.) <br /> <br /> I also appreciated some of the more detailed storylines In the miniseries, Benicio del Toro very convincing. An anchor for the movie. This thread has been changed in a good way (as an alternative to the Pakistani family). A fantastic adaptation. (Of course, I'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist in such a system, but I do not know enough about the nation's politics to argue.) After the first episode of Bei's mini-series I have actually watched the movie again. Why? I continued reading about the fantastic drama. I found the performances in the first episode of the miniseries borderline ridiculous. This has certainly improved in the course of the miniseries. Having just completed both versions in a few days, I can not agree that the performances in the miniseries reached the same level as Benicio del Toro, who was brilliant in the film. and Lindsay Duncan were very good. I also have the feeling that the police in the film far exceeded the mini-series. I was not impressed by the Germans. <br /> <br /> Finally, the dialogue shown in the film is much more nuanced. Especially in the scenes that are almost literal. "Careful, you sound like your husband." unlike "HAHAHAHA, you sound like Karl." I found that some of the actors in the miniseries were very convincing. This was a prime example. <br /> <br /> Other superior aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, editing. <br /> <br /> Should I complain that the movie was not longer? No, I think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format. The changes made stood alone. I mean, would you sit in a theater for 5/7/10 hours? Of course not. <br /> <br /> Mini Series: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Movie: 9 out of 10
