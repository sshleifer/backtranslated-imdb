First of all, I can remember that this story in elementary school was told vaguely about 6 or 7 years ago. So I'm kind of familiar with the story. <br /> <br /> Much has changed, however, and there are many differences and mistakes (sometimes unnecessary) in the film that hard fans do not appreciate. <br /> <br /> However, I really like this movie as a whole. I saw it near Christmas for the first time about two years ago (well, the first part), then I probably got it all back on the same channel last Christmas. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed, sometimes it's a bit exaggerated and long, but with a gripping story, decent acting (especially by frosty Fonda and Hobbs) and beautiful scenery, costumes and little magical accents make this one Film to a very special movie - which really reminds me of Christmas. <br /> <br /> Despite the differences to the book, I find that the film is well suited to introduce new themes and ideas (the seasons with fall, winter, etc., I think, a new thief character to to represent the fall) in the whole picture language, as soon as one notices that it quite right is amazingly and brilliantly executed. <br /> <br /> I live in the UK, so I waited a long time for the DVD, and luckily I saw an ad that contained a series of free DVDs in the Daily Mail newspaper that I offered. So I have the issue of yesterday and finally my DVD. If you missed this rare DVD for Region 2, you should collect the tokens from Daily Mail and send them as your DVD will be delivered for Christmas. <br /> <br /> So, for a bit of escape Get into the Christmas season of this year, set yourself on fire, make yourself comfortable and watch as you and your children are likely to really enjoy this great movie become. If you do not have it, it's probably going to be repeated on Channel 4 for Christmas, so record it!
