I bought this movie from my local blockbuster for 99p and the movie has been on my bookshelf for at least a year. Tonight I decided to see it. The film was quite different from what I expected, and I found no humor in it. All I saw was a bleak look at people involved in love relationships and sexual orientation. The Psycho-Killer conspiracy really does not make sense except to add to the movie's end. I felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job. I followed her feelings and what happened around her. Some people would probably have seen some of the stuff that makes them funny, but I could really take their place and love someone, but they'll reject you at every opportunity, no matter how hard you try. I found it a very moving movie and I got along well with the different sexualities. I had expected something like Bound & Gagged: a love story, but that's a different movie. Not for bigots.
