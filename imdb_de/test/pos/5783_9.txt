The end of Suburbia, as it should be of equal interest to both citizens and bulk consumers, is likely to become a cultural reform status. The film uses a super-cynical analysis of the paradises created by Suburban-style life, mostly post-war, by authors, policymakers and social philosophers. What we have created in America is a place with "none of the amenities of country living and none of the amenities of urban city life." This is the recipe designed for the suburbs, and the film focuses on the unique idea of ​​"oil". In general, in the most general sense, that the world is approaching or reaching the peak of oil production, and if we fully realize this, substantial lifestyle changes will take effect, be it through our best interest or forcibly forced by a quality of ourselves The slum dwellers of Calcutta could not describe us. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the end of Suburbia will tuck the viewer in the stomach and create a disgusting sensation. That must happen. It is a bleak attitude to our inherent way of life. The ambivalence lies especially in the respective critical view of the film. I foresee many unprepared viewers who slander the film as complacent liberal propaganda - like a film by Michale Moore. What they are not considering is that such a response is all too normal if such a message hits the lifestyle of the vast majority of the masses so incredibly hard. <br /> <br /> This is the truth and as a student studying urban planning, I can tell you that we need to prepare better now because of the small chance of maintaining quality of life in this dwindling pool of adulterated resources, disappears faster than a race plagued by black plague.
