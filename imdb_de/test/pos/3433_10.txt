First, I hardly see Swedish films, and this is actually the second time in my life that I see a Swedish movie in the cinema. That's why I think it's one of the best Swedish films ever! The combination of thrill and humor is AMAZING, and sometimes you do not even know if you should be scared or laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after the Second World War and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany he tries to help his friends on the train, which is not a good idea. What a clumsy jerk! And poor Robert Gustafsson - the wounded soldier - always gets in the way ... OUCH !!! But he still had his good mood. A positive type. Robert Gustafsson has made a few less great films in recent years, and that's really a relief. He is great in this movie. After all - this is one of the best Swedish films of all time, and Peter Dalle has done an outstanding job! Congratulations!
