Excellent and greatly undervalued from start to finish. One of Oliver's best. Well written, directed, shot, drama and Stuart's Copelands soundtrack (Trivia: The music during the credits sounds vaguely like a pop hit from the "Spacehog" band of the late 90s). Eric and Cast are brilliant, let alone the callers. What a whirlwind of emotions. It leaves your hair standing. (... "Neck are broken and whips are cracked") - with an old feminine southern accent .. Yike! creepy. More scary than any horror movie. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 points <br /> <br /> Em
