A few things that you should address to respond to the previous person's comment. You just have to pay attention to what's going on in the movie. <br /> <br /> (I suppose they are spoilers) <br /> <br /> The red stuff under David's mouth? Poison Ivy, the woman says she should not scratch, or "it will spread". David becomes "insane" because the stranger tells him to leave the house, which David's theory probably proves an affair between wife and stranger; he runs after the man. <br /> <br /> David does not lose him in the woods, he just hits the stranger a few times, leaving his wife to pick up the pieces. <br /> <br /> Only the woman eats the mushroom. <br /> <br /> I have to say, after this one point with the woman and the stranger I was disappointed. But the end made up for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And for this and the last scene ... this is one of my favorite movies I've ever seen. I should have put it together earlier, but I let myself be distracted. I was really surprised, frankly. <br /> <br /> This movie is, to say the least, interesting. But if you do not take that for the performances the actors give, I would say you better let them go, because that's all that holds this particular movie together.
