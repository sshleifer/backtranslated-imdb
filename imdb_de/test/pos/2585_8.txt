Me and my roommate got free tickets for a pre-screening. I suppose you would call it in Atlanta, GA at the Atlantic Station. As I entered, I expected something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily exaggerated, etc. But the movie is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not over the top, and the film is in a careful balance so you do not flinch or say it's unnecessary. <br /> <br /> It's really well put together and does not take itself too seriously. That's the beauty of it. If it has tried to take itself seriously, it would have failed miserably, instead it is sustained by humor (some unintentionally) and surprisingly good acting by Ricci. Although Timberlake fails miserably in his role, the film is good enough to put that aside. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie, if not for a different reason than the fact that it is something else to experience
