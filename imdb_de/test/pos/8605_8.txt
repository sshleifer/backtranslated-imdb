After the atomic bomb hits Hiroshima, charred bodies lie around, deformed victims try to communicate with relatives they can not even recognize, and one after another dies of radiation sickness. This black and white movie, so sad and scary, is not without humor. The story revolves around a young woman Yasuko, who was struck by black rain after the explosion. She's trying to get married, but everyone keeps dying and people are worried that the same thing will happen to her. After finding a suitable partner (who loses her mind after a long war), she shows signs of radiation sickness. This movie is a great illustration of nuclear attacks on Japan. He will scare you and make you cry. The drama is good and not too dramatic like many other Ww2 movies.
