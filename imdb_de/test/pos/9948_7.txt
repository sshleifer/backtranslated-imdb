If you love Japanese monster movies, you'll love this action-packed battle in which an alien invader wants to conquer Earth, and a "giant robot" with a weapon of super-weapons. The alien "Emporer Guillotine" from the planet Gargoyle has an army of thugs, which of course is called "Gargoyle Gang", as well as an endless supply of huge, hostile creatures routinely thrown on the earth to destroy buildings making loud noises , make the population panic, etc. A small kid named Johnny Sokko has the giant robot at his wakeup call and sends the robot as needed to beat up and then destroy these creatures. Johnny joins a group of "good spies" called Unicorn and strives to save the world. Despite the Campy nature, there is an unintentionally humorous dialogue and the fact that the target audience was obviously children. This film offers uninterrupted action, colorful characters, decent special effects and is just fun. Battle scenes are performed well and frequently, as the plot requires. The good guys and bad guys both made sure they had inexhaustible amounts of bombs, lasers, ammunition, and schemes to attack each other. Despite the fact that the film was constructed from cut episodes of a television series, the plot actually develops and comes to a final result. <br /> <br /> The film has a positive outlook and appeals to all (especially children). ) Desire to destroy evil in its many forms. Kids are the target audience, but it's fun to laugh at his funny stupidity. but at the same time to the root for the good, to prevail and "to save the world". Acting is cheesy in some places, but that's the thrill: there are several annoying dialogues (possibly translation errors or intended jokes by the filmmakers), and you'll quote these absurd lines later. <br /> <br /> Granted, this movie is not in production quality or budget. But what it is, campy sci-fi, is enjoyable for some laughs. I recommend it to anyone who has sense of humor.
