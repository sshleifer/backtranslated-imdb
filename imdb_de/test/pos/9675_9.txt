> This show has been the biggest thing America has to offer since The> Simpsons. Not only does it have thousands of new ideas, it is actually controversial (see the Jewish joke, Season 1, Episode 1) and is not afraid to tick people. However, the big heads of Fox have canceled it together with Greg the Bunny and Futurama. So be sure to buy the first season set while you still can. It's the best money you've ever spent. It's definitely a show that gets better the more you watch the show, as the constant flashbacks get a bit annoying at first and do not always fit in the story properly. After a few episodes, however, it becomes clear how brilliant it is and how good it is compared to other programs currently broadcasting on television.
