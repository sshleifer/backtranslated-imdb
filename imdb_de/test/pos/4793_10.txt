The topic of religion in Buñuel films is a point that you hardly have to analyze as a film eater, as an art eater, or as a human being. A satirical Buñuel can be seen in "La Voie Lactée", "Un Chien Andalou" or in "L'Age d'Or". It's very harsh and effective in the criticism, but if you've seen this and then see a movie like "Nazarin," you'll be asked for the author after recognizing this work. And many have asked for a contradiction that seems to be a contradiction for Buñuel, but better not to be called that way, I think that there is no contradiction in his work, only that the point of view of Buñuel religion in movies varies greatly is. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film is based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdós, who told us the story of Father Nazario, who lived a modest, simple life dedicated to God and helps everyone. He lived in a simple and poor region. There lived also Beatriz, a battered and abandoned woman. She finds no purpose for her life without her violent macho husband. She has a kind of aversion to him. On the other side is Andara, one of the city's prostitutes. Father Nazario was stolen again, he blames Andara cousin. Andara hears this and tries to fight unsuccessfully with the priest, who does not believe in violence. That night Andara realizes that her cousin is actually a thief. She stole her hotel pages. Andara fights with her cousin with dire consequences. Andara seeks the grace of the priest. Nazario decides to help her, knowing that this might be against his church. Obviously, this thing will have consequences. Nazario has become a pilgrim here. Without nothing, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz want to be with him and be like him to serve God. If it's the sweetest Buñuel movie I've ever seen, it's also the most spiritual. Here it is clear that most people confuse the contradiction: we do not see a Buñuel against the power of the Church, we see a Buñuel, whose film is about church, but not in the typical - and great - satirical way. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the right word is a contradiction. I find it actually pleasant and well done and despite such religious themes (as "Voie Lactée") I found it more of a spiritual film than trying not to touch the Catholic religion as he may touch it, and laugh in it other films about it. "Nazarin" is from Father Nazario and his perspective Front God and the same religion, but all this is in the end, analyzed in the spiritual life of this man. <br /> <br /> The other two women are not in contrast, but also very well two other perspectives of faith. First we have Beatriz, the abused woman who loses all faith in life, first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family. This little girl was very ill. Next to her was Andara, the prostitute who was in charge of the judiciary. There is great pain in the child's family, only religious women, but the belief in Father Nazario will increase if he comes to this city without anything. He blesses the child, a word later she is fine. The priest wants to go on, but Beatriz and Andara have regained their faith in life and want to devote their lives to God with Father Nazario. After some complaints Father Nazario decides to be with them and discovers with some things to the end how he feels about faith, God, religion and the person in distress, the people who have to seek charity, to survive. This last issue must be referred to as a possible explanation for the pineapple finish. This end we hear the drums (similar to "L'Age d'Or") and a father Nazario, who asks for these things when he refuses the fruit for the first time and finally decides to keep it as "A" A symbol of necessity, or perhaps an answer to his spiritual path that begins to be a priest. Meanwhile, the two women have to take Andara away for their crime (Beautiful scene in which she thanks a man who helps father Nazario in jail and then (damn the man who met the priest in jail) and Beatrice because she prefers to go with her Macho Man is together even though he treats her badly just because she does not accept that she falls in love with the priest.Pater Nazario - and Here is perhaps the unique place in the film to criticize critics to contradict the Church, the Religion that he serves. <br /> <br /> Father Nazario is that, then he is a (soft for a lot, but not for me) criticism for something in religion (Father Nazario is helping women, those of a crime or one It is, above all, one of Buñuel's analysis of faith and life, and he has really gotten it, with a beautiful, tender, sweet and memorable film that is undoubtedly one of his best. <br /> < br / > * Sorry for the mistakes ... if there are any.
