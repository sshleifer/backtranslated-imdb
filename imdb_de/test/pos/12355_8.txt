Sheba Baby is another movie by Pam Grier Blaxploitation. It was one of Pam's less visceral films of this genre. Pam plays Sheba Shane, a Chicago gumshoe. Sheba's father owns a small loan company in Missouri. When the local gangsters try to lead their business father, Sheba looks for the bad guys. Pam Grier had already made a name for himself in Blaxploitation films when Sheba Baby was there. Fans of Coffy and Foxy Brown know that Pam is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress. In Sheba Baby, the fiery performance that Pam audiences expected was not so obvious in this film. Not that Pam does not step into Sheba Baby. She's just not a runaway vigilante like she did in her previous Blaxploitation movies. So Sheba Baby is Pam's movie, through and through. And although Pam is a little more reserved than in her other films, she still gives a convincing performance in Sheba Baby. This movie is definitely worth your time if you're a passionate Pam Grier fanatic.
