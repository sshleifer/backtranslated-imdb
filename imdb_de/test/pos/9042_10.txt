This is easily the best cinematic version of William Faulkner's fiction I've ever seen, and I've seen some of the most prominent. Filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, it really catches the feeling of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County. Intruder in the Dust is not one of Faulkner's best novels, but even if it's a cliché to say so, it would be the crown jewel of another career. It's about Harper Lee's good but simple attempt to kill a mockingbird fifty yards down the ground (I read that in ninth grade, and that's exactly what it's all about). Two of Faulkner's most prominent characters star in the film, Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp. Stevens is probably the most common character in Faulkner's fiction. He is a lawyer and easily works as a narrator because Stevens, unlike many of his other characters, is a man of logic rather than emotion (at least when he's older). Lucas Beauchamp is possibly the most prominent of all black characters of Faulkner (playing a starring role in one of Faulkner's outstanding works: Go Down, Moses). Unlike all other black people in Yoknapatawpha, he refuses to settle in front of any white man. He is proud and many in the white population find this to be a vile black character. One day Lucas stands in front of a dead white man with a recently fired pistol. Most of Jefferson and surrounding areas see no need for legal action, and everyone is pretty sure that Beauchamp will be lynched before the evening, or at least the next day, since the murder and arrest took place on a Sunday. Beauchamp, on the other hand, explains his innocence and tries to get Stevens to help him. Stevens refuses; The case seems to be open and closed. But his young nephew, Chick Mallison, is ready to help him now that Lucas has helped him in the past. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, no Hollywood movie of this time deals so openly with racism. Hollywood movies seldom pursue the black population, preferring to banish them in servant roles. If you're an African-American actor, you might as well give up and accept that role either as a mammy, as a maid, as a servant, or as a porter, because that's the only way you can work. In Intruder in the Dust, there is one of the most memorable roles a black actor ever had, Lucas Beauchamp. And Beauchamp, as I described above, was not stereotypical in character and hard to accept for the audience. Even today, black characters are usually simple, magical and friendly. The latest arthouse hit Far from Heaven is a great example of this. Beauchamp is a kind of jerk and he is very stubborn. Although he may be a bit less here than in the novel, he is not a cliché. He is a complex person. Juano Hernandez plays Beauchamp extremely well. I have not seen the movie for a long time, but it also appears in Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly (1955) and in the film adaptation of Faulkner's latest novel, The Reivers. All actors are great in the movie. I should also quickly praise Claude Jarman Jr., who has the great role of Chick Mallison. The novel plays from his point of view, and he is the conventional hero of the picture. Jarman is quite an actor. he perfectly captures the character (who also appears elsewhere in Faulkner's fiction, telling, for example, events that happened a decade or more before his birth in the 1957 novel The Town). He would perform in another major role in the underrated John Ford movie Rio Grande next year. The only other film by Clarence Brown that I've seen is National Velvet, a very different picture than Intruder in the Dust. His job here is extraordinary. I really have to tell him that he captured Faulkner perfectly. Other well-known Faulkner arrangements are too melodramatic (The Long Hot Summer, shot in 1958, which I still like very much) or too cold (Tomorrow, shot in 1972, which I do not like, this cold is a complete misunderstanding by Faulkner). The only other one that does well on the source material is Douglas Sirk's great 1955 adaptation of Pylon (a very different kind of Faulkner novel), Tarnished Angels. 10/10.
