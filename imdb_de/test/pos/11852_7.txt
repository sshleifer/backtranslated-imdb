[WARNING: INCLUDES SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> Written by husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky (who also directed) and Maya Forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies lately. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasel to be the nice guy who faces the fact that his fiance wants to put other people to bed, and so he can. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good at "Tully," plays spunky and vulnerable with great zeal. Too bad that she does not get the recognition she deserves. <br /> <br /> Good fringe benefits also help immensely. Lauren Graham, who made "Bad Santa" memorable last year, plays the jaded, cynical sister to perfection, Bryan Cranston (the father on television "Malcolm in the Middle") gets some fun, raunchy moments and Andy Richter plays a genius The guy who falls in love with a single mother - Helen Slater in a credible, if familiar, role as a maniac. <br /> <br /> What surprised me most about "Seeing Other People" was how funny it is. There are real laughs here. Ed's first attempt to have meaningless sex has some great lines, and there is a trio that creates one of the truest reactions of a man when the male fantasy is changed. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is not unusual, but I liked that Alice (Nicholson) thought of it, much to the chagrin of Ed (Mohr). Considering the genre, you know that no matter how good their intentions are, Alice's plan is doomed to failure. We see how the couple is going through this strange situation. At first Alice and Ed are taken with the idea, but the human element fixes it. <br /> <br /> I guessed that Forbes and Wolodarsky did not turn this into a cheap sex hype. Yes, there is sex and nudity, but there are real emotions here too. The "other people" with whom Alice and Ed are friends do not want to be the objects of occasional sex. They also have feelings. In one case too many feelings. Admittedly, some scenes make a joke too much, the Judge Slater subplot is not necessary and Alice does something really uncharacteristic. But that's forgivable because Mohr and Nicholson create so much intimacy and honesty. Look at the scenes in which Ed rummages in Alice's underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement to end the experiment - no matter how much we like her little game, we're rooting for this couple to succeed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has received little advertising and a limited release. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often affect the Inglorious, Turgide, and Non-Surprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and fun movie.
