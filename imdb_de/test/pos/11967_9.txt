"East Side Story" is a documentary of the musical comedy in Stalinist Russia and later in the Eastern European satellite comedies, with many clips from the films and comments of the survivors. Although some of the Stalinist films look laughingly bad (The Bright Road (?) Is a notable exception), the movies from the sixties actually look pretty good. "My wife wants to sing", "The White Mouse" and "Midnight Revue" are especially entertaining. Producers had to contend with the censors who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which in retrospect led to humorous confusion, as the people who sought to appease the censors were the people who supported the filming With! Since musical comedies behind the Iron Curtain were rather rare - in their forty years it was only about forty - they had a disproportionate impact on their audiences, making great hits out of a few films. <br /> <br /> I notice that the sound was much better for the 60s movies. The directors often had to deal with outdated equipment and strict power regulations - they had to shoot in seven minutes or less - and dangerous officers. <br /> <br /> I also notice that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong influence on "Hot Summer". The later films may not be comparable to "Singin 'in the Rain," but they certainly look like they're beating "Bye Bye Birdy" out of hell.
