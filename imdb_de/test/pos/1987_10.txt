The producers of this image are Hungary. It is not a crazy artistic impulse that X and Z are capitalized in the titles, considering that the word "isten" in Hungarian means "God". - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian ... - Hum ... Is that so? <br /> <br /> Let's look at this film as a scientific-fictional sibling "A History Of Violence". Both films together have the power to inflate the respective genres; Thriller and drama in 2005 and science fiction from the movie we're watching. Everything he does has meaning and is surrounded by details: The Nicke to Phil K. Dick (who wrote "In the Days of Perky Pat"), setting up a fast food restaurant "Perky Pat". The nod to Stanley Kubrick using the name pattern of 2001; In the 1968 movie, when IBM became HAL (a letter in the alphabet), WD-40 in eXistenZ's 'classic lubricant spray' becomes XE-60 (a letter) when Allegra cleans up the port of Pikul. The Nicke to David Cronenberg, using the witty formula of Videodrome ("Death to ..." & "Long Live" ..) and another medium used as a central theme of an image (TV in Videodrome, video games and virtual reality in eXistenZ In 1983 you penetrated a television set and you were infused with a game in 1999. Welcome to Canada!) <br /> <br /> The good taste is the music of Peter Suschitzky, the music of Howard Shore and Ronald Sanders Cut (a Team that wins). For those who were born in the early '80s with a Super Famicom, a Genesis or an arcade stick in their hands, this movie rings a bell. Enough with the nod. The plot ? "Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a major role as a game designer (Allegra), developing a virtual reality game that draws players in the head," as we can see on the movie's detail page. That's the story in the story. For me, this image is a young couple of "reality demonstrators" infiltrating the "brand new virtual game" presentation session to destroy its programmer. I assume that what we see in the last five minutes is a reality, if there is such a thing. Jennifer Jason Leigh always plays a game designer in the game they're in, and the end of the movie is reality, with videogame freaks giggling, big hairy dogs, 'Cronenbergy-realistic' plastic textures (helmets and stuff) and 9 mm pistols. What you see is true. They play transcendenz for about an hour (in this game there is a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays the genius programmer of eXistenZ and Jew Pikul - Law a marketing trainee in connection with Allegras game) The health of her pod (the what you put into your nervous system to play), she must join herself and Pikul, then she wins the game (Transcendence) and back in reality they kill Yevgeny Nourish, Transcendz programmer. <br /> <br /> When you play eXistenZ and TranscendenZ, you need to be confronted with your essence. Imagine your subconscious mind and a virtual reality that you have to overcome in an unexpected way to win the game (by playing the game, the girl who plays Allegra.) Reality Demonstrator 'becomes Allegra, a' virtuality goddess'). <br /> <br /> What game would Heidegger have played to feel his abstract Da-sein concept? To really be active in the world? <br /> <br /> And what about Nietschze (Yes, Friedrich, God is dead and you know what?) Willem Dafoe stands for him! - God, the Mekaniker -) ??? <br /> <br /> Yes, we construct a narrative for ourselves and lose that thread that we follow from day to day, dividing people as personalities. eXistenZ's discusses the fact that reality is the total perception of itself when it is really engaged. And we could sometimes get some nice things; a perception of virtuality in reality.
