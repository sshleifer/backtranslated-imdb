I recently stumbled upon this show when the ABC family had a full-day marathon before the season two premiere. I remember seeing a preview of the show in 2007 and thought it was short-lived and not very well written since it was ABC Family. This show surprised me the best. The show is not only well written, but also realistic, funny and entertaining. I was expecting a lot of conversations about relationships, something like "this guy went out with the girl who dumped me for this kid ... etc." But this show is anything but! The characters are appealing and you really feel a connection between them. There's a lot of chemistry between the actors, and they can really feel the stuff is happening right in front of your eyes. and addictive;)
