Quite simply, Goldeneye is the best N64 game yet. The learning curve is near perfect, and you'll be able to play it for months with your friends, because multiplayer mode is nothing out of the ordinary. <br /> <br /> The system for acquiring cheats requires some degree of skill, not only knowing which keys to press, and the Aztec challenge at the agent level is amazing. All in all, it's the best game I've ever played on the N64
