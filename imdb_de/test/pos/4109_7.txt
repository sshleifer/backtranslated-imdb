A huge cast gathered for this remake, which despite a great soundtrack was unfortunately a failure of the box office. I can not say that it was an exciting conversation or a remedy for insomnia. Nevertheless, I liked the movie - it offered me the escape after an afternoon. A good look for those who are looking for the ideal life, albeit a fantasy. Expect some crazy moments, a few thrills and an occasional laugh.
