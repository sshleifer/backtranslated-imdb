I'm definitely not a player, but a few people in my family and my friend are. Reluctantly, I decided to find out what the big deal with "fantasy stuff" was. I saw Dorkness Rising and thought it was HILARIOUS! It's slapstick, but not disrespectful for those who like role-playing games. And, most importantly, people who have never played before can enjoy it and do not feel excluded or playful in understanding the plot. The acting was great and the field shots / sets were believable. That's why I want to see other films from this production company. I can not wait to see what the future holds for this group! Three cheers - well done !!
