"All men are to blame," says the police chief. "You were born innocent, but it does not last." Add this piece of nihilism to the fascination of Jean-Pierre Melville for the idea of ​​the Code of Conduct of Rogues, and you have Le Cercle Rouge. However, this code of honor amongst crooks is not just a cliché; It is a fantasy of imagination, even if film moralists - in their view realistic moralists and by most other romantic moralists - began to make films on the subject. Their topic is that it is not what you do, but how you do it. Mostly, we find stories about experienced men with their own sense of honor, stories in which destiny, fatalism, and the code regulate things. <br /> <br /> For the majority of humanity, with the exception of screenwriters and film directors, this would seriously jeopardize living your own life, raising your children, and being a good friend. This fatalism is something of a selfish idea. Le Cercle Rouge is in my view a classic movie for people who can enjoy the adventure of missing the last bus home. But where, in my opinion, Melville's Le Samourai - Criterion Collection dominates history, Le Cercle Rouge creates the great trick of combining style with a strong history and captivating actors. The point of the movie is nonsense in my opinion ... but the movie itself is a first class experience. <br /> <br /> Melville's hopeless story of three crooks - Cory (Alain Delon), Bird (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - based on some wisdom that may be attributed to the Buddha: That all humans They are destined to meet ... together with their destiny they can not change. Perhaps because some believe that Melville himself had the formulation, if not the thought. However, we know right from the start that this film will not end happily, that it will depend on fate and chance to set things up for us, and we will remember the nihilistic philosophies we discover during our school days to have. Once Corey and Vogel meet and gather in the unique talents of Jansen, we set out to steal an exclusive, strictly protected jewelery story on Place Vendome. The tension arises because we not only know that the French police are after Vogel, but also that some determined crooks are after Corey. <br /> <br /> The great pleasure of the film for me was to admire the work Delon, Volonte and Montand brought with them, and the intelligent recklessness that Andre Bouvril brought to his character, police captain Mattei , Melville hooked me up as he developed these characters and their own situations. He emotionalized me and then dismissed me as he made me appreciate their probable fate and let me see how it happened. Melville fixes his set pieces - the escape from the train, the escape from the woods, the later shootings in the forest, the meetings with Mattei and a man who refuses to inform - with fascinating possibilities. He builds tension in all these cases by taking his time; a rare feature in filmmaking and now even rarer. And Melville takes time to build up Mattei as an individual. Mattei is a pathetic, experienced man. He is a loner. When he returns to his apartment, he has a solid routine - he lovingly welcomes his three cats, takes his bath, and while the tub fills, he feeds them. I do not know who to meet Mattei, but I hope it's someone who likes cats. Nihilism is always in fashion among some creatives and critics. In most cases, I find it much harder to set aside nihilism and simply live your life without harming too many people. (And that's even harder to convincingly show in a movie.) Le Cercle Rouge is a movie that does not tell me much, but it's a beautifully composed movie in its own way.
