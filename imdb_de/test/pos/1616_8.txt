I bought this DVD for little money from Walmart because I thought it was a typical, junk-free video monster junk, but it turned out much better than expected. There's really no criticism to say ... it's obviously a low budget, but that adds to the old-fashioned fun. It is very cool and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There is everything: horror, sex, a great plane crash and good characters. And I would say it's pretty original, because it does not really look like any other movie I've seen. It has its own unique look, which I really liked, so this movie deserves recognition. I look forward to seeing more of these great films from "The Scare Master," Brett Piper, which I've never heard before. <br /> <br /> The DVD menu is really creative when playing groovy music so it's perfect if you're not ready to sit down and watch it. It also contains some peculiarities that are really interesting. But we never see the director or hear him in the commentary, he has to be shy. This comes from Edgewood Studios in Vermont, USA. I highly recommend it to all horror fans, you'll love it!
