I was a little surprised to see all the hate comments here. Sure, it's not the best show for kids, but does not people stop despising Barney after fifth grade? Okay, everyone hates Barney. Okay, I think his voice and his songs are annoying. Okay, he's kind of scary and weird. I'm 14 years old and I know it well enough. But here is the thing. Children? They LOVE this show. <br /> <br /> When I was a small child of two or three, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than anything else. Nothing caught my attention for more than ten minutes. Imagine, so are toddlers. Even most patients can not sit still long enough for their parents to take a break. There is too much to do and see and explore, too much effort to get in there. <br /> <br /> And then Barney came. I'm not sure what makes the Purple Dinosaur so fun for kids, but they really love it. I know that I did it. I loved the show and wanted to see it over and over again. Yeah, the songs somehow drove my parents mad, but to see how their kids learn and to be happy about something that can really hold their attention span is worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123, the magic words and brushing my teeth. Of course I had outgrown at five or six, but at the time I was at least a little more patient and gave my parents a break. <br /> <br /> My nieces and my nephew have gone through everything The Barney stage has grown big, much to the delight of her mother. I know what keeps Barney in the air. He entertains. Of course there's Big Bird, Ernie and Oscar, and they're great too. But in the toddler stage, it seems that more children prefer the big singing dinosaur. And that's enough for me.
