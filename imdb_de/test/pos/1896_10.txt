This movie is funny in many ways. It has action. It has humor. It has a setting. It has Dolemites whole army of kung fu men! And that's exactly what the film offers as a film. It is also played by some bad, the microphone makes more than one appearance and some "punches" are missing on foot. But if you make a movie so cool, who has time to pay attention to these "details"? This movie rocks. Rent it tonight, if you can find it ... I had to buy it to see it, but I do not regret it!
