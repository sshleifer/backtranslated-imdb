* Can be spoiler * Undoubtedly one of the best dramas, if not the best in the genre I've ever seen. Is Prot an alien or just a crazy guy? This is the question you will ask throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is just incredible, as is Jeff Bridges. This kind of acting and sometimes humor can not be beat. Some of Kevin Spacey's actions in this movie are very funny. For example, when he was up in the tree and talking to the "Queen" patient, he hid half of his face around the wall and just stared at it. From the beginning you will be thrilled, and if you really love dramas, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Good 85%.
