OSS 117 was fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It's hard to define why a movie touches you or not, and I will not try to analyze such a perfect comedy that is so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to: )! <br /> <br /> Here everything is old-fashioned, from women's clothes (sigh!), mambo dance, the "hero's song" ... ("Bambino" sounds like an Italian canzonetta ... sung arabic :)!). Hubert is physically impressive, but dumb as hell. Of all the 007s he looks like Sean Connery, but is definitely more sympathetic because he is ... stupid, talks all the time about his thoughts, chuckles, even has homoerotic fantasies and rumors about him. In short, as an anti-hero he rocks :)! Sometimes he just raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all that makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Bérénice Bejo is the true queen of the film. Graceful, insidious, but with ideals. Aure Atika, on the other hand, is reduced to a kind of femme fatale. It's surprising to see her as a "sexy bomb," you. <br /> <br /> You just can not compare it to "Austin Powers"! I agree with Amazon's D. Hartley (Seattle, WA) that it is respectful of the genre. <br /> <br /> What is your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is the "Battle of the Chickens" with the masked villain. But the really perfect thing is to chat with your contacts at the cocktail, how they murmur all platitudes with confidence ... But this scene is worth the comedy genre.
