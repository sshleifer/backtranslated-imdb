What a great movie that did more to make my wife and I stumble on it by accident and channel surfing on a beautiful, frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is usually best at leading a cast of very normal and human Costar characters through one of the most wonderful movies we've ever seen. It is difficult to understand why this film did not receive the attention it deserved when it was released in 2002. Why it was head and shoulders over so many of the boring garbage pieces that were released with greater fanfare and attention is revealed in the consideration. It is obvious that as a general public, we are being force-fed, which is considered by the powerful and influential people to be "great and wonderful", while real gems like "Unconditional Love" create a genuinely edible cinema through all these pre-transducers. Rent or buy this movie ... you will not regret it!
