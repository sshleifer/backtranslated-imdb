This all but ignored masterpiece is about the Monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie (Head), and that whatever they do or say has already been written in an (invisible) script that they seem to follow. Head was written by Jack Nicholson, Rafelson and Peter Tork during a three-day LSD journey in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel. The other three Monkees only acted in it. <br /> <br /> You fight this in every possible way by doing things that are not in the script. They deliberately lash their lines, go off the set, rip the landscape and beat other actors for no reason; and finally commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. <br /> <br /> If you see, for example, picture by picture in the fast flashes of a psychedelic party scene, you can sit by Rafelson next to the camera and see a cameraman deliberately shooting into a mirror. He reveals that the party is indeed fake and filmed in a studio with actors who suddenly lose character and disappear in the middle of a conversation when the director "Cut!" Screams. <br /> <br /> The Monkees, however, never fall out of character because these characters are also who they really are. This will ultimately be the core of the revelation that comes soon. <br /> <br /> At every opportunity, they realize that their increasingly bizarre actions are exactly what they should do in the script they can not escape in. They say they've gone crazy and are through the sky (which turns out to be painted on paper and hanging from the ceiling as a background of the set)? No problem! Hey, hey, they are the Monkees, and those crazy guys just make monkeys! <br /> <br /> In the end, they were not even released by their deaths. So the film should end, and their motionless, water-filled corpses are fished out of the river, put into another box and stacked in a movie studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production. <br /> This becomes all the more poignant the fact that the Monkees are actually fictional characters who have forced themselves into the real world. They made it through the power of their music. <br /> <br /> Ironically, in the end, Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as a very profound revelation that solves their problem, but unfortunately nobody listens. <br /> <br /> Peter realizes: "It does not matter if we are in the box (the movie)". He means that it does not matter if the will is free or illusory, and that "the only important thing is that you just let the present moment happen and happen ... you just have to" PASS HOW "as it happens." without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is "valid" through an abstract definition. <br /> <br /> If you can not even tell the difference, whether you're free or not figuring out if you're the "real" one is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at a very important time in my life. I've been trying to figure out how to escape the "just this geeky, scary nerd girl" by thinking hard about it and not just having fun (like sex) like anyone else. But the revelation in Head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork would ever know. <br /> <br /> I've seen "Head" for decades and wish I could thank Pete. <br /> <br /> Was that a good movie? <br /> <br /> Uh, how about ... <br /> <br /> == <YES> ==
