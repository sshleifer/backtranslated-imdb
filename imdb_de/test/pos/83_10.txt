Channel zapping one night I have just experienced the beginning of this film and it fascinated me from the beginning. It tells the sad story of an adopted child, Adam, whose mother left him after birth. The film takes us through his childhood and lets us discover a very disturbing fact from Adam's past. I will not give away anymore, but it is a very in-depth film and will surely fascinate you. This, in my opinion, was one of the best roles of Jimmy Smits.
