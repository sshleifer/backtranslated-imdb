Unfortunately, since I could not find them anywhere, I did not manage to try out the other entries in the series, although I certainly do not mind and can trust me, I checked. For those who do not know, this is an adventure title with a mouse click. This means that the mouse is what you use to interface with anything you can do here, even though there is a special case where this is inaccurate. I will not spoil it here, for anyone who has not tried it yet. Regardless of how little experience you have with computers, you can do that. There are not that many of them where you have to be fast or have quick reflexes. Heck, you can adjust the speed of the text (if you have subtitles) and thus talking in it, and it's not very uncomfortable or compulsory when you're slow. Accessing your inventory is as easy as combining or using items. Clicking and holding the button for anything you can influence gives you three options for what to do with it (be it a person, a specific part of the environment, or an object): Hand (press, record, open, etc.) , Eyes (examine, look through, etc.) and mouth (eat, talk, etc.). All this results in a welcoming, friendly environment in which you can vary the rich puzzles (depending on the two difficulty levels in which you want to try this setting) to do as you like, dozens of individual, creatively made characters and areas in this area. The length of time depends on how much time you spend on it (you can not blame me, it's worth it) and your ability to find solutions. There are a few points where you can decide if you want to go the harder route or not. This can be enjoyed by anyone from any age. There is no material that is unacceptable for children. This is one of the products that proves that this fact does not necessarily mean that this is unacceptable to older viewers. The animation is high quality, smooth, everything is moving as it should, and honestly, the third dimension is not that painful when trying to do so. Storytelling is well done and you never know what's going on. There are plenty of well-directed cutscenes that are kept in the same colorful, mostly bright 2D world as the rest, with thoughtful camera movements. "Cartoony" is a fitting word to describe this, and not just the visual style. It can be applied to all this. The whole world of it is very similar to ours, but not quite the same as ours, with a mixture of past and present, inhabited by people and stuffed with things that we can at least recognize or understand parts of, but the absurdity makes them funny would have to be one of the biggest strengths, right there: It's weird. Much of it comes from the spoken lines (which is said and what it is), and those who dig British efforts with a focus on verbal, like "Allo" Allo or the BlackAdder franchise, want to check out this jerk. However, there are several types of jokes, including, but not limited to: satire, wisdom, darkness, spoofs, irony, rough comedy (not just my favorite aspect), and more. There is self-confidence, with the leader addressing you personally, explaining for example why he is not doing what you have just asked him to do. For some decades, there is evidence of pop culture. Almost everything works, hardly gags fall flat, and if you do not mess with it, I could think that this is just not compatible with your sense of humor ... a situation that gives no judgment, and if you suspect has that this could be the case and want to find out, I propose the demo version, in which you can see for free if you are interested in the brand of the game and / or the laughter. The plot is well written (almost all of it is real), develops consistently well and keeps your interest well. The sound is all excellent, crisp and well done. The sound effects are perfect. The music is well composed without exception. The voice output is impeccable, with one or two celebrities. Armato is awesome as Guybrush Threepwood (I must love that name) you control. Boen is unbelievable like LeChuck, the deceased (and still threatening) zombie villain. The designs are very well done, very imaginative and fit all. Despite the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirates, you can get involved with a few. Steer one ship, climb the other, and adjust the blades in a rather unique and wonderfully thoughtful way. The replayability is mainly in the choices, during the dialogue, etc. This is linear, with a little freedom in the sequence, so that the pirate, who sits down with it at least for the second time, has not become so big There are a lot of possibilities as far as this is questioned, unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime. Ah, nothing is perfect. Anyone who would like to immerse themselves in a thoroughly thought-through and fascinating fictional universe and want to break up countless times should get a real kick here. The good kind, not the ones that hurt and possibly bruise. Do not forget, kids, * eat * no books ... that just begs for a paper cut. I would bet that those who like the others would appreciate them too. And they are not the only ones who can get involved. I recommend this to any member of this genre of VGs, except the members of the above group, as well as anyone who likes this review. 8.10
