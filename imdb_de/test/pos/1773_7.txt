This is one of several historical maritime yarns of its time that have in their midst the additional difference (though not unique) of a female buccaneer. At first glance, both heads - Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan - seem to be wrong, but they eventually grow well thanks to their talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. The velvety Marshall is unusually cast as the obligatory philosophical doctor of a ship, and Gomez is larger than Blackbeard The Pirate. The cast is completed by Debra Paget as Jourdan's wife. who triggers the jealous rage of the tomboyic titular character into whom Jourdan puts his first love pains (but does not spare him the occasional flogging or sword injury); Incidentally, the film was the second exotic collaboration between Jourdan and Paget in one year after Delmer Daves' VIRD OF PARADISE. The direct result of this unexpected softening of Anne's character is that she's made her escape with Blackbeard's crew and her unlikely climate change victim to save the lives of stranded Jourdan, Paget and Marshall. Not a particularly outstanding example of this guy. Jacques Tourneur's energetic direction and the magnificent score of Franz Waxman ensure an above-average effort, which moves at a brisk pace. By the way, Tourneur had already done service in the genre with the superior Burt Lancaster vehicle THE FLAME AND THE ARROW (1950). As usual with classical Technicolor productions, the cinematography gives the film a lush, invigorating treasure. By the way, there are different durations for this movie (81 or 87 minutes), and for the record, the version I saw was shorter.
