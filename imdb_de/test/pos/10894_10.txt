007's Goldeneye is one of the best N64 releases ever. <br /> <br /> Better than this game? Well ... Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Racer and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time are far better and superior games. But I still love Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the best adaptation of a movie adapted only to Star Wars customizations. The story is perfect. It's like being in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The graphics are outstanding. The movements are extremely realistic. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is the best part in this game. I loved to play the stage where James and Natalya break away from the Janus base while the Goldeneye prepares to burn them. It was very difficult to get away without an alarm. Removing cameras and controlling your fire are great aspects of gameplay. <br /> <br /> It's also the hardest game I've ever played. N64 games are usually very, very easy. Goldeneye is the only exception. I'm still trying to beat the difficult level of 00 Agent, but winning the easier levels was already a big win. I loved it when Alec Trevelyan asked: "For England James?". I answered, "No, for me!" It happened just the moment I blew him to death. Just like in the movie. I love to reach every goal. <br /> <br /> Multiplayer gaming is even better. First, I was killed every sacred second. Now I know how to win. I love forcing my playmates by playing License to Kill. <br /> <br /> The music and the sound are amazing. Super Mario 64 looks like an Atari next to it. The only thing I wanted to hear was the Goldeneye theme song, which plays at the end of the movie. After Zelda was released, I almost forgot that I still had this game. It is still excellent, even if it is already exceeded. I hope other 007 games are produced. <br /> <br /> Fantastic job rareware! Nintendo was very smart to release this game exclusively on the N64. Gorgeous Job Nintendo!
