I've heard a lot about 'The English Patient' and finally decided on the CD to find out what the whole Ballyhoo was all about. What I found was a pleasure in the cinema and should, I should repeat, always be viewed with an open eye. If you're a religious and moral fanatic, I'm afraid that this is not a movie for you, as you will not see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece, as you will constantly keep the moral dilemmas that this film causes. I remember exactly before watching this movie. I read the review on this site and was deeply impressed by the views of this person I quote, "The protagonists deserve what they got." When it comes to morality, I agree with him, but this is not the way to comment on a film of this splendor. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I've rarely seen such a wonderfully crafted movie. I keep hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious mind. First and foremost, this is a love story and yes, it's an extramarital affair (moralists are wary of it), but let's not focus on it anymore. Instead, let's focus on how the story was told. It's a mix of flashbacks and present. It is set in World War II and tells the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy, wonderfully played by Ralph Fiennes), who is cared for by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in an Italy torn by Italy just before the war began ( Defeat of the axial forces). The burned, scarred patient had repeatedly thought of the terrible affair with an Englishwoman, Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas), shown in flashbacks screened in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are so cleverly interwoven in the story that you somehow get carried away into the story and get the feel of a first-time viewer. The locations in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and also the characters. I am a romantic and am not ashamed to say that I had tears after the end. Watch it with someone you really love. The movie begins and ends with the same setting from the desert, where the sand dunes twist and curve like a woman's body, and it was breathtaking. The feeling of loss and sadness was so overwhelmingly conveyed by the actors that I wonder why God! Why are there wars that destroy the beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of innocence? Anyway, it has earned a bunch of Oscars and I'll go hunting for other works by director Anthony Minghella. It somehow brings back the romance in the David Lean genre of films. It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia', who also lived in the desert. Happy spectators.
