I can not overcome the quality of the score, the book and the performances. This is the first production I've ever seen of Sweeney Todd, so I have no others to compare to. But the effect is so strong that I can not imagine anything better. First, there is the music - take "Johanna" (Act II), while the Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna are intertwined with vocal line with the melodies of three songs. It's like a Bach chorale in this sense - just a masterpiece of composition. And the underlying chord structure and voices are so perfect - a bit of melancholy, a bit of contentment, a bit of yearning, all of which express the views of these three singers. <br /> <br /> Then - - the text. The rhymes are so smart. The rhyme schemes sometimes seem random, but always add up at the end. (The DVD I watched has Closed Captions, and these are indispensable for the appreciation of dialogue and lyrics.) Sondheim deserves a literary prize for his poetry alone. I can not imagine better than George Hearn. Why have I never heard of him? His singing alone is masterful, but the range of his acting is simply amazing. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. The song about "you and me down by the sea" - who could make it even better? Their timing is perfect, the pitch is perfect, every beat of the score is taken into account; and overlaying this achievement in musicality is her utterly delightful comic book delivery. <br /> <br /> It's a dark story, but I sometimes thought it was cute; and the melody of "Johanna" continues to play in my head.
