If not the best movie ever made, "Babette's Feast" is certainly one of the loveliest. This is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of art, generosity, loyalty and grace. Humor mingles with tender longing; Characters are treated with searching honesty, but also with deep respect. There are meditations on memory, destiny, age and faithfulness. Wonderful camera work by the cameraman Henning Kristiansen: Rarely have wrinkled faces looked so bright in the candlelight. The meal is accompanied by delicious historical music, Brahms, Mozart and simple folk hymns. Enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit, for as the general says, "Compassion and truth have met, and righteousness and blessedness will kiss."
