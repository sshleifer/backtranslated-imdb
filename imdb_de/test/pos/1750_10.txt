When HOPPITY goes to town, he discovers nothing but bad news for his little neighbors who are in the Lowlands. Can this honest, good-natured grasshopper save his lover, Miss Honey Bee, from the machinations of the evil C. Bagley Beetle and lead his friends to a safe new home before it's too late? <br /> <br /> HOPPITY is not exactly one of the great animations (a very new art at the time this movie was made). It's an entertaining movie that should please non-critical viewers. Technically it is well done, with animations of generally high quality. The main drawback of the movie is that none of the characters really have a "heart" - they do not get as alive on the screen as Jiminy Cricket a year earlier in PINOCCHIO. <br /> <br /> It's ultimately unfair to compare the edition of Fleischer Studio with that of Disney. Max & Dave Fleischer had their own star to follow. Their contribution - and that would be considerable - would be in the area of ​​the one-roll cartoon. With their POPEYE and BETTY BOOP series, they created alternative realities as realizable as any other animation studio. HOPPITY was their second experiment with the animation length of animations (after GULLIVER'S TRAVELS in 1939), and they would return to the animated theme again. In fact, the first in the highly praised SUPERMAN series was already in the release. <br /> <br /> The story of HOPPITY owes much to Frank Capra, and it is energetic to fight against powerful social forces. In fact, the original title of the film was MR. BUG GOES TO TOWN, immediately reminiscent of Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and their adventures in Capraesque. Jack Mercer, known as the voice of Popeye, speaks here for two very different characters, the old Mr Bumble & swat the fly film artists should hear the experienced speakers of Pinto Colvig & Mae Questel, both in unrecorded roles. <br /> <br /> The film contains some pleasant songs by Hoagy Carmichael & Frank Loesser, including "Be My Little Baby" Hummel is the best known. "We are the couple in the castle" is a fine romantic melody that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the film's initial animation, with its sweep of the sky and deep New York skyline, is hidden behind the opening credits.
