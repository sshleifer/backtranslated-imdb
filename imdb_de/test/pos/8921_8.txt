OK, so some of the plot points are a bit obvious, but above all, an interesting idea that works towards a tight end. The acting is solid, especially Lachy Hulme, who plays one of the central figures in this ensemble. He certainly has a screen presence and is interesting to see. It has a low budget that works for the kind of thriller / horror genre that Four Jacks belongs to. The film does not try to take itself seriously, which adds to the overall charm. The character of Phil (Dave Serrafin) is one of the most annoying characters on screen since Rupert Pupkin / King of Comedy. It's worth adding a weekend stack of DVDs.
