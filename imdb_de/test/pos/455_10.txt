I really enjoy this movie. The first time was Turner Classic Movies. All actors have played very well, but Brynner steals the show again as usual (he is so sexy!). This is one of the films that shows Brynner's emotions. In this movie, I first saw him laugh because he plays very strong, larger than life and serious roles in other films. In this movie you will see a male, tough and sensitive side of Brynner. Brynner seems to be a "ladies'man" in this movie. This is amazing how Brynner eats the glass bowl and speaks in his Russian language, which drives me crazy love. I do not understand if both Brynner and Kerr (both have a very good chemistry) are stars in a movie together and then Brynner always dies in the end, somehow reminding you of "The King and I".
