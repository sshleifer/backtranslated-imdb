"We both stumble together in this unformed world, whose rules and goals are largely unknown, seemingly undecipherable, or may not even exist, and they are on the verge of being killed by powers we do not understand." Ted Pikul says in the film. What some people sum up life for and "eXistenZ" is probably a movie about existence. What is real and what is unreal and how do you recognize the difference? Or not. The last line of the movie is very ambiguous. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a shaggy dog ​​story (in fact it contains a really shaggy dog), but it takes you on an interesting, provocative ride A touch of Cronenberg, with amphibians, wildcaps, fish , Spines and bones can see in a new light. Some bits are pretty icky. It takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called "GAS STATION" and a Chinese restaurant called "CHINESE RESTAURANT" Lots of things in the movie and it pays to look more than once. <br /> <br /> The main characters are Jude Law, who is OK, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is great. Some roles do not fit this very talented actor, but if she has a good role like this, she is second to none. Her unconventional beauty and mesmerizing voice go with Allegra. (Looks great in a short black skirt, too.) There are other well-known actors, but not much to do. It looks good, sounds good and a Howard Shore score complements the movie very well. Cronenberg may be the Alfred Hitchcock of the sci-fi / horror genre. No matter what movie he does, he is always worth seeing.
