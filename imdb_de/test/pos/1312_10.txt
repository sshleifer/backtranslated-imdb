This film tells hauntingly about the life of the author and poet Mishima. It leaps through its past, through its last day and through some of its stories, but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section. It captures the taste of the man, his work and his time ... the difficult 1960s. <br /> <br /> I think the most wonderful parts (literally full of "miracles") are excerpts from his works. The sets (especially for use with the camera) are amazing ... stylized, beautiful and effective. They can be used as examples for each set designer. I woke up at night and dreamed of the Golden Pagoda. <br /> <br /> The stories were a powerful exploration of the nature of man and of art. After seeing this movie, I wanted to know more about the works of this artist. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics or Japanese history.
