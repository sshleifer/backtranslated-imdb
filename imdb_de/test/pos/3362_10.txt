In my opinion, Papa's army is the best British sitcom ever. I think if you watch just one episode of the show, you can not fully appreciate this episode (this includes the movie). They need to see at least one series of this show, get into the characters, familiarize themselves with their environment and their surroundings, the situations in which they find themselves. Once you become familiar with the show, it starts talking to you. Now the movie has some changes to the series, which is a bit disappointing but still works. First, watch one or two series in the series before you see this. You will not be disappointed. Good result is "No spring for Frazer"
