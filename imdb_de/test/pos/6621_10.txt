When I was in the suburbs of New York, when the Z-Boys made history in Dogtown, I was only exposed to what had happened. I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with tone wheels. It's long gone and on the ashes of my personal life. But I never forgot it. It's like seeing long-lost brothers and friends, and it hits me right where I live. I can not see this movie enough. Every time I see it, another aspect goes up, another point of view is sharply focused. The vintage material, the incredible stills, the up-to-date personalities blended with the vivid shadows of the brightly-lit past, the heartfelt and unfinished tale, all cut together so beautifully that they represent a milestone documentary of a true American play History. In the words of Glen Friedman: "It was incredible."
