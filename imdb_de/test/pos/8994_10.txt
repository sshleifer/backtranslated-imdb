I wanted to watch this movie since the previews came out. I do not understand why everyone in this movie is so tough. It may not all be technically true for rugby sport, but this movie is not primarily about the sport. It's about a rugby team that's supposed to learn to be more than the world expects them to be. They are taught to become men, not timeless futile boys. Hollywood is never 100% accurate in its productions. They are there to make a product that sells. Something entertaining. The story of Coach Gelwix and what he has taught over the years is just unbelievable. He teaches about service, honor, integrity and moral cleanliness. How many other films do these teach today to our youth? I was proud to see such an amazing story that taught awe and respect.
