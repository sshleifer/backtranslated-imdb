If it had been done 2 years later, it would have been FORBIDDEN! Number one MUST SEE the recommendation of the day! The best Rouben Mamoulian movie I've seen yet (but I have not seen J + H yet). <br /> <br /> No wonder why this movie received less than 200 votes. A larger Greyzone, which could not care less about what's right, would not be seen again until the 1960s. As morally ambiguous and dark as the 70s, but also with a certain charm. Of course, this had to be low in the late 1930s, and it seems that it has not been rediscovered. <br /> <br /> Seriously. That got everything. Great actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and Guy Kibbee, not so lovable this time. And a powerful good director. So far, I was not the biggest fan of RM, but I really liked his movies and he's entering a new league. One of the best 30s movies I have ever seen! I never thought of that! 9.5 / 10
