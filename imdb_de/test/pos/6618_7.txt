This documentary describes the origins and life of the Zephyr skateboarding team through original films filmed in the 1970s (mainly by Craig Stecyk), in conjunction with interviews with today's team members and other influential people. The first part The film documents how the "Dogtown" department of Venice, CA, was born, which began around the turn of the century when the city became a Venice-like European city like Venice. By the 1970s, the only remaining attraction, the Pacific Ocean Park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with many exposed piers and other hazards. The poor kids who lived in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and they surpassed each other (or maybe because of) their surroundings. As the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they used skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years, as well as their surfing backgrounds, caused them to falter into the vertical mainstream. Skateboard style developed. <br /> <br /> I found out that the movie covered much more about surfing than I expected. That seemed like a bonus to me as I did not really know much about surfing or skateboarding before the movie. The soundtrack was not surprisingly good. I also liked how these kids just followed their passion and that in general they were better for this experience. The parts that did not work so well for me were the drama they tried to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the slightly over-sense of the team's self-esteem (though this is probably just a deserted street situation from which they've grown ) above). This does not mean that they had no significant impact, only that it is highly likely that there were other factors as well. <br /> <br /> One note: My wife is more affected than most by nausea when films use what we call "SpastiCam" (shaking camera movements). This movie is often guilty. So if you are so concerned, be forewarned. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially anyone who has skateboarding and / or surfing in their history. <br /> <br /> Seen on 11.5.2002.
