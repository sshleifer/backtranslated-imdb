Although this film is eleven years old, I rented it only yesterday and found it very touching. The story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and very touching. <br /> <br /> Although I did not care about the amount of language some of the young actors use - especially from Renfro - I understand that art imitates life. Renfro is once again doing a great job on the rough and tough, very (and I mean VERY) disturbed wannabe bully (his role in The Client comes to my mind), and Mazzello does the funny, slightly bizarre Dexter - A Child That realizes that his life has to end too soon. <br /> <br /> Although there are so many touching and funny moments in the movie, I have to say that my favorite was when the boys were cornered by Pony. In the abandoned church, Dexter (Mazzello) cut himself and said his blood was poison. While it is very imaginative and somewhat amusing to see an adult male run away from two young children, it is one of the most difficult scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Take a look at these, but with your Kleenex - you need it!
