The only pure life that ends with a signature in the blood. <br /> <br /> Mishima says anyway, a young, sheltered boy who writes celebrities. The life of one of Japan's most famous literary voices is told from three perspectives. His life just before he and four members of his private army take over a Japanese military base and commit ritual suicide (shown in color), flashbacks (shown in black) and white) and scenes from his novels (pictured in a kind of dreamy technicolor set somewhere between the traditional Noh theater and the "Wizard of Oz".) These stories are often narrated simultaneously, but are edited to support the slow merging of Mishima's life with his fictions, to the end (or beginning) when he likes the old samurai whom he so admires has a balance between feather and sword (when his words and deeds are the same and he is full.) and "pure" being). <br /> <br /> Paul Schrader wrote the script for "Taxi Driver" and directed "Cat People" (a bizarre erotic horror movie that made strange impressions on me as a boy), and in Mishima he makes a very good movie the next. <br /> <br /> What an interest it is to watch the poet, the homosexuals, the shy and clumsy man with a low body image who overestimates his tuberculosis in order to be aware of the Second World War (from which he was referring) always becoming ashamed), becoming a physique, obsessed with samurai, a-sexual, media phenomena still write numerous novels, plays and short stories. <br /> <br /> A short and sweet version states that Mishima has no father and possesses maleness, beauty, sex and sex, self-destruction, in a tragic attempt to feel connected to something greater than himself he always missed. If you watch him with his suicidal cadets, you see him happy, he speaks his great paternal speech, gives instructions and loves to control ... until the speech itself, the point where pen and sword meet? Of course, this ignores the subtlety of the narrative craft that makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. <br /> <br /> Although the story is sometimes intriguing, this is not the biggest success of this film. The cinematography, performances, editing, music (by Philip Glass) and stage design make this really worth seeing and more than just a traditional organic image. <br /> <br /> One day I will pick up A Mishima book, he seems to have an ear for prose and for the staging of ideas, but for now I am satisfied with the film. <br /> <br /> Those interested in Japanese literature and post-war culture should check out. Fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should also have fun.
