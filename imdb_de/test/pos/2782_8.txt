A rather charming representation of the European Union that begins among the young generation, as representatives of this group learn to live in an apartment in Barcelona where they all study international scholarships. At the heart of the story is Xavier (Romain Duris), who has lived a more conventional life with his mother in France, but quickly becomes a leader of the group, helping them cope with landlords and other problems. He learns quickly about life and love. Duris has a healthy look and delivers good performance. The rest of the cast plays well as well. Occasionally they all fall into English if they want to make sure they communicate. They are not sure if all their roommates understand French or Danish or whatever the languages ​​are. A remarkable cinematography, including a magnificent view of Barcelona and the famous Gaudi towers.
