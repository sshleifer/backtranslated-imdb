I got this movie mainly from eBay because I'm gay and love Til Schweiger. However, it is one of those movies that, when you watch it a second time, never say to yourself, "Hmm, I forgot that boring part, I'll make popcorn." It does not have that part. It's a very fluid and always interesting movie. And yes, Til Schweiger is worth it, if nothing else. But it's also a great movie for heteros.
