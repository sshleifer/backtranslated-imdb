I saw the second part of this beautiful piece, which was put on a ship sometime in the 19th century. Golding's book must be responsible for some of the excellent dialogue, but everything else was good too! I especially liked how they made the time and the feeling of being on the boat so good. For me, this had a sense of completeness that I know I can not convey in words ... Perhaps it was the way they mixed technical and historical details about sailing in the eighteenth centuries with history without messing it up. Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. It's not often a mini-series that sends me to the "Zone," but it did.
