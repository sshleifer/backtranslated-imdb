It is clear that the value of this film far exceeds the costs implied by the format (Mini-DV). The filmmaker embraces the format and cleverly inserts it into the plot, forgetting that I did not see the typical 35mm film. It has the core appeal of indie films like Clerks and the work of Robert Rodriguez, combined with a fantastic "re-setting" of the romantic comedy. "This Is Not A Movie" is an honest film with honest portrayals and a narrative of outstanding speed. There's no point in this movie that I thought was a scene that could (or should have) been omitted. On the contrary, the director pulls out amazing performances from truly gifted actors and does so in very tight circumstances. From page to screen, this movie is a worthy and relevant story that takes place on so many levels (creative, technical or otherwise). I would highly recommend it for those who love the cinema or those who are looking for a little charm in an otherwise meager medium.
