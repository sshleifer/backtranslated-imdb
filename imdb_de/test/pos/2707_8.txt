The Karen Carpenter story shows something more about the complex life of the singer Karen Carpenter. Although it fails to provide accurate facts and details. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb (portraying Karen) was not a good choice. She is a good actress, but plays a very naive and stupid Karen Carpenter. I think the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality. Louise Fletcher's role as Agnes Carpenter is great, she does a great job as Karen's mom in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately, this was not the case, though this film was at the top of the ratings in the US and some other countries
