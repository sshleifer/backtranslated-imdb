It takes a rare movie to get better every time you see it. O brother does that and then a lot. When I saw it for the first time, I have to admit that I had never seen anything like it. Then I wanted to see it again, and now I'm in double digits with this awesome movie, the most beautiful movie the Coen Brothers ever made, and Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy come in second and third place for me. <br /> George Clooney shows the performance of his career as Ulysses Everett McGee, a quick-witted know-it-all, escaped the convict who does not actually know that much. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect companions for Clooney, especially for Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar, a loyal albeit uneducated fellow. John Goodman is my favorite character as Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his role in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. The favorites of Coen brothers Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also offer unforgettable performances. <br /> <br /> Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their craft. It's not like they're trying to win Oscar prizes every time they make a movie. They just try to tell a story they want to tell, and that's entertaining. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean it for all Homer fanatics. It's just great. <br /> <br /> However, the most amazing part of this film is the color scheme. I've seen how they got that dusty feeling in the movie, and I'm still impressed if I just think about it. The coloring becomes an important part of the film. Great grand movie.
