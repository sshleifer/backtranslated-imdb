The 221 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" were originally aired on ABC from 1949 to 1957. and then they played in local syndicates for many years. For most of the original broadcasting years, the series was ABC's most watched program. The new DVD set of Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (September 15 - December 29, 1949) and for some reason unknown to me from Episode 22 from the fifth season, a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 at last year 's Released by Mill Creek Entertainment, so they're probably in the public domain). These sets make the movie "The Legend of the Lone Ranger" quite unnecessary, since all three episodes, which were put together in 1952 to the film, are included in these publications. <br /> <br /> The early episodes go back to the radio as much more voice-over narration is used as an introduction and introduction of important moments in the plot. <br /> <br /> The series itself was a pure kiddie western with clear, good and evil differences and no romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started with Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide the background for his transformation into the Lone Ranger status, his partnership with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels) and the taming of his horse "Silver". <br /> <br /> There is a clear code of positive morality that pervades every episode. The lonely ranger is totally good, but he takes on the mask of evil. While a masked man in the West was usually feared by the good citizens and distrusted of an Indian, the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do the evil. One stubborn issue is that when the solitary Ranger and Tonto first meet an average citizen, they are greeted with suspicion and convinced of their worth at the end of the episode of the citizens. The trademark ended as a secondary character and asked the question, "Who was this masked man?". <br /> <br /> To truly enjoy the series, you must accept her for the simple moral story she intended. If you do not take it seriously and still want self-reflective Campy parody elements, you'll just get frustrated. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
