This movie is great, it has the same low budget feel for first movies like 'Pi' and 'Clerks', but has the style of 'Memento' (also by Writer / Director Christopher Nolan). The score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost "memento" prototypes, and history shows that Christopher Nolan is the best when writing and directing. Do not be put off by the low-budget look and acting or the short movie length, and just watch the movie!
