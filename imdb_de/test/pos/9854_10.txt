Not only is this documentary one of the best documentaries I've ever seen, it's also one of the most moving and silent movies I've ever seen. It follows the lives of two Sudanese young men, Peter and Santino, as they try to invade American culture. Peter and Santino are friends first, but they are gradually drifting apart as Peter goes to Kansas City and Santino stays in Houston ("a country called Houston"). Santino's beauty is in his eyes. He takes people on the back, he supports an apartment full of Sudanese, pays the rent and does everything for others. He is a quiet sufferer. Peter is looking for himself, does a high school education, plays basketball and closes Christian friends. It seems that director Megan Mylan did not know what she was getting into with the beauty of this story. Peter and Santino are amazing characters that move you. The real strength of this film lies in its commentary on American society. It does not judge. It shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be for outsiders. I suggest you find this movie and look America through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people. <br /> <br /> My grade: 10/10
