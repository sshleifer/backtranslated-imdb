Some will say that this movie is a bad pleasure. I loved this movie, but I do not feel guilty. You can see that the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie. But some people will not enjoy Jack Frost 2. From the beginning you can say that this movie will be cheesy and definitely has an amateurish look. Well, if you have the privilege to watch this movie, remember that Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. Now that I can not fill ten lines, there are some great scenes: <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The three women on the beach had big deaths. The first one had Jack in a tree and tried to throw icicles at one of them. He was missed again and he dropped an anvil on her. The next woman fell on an icicle bed. The last one was stuck in the eye with pliers. <br /> <br /> The other was the place where two surfer-stoners hung near a frozen pole. One of them, of course, gets his tongue on it. Jack Frost pulls him back while saying, "COWA-TONGUE-A DUDE!". Well, you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> And of course the snowball kids kicked their asses. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> infinite stars
