Do exactly what you expect and then a lot more. The first movie was a step up from the TV show with sicker stunts that were aired uncensored, and a gnarly factor that had increased. Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more twisted. <br /> <br /> The stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular, with some overwhelming painful antics sprinkled with good-looking skits to make that smile turn into disgust. "Knoxville dominates like always the action, but this time he has reason to be in the center, as he volunteers for the most dangerous and idiotic stunts. Bam Magera is as wild as ever, though his image in 'Viva La Bam' has been toned down. Surprisingly, the infamous Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) appear to be less involved in the skits, despite their focus on previous activities. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez then you will definitely enjoy this movie and laugh at the 100 minutes of its duration. If you think of him as a childish, disgusting, or sad snapshot of today's youth culture, you'll find it insulting as ever. So fuck you off.
