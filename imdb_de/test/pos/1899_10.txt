Everyone who was interested in the black movie in the 70s watched this movie. Some of the dialogues in this movie are so funny, ie the abstract of my template. Also, be sure to watch the boom microphone in some scenes, as well as some of the best karate action ever. Do not take this movie seriously, otherwise you will be disappointed, go open minded and enter the world of one of the world's most evil mutha Dolemite !!! Editing is as if it were cut with a razor, but once again this movie is so much more than what you see in the movie, it has so influenced the black community that you can not understand it !! !
