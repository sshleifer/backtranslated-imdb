Feisty Dianna Jackson (an exciting, spooky performance by the gorgeous former Playboy playmate Jeanne Bell) goes to Hong Kong to eliminate the evil heroin ring that killed her brother. Dianna's friend of fellow karate master Joe (friendly Chiquito) faces the staunch narcotic agent Elaine's resistance, and Roman's blatant, ruthlessly ambitious Charlie (splattered by Stan Shaw with the most arrogant aplomb) while she her revenge was planned against the nefarious drug king Sid (an effectively slimy Ken Metcalfe). Director Cirio H. Santiago, who is working on a trashy script co-starred by Dick Miller (!), Is stopping the vivacious and eventful 72-minute run with a plethora of unnecessary nudity and countless martial arts combat scenes (Bell is clearly joined by a squat man a huge Afro wig doubled!). The definitely sloppy highlight occurs when a topless bell beats a couple of clubs in her hotel room alone. Felipe Sacdalan's raw, grainy, scratched cinematography, the awkward use of exhausting slow motion, the funky groovin score, the ridiculously incapable battle choreography, and the surprisingly gruesome inference all add to the cuddly, cheesy Grindhouse operation.
