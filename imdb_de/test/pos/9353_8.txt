My top 2 actors happen to be in this movie - Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. <br /> <br /> Ryan was able to play everything from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller and play it magnificently. In this film, he begins his speech "... people with names like Samuels and others whose names are hard to say" - it's nice to watch him. <br /> <br /> Robert Young plays the policeman called to investigate the murder of Samuel (Sam Levine), a civilian chatting with several soldiers in a bar. Mitchell is the soldier wanted in connection with it - his wallet was found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a gentle soldier who only misses his wife. The story is told from different perspectives. Mitchell and Samuels make a friendship and go back to Samuel's apartment. Samuels seems to know the loneliness that Mitchell feels. "For years, you've focused on a peanut, and now you do not know what to feel," he says of the war. Ryan is outstanding as Monty, the psychotic racist /> Robert Young (along with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career was renewed by film noir. "Crossfire", "They will not believe me" and "The Other Woman" are great examples. Robert Mitchum is his usual laid-back than the philosophical Keeley. <br /> <br / Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as the "odd couple" are also outstanding in their short but insightful roles. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best movie about racism ever made.
