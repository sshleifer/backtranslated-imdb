I have some of the older videos and DVDs from Dr. Who. I have played it over and over again. I love each of the "doctors" for different reasons. Because of a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who canceled, though he was still one of the mainstays of the BBC team. With the farewell of Sylvester McCoy the doctor remained alive by the fans. The BBC allowed fans to write books and cartoons. The dynamics of Dr. Who was stable even after 1989. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann. The movie was flawed, but he gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, the "man" was gone and the BBC newbies said it was time to bring the doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in America, the sci-fi channel has seized a chance that has also been a complete success, although the authors start from scratch and the mythology Dr. Who had to explain to new viewers. It is incredible for me that they did it. In Season 1, starring Christopher Eccleston with Russell T. Davis as lead author and Phil Collinson as producer, the Doctor returned to us and in each episode we learn more about the Doctor. The Doctor Who universe was always about choice, love, and sacrifice. That's what they have provided. It makes me want more and it saddens me that Mr. Eccleston has left the show. My first doctor was Doctor No. 3, Jon Pertwee's Doctor. Mr. Eccleston need not worry about his position in Dr. Ing. Who's universe. It's as solid as the rest. He's the 9th Doctor. I did not know Mr. Eccleston before he went to Dr. Who acted, but now I do it. I wish there was a way, he could know, there is an urge in the dr. Who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it. We have already seen that he is a great actor.
