This documentary is the most mesmerizing movie I've seen in a long time. I must have had it for a whole day. The selected material flows amazingly well and develops three characters that you can never forget. The various layers of these people withdraw to produce a strangely moving film about perseverance, loyalty, and determination. These characters were surprisingly fascinating and the movie is unforgettable.
