The kind of "little" movie the studios used to do, but rarely do more. A kind of "soul" version of the well-known "The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells". Ian McShane is a great DJ and lover of soul music. He is obsessed with the idea of ​​reuniting members of a classic soul group. The film follows its successes as well as those of the group members. a cast that includes a real musical talent like Isaac Hayes, as well as actors who question Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas. Not an epic, but still a piece of gold.
