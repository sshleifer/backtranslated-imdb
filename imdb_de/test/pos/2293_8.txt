You must have lived in Japan for a while to enjoy the beauty of this movie! I lived in Okinawa for more than 2 years and in Honshu for 4 years. Believe it or not, what you see is a very good and accurate picture of opposing East / West mentalities, both athletic and personal. A fun, funny and heartwarming movie that deserves better than the Americans who see it can ever judge. 8 out of 10!
