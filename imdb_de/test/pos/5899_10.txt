I watch this movie every time it's on TV. A simply brilliant movie. Three men return home from the war trying to return to civilian life with great difficulty. All three led an opposite life during the war (Executive Banker became an Army sergeant, a soda joke became Air Force Captain and the high school football hero loses both arms in battle) and now everyone has to reconstruct and rebuild their lives to connect with a new reality. The homes they return to, with adult children and independent working women, as well as an economic crisis, only contribute to the quarrel. However, it is the scenes in front of the camera and the unspoken dialogue that are loudest to hear. The awkward intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader (at home and at work) are heartbreaking. Dana Andrews is as intriguing as the handsome, decorated captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniform. <br /> <br /> The film is full of honest characters, and each is portrayed by a gifted actor. <br /> <br /> However, this movie took a whole to another level after seeing "Saving Private Ryan". The reality and extent of what these men experienced for love and land ... and obviously did not end on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> This is a must for every collection. <Br /> <br />
