Ronald Colman plays a lost son. Although he is not a bad guy, he is a bit crazy and has not done much with his life except to travel around the world and have a fun time. Now that his latest push in Africa has failed, he sets off for England. His rich father from the upper class wants to throw it at his ear, although he is reluctantly welcomed with open arms thanks to Ronald's winning style. <br /> <br /> At this time there are two women in his life. -showgirl Myrna Loy and rich girl Loretta Young (who is already engaged). How will it all work out and Ronald will be smart and behave like a responsible adult - these are the main themes of this pleasant little film. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie and certainly will not change your life, but it is definitely entertaining and fun. This is mainly due to the always brilliant acting of Ronald Colman. Heck, in the heyday of his career in the 1930s, could have played in REEFER MADNESS or some other filth, and yet made it entertaining and likable due to his charming personality. His seemingly effortless style in this film makes it very easy to like him, and it's easy to see why both Loretta Young and Myrna Loy love him in the movie! In addition, the writing is very funny and makes this a nice romantic comedy.
