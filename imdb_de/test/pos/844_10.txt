I loved this show. I think the first time I tried Rocky Road Ice Cream was because of this show. Was not the store right on the beach or something? I actually wrote back and forth with Marci for several years. I lost contact and wished I could reconnect as an adult now. Does anyone know where she is now? I wish they would release it on DVD. I seriously doubt that there are maybe five or six people who even remember the show that was even aired. They just do not do shows anymore, right? I wonder if it would still hold at this time. Do you know someone who can burn DVDs of the program recorded on VHS? I would be willing to pay (within reason).
