I really felt that the movie was ahead of its time. One potential daughter-in-law was such a strong, career-oriented woman. She knew what she wanted and was diplomatic, but stuck with the cocky mother-in-law. The role of the mother was played very well (you just loved hating her). Her need to control her son's life was neurotically evil. If you've ever been in a relationship where you've been judged and found to be deficient (and everyone involved knew it did), it could be too close to home. It has been years since I saw this movie, and I remember thinking that this plot and dialogue would work in a movie of the 50s or 60s. Due to the dynamics of the mother and the sons, it is difficult to look at them, but I would like to see it again. I always hope to find it in one of the old movie channels, but so far no luck. Trying to buy it was also in vain (I do not think it's on tape or DVD).
