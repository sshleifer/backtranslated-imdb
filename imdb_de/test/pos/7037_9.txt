I remember it in a similar way to the boys. We stumbled back out of the pub and looked at it or picked it up, and then spent weeks repeating the lines. <br /> <br /> We named one of our colleagues "Zipmole Watkins" after the brilliant episode in which Daniel Peacock has a bit of "restyling" on the Back Street stripper's nose. <br /> <br /> Lots of great lines "Remember, at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man - take it is a simple guy!" - Gandhi as a shopkeeper on site. <br /> <br /> Tony Woodcock was definitely in the episode where they taught Ralph (Daniel Peacock) to be a bartender. "It's not good, Amanda man" Helen Lederer teaches him to ask people after the match "See the match last night I thought Woodcock was playing well." After a series of failed talks, the curly Arsenal star sat in the Bar: "Do you see the match last night?" "Yeah, I thought I played well" <br /> <br /> We're still doing strange stupid lines - "Reg and Ralph ..... or. ...... Ralph and Reg. Reg, Reg. Reg. Reg Reg Reg "<br /> <br /> Many very surreal dull moments and very surreal songs from the flatlets - The Back Street Abortionist - a personal favorite with the great end line - "And he marks your packages" Return to sender "<br /> <br /> Good old Danny Peacock - You've gained a lot of the evenings of some young drinkers, sir. <br /> <br /> ** Update - I found a few episodes on tape - I will upload the Gandhi sketch on Youtube **
