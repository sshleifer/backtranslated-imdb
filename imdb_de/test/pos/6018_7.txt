"Gypsy" is probably the best musical ever written, so it's a pity the movie version was so disappointed. For this we have this re-make, which, if not flawless, is a pleasant and successful adaptation of the musical. The script is completely accurate, with all songs included, and the staging remains close to the original staging of Jerome Robbins. Bette Midler is a skilful choice for Rose, her vocals and personality, and her acting is great. Peter Reigert is a good Herby, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a straightforward, natural Louise. In fact, a live recording of the resumption of 1989 with Tyne Daly would have been a better idea, if only because "Gypsy" is more exciting on stage.
