A real outstanding first season episode is what Ice is. An artificial posture, claustrophobic conditions, and a general feeling of paranoia in the icy air make this a must-see first season. The previous residents of Artic Station Mulder Scully and four others either killed each other or killed themselves. A virus produces murderous aggression and is responsible for producing deadly paranoia and anxiety. Mulder and Scully actually start questioning each other. The tension is so high Writers need to be highly acclaimed for creating such a scenario in which the atmosphere is so tense that Mulder and Scully are so directly in conflict
