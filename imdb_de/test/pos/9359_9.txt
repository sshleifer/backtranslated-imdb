In a March 1947 New York Times article, Crossfire was described as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s that "addresses questions of race and religious prejudice with more courage and honest courage than the public was used to." While RKO produced Crossfire, Twentieth Century-Fox made Gentleman's Agreement, another story about anti-Semitism. RKO ran to hit the much "ballyhooed" Fox picture in theaters, and released Crossfire a few months before Gentleman's Agreement. In July 1947, RKO Crossfire searched for representatives of various religious groups in Los Angeles. In addition, several surveys were conducted before and after the film screenings to gauge the audience's prejudices. Crossfire received praise and criticism for the portrayal of anti-Semitism in America and has been the subject of numerous editorials. Crossfire received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, but lost to Gentleman's Agreement. It was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame), Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). In September 1947, Crossfire was honored in Cannes as the best social film. In December 1947, the magazine Ebony, an African-American magazine, awarded the film its annual prize for "Improving Inter-racial Intercourse." Loved this movie. If you have the chance to see it, you will see it.
