I loved this movie. Independent filmmaking at its finest. The cinematography, the tempo, the rhythm and the drama were perfectly coordinated. Fred Carpenter's best work to date! The film is well written, with many twists that bring you to the end. It moves well and keeps you involved. As a photographer, I was most impressed with cinematography. The lighting creates mood and a beauty that is usually found in a much bigger budget movie. This gave the actors a great screen from which to unfold their magic. And that's exactly what they did! Great performances by all actors and each of them were well staffed in their roles. As I said at the beginning, this is a wonderful movie and one of Fred Carpenter's best films. You will love it.
