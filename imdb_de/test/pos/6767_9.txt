OK, so I'm not usually one who runs out and lends foreign films ... especially dark comedies. I think on the one hand I can count on the number of films that I found really funny from start to finish. This movie will be added to the shortlist. Even dark comedies directly from Hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. But this one had my eyes in tears. My pages hurt. I have not laughed so much for a long time. This film was recommended by my mother and I do not think I dreamed to look at it if she did not like it. Do not be afraid to read during your movie - you will miss a hilarious movie.
