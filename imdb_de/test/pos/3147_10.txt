I looked at The Reader at Sugar, an ideal place to see everything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well networked and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and the delivery that really made this short shine. Duncan Rogers's tricky script was exactly what needed shorts tonight. It did not meander, like various offerings, or he preached to us. The Reader was a simple tale in its best form, well staffed by Rogers and beautifully played. Duncan Rogers is obviously a director with the ability to put all the pieces together. I'm looking forward to his next finished project. K.
