Ross Hunter's 1937 musical remake of fantasy, based on James Hilton's everlasting bestseller, was written off in 1973 by critics and audiences almost immediately. It was a setback against musicals in general that had given the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. A group of disparate British and American individuals land on an escape flight from a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is kidnapped and crashes in a snow-covered mountain area. An ambulance arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and happy. Some of the noble cast's appearances are not so noble (the bubbly mood of the piece, the rousing Burt Bacharach-Hal David tunes, and the easy alignment conspire to make the performers look a little stupid). Peter Finch is the international peacekeeper involved in a somewhat clogged romance with the resident Liv Ullmann. Sally Kellerman is a dissatisfied man who spits out lines like, "I'm sick of taking pictures of people blowing their heads off, so people whose heads are still on - and usually under hairdryers - got a last kick before contact me for the latest recipe "; John Gieguld "as Chang", an Asian who learned English when he was in Oxford, is amused with humor (but why not songs for Chang?). Hal David's dopey lyrics are sometimes stunning ("On the Good Lollipop / How did Christopher Columbus sail / sail across the sea?") And the tempo gets jammed with all the talk about the outside world and how nothing is miserable these days. However, the production is abundant and the general handling seems strange. The two-dimensional characters are so overly serious that they actually become adorable, and the film's stupidity is contagious. It makes a lot of fun in the end. *** from ****
