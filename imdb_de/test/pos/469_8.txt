This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a sixth-sense end (or maybe a surprise for the crying of the game) and the best soundtrack I've probably ever heard ... if all of that makes sense. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds show pretty much that you are choosing a twisted ride. (I was surprised that no one came out right during the Brooklyn premiere.) But from there, the film begins a talk-fest between two really damaged people, Daphne and Buddy. <br /> <br /> They are lonely, confused and boy talking about sex. Daphne brings her most interesting stories of escorting to life, some are quite funny (Mr. Chang), some disturbing (the Harlan scenes with music telling us what we see could now be what's going on or what Daphne really feels ) and because I have a friend who escorted earlier, most of them seem to be quite real. <br /> <br /> You Are Alone is multi-layered and usually brilliant. Okay, maybe a few minutes less, and I do not know we missed anything. <br /> <br /> Then I have to see it again and know the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> (The director has asked people in Brooklyn to write a review to IMDb audiences because many people read them.
