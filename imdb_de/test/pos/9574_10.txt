This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. However, I have laughed at many movies more. Because the brilliance of Best In Show is not in slapstick or Einlinern, but in sophisticated and multi-layered verbal joke. The improvised dialogue is so fast that you do not laugh at every single joke, but only after several jokes build on each other, and you defuse your senses until the joke reaches its peak and you can not let go. <br /> <br /> It's a well-filmed movie, but what makes it extraordinary is acting. I was impressed at first sight, but when I saw it, after learning that virtually every scene is improvised, I was astonished. It was gratifying to see the comedians work against each other, build jokes out of nothing, and immerse themselves in their characters. <br /> <br /> I imagine the golden days of Second City were like this.
