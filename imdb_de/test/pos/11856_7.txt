Demanding sex comedies are always hard to pull through. Take a look at the films of Blake Edwards, who is probably the master of the genre, and you'll find as many misses as hits. If a film of this kind ever fails to work, it can never fall back on the proven toilet humor of a teenage sex comedy (ie, "American Pie") or warm the audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy [by Julia Roberts] It can only last until the end and hope that the audience appreciates the almost necessary irony of its dissolution. <br /> <br /> Written by husband / wife team Wally Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, "See others People "opens with the fianc√©e Ed & Alice [Jay Mohr & Julianne Nicholson] just a few seconds from the stern, and as the frame freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters, and we welcome from now on that the story being unfolded has a point of view of both sexes. <br /> <br /> Two months before her vow, Ed & Alice are already looking like an old couple immerszene show us their actions alone, how well they are together and how long they have been together. So when the line that is supposed to drive the action is pronounced - as expected from the most unlikely of the two - it is as if the relationship itself is demanding a change, even if it means its own destruction. <Br /> Once all the basic rules have been established [Ed can not sleep with her mother or Salma Hayek], the two set out in different directions, hoping to find meaningless sex to cement their relationship. At first everything seems to go as planned, as their daily trysts only help to arouse the passion between them. But as the deeper feelings of regret and jealousy emerge, they predictably fall apart quickly and threaten to disintegrate. All these actions that lead to a solution that you may or may not like - depending on your own cynicism. For such a comedy you need a solid cast whose supportive characters are as strong as the lead. Director Wolodarsky does not disappoint. Here he has two of my favorite actresses as sisters - Julianne Nicholson & Lauren Graham - occupied and lets them play their strengths. For Nicholson, who has always reminded me of a young Shirley MacLaine, she gives Alice a touch of naivety and vulnerability, though her actions seem less. And Graham, an actress who has proven she excels a whole Howard Hawks ensemble, steals every scene she's in with an exciting "no BS" persona. <br /> <br /> As for the boys, Jay Mohr and Josh Charles are ready. Byron Cranston of "Malcolm in the Middle" has to be applauded for taking on a British accent and hanging everything up. But the real treat here is Andy Richter and his plot with single mother, Helen Slater. While his scenes seem almost to be in another film, they are by far the funniest and his late delivery steals the show. <br /> <br /> For independent production, "Seeing Other People" has a more personal and introspective feeling - something you would not notice in a big Hollywood movie of this kind. Not to mention that this movie also has some really funny moments - unlike most Hollywood comedies in general. <br /> <br /> rating [on a 5-star system]: 3 1/2 stars
