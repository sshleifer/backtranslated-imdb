Danny Boyle was not the first person to realize that zombies can run like the bludgers. This honor belongs to Lifeforce, which of course is the biggest naked space vampire zombie from Halley's Comet running amok in a London doomsday amok. Tobe Hooper may have done a lot of crap, but for this insanely epic sci-fi horror, he deserves a place among the immortals. In addition, it offers space vampire Mathilda May, the best that has come since Simone Simon from France and spent the entire movie nude. Which makes her very good. Keep in mind that although she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence ever seen on Earth, she is "totally alien and absolutely dangerous to the planet and our way of life." It was a pitch meeting I would have liked to sit in: British Space Program astronauts find three naked humanoid alien life forms in a huge 150-mile artichoke / umbrella-shaped spaceship hiding in the tail of a giant-filled Halley's comet are dried bats and bring them back to Earth with almost apocalyptic results, drying off the people of London from their vitality, with much nudity, swirling thunder and spitting coffee through the room Direlogue ("I've been in the room for six months, and she looks perfect to me. "" Suppose we do not know anything that underestimates the matter. "" Do not worry, a naked woman will not get out of this complex. "). Oh, and we'll get the authors of Alien and Blue Thunder to write it with uncredited scripts from Mark of the Devil, The Sex Thief and Eskimo Nell and the director of The Jonestown Monster. Sounds like a winner, here are 22 million dollars? have fun. And they do, they do. <br /> <br /> There's plenty of promise in the raw material to make something truly scary and thought-provoking (at a time when AIDS hysteria was approaching its height, a sexually transmitted 'plague' affords ample opportunity for allegory) but in the hands of the Cannon go-go guys, what could have been another quatermass and the pit could quickly become more Plan 10 from space instead. It's full of crazy insanity, be it Frank Finlay's funky death scene ("Here I go!"), Peter Firth's big performance ("I'm Colonel Caine.") "From the SAS?", Michael Gothard calls discretely a room full of reporters: "Gentlemen, this last comment was not for publication, this is a D-Notice situation," replies the surprisingly accommodating press people. The guards offer Mathilda May's nude space vampire a nice cookie to stop her escape. Revived corpses that exploded into dust in everyone, the sweaty Prime Minister took his secretary's life, and London filled with zombie nuns and stockbrokers and joggers and went on a rampage. And that does not mention "This woman is a masochist! An extreme masochist!" Scene or the great stereophonic echoing effect on the male vampire: "It's less scary if you just come to me," while a lead stake with Peter Firth takes on his best Action Man voice to answer that! "Alone in one Scene you have an obsessed Patrick Stewart personifying the woman in our deeply confused astronaut hero, Steve "I've never seen - Charlie-Manson" Railsback and his amazing, dancing eyebrows in full on "Helta- Skelta! "The inimitable Aubrey Morris (the only man who restrains Freddie Jones) who refuses to kiss him, plays Interior Minister Sir Percy Heseltine as some kind of crazy Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of the actors who always looks ) as if he must have been a doctor who hammered the blase macho of the public school in the hope that no one would ever see it and John Hallam's incomparable reactionary shots as male nurse opens the door in the middle of the psychic tornado to inject more drugs, as if they needed more in this movie, it's just a shame that Frank Finlay's insane scientist, unable to do so, destroys death on alien life forms (a role that was originally intended for Klaus Kinski) to testify, the action in this case has failed. <br /> <br /> No Ega l, how crazy you think the movie is, it gets even crazier, whether it's a zombie pathologist ("He also needs to be fed") that explodes everywhere in the home secretary's suit, Patrick Stewart's blood and guts, the one Forming Naked Mathilda May The Space Vampires make St. Paul's Cathedral the world's largest laser show to transport human souls from the London Underground to their geostationary mothership. I loved every wonderfully crazy moment. In its own way, this may be the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> The DVD features the original 116-minute version, which opened in the UK instead of the heavily edited 101-minute version in the US, which not only offers you much more fun for your buck, but brings Henry Mancini's score back to its original glory (the US version uncovered many gaps with additional clues from Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). Although Mancini is a somewhat surprising choice at first glance, he has cracked many of the classic 1950s universal sci-fi horror, and his score is magnificent, with a grandiose moving main title that has a rare reminder of how interesting he could be away from Blake Edwards. Unfortunately, there is nothing more than a trailer on extras, but it would be nice to one day hope for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from Hooper's originally intended 128-minute cut: of what is shown here, they could only offer even more comedy gold!
