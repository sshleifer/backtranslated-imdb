I have no words to really describe this series. <br /> <br /> The premise behind this concept (an extremely hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality who in the end swirls a team of strange bullets into her own portrayal of the world, which was a creation of Haruhi as she did A world of aliens, eskers, and time travelers is a breath of fresh air in a world marked by repetitive anime series and non-innovative TV shows. Characters are well-developed, and one will love them in the end, some less The word for describing the animation job does not exist because "excellent" would really be too short to describe how it was done, there are many funny situations that either make you smile or take you deep into thoughts Do not fall for the impression of the first episode, as this is just the tip of the iceberg, as the novels will come. <br /> <br /> The only problem is d he missing chronological order in the episodes, but you can solve the problem, no? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Without question one of the best series of 2006.
