Flipper is a nice heartwarming movie for the whole family. It's obviously not a great movie. Free Willy looks much better in every component of filmmaking. It may be a bit na√Øve at times, and the writing and script are not the best part of the movie, but it's an entertaining movie with very good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral messages. Elijah Wood once again proves to be an incredibly talented and underrated actor. He can make a bad movie, a good movie - well, good - great and great movie becomes a classic. The performance of Paul Hogan was also very good and fits in perfectly with his role. As I said above, all the cinematography was very good. But underwater shots are definitely the best parts. Pinball is the perfect way to see a nice, sweet and entertaining movie. If you want me to get tired of the modern Hollywood trash, full of sex, violence, vulgarity and obscenity, then you would most likely like this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7.7 out of 10.
