This film is a benchmark in non-mainstream cinema history. The use of montage represents a quantum leap over Strike's relatively straightforward juxtapositions (Eisenstein's 1st film). Take the scene on the steps and watch the soldiers' repeated attitude to repeat the point of the horrors that actually happened! A highly intelligent monumental film, a must for all film students!
