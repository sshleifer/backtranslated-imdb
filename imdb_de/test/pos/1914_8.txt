Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Playing Rudy Ray Moore as a pimp superhero on the wrong side, challenging the MAN on the way. He has two enemies, the good Willie Green and the grubby mayor. Watch as Dolemite is kicked, beaten, beaten and pimped across the screen. What's that man's name? Dolemite! <br /> <br /> Interesting film that has paved the way for a generation of rapper and performer. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made some of the cheap movies in the 1970s. In-house produced and marketed, he addressed a particular audience. Some people call it blacksploitation, others call it garbage, I call it entertaining. Dolemite was followed by the semi-sequel The Human Tornado and a direct video Return of Dolemite 25 years later. <br /> <br /> Footnotes: If the movie was properly matted on video, you would not see the boom microphones. Dolemite was cut to get an R rating.
