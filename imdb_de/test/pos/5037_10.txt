John Travolta was awarded "Michael" in the film of the same name. I do not believe that a better presentation would have been possible. The movie was funny and touching. Michael is a very "human angel" (if its like that). Andie MacDowell excels in her role as a reporter, moving from unbelief to belief. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are great reporters, all out to prove the joke of the angel on earth. Each of the minor cast members is wonderful, especially the older woman (I do not know her name), who plays Michael's mother! One of the cutest movies I've seen in years ... I could watch this movie dozens of times!
