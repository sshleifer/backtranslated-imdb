I had the pleasure of seeing these two chairs by (one of?) The Executive Producer at the Atlantic Film Festival, which was interesting because he laughed at other times than the rest of us. <br /> <br /> Filmed In Atlantic Canada, the film is about three teenage girls who, in one of their last summers in their teens, spend a lot of energy sleeping with a married 30-year-old man despite much protest , <br /> <It's definitely worth a watch, but the humor was geared toward a completely different demographic than the one I inhabit (male 18-25), so I shook my head about the figure's antics instead of laughing , Still, history is strong enough to entertain yourself without laughing so much.
