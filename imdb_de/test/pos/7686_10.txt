This film is one of the few historical documents that shows the talents of so many black singers, actors, actresses and dancers. Many who are no longer with us. Those we can enjoy today in 1999 let us recognize the talents that existed then. Therefore, the individuals still alive today are also superstars. Due to the history of education in music, drama, film, design, singing, etc., this film belongs to the people of this country alone. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie recently. The sound was excellent! The movie seemed complete, color and clarity were good, but good, considering how old this movie is without having to fix frames. I agree with all previous positive reviews. I have no negative views. <br /> <br /> I just want to make an inquiry. Please, whom it matters, please make this movie available so that all of you can have this historical experience.
