The creative team that brought us Police Squad - and the resulting Naked Gun - said in an interview that their network contact told them that the show would be canceled after the first episode. Basically, the show was given no chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently told the team that the problem of the show was that the viewer would actually have to watch the show to be funny. Most broadcasts are shown on television, with the understanding that the viewer had to get up and miss a few minutes if he got something to eat or went to the bathroom. <br /> <br /> The humor of the show is extremely dry (it does not use a laugh track), and the universe in which the characters live is one in which anything can happen, regardless of logic, as long as it does absolutely incredible; For example, in one episode, a surgeon must bribe an informant on the street to get a hint on heart surgery. <br /> <br /> Those who are familiar with the Naked Gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting arguments between the show and the films. In the films Nielsen developed a special "take" approach, d. H. The eyes widened when confronted with the unexpected. This does not happen on the show where Nielsen's Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - nothing is unexpected to him. There are also no romances on the show and no parodies of MTV. After all, the show takes on certain risks that the movies avoid. In the first episode, Drebin shoots a group of homicide detectives from different angles to "play the crime" - ballistics the hard way. This is actually a risky piece of humor, because we have to accept that it is perfectly normal for police officers to kill each other while investigating a crime, for no other reason than experimenting. This rarely happens in the movies. <br /> <br /> Each episode, when viewed individually, is funnier than the Naked Gun movies, as both are more compact (more happening in a shorter time -frame), even quieter (there's no rush to a punch line as sometimes happens in the movies). There are some inconsistencies in the movies (mostly "2" and "3") that never occur in the shorter timeframe of the show. Of course, there is no doubt that Naked Gun (the first) movie) is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema. And if you watch episode by episode in a single session, the dry quality of humor may diminish the tolerance. <br /> <br /> Still, it would be useful to have a DVD of it, and watch an episode a day for a few weeks - If laughter, as some argue, has medicinal value, the reputation of this show is good for the health.
