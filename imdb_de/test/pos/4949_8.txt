Iron Eagle may not be the most credible movie, but the characters are well written and very well played. If you can not believe the characters, the movie is a flop. <br /> <br /> I think that photography, especially aerial photography, is outstanding. I think it is far superior to Top Gun, to which it is compared endlessly. It's one of the best aerial photos I've ever seen. The soundtrack of Basil Paledouros (forgive the spelling) is great and goes well with the rock tunes. I wish that part of the soundtrack would be available. <br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick is good as a teenager, who suddenly has to grow up in a hurry and with the realities of life, death and responsibility. Lou Gossett is fabulous as Chappy, both hard-nosed and human, remembering the deaths of pilots. Then there are the movies that inspire you for one or the other aspect and you can see it again and again! Iron Eagle is that kind of movie!
