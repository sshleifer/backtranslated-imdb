"Five Fingers of Death" started the American kung-fu film madness, but I remember seeing him for the first time as a "King Boxer" in Chinatown, NYC, without the bad synchronizations and the few Americans. I was also fortunate enough to see the American premiere of "Five Fingers Of Death" in Times Square, New York. What was that contrast ... the same movie, but a different audience. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown, this movie got a more serious tone for the viewers. It was because of the correct voices of the actors (in Chinese) that made this film more credible. Chinatown's cinemas have shown violent kung fu films for years (1972's "Boxer From Shantung" beat them all in Gore), so action choreography and story were the main attraction. Competing school properties were not yet overloaded, so the plot appeared fresh. Every great kung fu movie had wonderful, insidious villains you wanted to see, and FFoD had them too. The star, Lieh Lo, was a well-known actor in Chinese theaters. The mainly Chinese audience really enjoyed this movie. The enthusiasm of the audience when leaving this film is the last satisfaction for me. <br /> <br /> In Times Square, this movie was an action comedy ... probably unintentional. I liked it here, too, but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the beginning, the movie made you laugh. As soon as the audience heard these strange British accents from these Chinese actors, the movie became a violent and bloody cartoon. Most American viewers saw this kind of blood in a horror movie, not an action movie. The action sequences blew the audience away. Unfortunately, the movie studios saw that they liked it so much that bad synchronization and unnecessary violence became a kung-fu-flick formula. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching this movie with an American audience, but it was a lot more fun Chinatown Some films can pass the test of time, but not the dubbed version of FFoD. The original "King Boxer" is still fun ... a CLASSIC!
