So you want to be a rock star? Watch this movie. You do not like rock, you say? Or are you really into Heavy Metal? Then create your favorite album and dream of this movie has nothing to offer. Rarely have I ever seen a movie that can portray the dream of a rock band so well. I had long hair in the late eighties and early nineties, and I've been playing the guitar for the past 15 years. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yeah. The music is good, not great, the actors are good and believable, even Jennifer Aniston plays her part perfectly. And Mark Wahlberg is perfect as a wannabe rock singer. So you know what you will get. A movie about dreams that come true, are kicked and finally find out what life is all about. It's a good, solid seven out of ten, nothing more, nothing less.
