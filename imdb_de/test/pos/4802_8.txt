You know, I've seen a lot of crappy Hong Kong movies and have been good. But running out of the age was great. <br /> <br /> I think what made it so good was the fact that Andy Lau and Ching Wang have such great chemistry. The movie is very fast at first, but does not slow down enough to notice, which is good. We do not want a heart attack, lol. As far as the plot is concerned, her other aspect is enough to interest you. Lau has some pretty good moments as he uses make-up to personify people from the underworld. The film also has the best oriental cast since the House of Flying Daggers. <br /> <br /> The movie is great because it's so unpredictable and it wonders on every corner. Definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and thrills at one in 8 out of 10
