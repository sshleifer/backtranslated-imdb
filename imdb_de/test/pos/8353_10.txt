I thought that this is a wonderfully written movie. I love the little scamp and the angel of the road. This movie is very easy to understand for small children, but also a good movie for adults. I liked this movie because it continues the original lady and tramp and this movie is a classic. Lady and the Tramp 2 Scamp's Adventure was full of new characters, catchy songs, brilliant animations and memorable classic characters. I loved the movie since I saw it for the first time. I also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character. It also shows the disadvantages and good things to find new friends to meet. My favorite song in the movie was Always There, because it showed the different characters how they express their feelings. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who was a fan of the original lady and tramp.
