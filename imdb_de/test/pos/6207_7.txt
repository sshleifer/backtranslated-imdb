Despite later allegations, this early talkie melodrama has little in common with "Citizen Kane": it is a biography of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat who is recounted in retrospect but jumps around in time. Screenwriter Preston Sturges shows nothing of his later talent for sparkling dialogues, and none of Kane's innumerable cinematic innovations is obvious. Still, it's very good to see a young Spencer Tracy (he looks like an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore - a bit over her best and not physically well matched - a multi-faceted woman behind Man play. There is also Helen Vinson as one of the most insidious femmes in film history, putting the last third into ecstatic soap opera reverberation. The surviving copy is erratic and there are no audio clips, and there are still some holes left (how is she supposed to know whose son was sleeping with them?), And the music is awfully hokey. Nevertheless, I was fascinated.
