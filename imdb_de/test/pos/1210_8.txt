This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that I believe will not be achieved today. The colorful characters - in their stereotypical garb - have given a certain charm to the show, which has been raped and overexposed by society. Wrestling was innocent at the time. A kid could watch it without watching an episode of Jerry Springer. <br /> <br /> Looking back now (I was 5 at the time), though I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed Warrior for its more. Mystique Hogan was the brand hero who made an impressive image of himself Produced public. The ultimate warrior, on the other hand, was a masked man with few words - a limelight hero for another audience. <br /> <br /> This rivalry was therefore so exciting as a child duality in me for every fighter. I had a place for both. Since blood was shed in this long, heavy fight, the stakes were high - at least for me as a child. Similarly, because of Hogan's defeat, it made him more human - I remember he somehow regretted it. <br /> <br /> All the emotions that play in the soap opera of a young man made Wrestlemania VI such a great time to experience this game.
