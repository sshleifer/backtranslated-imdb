I saw this movie many years ago, tried to find it, but understandably it's nowhere to be found. It was so esoteric and yet one of a few films that stay with you for a long time. I'm still not sure what the reality of the movie is, and maybe, just like the blur principle, darkness is the final thing. The spectacle is great, the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of foreboding, a general melancholy permeates it, yet it's hard not to get into history. I rented it and thought it was science fiction (it was in the sci-fi department with some misleading clattering), but obviously it is not. Or horror or even tension. In fact, one is grateful that the director has taken the courage to shoot a film like this, for which there is obviously no solid audience. I know that some people have complained about Klaus Kinski's short role, but I think this is very fitting - his limited presence is crucial to the genesis of the film's mystery.
