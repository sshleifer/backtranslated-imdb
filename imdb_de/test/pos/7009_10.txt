I'm 15, usually no kids my age, who usually see these old classic movies. But that's one of my favorites. I was totally addicted to the first time. It's really good to think about technology and movies at this time, music is great, action ok, choreography is great, you have to see. I do not know why there is a prequel for this movie. Not many people like this movie, but I love classic love movies, they are so much better than movies now! This movie makes you smile, cry and dance. The music is absolutely catchy and beautiful. I have not seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (Prequel), Prequel should have the star actors, that's what I hate about prequels, they destroy the original. Nobody wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many will agree that the original, the sequel and the third film are sufficient for a film. In addition, people will not bother to see it. Who remembers the film about St. Benard Beethoven? I think there are a total of 5 films.
