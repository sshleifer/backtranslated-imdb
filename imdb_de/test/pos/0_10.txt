I saw and saw this movie last night after being forced by some friends. I admit I hated to see that because after all I knew from Ashton Kutcher, he could only make comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can play with our emotions. He did just that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overwhelmed by laughter in the first half of the film and moved to tears in the second half. When I left the theater, I not only saw many women in tears, but also many grown-up men desperately trying to see no one cry. This movie was great and I suggest you see it before you judge.
