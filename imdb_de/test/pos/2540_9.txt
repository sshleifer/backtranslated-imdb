In his descriptions of CAA, platinum card lunch in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in Provincetown he never did, and free travel to Nicaragua financed with Columbia imagery, he tears the audience away because of his unusual personality, laugh at himself (maybe because he did not take the Hollywood thing so seriously) and get us to take care of it. <br /> <br /> This monologue is not just about "the killing fields" or "swimming to Cambodia"; it's more like a pastiche of events as he sees them. Some of the lines are classic, as when Gray meets the valued Talent Agents at CAA. The conference table is ...

Many of us will miss his out of balance humor. 10.9.
