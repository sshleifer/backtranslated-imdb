Many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, but sometimes comes a movie that is honest, fun, entertaining and memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has survived the time mixing all four ingredients. This film follows three friends (Gary, Rick and David "The Big Apple") into the world of first-time sex and true love. Along the way, they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow the hopeless romantic Gary (the main character) on his quest to win the girl of his dreams for himself, leading him on an uncertain path with a startling twist at the end. If you have not seen this movie, be sure to take a look ... with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at a steady pace. L.A.V. is really an original movie, a rarity among films of its genre.
