Bridgette Bardot looks as sexy as ever and plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a French ambassador. She has one of her father's best adviser (Womanizer MICHEL) marry her, and it turns out that it's best for both of them. Michel soon flirts with his old girlfriends. To teach him a lesson, Bridgette flirts violently with a married PRINCE CHARLES. Michel is surprised by his jealousy. This is followed by a cat-and-mouse game between Brigdette and Michel ("I have an affair" ... "No, you will not" ...). Finally, Michel realizes she only makes and vows to give up all the other ladies in his life. Bridgette and Michel are content in their happy lives, while Prince Charles returns to England. <br /> <br /> It's a light piece, but incredibly charming. While some may find it a product of his time, I found that absolutely enjoyable. Worth a rental
