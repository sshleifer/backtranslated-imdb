The key message - one Miller would surely have intended after the war crimes trials against Vichy - is that hatred of someone without a rational foundation is a waste of life. Fred, the character of Meat Loaf, has known Lawrence for many years, and when the time comes, he lets them attack a man who is not their "target audience" on the orders of his fanatical supporters. For me, this is the crucial message - it does not matter what Lawrence and his wife do from then on - they are labeled and have the chance to save themselves by reason. The aggression and anger of the animals blinded the criminals of Fred's Union to reality. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine suggested that I visit "The Wave" to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them realizing it. I did a role-playing experiment once and was shocked to see ordinary and thoughtful people welcoming the creation of an oppressive police state - which would end up threatening everyone - because it was gradually falling asleep. <BR /> <br /> Fred is the beginning, his friends in LA and his preacher idol are the catalyst that pushes his neighbors over the brink of violence, without thinking that what they are doing is wrong , <br /> <br /> The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein is intriguing to the Jewish shopkeeper, as Lawrence misses the point almost to the end: When the Biggest Finkelstein squeeze out, where should he go? If his family fled from the Nazis, what an irony, to be tormented again in the land of "freedom". <br /> <br /> This great poster (it's a pretty famous propaganda article) about American families enjoying the highest standard. Life in the world is a very important detail. If you watch this movie, pay attention to the graffiti in the subway and to all the little posters. The embassy is also lurking there. <br /> <br /> This film should be on the curriculum in every school, especially in our time, when baseless hatred of "reasonable" people, who in thin costumes are just extremists, becomes so prevalent.
