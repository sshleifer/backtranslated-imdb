Renee Zellweger is a housewife from Kansas whose dominant husband is mistaken in drug trafficking. Two professional batsmen - Morgan Freeman and his son Chris Rock - murder the husband in his dining room. Zellweger, unseen by the killers, experiences this and experiences a dissociative reaction by adopting the personality of a nurse - the eponymous Betty - who is a character in her favorite soap opera. Zellweger believes he is the TV character and drives off in the car of her husband, who has a load of dope in the trunk, and travels to LA, where she hopes to catch up with another character in this thoughtless afternoon drama, dr. "Greg Kinnear, unaware that she is being followed by the two hitters, drives her to LA, where she joins Kinnear and is actually written in the series as a nurse named Betty, a handful of men who know each other, including also the local sheriff, catching up on what's happening and also looking for Zellweger in LA The end is believable and poignant. <br /> <br /> If that sounds crazy, it's because it's so, and it's the responsibility of the Writer, John C. Richards The odd thing is that Richards and the director, Neil Labute, are doing a lot of good work with the actors, this is not an action that was cast in a known form, no, I give bonus points for Someone got the chance somebody took the chance of a film that was NOT a copy or a remake of something that had made money ten or fifty years ago Every night, people who are divided are kneeling and praying eagerly. I do not know if the movie was remunerated, but it is mostly successful from an aesthetic point of view. <br /> <br /> This could be called an "Initial Premise" movie. They begin with a single transformative event, in this case the murder of Zellweger's husband and the acceptance of a truly new personality, and follow the logical paths realistically. "Groundhog Day" is another, better and more complex example. "Nurse Betty" has its logical cracks, in which the incidents give up their plausibility. At a party in LA Zellweger finally meets Kinnear, the man who plays her ex-fiancé on TV. She is stunned (because she finally considers herself to be Betty, who has long since lost her fiancé). She speaks to Kinnear and some of his colleagues and introduces herself as "Nurse Betty," the character. She speaks to Kinnear with the name of his television character "David Ravell". Confused at first, the group convinces itself that it is an up-and-coming actress who insists on staying "in character" during the conversation - and also after Kinnear gets bored with her and the others. Kinnear drives home and even if she kisses him for a good night, she is still in her character and leaves Kinnear amazed at the relentless way she captures Betty's character. The next day Kinnear returns her love. This development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear at this point, is a crack in logic, the kind missing on Groundhog Day. At the end of Night One, Kinnear, like any other person, would realize that Zellweger is a couple of clowns under the circus. The rest of the film, which contains many digressions, succeeds beyond expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his impudent, nihilistic son is beautifully described. Morgan is flawless in his despair. He manages to fall in love with Zellweger's image by finding clues about where he lives and what he's doing, and in the end he can not bring himself to shoot her. She's too cute to shoot. After her transformation into Betty, she left a note in Kansas. "I want to help the whole life, be it animal, plant or mineral." Who could harm the author of such an absurd conative statement? His admiration for her comes like an epiphany as he stands near one of the headlights on the edge of the Grand Canyon. Zellweger, dressed as Dorothy or maybe the good witch of the East - well, characters that are like Zellweger from Kansas - appear to Freeman and he hugs her and kisses her tenderly. It is a scene that is both scary, romantic and a bit scary at the same time. Once I stood by one of these lights and tossed some shredded paper into the upwind of the dark ravine and found myself surrounded by a thousand whirling bats that had mistaken the fluttering rags for moths. Where was I? OK. I tried not to leave the place. The achievement of Zellweger deserves praise. Everything she does, every movement, every utterance, is naive and timid. She is really a sympathetic character - despite the fact that she is not a glamor girl for Hollywood standards. But - what an actress. Compare her performance as a 19th century bumptious hick in "Cold Mountain." Only the opposite. Everyone has something to do in this entertaining movie. Allyson Jannings does a good job in a minor role. Watch her as she tells Greg Kinnear that she is considering killing his character in the soap opera during a drowning accident. Kinnear is one of the narcissists wearing the kind of ten-thousand-dollar skinny black leather jackets that were popular back then. He chuckles and says, "Oh, one of those crazy deals, right? Okay, how do I get back?" Jannings does not answer. She only smiles at him with those huge blue eyes and mocks her head mockingly. <br /> <br /> No masterpiece of filmmaking, but a good, original and professional work of all involved.
