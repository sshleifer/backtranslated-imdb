Everyone agrees on the technical excellence of this film by Jutra (whose life ended so tragically). In terms of content, of course, it makes a difference if you are a Quebecker, and this explains some of the different opinions. For me, it's the cinema that Vignault's "Mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays" has to sing. In addition, Jean Duceppe himself was part of the legendary Quebec. <br /> <br /> This movie can be likened to "CRAZY", a recent release in Quebec that is successful enough to be shown here in Spain 1960s. Urban Quebec (crazy) vs. rural Quebec (Antoine). But also a film that has to be something completely different for foreigners and people who know Quebec from the inside.
