It is interesting to see how the society of the late fifties is portrayed in this film. Men are horny, chain-smoking drunkards with one thing in their heads (time has not changed men so much, but "sexual harassment") and women are only at work until they find and settle down with a husband. Some of the dialogues are frightening, but in an innocent, pass√©-kind charming. I love the opening credits, which show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan singing Johnny Mathi's "The Best Of Everything" on the soundtrack. I would like to jump directly into some scenes that were shot in the streets of N.Y., circa 1959, and experienced a time that I only saw in film and in photographs. Some scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffith's "Working Girl". Especially when Hope Lange (who's a mix of Grace Kelly and Dolores Hart) is bombed in the apartment of handsome Stephen Boyd). Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to Sigourney Weaver's terrible female boss except that she was outwardly indecent (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was sweet on the outside and horrible on the inside. I found it disturbing how the Suzy Parker character (Gregg), an independent woman with career goals, began to become an actress who reportedly did not need a husband to complete it. She becomes the Stalker / Crazy / Nut job when she lets the man she loves drive her bananas after he finishes with her. I loved the character Mary Agnes, the office gossip, with her thick New Yawk accent. If you like movies like "Valley Of The Dolls", you'll love it too.
