John Travolta continued his comeback, playing a slightly twisted angel in Michael. He may be an ambassador of God, but he is not the nicest guy, according to reporters Andie MacDowell and William Hurt. When I saw this movie for the first time, I saw "All in the Family," so I did not recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I recognize her, I try to imagine Archie picking her up because she's harboring an angel (which he would probably order next to blacks, Jews, etc.). I know, that does not really relate to the movie. But I just like connecting things that way. Anyway, it's a pretty interesting movie. Also with Bob Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. <br /> <br /> What John and Paul said ...
