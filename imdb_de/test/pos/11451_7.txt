It's the old, old story: children celebrate a party in an old house, demons are unleashed, death and casual nudity follow. You all know it, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Many people (okay, a lot of horror fans, to be exact) have fond memories of this movie and it's always with a slight shiver that you visit an old movie again to watch movie whether it is still as good as you thought it would be. Luckily, this is here. <br /> <br /> There's something for everyone (well, anyone who happens to be male, I suppose). From a funny title sequence to a shoplifter scam, where clever use of Linnea Quigley's ass, the "mirror" scene, and demonic fun is accomplished, this is a huge hit from start to finish. The girls are cute the guys are. , , , Men do the death scenes well with some good gore effects, and unlike some horrors from that time, this actually preserves a good sense of atmosphere and even tension. Do not get me wrong, it's still fun, but it does offer some nice, crazy moments that most genre fans should like.
