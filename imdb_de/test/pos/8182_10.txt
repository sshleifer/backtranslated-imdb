The film invites comparisons with Shakespeare. The Mandarin is beautifully written and spoken, and the plot is intricate and intriguing. Gong Li has never looked better, never has the glamor of China been better on screen. The balance between political unrest and personal intrigue that Gladiator has hinted at but never really delivered is eclipsed here. Just unbelievable
