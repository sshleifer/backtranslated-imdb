It's a damn good movie with surprising twists, a good cast and a great script. Just a few stupid pieces, like the Rasta Hit Man scene (this guy is a pro?), But that has already been commented on. The fact that I had only heard one guy at work, and did not have many opinions or critiques that got me any further, made it even more entertaining. This gets a higher score than some people think it deserves, but I have to consider the low budget and the good effort of the cast. It makes me sick that some movies are made whose budget equals the GDP of a small country, with a well-publicized release, good reviews, an Oscar-winning director and / or actors, and prove so disappointing that the actors cast their roles step through and uninspired directing, with predictable plotting lines and a story with holes so big that Sandra Bullock could drive through a bomb-laden bus. (Examples are, in my opinion, The Terminal, Castaway, Matrix: Revolutions) Additional points are given to the wardrobe department, which decides to fill big clothes, especially Paulina Porizcova, who wears a rubber dress in one scene, and a jacket with "c * ". nt "on the back in big letters in another! A sex scene that shows her tight ass and a good soundtrack are bonuses! And PLEASE, enough with the Tarantino comparisons, that did not remind me at all of a Tarantino movie. .. and Tarantino borrows virtually every idea he ever had from other films! Even if that's your opinion, say, if a particular movie or book is once written or directed in a certain way, no one can use the same idea again become real This movie has its own style.
