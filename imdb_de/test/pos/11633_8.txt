I do not understand why everyone hates Barney. If you hate the show so much, DO NOT WATCH IT! It is stupid how everyone changes the son "I love you" in "I hate you". If you do not like it, fine. Anyway, that's your opinion. There is no point in humiliating the show, if not so bad. OK, it's stupid and yes, it has its shortcomings, but it's a kids show. Children do not want to be sad and miserable, they want to be happy. And Barney helps. And even on the show there are moments of sadness and anger and so on. And yes, Barney uses magic. But the kids look at Barney as fancy. Children need a place to escape to express themselves. The world is a miserable and hard place. We all need a place to express ourselves and be happier. Barney does that to us. This show is great. I saw Barney when I was younger. Yes, some people think it's stupid. But I have seen it and am at the top in my class. It does not necessarily make you any smarter, but that's not the point. I believe that Barney's purpose is to create a place where children can be children and the spirit of childhood can be expressed. Where the imagination lives on. So many teenagers are now uninspired and afraid to express themselves. Barney helps to encourage that. Barney helped me not to be scared and just show me who I am. I am now in my second year of high school, an AP student with a 4.0, a drama student with a love of theater and art, and a new cousin who loves Barney. I watch it with him, enjoy it and sing along. Yeah, it's stupid and stupid and whatever, but it's great for kids. Who wants to be an adult who does not have time to have fun? I am a child at heart and I love Barney. It's great for kids and those who are a kid at heart. <br /> <br /> It's a great show for babies and toddlers. So stop hating. Say you do not like it, but stop it with the "Dumbest Show Ever" or "Barneys a load of bulls" or whatever. Keep it to yourself. Take a pill or whatever. Here's something: I never liked Sesame Street. But you do not see me go "Grover is a load of bull" or "Cookie Monster should die" or whatever. I hate all BULLSS ** T people tell about books or movies like Barney or Twilight. If you hate it, OK, whatever. Nobody cares. Do not say hate, because you could offend someone.
