I loved it. I had just gone through half of "The Glass House" (turned off ... god, what a mess of predictable conspiracy and bad drama) and then I saw this movie. I thought it was great. Loved both Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster. I liked the escapism of the whole environment, traveling in Europe in the 60s - but they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all the bad things that could happen. It kept my attention completely, even though I thought parts were unbelievable.
