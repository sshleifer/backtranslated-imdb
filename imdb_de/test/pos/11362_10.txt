Anyone who enjoyed the series on first broadcast (I came home from school to see them) is now at a certain age, so I can only add my comments to those who ask for a DVD release so that those of us can relive the memories of the first transmission before it just becomes a piece of unforgotten televisual history. If so many old TV series from the sixties and seventies can be released, why not? Certainly, the rights release can not be that difficult. Most of the Shakespearean lines I can quote are from this iconic series, and I remember sharing them with my classmates as we tried to transcend the other's memories of the text. Peter Dews rightly earned the merit of having the foresight to bring her to the screen. This was certainly a public broadcasting at its best. Robert Hardy and Sean Connery fight to the death - it's exciting and from the beginning of the golden age of BBC Television. Come on BBC. Delete it and license it please. March 2009 Finally the DVD is here and congratulations to all who made it. The picture quality is remarkably good and the performances are as good as the memory. Now, all who crave, have to buy it and relive those magical moments. British spectators. Since the series was produced in the UK by the BBC with British actors, it is strange that the DVD release is not available on DVD of Region 2 (Europe) and can only be imported from the US and played on modified players. It is unlikely that there are major rights issues. Maybe the market was perceived as too small. Why was not the market then called "Region Free?" Approved? so everyone could enjoy it?
