I'm not a fan of musicals, but I'm a big fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised even if I expected greatness from the classic director. This movie is beautiful. The shots are like moving oil paintings, for which many directors strive for Renoir MASTERS. I can not say how much this movie goes beyond itself ... it's not really a musical, it just has a few well-placed music numbers and a big dance finale. But there is something about this movie that makes you feel absolutely happy when you look at it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of foreign art films, but I'm also a hybrid who likes things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger movies. I'm very easily turned down by things that are too happy or "la la land", but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is simply irresistible - not to mention that every frame is beautiful and the plot is good. 10 out of 10.
