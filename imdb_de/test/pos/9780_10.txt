After a great-grandfather was captured during the Second World War and sent to Changi, I was reluctant to see this when first shown on television. My great-grandfather kept a journal when he was in prison, and when he died there, he was repurchased by his cronies, and I was fortunate enough to have read it, and felt like Changi at least knew it first hand was. <br /> This is a fantastic recount of what happened to these poor guys who were sent to Changi Prison, and shows how hard and cruel they were to protect their land. It's a great story of camaraderie, commitment and Aussie spirit that will never give up. It's worth watching if you like Australian history or something about World War II. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this Mini and give 10 out of 10 points.
