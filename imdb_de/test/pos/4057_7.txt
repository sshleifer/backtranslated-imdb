It's showtime! Showtime is simply a hit in Eddie Murphy's and Robert DeNiro's career. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure, but not quite on the level of the actors, especially not Robert. Showtime is led by Tom Dey and includes some minor roles from men like William Shatner and Mos Def. <br /> <br /> Showtime is about two very different bulls, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). Some take work in an unobtrusive, quiet way, while the other is more relaxed and more fun than offenders in their backseat. They are both behind the same offenders behind a vast fleet of televisions, video recorders, etc. They are crossing each other and a TV station wants a new reality TV show so they can fight the crime while they are on TV. Mitch hates the ad, while Trey says it with his line "It's Showtime!" Loves. Their TV tricks and methods are shown on television and are the new "Cops" show. The fun begins. <br /> <br /> All in all, Showtime is a fun action comedy. A good movie, but not quite the expectations and standards of the actors. However, it rolls along as it runs and parodies reality TV shows. A good break from shows like cops. Really only a guilty pleasure in the end. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
