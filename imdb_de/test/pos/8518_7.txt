1983 was "the battle of bonds". This year, Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate James Bond films, the first (Octopussy) was produced by the "official" creators of Bond films, while the later (Never Say Never Again) was produced by a group. " Produced by Kevin McClory, who held the film rights to Thunderball. Surprisingly, the "unofficial" movie is better, despite the obvious flaw and the fact that "Never Say Never Again" is a remake of Thunderball. "Never Say Never Again" has the distinction of the Sports Best Casts ever compiled for a Bond movie. It all started with Sean Connery, who returned for the first time since 1971 to Diamonds Are Forever Bond piece. Connery could be older than he was then, but he looks better here than in Diamonds Are Forever. The band of Never Say Never Again is the slender and dangerous shark of Dr. Ing. No or From Russia With Love, just a few years older. Connery's delivery of a liner and dialogue is as it has always been. The only downside of Connery's age is his credibility, especially when it comes to the ladies of the film. Let's face it, even if Connery is in peak physical condition, Moore looks so strange when he bets women at half his age. Despite this credibility problem, Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his better Bond performances and a significant improvement over his two previous Bond performances. <br /> <br /> Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early movie roles. Bassinger plays the part with a lot of confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable. Bassinger asserts himself against their co-stars and also has considerable chemistry. In fact, she can outshine her Thunderball counterpart played by Claudine Auger. <br /> <br /> Then there is the villain Maximilian Largo, played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer's Largo is everything a James Bond movie villain should be: polite, charming, evil and above all credible. Brandauer realizes the role and chooses not to fall into the trap that many other Bond villains ran into when exaggerated. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent threat and charisma that was not seen in many opponents of 007. <br /> <br /> The outstanding cast also reaches into the minor cast. Barbara Carrera makes a good henchman in Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when she appears. Max von Sydow makes a nice appearance as Blofeld, although his appearance is more like a cameo. Rowan Atkinson acts as Bond contact, representing some of the best scenes of the film. The highlight of the understudy is the MI6 staff by Edward Fox's M, which contrasts sharply with Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem, who makes Moneypenny affine and starring Alec McCowen's wonderful Q-dot on the cake, but has a few dropouts in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihy as Jack Petachi, both of whom appear to be credible in their respective roles. Otherwise, this film contains one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to a great cast, the film also contains some other important ingredients. From the opening sequence in Central America to the fight in Shrublands, to underwater scenes and motorcycle chases, this is a movie in which the action sequences are not only great, but above all serve the plot. The movie also shows some good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions and everything we expect from a Bond movie. Irvin Kershner, not back then at The Empire Strikes Back, brings the film in a strict direction, especially in sequences such as the station of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles. <br /> <br /> Still this movie is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is one of the most obsolete Bond films due to its intensive use of computer-linked video games from the 1980s. Although the technology comes from some movie at some point in the future, the film relies heavily on him, especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the sequence of domination that makes the film incredibly dated a quarter century after its release. The script also tends to suffer from predictability because it is a remake of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the script for Never Say Never Again is pretty good. The script has good dialogue scenes, not just a single awful turn (how many of the writings of the Roger Moore era can you say that?), Some humorous situations, and yet it's mostly observable and tense. If you look at the fact that it's a remake, there are a lot of good things in the film's script. <br /> <br /> Music is indeed the film's biggest weakness. Due to the "unofficial" status of the movie, the James Bond theme could not be used. But that would have shown, with the right composer, that a Bond score could work without them. Unfortunately, the result of Michael Legrand is far from sufficient. Legrand's score is completely wrong in a Bond film and there are only one or two places where it actually works. To make matters worse, the film is also burdened with one of the worst title sequences ever seen in a James Bond movie. Despite strongly outdated, somewhat predictable and poorly predictable reviews, Never Say Never Again is one of the toughest results still a good bond movie. With one of the best casts of a Bond movie, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction and some great dialogue, this film proves that "unofficial" is not a bad thing. In fact, it's better than Octopussy and the winner of The Battle of the Bonds.
