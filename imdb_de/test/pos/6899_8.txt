I saw that at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and I really liked it. It worked for me as a funny comedy because I do not like horror, but it only took a few minutes before I had to close my eyes. The BBC quality was not far away, which is amazing for an indie movie. I liked the way the plot rotates and even meanders, it kept surprising me. I even got used to the Willy Grimes character that I initially disliked. It would have been better if there had been a motivation for the woman to be so interested in going to the island: it felt very much like a plotter. <br /> <br /> I like Dominic Monaghan and he did a good job at Pratfalls, horror and in the thoughtful moments. Beautiful voice also in the narrative. <br /> <br /> This would be a funny and unusual date movie.
