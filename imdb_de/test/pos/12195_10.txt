Although this movie does not have the darkness of the books, in my opinion it is a great movie. With the beautiful Stuart Townsend as Lestat it is a great camping fun. He may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair he would not look good with blond hair, and Lestat is definitely about looking good. He moves like a predator I always thought Lestat would have. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It's not an interview with the vampire, so do not try to compare them. Interview is Louis' story. This is a cut-and-paste version of Lestat's. In any case, I can only recommend.
