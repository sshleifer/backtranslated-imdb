The most attractive factor in this masterpiece of a movie is not the beautiful lead actor. Nor is it her outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry. <br /> <br /> For me it's the scene of the entire movie. The settings, the lighting, the props ... all contribute to the love-lust between the main characters. A hint of smoke from Chow's cigarette reveals his state of mind, the ever-changing tight-fitting cheongsams of Lizhen reflect the constraints of decision-making, the ruins of Angkor Wat fit the deteriorating relationship of the two lines /> <br /> The Excellent Using Mis-en-Scene gives the film just the right feel to illustrate the complicated relationship between the characters. The film leaves the audience without desire for more.
