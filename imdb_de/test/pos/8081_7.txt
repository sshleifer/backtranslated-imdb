I like the phrase "post-war British paranoia" used by one of the reviewers. It describes so well the kind of films in which John Mills ("The October Man" (1947), "The Long Memory" (1952)) between "big" pictures ("Scott of the Antartic" (1948) and "War "Outstanding and Peace" (1956)). <br /> <br /> In this decidedly "Eric Ambler" style plot, John Mills had played Dr. Howard Latimer, who promises to be a friend to his friend Charles (unseen), a German Actress Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) at the airport A creepy "reporter" Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries) is currently in his consulting rooms and offers to take him along, but as he tracks the actress, Windsor informs him that she is already waiting in the car !!! (something lazy is going on!) Howard gets dropped off on his date and does not think about it anymore. <br /> <br /> The next night he finds her dead body when he leaves comes home from work, and besides, he finds that his friend Charles did not ring him. He is still in New York and Windsor does not seem to exist. Previously, Ms. Ambler (Rene Ray), who had been referred to him by Doctor George Kimber (Mervyn Johns), had told her of her recurring dream that she had found a corpse and a brass pedestal with a square pedestal. It's a nightmare that turns out to be true for Howard, but as Detective Inspector Dane (Roland Culver) interviews her, she denies any knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is later in the trunk of Howards Daimler. </ Br> When Howard lies low, Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White) visits him. He calls himself a "friend" - he has a photo of Windsor he wants to exchange for a box of matches given by Frieda Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the apartment, Charles rings and while Howard calls, an unknown attacker knocks him out and steals the matches !!! Who can he trust? Who has nothing to hide? <br /> <br /> This is a top thriller - not quite in the same class as "The October Man", but with John Mills, what he does is best-playing ordinary men trapped in impossible secrets !!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
