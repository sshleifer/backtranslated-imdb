I have only seen this movie once and look forward to seeing it again and again. Dear David (by Beligium), why did you bother to write a comment on this film? I just think that we can think about you (after reading your comment): you are a proven non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie) and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming. I think you are a bit old and sexual expression is not part of your "face". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best film festival, and I am pleased to say that this film has been awarded: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabelle Huppert is great as always, who would make this movie like her? One of her best performances ever. The music is fantastic and once again Michael Haneke puts the reality on the big screen. It's like a Dogma95 movie because of the theme. Try to see it. <br /> <br />
