It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now the fourth in the series, which in my opinion is the best in the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For puppets, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> but that really did not interest me. Just to see how Chucky and Tiffany argue and fight each other. And the end leaves it wide open for a fifth sequel (which I hear is in the works). Idle Hands is celebrating its premiere next week and seems like another horror / comedy, but I doubt it'll be the best.
