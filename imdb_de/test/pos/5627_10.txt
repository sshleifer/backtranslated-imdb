The theme of this film may be depressing: a man of about thirty, without work, little education, three children from a failed relationship who live in his parents' house, but with the dream of making feature films. But after about half an hour from the movie's beginning, you realize that Mark Borchardt has an inexhaustible supply of drive and ambition - it's just that everything is focused on his need for movies, and nothing else will make him happy. The movie jumps through the emotional spectrum, but in the end you feel happy because you've just met some wonderful people. Look at that - you wish it would last longer.
