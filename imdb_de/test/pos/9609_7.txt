Peter O'Toole is a treat in roles where the lines he speaks are good and give him the opportunity to brag in drunken stupor. The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence. <br /> <br /> The film alludes to incest - without a single explicit scene - but it can entertain the viewer in its rough social commentary. Although this is not a big movie, he will be remembered for his entertaining performances. <br /> <br /> Even York, who signs the papers at the end, is a pleasure to watch and a tragedy radiates out loud. The potential weakness is the relaxed direction of Thompson. But the movie hovers because of the actors and the script. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie twice over a 20-year period - both times with the name "Brotherly love". "Country Dance" is a pretty farce and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.
