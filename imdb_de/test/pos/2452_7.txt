Not for adrenaline maniacs, etc. It's a good movie that looks at itself from a different angle after the war, a mental health problem. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez is great as a young man who is persecuted by the demons of the Vietnam War and causes problems in the family. <br /> <br /> Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father. <br /> <br /> It all depends on the problem of dealing with the past, with whom. <br /> <br /> Emilion Estevez's character does not seem to be busy, and Martin Sheen's character does not want to do that bypass. <br /> <br /> The protective mother regards this issue with a warm and open heart, but open-hearted reasons.
