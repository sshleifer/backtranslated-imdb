I saw this on community television a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised at how pleasing a movie was. <br /> <br /> Although somewhat crazy in some ways, he works well as a mystery thriller thanks to a script that works out an ingenious storyline; I have consistently advised and the resolution is inspired. <br /> <br /> The cast is a star-studded cast that contains a mix of those at the end of their careers (in fact, Richard Long died the same year he was made) or those in TV series ( Kate Jackson, Tom Bosley) were just before the star. They all do a good job, except for Cesare Danova, who strolls through his role. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended.
