I remember seeing this on British television in the early 1990s and was addicted. The international scale of the production is breathtaking and it's great to see how the characters evolve over the five hours they're running. The scenes in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular interest, and as a spectator you will get a real look at the culture and mood of these countries during the final stages of the Cold War. The characters of Fazal and Helen are developing very well throughout the series and can compete in this area with modern shows such as The Sopranos and Six Feet Under. In the UK, the VHS costs about £ 6 and the DVD about £ 10 - a quality bargain. I thought Soderbergh's version was great too - but this masterpiece is clearly due to a lot of guilt.
