The reputation of this little film is a pleasure from start to finish. The story is always entertaining, the tension never loses. The whole cast is wonderful. The combination of Walken and Bracco works perfectly, it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance. Bracco is very sexy and really funny like the cheater who fights for her independence. For some reason, they gave Walken a very strange make-up and the weirdest haircut I can imagine? It's a sort of parody of the one Burt Lancaster had in Elmer Gantry. It was a pleasure for me. It's the first movie I ever saw in Miguel Ferrer, probably one of the least appreciated movie actors of his generation. He is very good in a small role as Bracco's pimp. Even the Jamaican thugs are a sight. I highly recommend this movie.
