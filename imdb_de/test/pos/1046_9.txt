I discovered this movie by accident and it was a nice surprise. A Christmas classic, it is also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The plot is simple: Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) lives off by writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas time, her boss Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young, weakened sailor to the Connecticut Farm she writes about. The only problem is: she has no farm and can not cook. To get out of the marmalade, Elisabeth agrees to a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardiner, who has a farm) and flies to Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix. <br /> <br /> There is a good direction from Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful: Stanwyck has never been better than this witty yet romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall make funny and human minor characters. The only weak point is the leading man, Dennis Morgan. It starts well, but if the movie goes on, it gets really boring. It almost begs Elisabeht Lane that he ends up with him and not with Gary Cooper or David Niven, both of whom would be better suited for the role. Anyway, this is a merry Christmas movie with a refreshing score and I recommend it to anyone who wants to spend fun and sweet holidays ... in Connecticut.
