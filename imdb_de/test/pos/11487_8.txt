It was sad that Committed lasted only two weeks in the Dallas theaters. I thought this movie had a lot to offer. The script was funny, full of subtle emotional shifts and had a good message. The acting was great. Everyone did a great job, especially with the intricacies of the script. Not only does Heather Graham have beautiful eyes, she has * expressive eyes. In this regard, all actors were attractive! I do not know why it did not go well in his movie release. Apart from the studio, there did not seem to be much. But it deserves to do better, and I hope it works well on video. It is certainly one of my favorites for the first half of 2000.
