In this film, the fighting life for the typical East German men is accurately represented. Observed by the secret police, friends and colleagues, most of the eastern population existed. The Strelzyk's and Wetzels were two families who decided that they would not need it anymore. <br /> <br /> Despite the extreme danger of fleeing to the West, they feel that the rewards far outweigh the risks. John Hurt and Beau Bridges, representing the respective heads of families, came up with the idea of ​​skimming over the heavily fortified border of the GDR. <br /> <br /> There are exciting moments when they collect and assemble the necessary materials for the flight. They work in their day jobs and at night they put the balloon directly under the noses of the authorities, one of which is the neighbor of Strelzyk (Klaus Loewitsch). <br /> <br /> The first attempt, involving only the Strelcycles, ends in failure if the balloon crashes just a few feet from the border. The crashed balloon is discovered by border guards, and a relentless search begins for the conspirators determined to try again. While the sale of materials is closely monitored, Peter and Guenter still manage to get bits and pieces of fabric to use to build a second balloon for their nimble escape to freedom. The film also includes a heartwarming and effective soundtrack by the late Jerry Goldsmith.
