This is a movie that is much more fun than its rating of 7 suggests. In many ways, it 's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS - with lots of excesses and sloppiness from VALLEY, a little polished up for the public of 1959. Fast to success - but this time in the publishing world and not in the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF ALL has Broadway aspirations). <br /> <br /> The film starts with Hope Lange came to the company for her first day at work. She is assigned to Chef Joan Crawford, who has appeared in her first supporting role for decades. Despite the awkward crawford, Lange is determined not to give in - to do it in this job. And over time, she quickly climbs from the secretary to the editor. At the same time, her two new roommates are also trying to improve through the stage and the relationship with a rich playboy. As with VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, they all have their ups and downs (mostly downs), but at the end of the movie there is some hope that at least some of them will be able to do it - beaten and bruised, all the same. <br /> <br /> In this movie, men are mainly pigs. The only guy who seems to be decent is played by Stephen Boyd, and of course Hope Lange neglects him for a new friend. The guys being played by veteran character actor Brian Ahern and the rest are sexist scum, and finally you understand how Crawford got so bitter and evil. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything - adultery, premarital sex, abortion, etc. and is certainly NOT an artistic triumph. However, it is a pleasure to watch them thanks to great output and a juicy script. Just do not expect Shakespeare !!
