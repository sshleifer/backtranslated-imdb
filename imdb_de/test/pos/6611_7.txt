This film deserves a lot of praise for me because although I'm not a surfer or a skater, I was inspired throughout the documentary. <br /> <br /> The depth of the story and the evolution of these two extreme sports emphasized what you could do for two groups of individuals. The dedication that these people have / have is truly inspiring, and that's why others can now enjoy and do what these guys founded. <br /> <br /> In contrast to most other documentary films, this film has been cleverly compiled. The amount of material that has been recorded and survived over the decades is outstanding. That's why some of the best cuts I've ever seen have been put together, keeping the topic focused. Without the urge to fall back on the recent recordings of the better known surfers and skaters, this is still popular today. <br /> <br /> The film explores areas such as success, gaining new tricks, winning competitions, and collecting fame. As well as failures such as injuries or a burnout. <br /> <br /> It was also fulfilling to hear the experiences of skaters and surfers themselves rather than second-hand information. This resulted in a better picture that should be drawn. <br /> <br /> Overall a really great performance.
