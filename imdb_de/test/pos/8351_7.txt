* smaller spoilers * <br /> <br /> You know, it's at the point where Walt Disney Television Animation might as well be called Walt Disney Sequel Animation. These extensions range from excellent ("The Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" and the fantastic "Lion King II: Simba's Pride") to the awful ones ("The Return of Jafar"). (This, of course, is my personal opinion.) Now, Disney is bringing us her latest sequel. "Scamps Adventure," and though it's flawed, it's still entertaining. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation does not match that of Disney Feature Animation. Nevertheless, the animators bring the characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not aged a day since 1955. Trusty still talks about his sense of smell and "Ol 'Reliable," and Jock is still sorry for him. There's a nice fight between Tramp and a giant dog in the dog pound, and again we're tempted to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads (though it's very doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor.) > <br /> I do not really care about most of the songs (even though Roger Bart and Susan Egan - the singing voices of Scamp and Angel - sing their parts very nicely). Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done much better work in the past. Danny Troob is fine, but nothing special. And some of the junkyard gang seem like excessive luggage; That means they really do not do much. <br /> <br /> The language work, on the other hand, is pretty good. I do not like Jeff Bennett as a dog catcher, but as a tramp he is very good. Chazz Palminteri does a great job as Buster, leader of the junkyard gang, and Alyssa Milano gives her perhaps the best performance as Angel. Then there is Scamp (who is the image of his father). He is voiced by Scott Wolf PERFEKTION. Wolf can excellently show Scamp's wild stroke and his soft side. <br /> <br /> All in all, while "Scamp's Adventure" is flawed, it's still quite entertaining to see. However, I hope that Walt Disney Television Animation focuses on more original material for its future releases. <br /> <br />
