Most of the criticisms of "Attack of Show" come from people who unfairly compare it to an old computer TV program called "The Screen Savers". People are upset because G4 has decided to break off the "screen savers" and replace them with the pop culture "Attack of the Show". Comparing the two shows is similar to comparing apples to oranges! <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Show" is a unique, hours-long program that covers the current Generation X / Y culture. It includes segments on movies / television, panel discussions, video games, new DVD releases, sex advice, new gadgets (MP3 players, cell phones, etc.), comic books / graphic novels, magazines, and Internet fashions. <br /> <br /> It's a funny show. It's definitely worth your while to be in your 20s or 30s. I give 8 out of 10 points.
