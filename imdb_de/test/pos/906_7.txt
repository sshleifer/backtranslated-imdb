This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts with great and funny moments, but overall the movie relies too much on a weird premise. Stan Laurel wears no pants. Laurel plays a Scottish naive young man who arrives in America with full kilt. For some reason, therefore, he is in the center of attention and his uncle, played by Oliver Hardy, thinks it's time to put some pants on Philip. <br /> <br /> His humor is well executed, but the main thing becomes tiring after a while. While the movie definitely still has its weird big moments, it's also far from the best of the many Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts that still exist. The film is just too easy to be considered one of the best, though it is definitely executed very well for most parts. <br /> <br /> Great, clean, fun, nothing special or amazing. <Br /> <br /> 7/10
