<br /> <br /> Japanese-style horror movie season. Uzumaki / Spiral was a total freakfest from start to finish. A fun freakfest, but sometimes it was a bit too dependent on kitsch and not on the horror. The story is difficult to summarize: a carefree, normal teenage girl comes face to face with extremely disturbing events, while the small town she lives in seems to be under the control of spirals. The spirals are everywhere in the air, clouds, dirt and everyday objects. The spirals take control of humans and bad things happen to them. Oh, one more thing, people happen to turn into slugs. Why? Who knows or cares, people turn into snails, that's enough for me. That was not as scary as it was scary, because there are not as many attacks or fierce attacks as is often the case with horror movies. Uzumaki prefers to crawl and crawl (like a snail!) Instead of shaking. A favorite scene: A woman lies asleep in a hospital room as this long, millennial millipede enters the room and slowly climbs up the bedpost, over the sheets, over the pillow and into her sleeping ear. I twitched and curled my toes. Uzumaki has a handful of scenes that are really violent, but somehow humorous. For example, a man is obsessed with spirals, he gets into his washing machine because he sees a spiral in it when he turns, he commits spiraling suicide in the washing machine. The last shot we see of him is that his body is all rolled up and rubbery. A human meat spiral with a strong, single eye flashes in the middle of the washing machine. A bizarre picture. Uzumaki has a crass psychedelic addiction that enhances his charm and fun. I love those horror movies. It's not about killing, a la slasher movies, it's about a power of evil (the spirals!) That you take over and try to kill you, forcing you to kill others. Films like Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror movie, and thank God
