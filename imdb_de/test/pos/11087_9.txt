this movement was fascinating and absorbing; The story, however, was a bit choppy and sometimes hard to follow. Although the two main characters did a great job, it was a memorable movie to just play Senn Penn with every fiber of his being and steal every frame. Later films have shown that he is not just a single actor: in Sweet and Lowdown he also showed comedic flair. Surprisingly talented and not as easy as I thought he would be.
