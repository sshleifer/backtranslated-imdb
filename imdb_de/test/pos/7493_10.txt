This movie is hard to beat. It follows in the tradition of Pulp Fiction and manages to shape its own unique style. The cast is awesome, the script is great - and things like the odd (pulp fiction-like) time sequencing is brilliant. I especially like the fact that the images returned in Flash vary dramatically depending on what the story is telling. If it's one of the indoctrinated criminals, everything is flashy and cool, but if it's the hero's memory, it's all grim and disgusting. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie - so I'm very upset to find that I can not buy it anywhere!
