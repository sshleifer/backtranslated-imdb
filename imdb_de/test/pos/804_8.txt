Immediately after moving to his new country home in the English countryside, Hercule Poirot receives an invitation from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell, owners of a large manor house nearby. But the next day, one of the guests is found shot dead near the pool, and his clumsy wife holds a revolver a few steps away .... <br /> <br /> This Agatha Christie riddle is a bit thin, though The killer's plan is still very smart. It is exquisite filming and cinematography that raises the story to a higher level. This episode usually contains the serious tone of "Five Little Pigs" and "Sad Cypress", but contains more dark humor than they do. Performers may include the two most famous actors to have collaborated on the show at the time, Edward Fox (as a butler) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Angkatell), although the outstanding performance is being pioneered by dazzlingly handsome Megan Dodds Henrietta : Your personal confrontations with Suchet shine and are the highlights of the movie. Oh, and since an English police inspector interferes with the case, they could bring Philip Jackson back for the case. (***)
