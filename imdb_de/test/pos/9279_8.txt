Despite the reviewer's previous work, this is a well-played and interesting documentary with many clips from classic 1950s science-fiction movies that influenced Spielberg, Lucas, and others in their recent efforts. I agree that Spielberg's films are not in the same league as the films discussed here, such as William Cameron Menzies' brilliant INVADERS FROM MARS, to name only one of the many tracks studied, but this is still a remarkably good overview of the 1950s paranoid science fiction. Yes, it's becoming a commercial for the lukewarm remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS during the last fifteen minutes; You can turn this off. The rest is surprisingly good and it's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them, even if they can not match the originals.
