I was a big fan of this series. Yesterday I watched it again on DVD. I was worried about laughing or not? In some episodes, however, I laughed hysterically and some episodes were good. Smart Show Rakesh Bedi (Raja) & Satish Shah are brilliant, while Swaroop Sampat is just bad, but I think she does the job. Maybe a better actress could be used instead of her. <br /> <br /> If this series were to be aired this year, I would have given it 9/10, and to think that this series is almost 25 years old and their comedy is still good. I'll give her 10/10. I would highly recommend this series to watch on DVD.
