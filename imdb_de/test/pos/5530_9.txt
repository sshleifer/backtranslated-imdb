That was one of the lines in a trailer to this film and the publicists did not excel for once. All six of the players featured here are 99% on screen, so they have to be good. <br /> <br /> It's always fascinating how certain plots can be made to a deadly seriousness for a highballing comedy situation. Mary Boland of the Gloomy and Charlie Ruggles of the Chicken Bacon play their usual characters, who plan to drive all the way to California. To share the expenses, they promote someone who shares the ride. You get Burns and Allen and a monster of a dog. The same premise was a deadly business affair several generations later in California. If you travel with Gracie Allen, you know that you will absolutely go crazy if you try to find your Monty Pythonesque argument across the world. And if that's not enough, come across W.C. Fields, part-time sheriff and full-time pool hustler, lives in sin with Alison Skipworth. But back then we did not bother with such things. <br /> <br /> A true classic 1930s comedy that should not be missed.
