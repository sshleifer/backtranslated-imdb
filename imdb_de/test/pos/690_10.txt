I watched as I expected to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes, and was surprised to call the dialogue exceptionally natural and with black humor. It was more like Eastenders going into the sea than serving us. The scenes during the approach and the attack are remarkably realistic in their portrayal of a battleship and the convulsions and jokes among the ship's crew (at least based on my service in the 70s). Some of the throwaway lines are very funny ("I do not join the Band of Hope just to enjoy some oily fish fryer!) My only complaint is that they did not show what happened to the Irish helmsman and his bride or the tattooed PO and his "I Love Arabella" tattoo!
