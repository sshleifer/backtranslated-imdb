Wow, I find the average rating of this movie on this page incredibly low. There is really no reason not to like this movie. "Michael" is a simple but original and easy-to-enjoy romantic comedy. The plot involves a group of reporters / experts investigating the mysterious appearance of an angel (John Travolta) in the Midwest. The angel turns out to be less holy and worldly than we would expect, and that makes him entertaining. His interest in women and the Beatles takes the fishing tackle in a new direction. The romantic side of this movie is that the angel Michael is trying to bring together Andie MacDowell and William Hurt. They may not have the most chemistry on the screen, but they certainly have enough to work well. Anyone who rated this film that low (5.4?), Come on! The movie is not that bad. In fact, I found it pretty funny and memorable. Sure, it's not the best you'll ever see, but it's still good. This is a movie that I think was remarkably underestimated. It's funny, romantic and recommended by me. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
