Films belonging to the genre "Film Noir" usually contain similar elements: a "Deus ex Machina" photography, which drives the main character directly into chaos, a pretty, but psychotic girl, a pretty, but psychotic thug, a lot of money, a lot of brutality and usually a dissolution in the desert. Think of "High Sierra" or "White Heat". <br /> <br /> There's a lot of hard-nosed movie Noir out there. But if Film Noir is good, you can not take your eyes off the rubble of people. <br /> <br /> "Blind Spot" belongs to this last tradition. The film follows Danny Alton, a troubled teenager (superbly played with depth, grace, emotional integrity and downright lamentations from James Franco, who completely falls into this role), who has fallen in love with the rough street kid Darcy /> <br /> From the beginning you know that this will be bad. Darcy invites Danny to his house. But the house is empty and up for sale, and lying on the floor is a bloody check for thousands of dollars. Danny is robbed of his clothes and possessions, but uses the check to track down the suicidal April - Darcy's other lover. When they reach Darcy's real home, they find Wayne - a thug chasing Darcy for stolen money. Together, the three manage to find Darcy in a dusty, run-down desert motel. But that's just the beginning of the story, with plastic explosives, drugs, shootings, a spooky burial center, bisexual assassins, and a lonely semi-finished desert house bringing events to a warhead in an alley outside a tattoo parlor in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> This movie contains some of the best noir cinematographs I've seen in years. In one scene, Danny rushes through the desert on foot to the half-finished house in the desert, where he believes Darcy was taken away by gangsters that night. A very long shot with sharp light effects shows Danny - arms and legs flapping, tangible fear engraved on his face (even visible at this distance), dust cloud behind him as the wind lashes in his direction - across the desert plains rushing toward the house , The loneliness, the despair, the desperation that Danny senses is shockingly portrayed. There are many such scenes in this film that were wonderfully designed by the seasoned Maximo Munzi. This is an Oscar-winning material. <br /> <br /> Also, the editing is amazing. The film contains small moments in which the characters gain insight into themselves or their situation. Time pieces in which memory and feeling flare up again. At these times, fast image montages flash across the screen. This is an excellent adaptation by director and author Stephan Woloszczuk. In an early montage, Danny describes the wondrous feelings he now has when Darcy entered his life. Quick pictures of Danny's diary flash across the screen: the words "4 life", "luck" and "safe" stop for a moment, while page by page with words the content of a human heart races across the screen - fuzzy to read too fast. It's like a flood of emotions that Danny himself feels. <br /> <br /> The flood of images reveals something different about this film: so beautiful is the production design by Nathaniel Waters. Darcy's Quonset Cabin is the perfect combination of high-tech and slob (paying homage to set decorator Kimberly Foster's attention). The breathtaking desert house scene is just scary. The ruined motel where Darcy hides can be found in every abandoned small town in America. The scary (and amazingly lit) funeral home, in which the plot takes a terrible turn, blends the hardness of death with the entire movie. (It's too bad that the film's director of light is not credited.) This film has an excellent production design that enhances each frame and the performance of each actor. <br /> <br /> This is the fourth element of this film that sets him apart. Take hold of you and capture yourself: acting. James Franco is a great actor. Even in "Spider-Man," where he had virtually nothing to do, Franco showed that he understands human emotions like no other actor of his generation. He's not a handsome boy who looks as good as Brad Pitt. Franco shows deep emotions with full force. His performances contain pure human heart. Consider the scene in the phone booth outside the funeral home where Danny collapses after telling April and Wayne that Darcy is dead. Lesser actors could not cope with the complete emotional collapse of a human being. Franco does that. <br /> <br /> Shawn Montgomery simply blew you away in her first movie with her appearance as a suicide bomber in April. Deeply in love with Darcy, she suffers from massive depression after she has buried her unborn child (after the fetus spontaneously broke off) in a perfume box in the forest alone. Her life of luxury and perfection is now a fate: April is one of the best cartoon characters I've ever seen. While Danny's relationship with Darcy is slowly being eroded during the film, April's nervous breakdown is revealed only to the public. Neither Danny nor Wayne seem to be particularly interested in her as a human being. The desperation in April, when she realizes that Danny was also Darcy's lover, is poignant and powerful, even though she is cut off by the character's complete inability to feel emotions for a very long time. Montgomery brings in April a pathos that brings your heart through the Wringer. Mark Patrick Gleason gets the toughest job of the movie: Wayne has to turn the racquet into something human and genuine. First, Wayne is simply one of a number of violent, evil-minded and obsessed drug-thugs who appear in a number of films (from "Kindergarten Cop" to "Beverly Hills Cop 2"). Gleason is very good with what he has given, but he does not quite get where you feel for Wayne. It's hard to say if it's Gleason's problem or the material. There's a moment when Wayne (Darcy's brother, though neither Danny nor April knows that) reads Danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional connection between the two men - where you only know Wayne's homophobic Danny's ass the explosion never comes. (Thank goodness, Trite's plans are the death of the film noir.) Once the revelation about the siblings is at the end of the movie, the audience is quite astonished when they realize the depth of love and compassion that Wayne really made for Darcy so deep that Wayne accepted Danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother. But that happens outside the screen. Gleason will never be given the opportunity to play Wayne's feelings. It must have been very frustrating for the performer. <br /> <br /> The story is quite imaginative, although at the end of the film the smuggling device will probably remind viewers of "Diamonds Are Forever" (yes, James Bond). A traditional narrative voice (proving that Franco is just as talented as a physical actor) provides a great atmosphere, though it tends to pass into Schmaltz several times towards the end of the film (which means unintentional laughter)). Great locations play a key role in the movie. Kudos to the Locationscout for finding such amazing buildings! The end of the film hit me like a bit rushed; not knock, but a little too tight for my movie, the noir tastes. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen viewers either love "hate" or love "blind spot". The modern film audiences, who are exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence, often have little appreciation for the intricacies of film noir. My suggestion is to take a small group of friends who do not find despair, emotional breakdown, despair or depression ridiculous. Take them to a small theater in which they can boast the spectacle of film vision, but in which they are not destroyed by a crowd that does not recognize a good movie Noir. Bring some popcorn (trust me, they will be so crazy that they will not finish it), get a soda and let them be overwhelmed. Go somewhere bright and happy to wash the dirt and weakness from your soul. Since this film is so good that you feel that way, you need this stuffing material.
