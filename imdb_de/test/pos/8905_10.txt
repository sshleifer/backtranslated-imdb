Visiting this film was an excuse to escape the work I had to do for my classes, but it turned out to be one of my best experiences here in France. The film can quickly build multi-dimensional characters and is characterized by an excellent smooth story. The characters really had the voices you would expect when reading the graphic novels, and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations. The movie was exciting, cute and action-packed at the same time. A wonderful story that was expertly filmed. I will show it to my French students.
