I like the show, but come on, write some action! Finish dragging on. They have a great concept and it could be a lot more. Miles (Jenkins) is great and, as a child, states that age should work in the situation he is in. Hey, be creative with the creatures, they may have telepathic abilities or other worldly powers. The children actors of the series are very good and convincing. Miles' parents seem to be a little under-performing, but develop this, come on! They have a great seed here and there can be a whole new twist on the coming season, with lots of new characters and creatures and all sorts of decent sci-fi stuff. If you could make a series with a witch, then you should be able to make a creation with these creatures and children.
