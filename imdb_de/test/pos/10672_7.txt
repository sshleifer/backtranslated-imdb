I saw this for the first time in syndicated television in the 1970s and admired its production values, which were high-tech back then. The remastered video is richer and more colorful than the pale 35mm TV printouts. This movie deserves more attention: It has paved the way for UFO, Space: 1999 and even Star Wars with detailed miniatures and thoughtful gadgets. Sure, the story of an alternative anti-matter planet Earth has been recycled a hundred times since Star Trek, but the beauty of this film is its confident European design flair: from Rolls Royce's space motors to the Euro Sec. Letterhead paper, JFSS or Dopplegangers, as it was called in Europe, is gratifying to the imaginary vision of Europe in space in the shadow of the superpowers. Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's ambitious epic gets a bit boring as the American astronaut finally realizes that he is on the doppelganger earth and literally goes downhill after the poetic graceful shuttle-boarding sequence. A mediocre story is supported by a great and lyrical classic by the late great Barry Gray, John Williams of Britain.
