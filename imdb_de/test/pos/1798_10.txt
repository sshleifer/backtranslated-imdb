Happy 25th Birthday to Valley Girl! Great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances ... catch the spirit of the 80s; the slang of the mainstream and the outcasts. A wonderful rendition of high school life and "gloomy downtown" from a suburban perspective. The soundtrack includes songs by Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Furs, Men at Work, The Flirts, and Bananarama. <br /> <br /> This movie is really Romeo and Juliet (minus the double suicide) that takes place in Los Angeles in the 1980s. Julie's father, played by Frederic Forrest (Sonny Bono, anyone?), Is hysterical like an idealistic hippie father who wonders how he made such a materialistic offspring. But he does not judge.
