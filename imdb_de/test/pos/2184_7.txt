This broadcast of the classic musical "Sweeney Todd" does not do the production justice, but it is still rousing. <br /> <br /> First, the fun of this version is the production design, set the startling trapdoor. Then the staging is excellent, right down to the slash. <br /> <br /> The main shortcoming here is the performances people give. Oh, they're believable, okay - but it's pretty frustrating when nobody seems to be on time in a song as fast as "Kiss Me". In fact, the actress Johanna plays is not only a bleak off-tempo, but also a little bit absent. And Angela Lansbury's slightly exaggerated cockney accent is a bit irritating. One more thing - what is so bad about Judge Turpin's performance of "Johanna" that it is banned by the American theater, but not the cannibal hymn "A Little Priest"? Otherwise, this is an excellent production. It's a thrill to see people do what they love - and I'm not even talking about "meat pies with a twist".
