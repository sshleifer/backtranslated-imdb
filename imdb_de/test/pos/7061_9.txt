Remembering this movie always reminds me how I remember what the summer was like, God! so long ago. The entire scene of the "Overnight", from the canoe procession to the end of the journey, is precious, and the story of gonorrhea about the deadly killer is a legend from my youth. A very entertaining movie that has been greatly improved by the following terrible sequels.
