Together with In the Army! This is one of the best films of Pauly Shore, if there is such a thing. While the entire conflict between the West Coast and the Midwestern culture is nothing new, this film proves that the story becomes more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then-fresh shore. While the change in values ​​would probably have gone the other way, the whole concept was entertaining. Shore's interaction with the family was not only funny, she also had Carla Gugino and Tiffani-Amber Theissen (she will always have the Amber in my book) in two impressive and early roles. One of those films that I easily see when he is on TV.
