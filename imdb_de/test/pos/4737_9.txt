Waco: Rules of Engagement is doing very well not to draw any conclusions for the audience. It only contains interviews, footage from the stalemate, recordings of congressional hearings, phone calls, testimony, etc., and allows you to draw your own conclusions. It has been worked with 100% objectivity, but it is very compelling. You will not like Koresh after you have seen this, but you tend to believe that you will believe how I am doing now. There are many things we have not been told what happened before and during the conflict.
