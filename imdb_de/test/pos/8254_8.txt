Every Sunday we shoot at Berkeley Square in London, I have provided a location service for this film. David Niven The gentleman has always enjoyed the role, unfortunately, to be his last. We had a moment of panic when a trunk load of fake Krugerrands (cast for the movie) dumped a storm drain. <br /> <br /> Imagine the hectic crew opening all the procedures to recover the last one. If you know and love London you will love this comedy tromp - including Richard Jordan, who unfortunately died of a brain tumor. A good movie, great crew, great cast. Search for the current stars of Coronation Street, then play scenes or extras. The car gap and the retail businesses of Ivan were all shot in West London, Chiswick the entire shopping parade and the American used car section were dressed overnight, the car gap is still there like the shops. A restaurant suddenly turned into a funeral home. If you see the movie in the lists, try to see it! Incidentally, Sally Harrison, the bank's receptionist, was married to production designer Tony Curtis. <br /> <br /> April 2007 I just thought I would add some extra comments to the venues: <br /> <br /> Pub: Right next to Berkeley Square. Elke Sommers Cottage: in the background street along the Twickenham Film Studios Ivans Used Car Lot: along Chiswick High Street and all shops near the roundabout. Workshops (conversion of armored delivery trucks) factory at the roundabout opposite Fullers Brewery Jail (see workshops above). Telephone Booth See Elke Sommers Cottage (It was the wooden studio prop box used in many films.) Look for the light cable on floor level and the wood hinges the door !!! Honeywell's computer room near Olympia Graveyard - Chiswick - Grave - something outside the border with the Common Bank Interiors, Blank Ceiling and Vault: Twickenham Studios <br /> <br /> And only David Niven, the gentleman, joked and mingled with the crew, extras and so on ...... Niven would dine at Connaught Hotel and have coffee with the crew!
