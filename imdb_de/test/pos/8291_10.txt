One of my favorite childhood movies. The Chipmunk Adventure offers incredible fun for young and old. The animation is lively and colorful, and the movie itself features some of the best songs ever recorded in an animated feature. Who could forget the dynamic "Boys / Girls of Rock n 'Roll", the exciting "Diamond Dolls" and the heartbreaking "My Mother"? <br /> <br /> This should be considered as a nostalgic, classic animation stone from the eighties. It's too bad they do not do it like that anymore. Most animated films today rely on violence, coarse humor, or sentimental porridge ... except, of course, the people of Pixar. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: An amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages.
