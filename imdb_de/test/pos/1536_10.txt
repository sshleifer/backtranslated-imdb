"Closet Land" tells a powerful story and contains many different subtle elements. You may have read a lot about the plot of the movie before, but you do not have to. All you need to know is that this movie is just an interrogation. Along the way, we learn a lot about the interrogator and the person being interviewed. We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. Especially if you have absolutely no control over it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie is a warning (really, the movie has several aspects), what happens to people's freedoms when they "look the other way" and ignore the injustices, that happen to people around them. <br /> <br /> If you have about an hour and a half and know where to rent it, I strongly recommend that you do so.
