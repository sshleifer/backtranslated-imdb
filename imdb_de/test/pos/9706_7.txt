I just came out of an advance show and wow this movie was hilarious. Maybe better than the first, but at least the same. If you do not like donkeys or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity (much more than in the first), then stay far away. But if you dig the whole jackass thing, this movie will not disappoint. Toro Totter is the greatest invention of all time. OK. So, my review was not long enough ... Anything else I have to say is poor, poor Dunn, they really throw him the crap out of it. So if you like masochistic humor and a pronounced male nudity and by far the most disgusting female nudity (John Waters is involved, do I have to say more?) Then you'll be stuck in stitches with this movie. I never stopped laughing and came out with sweat.
