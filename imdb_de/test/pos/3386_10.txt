I first saw this mini-series as a kid and even though I'm not a kid anymore, I still love it !!! Professional copies are hard to find, but if they're on DVD, that's MINE !!! =] <br /> <br /> Great casting, wonderful acts, lots of action, romance and even good comedy. I'm not a historian by nature, but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction!
