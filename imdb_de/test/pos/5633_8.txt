I enjoyed it because I can relate to it. <br /> <br /> At some point in my life, I tried to make films, and I had many of the same problems as Mark Borchardt when I was trying to shoot HIS movie. I also went through a prolonged period of selfish arrested development, in which I refused to grow. But then I miraculously got married and had children. I noticed that it was a difficult filmmaker not likely to feed my family. So I got a decent job and did what I had to do to achieve that. That's what a mature, responsible adult does. <br /> <br /> Mark has not yet faced this reality and is in this sense a retarded adolescent. Because of this, there is a hopelessness about him. Like Don Quixote, he seems so incapable and self-puzzled that he does not realize how bad he really is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and compassion for him and his circle. Mark has children and an ex-wife and bills to pay, but the film shows that he essentially cares only about his "artistic vision." <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Mark in the film acts as a personable person, surrounded by a very interesting family and a group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark lacks many of the things that are necessary to succeed in life and career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial impact, etc. Yet, like Ed Wood, he seems to be trudging on without Appearance of a hint. <br /> <br /> I think we should feel encouraged by the spectacle of the "never say the" attitude of this noble individual fighting against adversity. And man, what chances are there! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are all descendants of great movie or television people. no doubt they will all want to direct someday, if they are not already there. How much space is there for an independent like Mark? It's like hitting a guy in the head with a board, over and over. Come to think of it, that's pretty close to what happens to any of Mark's actors, with the kitchen door open, in one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Despite these concerns and apparent criticism, I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone. Uncle Bill is incredible. I have a friend who met Mike and Mark and he told me that in real life these guys are exactly as they appeared in the movie.
