Pavarotti and the entire cast are outstanding in this beautifully filmed opera by Giuseppe Verdi, the world's best opera composer. The coloratura soprano is particularly spectacular with her perfect tone. The title role is well executed and well sung. The entire production is as perfect as you would expect. <br /> <br /> A masterpiece of cinematography! <br /> <br />
