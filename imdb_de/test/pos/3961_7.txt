This is a teen movie, and while you see it, you expect some nonsensical stuff here and there, but overall, the movie is effective and effective. He lets you ask and makes you think that the story is somehow far-fetched but believable and you feel good in sequences. It's not the usual and proven way. The characters are pretty well defined and convincing. Justin stands out from the rest and pays attention to his speech. Eventually he will convince everyone that he is brilliant. He has to take on more serious roles, he is worth more than just teenage films. Etch this movie and get rid of it
