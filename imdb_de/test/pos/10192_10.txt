The HAND OF DEATH is clearly one on the scale of one to ten, not least to John Woo's masterful direction, paired with Kats excellent cinematography: Some of the relaxed tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental. There are moments when it borders on an art-house movie. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung are the kind of villains you can not help but hate. Tien is especially good as the worst of the bad guys. It's a role reversal that I've probably never seen before (Tien usually played a hero, and in fact I did not recognize him first with his mustache). Sammo's stupid "bearded teeth" make even an already unappetizing character appear even more flawed; That he is also an experienced martial artist, makes him even less sympathetic - in a villain you hate to hate. Fantastic is his choreography of the fight scenes. Jackie Chan appears briefly (early and late) as a blacksmith, and I think I actually discovered Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tan as a guide is nothing short of great.
