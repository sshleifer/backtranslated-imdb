Really a great movie ... I stumbled upon it in the video store and rented it because Aaron Eckhart (In the company of men and their friends and neighbors) as well as Paulina Porizcova was there ... The beautiful former SI swimsuit model gets naked in the Film, but that's just one of many reasons to rent it ... It's very exciting and the character development is fantastic ... Eckhart is one of the most underrated actor who works and he steals this movie ... It is very dark and violent, but I enjoyed it very much.
