One of the great tragedies of life is that Disney is so successful in everything they do. If this were not the case, we might have more unique little gems of animation, such as "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird." The story is that a wicked king usurped the throne of a place called Up-And-Down Land (I might have mistaken the name). He is hated by everyone. His favorite hobby is the shooting of birds. He probably killed the wife of Mr. Wonderbird (a bird played with the typical flair of Peter Ustinov) and gave him four young girls. Meanwhile, we see that another hobby of the evil king is painting. In particular, he painted three paintings: a self-portrait, a painting of a shepherdess (in whom he fell in love) and a painting of a chimney sweep (of which he is jealous). One night, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep climb out of their paintings and run away together. The self-portrait of the king also climbs out of his frame and makes the real king (you think I fancy it? It's the real plan) and sends the royal police to the young lovers. Mr. Wonderbird then helps the lovers to try to escape the king's forces. <br /> <br /> The plot is wonderfully surreal and the surroundings of Up and Down Country is an unbelievably imaginary place, full of towering buildings accessible only by elevators. It is an equivalent blend of the worlds of "Metropolis" and "1984" and the drawings of Dr. Ing. Seuss. <br /> <br /> Look for a unique viewing experience that does not fit the standard formula of most animated features.
