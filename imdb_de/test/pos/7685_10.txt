I was in my early 20s and had just graduated from college when this movie was released. It was an event of great importance, not only because of the high quality of the film (as evidenced by its numerous awards), but also because of its place in the historical context of 1959. Because of social progress, it has since become almost impossible to fathom My college had not admitted black students (carefully screened) until 1953. A mainstream high-budget extravaganza with almost exclusively black casts was a special novelty in 1959. <br /> <br /> The film was given a luxurious roadshow presentation (reserved seat) only in the best movie theaters, complete with a souvenir program, in which the elaborate care with lighting and color, multi-track stereo sound, etc. is set out in detail knowledge was in the film. Gershwin's music, which was played excellently, and the sheer universal humanity of the story moved enormously. <br /> <br /> Recently, I received a faded copy of a two-hour clip of the film, and repeated visits have confirmed my opinion. Time made the apparently steaming sex scenes of 1959 rather tame, but the musical quality has not diminished. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their depictions. What a crime that today's young black artists can not see these performers at the height of their careers!
