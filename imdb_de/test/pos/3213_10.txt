When the Gilmore girls started in Germany, I did not want to see them because it was just something out of the ordinary for me. It was a series and I did not even know anyone in it. Later, I realized that Edward Hermann is part of the cast of Overboard (a movie that I absolutely adore). I once had to see it with a friend and have never stopped since. It's just fun. You feel it's okay to have sex before you get married. I do not do these things all the time, but when I do these things, I feel a bit like a Gilmore girl. Even my friend started watching her and that says something. Season by season things got better with the scripts and the stories. They are open and if you are different from any other show you want to be like them.
