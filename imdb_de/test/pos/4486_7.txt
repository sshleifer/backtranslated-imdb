When I saw this episode, I probably saw enough Twilight Zones to find them ahead of time. There is this strange collection of characters at the bottom of a cylinder. They are fine until an overzealous soldier shows up in their midst. It is his supreme command to flee, and so he gathers the forces and uses them to reach the top of the cylinder. There's a lot of talk about purpose and reason and speculation about their past, but nobody can remember anything. They represent different tasks: a piper, a ballerina, a clown, a man with a broken hat. Why are they here? It leads to an adventure and is resolved in the end, but I think I had a pretty good idea before everything happened.
