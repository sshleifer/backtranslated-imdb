Gamer: DR is not an extravagant movie, but rather amateur video. Terrible magical effect, really bad fireball, terrible dungeon, castle, village ...... sword, ax, shield, robe, plate ..... okok ... everything. It takes you about 10 minutes to match your visual appearance expectations, and then you get 105 minutes of fun. <br /> <br /> I'm from Hong Kong and it's really hard to find RPers, none of my friends plays RPG and I always want to be one of the characters in the world of D & D. Watching Gamers: DR just shows me what it's like to be a player. You will see rulebooks, dice, play set, etc, etc .; You'll hear terms like "Fighter", "Wizard", "Hangout", "Level", "Character", "Flaming Hand", "Chaotic Evil". <br /> <br /> What a role-playing game I find it is leave everything you want, not bound by software RPG. Gamer: DR provide the same element, you do not know what's going to happen next, and you'll probably just laugh. The film follows both the real life of the players and in the D & D world. You will hear the player throw the dice as the character takes action in the game, which makes you feel like you are really in the game. <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil anything, but in short: Gamer: DR is a must for RPG lovers. For people who never play an RPG game, it is certain that you will still enjoy it.
