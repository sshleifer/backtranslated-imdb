I never looked at a file in a language I do not understand just because I wanted to watch the movie and I could not find it in English submarines. I do not know how much I missed, but it was not much. Probably only certain details that sound silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and the interaction of the characters. I would like to tell The Diceman from Germany that there is no reason to feel that it is "annoying" when it comes to the emotional power of the film. As I said, I do not understand Japanese - or at least only the very small amount I've lost reading the very long novel - probably my favorite all-time book - that I could not take off and the next day off work until the end! I do not know if there is an English dubbed or dubbed version, but if the movie, but if there is one, I would like to see it. The movie was amazing in Japanese. Slainte, Maegi
