"Boogie Nights" uses its protagonist Dirk Diggler as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in America's shameful past, resulting from an unexpected rise in pornography, leading to an abundance of corrupt youth. His main character borrowed features from a variety of real actors who interfere in a lot of illegal affairs that Hollywood celebrities are packing and too often exploited by the press. It seems to be some kind of big story that might seem like an E! Real Hollywood story. Drugs, sex and violence - the American dream. But what goes up must go down, and the bigger it is, the harder it turns out. <br /> <br /> Dirk Diggler's dreams are huge, as is another valuable asset to his body. Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives every person on the planet great talent, and his gift is rather unusual. After a quarrel with his mother, Eddie leaves his home and meets the seedy Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult film director who offers him work. Eddie eventually becomes a porn star who starred in most Horner films. With new success Eddie is told that he has to invent a new alias for himself, and that's how Dirk Diggler was born. Eddie / Dirk himself is mainly based on the infamous porn star John Holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with 'Wonderland', in which Val Kilmer played along. "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly the best of the two and proves that movies can be made through pornography without disgusting the target audience: ordinary moviegoers. The film takes place in 1977, an artistic era of pornography - The filmmakers were convinced that they could balance the deep points of the X-rated features with deep stories and a fascinating atmosphere. In a sense, the director of the film - Paul Thomas Anderson - does a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a free and artistic film about a time in American history where the filth was indeed both gratuitous and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep and so strong that we soon feel like we are experiencing the era up close. There is no moment when we can not convince ourselves of the time span covered in the film. <br /> <br /> On the set of 'Boogie Nights', everything was not happy. Before filming, Anderson repeatedly turned to Reynolds and asked him many times to play the role of Horner. Finally, Reynolds agreed, but claimed that the film was awful and the worst part of his career. He had publicly rejected him before he was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award and suddenly silenced. A year earlier, Anderson had suffered title disputes over Sydney / Hard Eight. He preferred the second title for his film and New Line Cinema considered the former more marketable. He essentially lost the battle, and Anderson cleverly avoided avoiding title dispute by inserting the words "Boogie Nights" into his film through the mouth of a character. <br /> <br /> The casting of the film is one of his films finest aspects. The Paul Thomas Anderson regulars are represented here as well as first-time first-time visitors. To name a few of the more well-known stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the entire movie is essentially bordering on Mark Wahlberg as Eddie, who surprisingly convinces in his role. Previously known for his singing career and disappointing activities in Hollywood, Wahlberg has all the qualities needed to portray such a character. This is his best role so far. <br /> <br /> Anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take complete control of each scene. When Jack Horner meets Eddie for the first time, Anderson secretly sets stars in the scenery, a sign of what's to come, and hidden imagery, as fine as it gets. The opening scene lasts three minutes, a long tracking shot that takes Jack and Amber to a nightclub where most of the characters are introduced first. It reminds me of the discussion about tracking footage in Robert Altman's "The Player" - it works so well in Boogie Nights and is the first indication that Anderson knows what he does behind the camera. His style is fast-paced in the style of Martin Scorsese, where shots run rather fast, but never rush. Incidentally, Anderson refers to two classic Scorsese recordings - the final De Niro-Spiegel speech from 'Raging Bull' and the tracking nightclub scene from 'GoodFellas'. Anderson is a young, growing director who, despite his age, is remarkably mature in history and direction. While his first feature film "Hard Eight" was remarkably wise and poignant, "Boogie Nights" is even more so. <br /> <br /> "Boogie Nights" began, according to Paul Thomas Anderson's quest for love. Anderson's film, which shot the extraordinary Hard Eight in 1996, is pragmatic to such an extreme that it seems almost real. Boogie Nights enlivens us with its unsatisfactory content and occasionally borders on pornography, only it is far more sophisticated than garbage. It is a stunning, wonderful, modern masterpiece that is as impressive as it is wild and stylish. Probably Anderson's best film and one of the biggest - and most important - projects of the last decade.
