1891: Brave, morally upright military physician Lieutenant Claude de Ross (solid Claudio Cassinelli) and several other survivors of the shipwreck rinse ashore on a remote tropical island, joined by the reckless and sadistic Edmund Rackham (who plays on the deliciously slimy handle) iron fist is ruled by Richard Johnson) who lives on the island with the vivacious Amanda Martin (an exciting, exciting performance by the gorgeous Barbara Bach) and her outspoken biologist father, Professor Ernest Martin (a wonderfully spotty depiction of Joseph Cotten). In addition, de Ross discovers that Professor Martin has control of a dangerous breed of Fishman beasts exploited by Rackham as slave labor. Director / co-author Sergio Martino tells the vivacious and gripping story at a constant, snappy pace, offering a tasteful reminder of the lush and secluded tropical environment and manages to create and maintain a spooky and mysterious atmosphere in the spooky opening thrush. It also spices with a nice line of dry humor and brings the exciting, action-packed climax into the limelight with considerable rattling. While the central premise is obviously inspired by "The Island of Dr. Moreau," the story still gets a lot of freshness and intrigue because Martino entraps elements as diverse as Voodoo, the lost underwater city of Atlantis, Mondo Destructo, a volcanic eruption, hidden treasures, unscrupulous genetic experiments and even some exciting punches between de Ross and Rackham during the thrilling conclusion to an overall dynamic, imaginative and often extremely entertaining whole. The sound of the solid cast is another big plus: Cassinelli makes a sympathetic hero, Johnson writes his juicy villain with superior lip service, Bach rated as a pretty addictive girl in distress, and there's decent supportive contributions from Beryl Cunningham as a sinister voodoo priestess Shakira, Franco Iavarone as the superstitious Jose and Roberto Posse as troubled troublemaker Peter. Giancarlo Fernando's magnificent widescreen cinematography provides a wealth of stunning images, while Luciano Michelin's vibrant tribal score hits the funky spot. The amphibious humanoid fish people also look pretty gnarly. An extremely funny movie.
