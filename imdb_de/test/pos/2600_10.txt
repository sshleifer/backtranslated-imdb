The "Hunting Trilogy" by Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952) and Duck! Hare! Duck! (1953) should be regarded as a comedic peak of cooperation between Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese. Although they are rarely mentioned in lists of the "biggest" or "most important" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNY cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the honor that directors like Jones, Freleng, or Avery got, but it's his dialogues and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the funniest of all time.
