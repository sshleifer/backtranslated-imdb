I read that Paolo Sorrintino's inspiration for The Consequences of Love came from watching a businessman in a Brazilian hotel and speculating on what he could do there. The film is similar for us. We see the existence of Titta, who has been living alone in a hotel in Switzerland for 8 years. He is mysterious and avoids friendship. His life is characterized by order and regularity. Gradually, the truth about his existence is revealed to us, until finally his world begins to disintegrate. The secret of Titta is central to the consequences of love's outstanding achievement by Toni Servillo. His character becomes all the more fascinating to us when small details are revealed - that he injects heroin once a week, that he has no imagination. Although some here criticize the dialogue for not being naturalistic, from my point of view that is not relevant - this is not a movie, and I think the script is great. The camera work is also excellent. <br /> <br /> If you have to criticize, the movie loses itself in the later scenes, while the mystery of Titta's existence is revealed to us and his world begins to fall a part. However, the tragic final scenes are just as good as the previous setup.
