The answer ..... No, unfortunately not. Although Miller and The Sweep must be celebrated as extremely bizarre cinematic pleasure. The drama, the tension, the romance and the unidentified crowd in the end contribute to the complex plot of the film, which must have been too much for the audience of 1898. A revealing an experience for the whole family!
