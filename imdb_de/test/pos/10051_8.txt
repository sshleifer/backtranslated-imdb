All in all, a great movie from this time and source (written by Warner Brothers, culminating in craftsmanship and style before World War II), provided you do not take it seriously at all. The film does not claim historical accuracy and is certainly not more accurate or credible than JFK. (However, this may actually be more honest, since it is essentially admitted that it is not to be understood as being fact-based, but rather as a semiheroic representation.) It is worth noting that the audience of Die Zeit was not na√Øve about the story than we are today; The NY Times report acknowledged that the public rejected "factual inaccuracies that were circulated throughout the film," described the biography of Custer's life as "imaginative," and pointed out that Custer's motivations toward the eventual endings were different historical reports. One might have guessed that they might have really gone overboard in building Custer, but admirably succeed in not portraying him as the sharpest or most enthusiastic dude in the area, but adequately determined, principled and inspiring. <br /> <br /> Flynn and DeHavilland, who shot his 8th movie together in eight years (and more recently), feels so comfortable together and plays so easily at this point that it's not too hard is to overlook how thin her ad is written here. With a first mating, it would be hard to imagine what Elizabeth really would attract Custer, but these two make it possible. The film also lacks the director from his previous seven films (the heavily underrated Michael Curtiz), but since he worked with them on the comparable Santa Fe trail last year, it's understandable if he declines. (They all started together with Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade - both great - so we can not really blame them if they have trouble keeping everything fresh.) Raoul Walsh, the director here is safer with the action sequences - which are outstanding - and everything else outdoors. The interior scenes are a bit uneven, but the studio's artisans manage to compensate well, as does Warner Bros' outstanding cast of "usual suspects" and new faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc.). , I would have liked it better if Kennedy's character had been a little less standard (I like his work in general), but here he seems to score roughly the same in each scene; The part could have been written better - and I think they may not have been sure what he could do with it, having only been in films for a year (Walsh probably took him for it after making High Sierra together ). <br /> <br /> Among the highlights is the (presumably presented) representation of the emergence of "Garryowen" as a cavalry theme. The last half hour is especially notable, especially with the farewell of the leads repeating the end of their screen partnership, followed by the final battle scenes. A thoroughly exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
