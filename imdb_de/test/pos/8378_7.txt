The dark black-and-white photography of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thriller produced by Turhan Bey, a 1940s Universal Pictures star, gives a "Third Man" look. It is an expertly filmed story of jealousy that leads to murder when a famous pianist (FRANCIS LEATHER) over-conquers his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and soon attempts to execute a plan to murder a man with whom she has an affair. > <br /> A taxi driver (DONALD BUKA) brings the woman's lover to the hotel when he comes outside for a moment to chat with a worker digging the road. Lederer uses the sound of the drill to dampen the sound of the bullet he puts in the passenger's head from outside the car. When Buka returns to his taxi, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat. To indicate the murder of the police, he changes his mind and decides to change the identity with the dead man who has a man American passport, which means that Buka could realize his ambition in the United States return. The stolen identity plan gets fatter as the man's girlfriend (Lederer's wife) turns up in the hotel to accuse Buka of incarnating the dead man. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of storyline that movie goers have probably seen countless times. But it will be a nice workout with many exciting scenes as Buka and Lederer's wife plan to flee the authorities until they are finally confronted with the killer and the police. <br /> <br /> It is extremely exciting and well done, and keeps up the interest with some excellent atmospheric photographs of Vienna, which most of the moviegoers remember "The Third Man". <br /> <br /> It is worth to see her.
