I saw this for the first time on Demand. Or on TV. I'm not really sure. But that must be my favorite movie of all time! I mean, this movie is bloody, laughs and shivers the whole movie. I recently ordered "Monster Man" from Amazon and watch "Monster Man" since I got it. Trust me, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. The comment on the DVD is very funny. They also said something about "Monster Man 2" during the comment. Let's hope they make "Monster Man 2"! If you have the chance, rent the movie or buy it. You will absolutely love it! This is the best movie released in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
