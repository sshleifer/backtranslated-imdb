A few thoughts before I get to the heart of the movie: 1) I've never seen so many naked breasts in a movie before, shown in so many non-sexual scenes - it was weird; 2) Joseph Fiennes, where have you been? They charmed us in * Elizabeth * and * Shakespeare in Love *, and then you left for a while. Mainstream American wants more! Okay, I'm a professor of college English. I have read this piece many times and this is probably the best movie version I have ever seen. While some aspects of other productions may stand out, the overall package is well put together. Pacino is not an Olivier, but he does not have to be. The film's cinematography is breathtaking not only because of its bare breasts. Venice is presented in a stunning way and you feel really there. Portias Wohninsel is incredibly beautiful and the lighting is always colored to match the moods of the scenes. <br /> <br /> The antisemetism in this movie / play is hard to see, especially at the end. Pacino, who falls to his knees and holds on to his religious artifact, is perhaps the strongest moment in his film since * The Godfather III (as Michael's daughter is shot down on the operatic steps). Is the game antisemetic? For sure. Is * Othello * racist? For sure. Take it for what it is: a commentary on the Elizabethan era, no commentary on today. <br /> <br /> Fiennes is not busy in the movie but is still a treat. The women in the movie are fine; Nobody really stood out here, but they fit well into the landscape. Jeremy Irons and Pacino are outstanding in the two juiciest roles, opponents to the end. I always had the feeling that Irons was undervalued (I still get chills when I hear his voice from * The Lion King *) and Pacino is Pacino.
