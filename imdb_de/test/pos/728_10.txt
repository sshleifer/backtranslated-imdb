I saw the movie when I was in high school a few years ago. I thought it was a movie that made you think that you wanted to see the power behind riddles. I think those people who do not like this movie are those who do not like to solve things, or those who get frustrated when they can not solve puzzles. It's a good movie based on a true story that took place in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario. So if you want a real record of things in the streets, watch this movie. And for those who only watch movies to show action holes and character weaknesses, you have to realize that the same stuff happens in real life. But that's all I want to say. The puzzles are good, some are hard, others are not. But the film also leaves more, more puzzles, more explanations, just more, more. I'd like to add that the ideas in this movie, the underground puzzle world, exist, but there is much more. You can not search for it to find it. Never looking for it would not be a way to find it. Leave your mark and it will find you.
