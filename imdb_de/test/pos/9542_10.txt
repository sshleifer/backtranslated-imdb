This wonderful movie has always moved me. The color, the convincing cast and the breathtaking landscape make a significant contribution to this. This production, in contrast to the later remake of Carlton, is rather impressionistic and rather presented from the children's own perspective. It focuses on certain episodes from the charming story of E. Nesbit, rather than trying to create a more documentary "wart-and-all" style that Carlton accepts. Above all, the outstanding music of the late Johnny Douglas underpins the story and adds additional emotional depth. The end result is a truly impressive combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively presents the moving story of The Railway Children. <br /> <br /> One nasty factor that viewers in this movie can think about is how things have changed since - and in many ways, for the worse! Yes, maybe many of us do not need to use outside toilets and travel in horse-drawn carriages, but what about the quality of life in general? Look at the cursed celebrities who are now "gracing" our television screens. Your language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. Consider also the fragile "today here, tomorrow gone" aspects of so many of today's "partnerships" plus all the single mothers - whatever happened to this institution "marriage" when people accepted the mistakes of others, but still stayed together, love her children? These details add extra spice to this wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I hope that with the end of the generations, children will continue to enjoy this movie. Not to mention certain adults!
