When I was told about this movie, I was not very happy to see it, although in the end it turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Very graphic (scenes from man to man, you do not see it all) not a gay theme film, if not ... <br /> <br /> the film is very humorous and contains some very funny parts. I recommend this movie, about three quarters through you really feel for the main characters, and this brings the whole movie together. <br /> <br /> once more, very nicely put together.
