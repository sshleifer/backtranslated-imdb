I found this movie pretty good and quite entertaining for a movie full of emotions. I agree with what another user wrote about the script, which is sympathetic to the three main characters. I think that's what made the movie good. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Kramer were villains and it was refreshing, I think, to see that two people essentially solve the problem on their own and eventually do the best for Billy. And although it was a bit strange, I actually liked the music in this movie as well. For some reason, the music seemed to be appropriate for the journey of the three main characters. This movie went pretty well and did not scribble, as is common in some emotionally heavy films. It was a serious situation, but not too serious. It just told the story in a simple way and it worked pretty well.
