I saw this movie for the first time last night and enjoyed every aspect of the movie - the dancing, the drama, the dialogue, the storyline, the script, and the overall atmosphere this movie produced. I would highly recommend it. Jennifer Gray gives an absolutely wonderful and first-class performance in her role as Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has a natural ability and a sense for dancing and she is beautiful and charming on the dance floor. The wonderful thing about baby, however, is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension in her character. Not only is this a film about dancing, but the writers have also given us the opportunity to show Baby the different emotions and feelings she experiences throughout the movie and to give us some insight into interacting with others in the camp Life. Gray portrays her character with such a reality and abundance that you feel deeply for baby as she experiences everything she does in this movie. Patrick Swayze is great in his role as Johnny and he really manages to make him character alive. He gives his character a comprehensive personality, a strong attraction and a great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Gray is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this film. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Rhodes is great in her role as Penny, and her portrayal of the torment she experiences is really powerful, giving the movie a scary dimension. The other members of the minor cast - Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor - deserve a special mention here. They also give wonderful and imaginative performances that give this film an extra dimension of quality drama and credibility that are wonderful to experience. Dancing is great and first class by all involved. <br /> <br /> The script and interaction between all the main characters is intriguing and powerfully binds the viewer. The plot, though extremely predictable, has more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful. <br /> <br /> In addition, the wonderful selection of music included in this film creates a truly magical atmosphere and a very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all different scenes. <br /> <br /> `Dirty Dancing 'is a really powerful, great and very appealing movie that deeply touches you and makes you dance with a wonderful feeling in heart and soul and an inspiration. I highly recommend it
