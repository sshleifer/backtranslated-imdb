I noticed that people asked if anyone had this show. I have all 26 episodes aired in the US and am willing to share it with anyone who is interested. All I need is for you to supply the VHS tapes or blank DVDs. I have them in both formats and pay the shipping costs. My e-mail address is creator67@pipinternet.net. Just send me an e-mail and your request. I will inform you and we can make the arrangements. The quality is very good and they are very enjoyable, especially if you have not been able to see them since the broadcast in the 60s. It was one of my favorite shows as a kid and had a very special place in my heart because it brings back many memories of my childhood and other shows like Ultraman and Astroboy. Peter
