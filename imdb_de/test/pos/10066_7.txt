Madonna steps in again and fails again! Who's That Girl was released just a year after the big flop by Shangai Surprise and two after the successful cult movie Desperately in Search of Susan. She decided to forget the previous movie's flop, unaware that it might be a flop. The film was badly accepted by American critics and audiences, while it was a success in Europe. Madonna explains that "some people do not want them to be successful as both a pop star and a movie star." The soundtrack album, in which she sings four tracks, is selling well and the title song single has become a hit, as has the World Tour around the world. The truth is that Madonna failed as an actress because the script was pretty weak. But it's not so bad, especially for those who like the 80s: it's such a dilapidated, garbage-packed, colorful and joyful action movie! In the end it is very funny to see it.
