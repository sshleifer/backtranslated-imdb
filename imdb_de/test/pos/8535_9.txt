I honestly did not think this movie would make me laugh and admire the great gore effects, kid, I was wrong! From start to finish, the film showed some great gore effects, accompanied by the parodies of other titles like "Evil Dead" and "Gremlins". This movie could be compared to Peter Jackson's works of art, though this movie is not as bloody as Braindead, but I'm sure those guys will do another Splatter movie.
