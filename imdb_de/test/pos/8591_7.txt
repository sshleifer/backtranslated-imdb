an excellent, thoughtfully produced historical drama - well played, artistically written and filmed in a way that conveys accurate visual images of Congo and more than a few moving moments, especially for those interested in the history of Africa and imperialism. However, a lot of valuable content is lost in the translation, and because names, acronyms, etc. are difficult to understand. I would therefore strongly recommend reviewing a neutral source such as Wikipedia to get a basic impression of the story (and subsequent story) presented before enjoying the movie. If you have the DVD version, there is also a useful historical background. There is a point at the end of the film where the name of a character, who then speaks with an American accent, is actually spent - a simple Google search for "Lumumbaa censorship" or something similar becomes a truly fascinating (and maybe also .) disturbing) in the production of this important film. Coupled with a little bit of external research, this film helps to teach dozens of other films related to Central / East Africa and / or imperialism, eg. Hotel Rwanda, shake hands with the devil, various adjustments of Conrad's Heart of Darkness and even "Ali" when Mohammed Ali visits Kinshasa.
