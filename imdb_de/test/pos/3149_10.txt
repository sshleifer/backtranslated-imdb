The reader is exceptionally well made and very cute. Each element of the piece helps to produce a purely emotional response to the script. Well played, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before the shoot, not even a read. The performances are a testament to fine, instinctive action in response to a well-written script. The work of the actresses was excellent and there was never any indication that her work would fall into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case. This film is an excellent example of how these low-budget contracts benefit both actors and filmmakers.
