I saw this movie for the first time about 3 years ago. I was shocked at how stupid the FBI was to avoid such a tragedy. It could easily have been prevented. This movie was amazing. <br /> <br /> Now that I have seen him after 9/11, I am appalled and can say that this could have been more easily prevented than most people would like to know. <br /> <br /> This movie is 100% true. <br /> <br /> In the last scene of the film, as the first-time thought-giver in a helicopter is jailed and flying over the towers, he makes a disturbing remark: that was laughed when he said it. "Next time, we'll bring it down * BOTH *." This was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. <br /> <br /> This film reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were conducted right in front of the FBI and the NYPD. It shows how the 1st and 4th changes are partly to blame for the attacks. <br /> <br /> I'm watching this movie now, knowing that both attacks could have been prevented.
