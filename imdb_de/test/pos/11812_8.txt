I really liked the movie a lot and found it very entertaining and dramatic. But I just had a question about the music is the movie. I could not find a soundtrack (if there is one). And I was wondering if anyone could tell me how the song is played as the boys go down the river on their way to New Orleans. I thought it was something like "My great escape", but I searched the internet for books, pretty much everything I could think of, and I can not find it anywhere. If someone could help, it would be very grateful. Many Thanks.
