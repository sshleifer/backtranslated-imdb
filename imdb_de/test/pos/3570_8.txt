This movie is a short time to spend entertainment, but who could not be made in any country has nothing "Colombian". If you are looking for the topics of supposedly Colombian or socially and politically correct cinema and what you call "endangered", then you are better off not seeing this film. Part of the drug trafficking or struggle does not refer to the farmer and worker, wing guerrillas and kidnapping policy. <br /> <br /> The corrupt police is a person who could be Mexican, Russian, Italian or Chinese, and also the protagonist of the personality, an Argentine photographer. It could be Venezuelans, Peruvians, or Philippians, and often "Boludo." In its parliaments, it could be replaced by another slang word from another country without changing personality or history. It is important that it is a very discreet story with pictures and real performances. Its quality is almost from TV movie, but good ones. That if a movie like this, if he deserves the support with public butt a bit or not, is a classic conversation "Mamerta".
