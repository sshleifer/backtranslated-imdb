This film is a wonderful example of the quality dramas Channel 4 and the BBC have produced over the years. Ted Danson delivers a powerful performance from a man tormented by memories no one can accept and a society that thinks he's crazy. It is a remarkable achievement of a man known for his role in Cheers, a TV comedy sitcom. The actors are all very well chosen, not least Mary Steenbergen, Danson's wife, who plays the role of Gulliver's wife in the film. Above all, the seamless and very delicate changes between our world and Gulliver's world make this film. The difference in perspective between giants and dwarfs, all played by real actors, is beautifully captured. A rare pleasure in cinematography and directing.
