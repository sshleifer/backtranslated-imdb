I have this Anne Rice book adaptation. While most of the film is shot here in Australia, it offers a lot of scenery and a fantastic filming environment. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has recently woken up from a long sleep and has decided to betray his vampire oath revealing himself to a band. When he becomes a popular movie icon, his fellow vampires go mad and plan his death. Meanwhile, Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), an orphaned member of the supernatural studies, who has an old vampire family tree, is deeply obsessed with Lestat. Their boss David (Paul McGann) understands their obsession and gets to know his obsession with the vampire Marius (Vincent Perez), who is an old vampire and the man who also made Lestat a vampire. Jesse receives Lestat's journal and reads about his first murder and an encounter with the Queen of the Damaged Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley, he receives word that not only angry vampires will be there, but Akasha as well. Meanwhile, Akasha has other plans. She goes to a vampire coven, a bar, and kills everyone on her way. With Lestat tried by Akasha with a royal and loving care, the old vampires, consisting of Marius and Jesse's Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin), plunder against her. Join Her Or Die? <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was awesome, it had great fighting scenes, great music and great locations. Unfortunately, Aaliyah died shortly before the movie premiere in a plane crash, but she looked impressive both on the set and on the sets. You can see it!
