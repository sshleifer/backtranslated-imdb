Wittikismen, colorful characters, family relationships, dealing with hardships, life with fun and humor. This movie has everything and much more. What a great story for every man (and woman), with a first-rate plot and script. It offers pure fun, lots of laughter, lots of smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family. Other reviewers describe the story. I will just offer this comparison teaser? It's part of "Best of Show," "Grumpy Old Men," "Millions," and several other comedy and life flicks in one. <br /> <br /> This gem of a movie most likely has a limited release and is probably not very available for rent. But now it is on DVD and I highly recommend it. If you like good, old-fashioned fun and entertaining family movies, you can not miss Manna from Heaven. This film is a safe remedy against the blues or to drive the darkness away on unpleasant weather days or hard times.
