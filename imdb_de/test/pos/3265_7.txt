It's hard to know what to do with this weird little Australian thriller - on the one hand, it's an entertaining little movie with a great sense of humor; On the other hand, he lacks only the certain something that ensures that the film never protrudes beyond its borders and thus remains trapped in the merely "interesting" area. Nonetheless, Two Hands is a well-plotted film that juggles multiple stories at the same time, allowing for several small highlights throughout the film, and in turn helping to keep the movie boring. The absurdity of the action, the strong Australian accents and the bizarre characters contribute to the fact that the film is also entertaining. The plot follows the story of a young porter who believes he will move on to larger things after accepting a job from the local Kingpin. He does not; The job only gets him in trouble when he wants to swim and leaves tens of thousands lying on the beach, who is stolen by a few children who spend their time shopping. Not everything is rosy for our hero; Who has to find the money or face the consequences? <br /> <br /> The film consists of a cast of unknowns. At least that was in 1999, when Heath Ledger is something of a name nowadays. He does not impress too much here, as his performance usually consists of one note and he does not provide a convincing lead. He agrees with the movie that he is Australian and looks na√Øve. But beyond that, he's not the best track I've ever seen in a movie. If you ask me, Bryan Brown gave the best performance here. He does not have much time on screen, but he steals every scene he's in and gives the movie a lot of humor. However, it has nothing to do with the best sequence that takes the form of what is probably the most hilarious bank robber ever caught in the film. Overall, I can recommend this film to people who enjoy quirky thrillers; for the weirdness is abundant, and the way the events turn for the bizarre is gratifying; However, if you are not a fan of this movie, I can not really say that Two Hands makes your boat float. It's not a must, but if it's your thing and you get a chance to see it, you probably will not completely regret it.
