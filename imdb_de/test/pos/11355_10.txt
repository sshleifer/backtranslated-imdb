It's easy to see why many people consider In the Mood for Love to be Wong Kar -ai's best film. The film's lessened appeal, centered on studying a relationship brought about by an emotional alarm, is retreading into the Happy Together area, but without the hyperkinetic patchwork of shattering movie stocks and hypersaturated sequences becoming a trademark have been from Kar-Wai's films since Chungking Express. As with Soderbergh's The Limey, this is another kind of curiosity for Kar-Wai. where dialogue and action are abandoned through mood and composition to create a story about two delicate lives in a seemingly limiting emotional stasis. <br /> <br /> It is a testimony to the genius of Kar-Wai, to whom he is able to bring such a simple story to resonance. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-Zhen (Maggie Cheung) move side by side in the same apartment building. He is a journalist who dreams of publishing martial arts novels, and she is a secretary to a shipping company. Their possible coupling is obvious from the beginning, but the joy of it is that Kar-Wai makes such a journey ambiguous with his great masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The key to the film's success is the use of Kar-Wai of the interior, with foreground and background levels similar to Polanski's works. During the incredibly sensual first half of the film, Kar-Wai Leung and Cheung isolate themselves within shots that the second person in a conversation is never visible. Here, Kar-Wai deals with the environment and space, creating a tight emotional dynamic between his characters. It also says that Kar-Wai never chooses to focus on the physicality of Mo-Wan and Li-zhen's spouses. Their faceless partners are noticeably absent in the film as they cultivate their own love relationships. This does not mean that In the Mood for Love due to Kar-Wai is a limiting experience. He manages to flood his movie with wide splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sounds. There is an attitude in which Cheung's slow, sensuous ascent via a metaphorical staircase changes into Leung's descent of the same stairwell; Their movements complement each other perfectly by spelling out the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. Their souls have joined, but they still have to unite physically. The erotic shift of these scenes is both intriguing and frustrating, as two lovers crossed by a star reject the physical accomplishment of their modest fidelity. Other scenes in the film are interrupted by short slow motion shots of Cheung Erotic she moved through their inner environment and set Mike Galasso's hauntingly beautiful score. Cheung's clothes are a wonderful compliment to her appearance as she moves slowly through her surroundings. Their movements are slowly becoming an inevitable merger between Li-Szhen and her dream-lover, even though the seduction process seems to be completely subconscious. <br /> <br /> When I make it that way, these two characters are more like two birds releasing pheromones, it's probably not that far-fetched from a statement. The close connection these two characters have with their interiors is almost as intense as their relationship to the outside world. The film rarely moves into an outdoor space, and when the camera does, it is usually common to point through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like caged animals. Kar-Wai continues to annoy us when the lovers are close enough to touch each other and shatter the couple's closeness by being shot through mirrors or through gaps in garments in a closet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to her love lust and often triggers a gentle rainstorm over the characters as their bodies glide close to each other. Kar-Wai's atmospheric atmospheric footage of a waterfall permitted Leung Lai Yu-Fai undergoes a cathartic release in Happy Together, even though Leslie Cheung's Ho Po wing was not there to enjoy him with him. At the end of this film, love was so inextricably linked to the war, that a muted declaration of love from a third man signaled Yu-Fai's realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if he did not bring him back , Mo-Wan's journey ends inside a ruinous temple. His own emotional impoverishment compares favorably with the political climate of his country, and the absence of Li-szhen is only tolerated by the fact that Kar-Wai Mo-Wan allows a kind of liberation. Mo-Wan covers an ancient myth and his secret release into a gap in the temple allows him to live his days with the hope that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose.
