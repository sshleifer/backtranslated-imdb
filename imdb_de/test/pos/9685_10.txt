This movie was marginal in gross humor ... I absolutely can not believe these people can get away with it. Johnny Knoxville did not cross the line ... he pounded everywhere! That was better than the first one ... definitely! What I found out about the first movie was that the Shenanigans looked like they were on TV. Show. NOT THIS TIME!!! They made a full 180 degree flip ... the whole cast is so great at what they do, and not the stunts were crazy ... but the music basically fit into every situation ... GOOD WORK !!! ! If you see it, be sure to use the bathroom before going to the theater. Keep a strong belly and make sure your drink does not spill out of your nose.
