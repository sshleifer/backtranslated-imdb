Why does everyone have the feeling that they have to take this film constantly? It's cute and funny (exactly what it should be). Madonna did not want to prove herself as an Oscar-Calliber artist with this movie anyway! She just did what the character demanded, and she did it well. I loved her in this movie. it's my second favorite madonna movie after evita. The soundtrack is also excellent. It's no better or worse than some cheesy 80's strip. For all the critics, just do not take it so seriously and you may enjoy watching it. Madonna is a goddess !!!
