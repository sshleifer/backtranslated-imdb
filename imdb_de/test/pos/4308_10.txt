"Miller's Office" is a movie that many will watch and enjoy until the end, while others will stop within five minutes. It's a spoof of detective films with all the twists and turns; The action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city reminiscent of Batman's Gotham City (look closely at the streets, buildings, the police car, the criminals, etc.). It's also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters like Muller's secretary and lover of Vitasek (the actor who plays Mueller's assistant) who do their best to sing, if not very successful. <br /> <br /> The Occupied Rooms The characters have their own presence in the movie, like the decadent Blue Box (in Vienna there is a real club by that name) where you can see a sailor entering Girl in the background meets, M端ller's apartment with the black paint on the wall walls and the dirty kitchen, M端llers office with the sweet image of his assistant, etc. The humorous moments in the film are diverse and include "flat in the face" - humor, like M端ller zum Furz His assistant's face, the prostitute, who charges M端ller extra for orgasm, the ridiculous outfits of the racketeers, etc. <br /> <br /> A legendary movie from the 80s, especially for those who are interested in Austrian or German Cinema interested.
