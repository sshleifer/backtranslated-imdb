I did it too. When I saw the band for the first time, I immediately dismissed them without hearing the music. Then one day, just out of curiosity, I bought the CD and fell in love with it. So I bought the video. Keep your lunch kids, that will not be pretty! The video was excellent - a great opportunity to hear the music, see some of the promo videos and meet the band ... even though I do not * yet * know how to handle these masks! A must for all fans of the band and generally for alternative music
