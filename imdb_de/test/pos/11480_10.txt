I think this film is a complete masterpiece - actually, I am the best work of Fernando Fragata and undoubtedly the best of all Portuguese films. I do not think you can find such a "zero budget" movie that is as impressive and amazing as this one. <br /> <br /> The direction is perfected at an incredibly fast pace and the music composed by Fragata is mostly excellent. The story is both scary and humorous, and it's certainly an advanced study of the old saying, "Misery loves company," a kind of situation linked to an overwhelming mystery. A more than perfect recipe to stick the eyes of the audience on the screen from the first to the last image. <br /> <br /> It was called Neo-Hitchcock and I agree. Much like the best Hitchcocks, I was guessing throughout the movie, and most of my suspicions were far from what was cleverly revealed in the end.
