I really chose this movie for my husband who works on the radio. I thought it would be more of a movie he would enjoy and tell, even though he was from the eighties. This movie really attracts you. Sometimes you just want to strangle the presenter Barry. Sometimes you just want to send some of the bigots who go to a concentration camp. Sometimes Barry really sorry about you, because he's gotten really big for his jeans, if you know what I mean. It was on the drama channel of Encore. I think that's a true story. If you really love drama, you will love it, even if you do not know everything about the broadcast business. If you're a fan of Alec Baldwin watching him, you should not see it. His role is really a bit in this movie.
