I did not really know what to expect from this movie - and was pleasantly surprised. I picked it up because I recently came across Norman Reedus and try to find more movies in which he found himself. <br /> <br /> I'm not that enthusiastic about Hustler movies or Confilmen, but I have to say, it got me hooked in a few minutes. Probably because I could not stop figuring out who was pushing. This film is stylish and fast, with a story that is believable thanks to its location and fantastic performances. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed by most of the film, I have to say that Dagmara Dominczyk was just outstanding. <br /> <br /> Give me a chance - it's a really funny movie.
