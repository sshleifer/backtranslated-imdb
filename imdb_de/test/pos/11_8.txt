I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I entered the theater, I was not really in the mood at the time. It's a bit like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right attitude to thoroughly enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what slowed my mind down. The trailers looked good, but the water theme gave me a bad look back at Kevin Costner's latest movie, Waterworld. Despite the promise Ashton Kutcher made in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not quite sold out to him. Something about the guy just annoys me. Probably has to do with his simian facial features. <br /> <br /> It took about two minutes for my fears to subside and my concerns faded. The film immediately throws us into a strained rescue mission, and I was tighter tied than Kenny Rogers' orange facelift. My concern briefly caught on Kutcher's first appearance because too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a tough toothpick in the mouth and a grin that would make George Clooney proud? Yes, we understand it. I was totally ready to hate him. <br /> <br /> But then he had to do a pretty strong job and force me to mitigate my bumps. <br /> <br /> Damn you, monkey man! The Guardian is a mix of exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor and solid acting. A movie that I dare the majority of the audience love. You can argue about the clich√©s, predictability, and the rare moments of overcooked alcohol, but none of that decreases the entertainment value. <br /> <br /> I had a bad feeling that the pace of starting Costner slowed down too much the training of young people, on the contrary, the training could be the most interesting aspect of the movie. Coast Guard lifeguards are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen. I think the inmates see what they are going through and how difficult it is to make it very informative and a good way to bring the audience here - recognized group. <br /> <br /> Do you have what it takes to become a lifeguard? Just think about it-you'll have to do dangerous missions in cold, dark, rough water, and then you'll have to fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia and lack of oxygen as you try to help stranded, panicked people who depend on you for it To survive. And if all of this is not bad enough, sometimes you can not save everyone, so you'll have to make the difficult choice of who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> Man, who wants all this responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what it really was like for these guys, and who would have thought I owed an Ashton Kutcher / Kevin Costner movie for the training? <br /> <br /> The Guardian not only does a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero, but luckily, we also enjoy entertaining its paying customers. <br /> <br /> The GIST <br /> <br /> moviegoers who want a glimpse into the nature of a daring mid-ocean rescue mission could give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free, but if I had paid, I would have felt that I had earned my money.
