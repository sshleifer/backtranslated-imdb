This is really a kung fu classic. This film seems to influence martial arts films for decades. The Spanish guitar background music, the competing schools, the incredibly high jumps on the rooftops, the interception of spears, cheating at tournaments, the secret training for an exotic karate technique, subjects of patience and perseverance and much more were later copied to films like " Karate Kid "(1984)," Hero "(2002)," Kill Bill Volume 2 "(2004) and" Kung Fu Hustle "(2004). <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see this movie for the first time in 1972, shortly after it was released, just before kung fu movies became mainstream and before Bruce Lee became a household name. I saw it with two of my buddies in a downtown San Diego theater frequented by sailors, and although the scenes of glowing red hands and hollowed-out eyeballs made a lot of laughter, the audience was obviously there, as was ours small group. It was a very memorable movie for me. Decades later, I could still remember certain scenes, even after I forgot the movie title. This film is special to me now because one of the two friends I saw with him for the first time (sailor Kenneth Lee Hines of Kitty Hawk) has since died. Therefore, this movie serves as a reminder of the day before we took judo and karate lessons in the following years. <br /> <br /> Regarding the kung fu movies, I would rate this movie as 10/10. However, since I have to keep an eye on the bigger movie audience, I objectively rate it 8/10 because of obvious technical flaws. I only recommend that neophyte viewers consider these technical defects as proof of their vintage nature and authenticity, and then cheerfully enjoy their testosterone-laden chaos.
