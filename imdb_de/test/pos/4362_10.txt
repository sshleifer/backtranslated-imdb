Little Dieter Needs to Fly was my first film during the 1999 Gothenburg Film Festival. Since I was extremely tired that evening, I was reluctant to see it, but the overwhelming overall rating of 9 here at IMDB made me go there , It was adorable to experience the life of Dieter Denglers through his own storytelling. <br /> <br /> SEE IT! And if possible ... see it in a movie theater!
