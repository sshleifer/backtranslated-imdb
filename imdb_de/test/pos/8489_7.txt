Ray lives from Taylor Rockford, Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong and Sharon Warren. Written by Taylor Hackford and James L. White. Rating *** <br /> <br /> "Hit the street, Jack, and do not come back, no more, no more, no more, no more!" Who would have thought that this immortal line, which has almost become a healing mantra for broken relationships in popular culture, was thought about a battle of love? Ray Charles was a genius. And if there was something he knew, breathed and lived; it was music. In a life of acute poverty, a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs and painful affairs; Ray still found moments when inspiration struck him from nothing and words and notes took their own form to form an instant eternal classic! <br /> <br /> There are some lives that deserve to be transformed on the screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. It is almost a shock to learn that this project had no studio support until it was completed! This support was likely to come after the first screenings, which praised Jamie Foxx's performance as a surefire Oscar winner in subdued voices. Jamie Foxx as Ray almost convinces us that it's actually Ray Charles who performs on screen and not an acting actor! From the crooked omniscient smile to the stooped gait of a disabled person, but of a man dancing through his demons. Ray was a complicated man. He never demanded compassion and seldom showed it himself. He was a smart businessman and ensured his success at any cost, sometimes for the price of losing his loved ones. He never apologized for his inhuman behavior, always claiming that he loved his family, which we believe is his accomplishment. He liked sex. It was that easy! But among all, there was also a Ray who was afraid of the dark. Imagine the horrors of a blind man before darkness! His fear was because of his guilt. Ray was convinced that he was the cause of his brother's death, and his entire life was trying to save himself. Ray was an outsider who blended gospel with jazz, an outrageous blasphemous practice in the 1950s. But his intentions should not be instigated. He just practiced the only way he knew how to approach God! <br /> <br /> It's hard to capture an eventful life like Ray's, and maybe the movie fails. We can never really get close to Ray. We only know him as well as we see him. His relationships, especially with Margie Hendricks (Regina King), are not studied in detail. And the script barely goes over Della Bea, Ray's wife, who everyone knows, was by his side a rock. And the biggest mistake of all is the hurried, almost abrupt climax. It's as if the director suddenly realized that he was out of stock and called for a pack-up! Nevertheless, 'Ray' is definitely recommended for a flawless performance by Jamie Foxx and an outstanding star ensemble. The songs and the age create a sense of nostalgia, and we have the real feeling that the film is made with sincerity. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Note- 'Ray' will be nominated for this year's Oscars in six categories, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (Jamie Foxx). <br /> <br /> Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Bad ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> February 19, 2005
