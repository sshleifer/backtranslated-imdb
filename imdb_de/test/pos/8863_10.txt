The Thing by John Carpenter is undoubtedly the best horror movie ever made. Not only that, it's also one of my favorite personal movies of all time. What makes the movie so great? It's hard to get my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions when everything seems to fit. The movie is even superior to aliens when it creates a kind of atmospheric hell. The fact that it's not just about the blood (which is wonderful, by the way), but also creating a paranoia unmatched in movies. A truly wonderful movie that is revered by all horror fans and anyone who has a great taste for movies.
