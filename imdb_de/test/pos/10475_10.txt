Some have commented that the subtitles in this movie are not a problem - I want to make a distinction - the annoying facial expressions and the subtle interactions between the characters are such that you can not afford to distract your eyes for a fraction of a second. I tried to look at the DVD in English to overcome this problem (do not make that mistake, the result is a travesty). The only way to get the full benefit is to see two or three times in a row, so you know, and then ignore the subtitles. An acting master class - not in dialogue, but in body language. <br /> <br /> It's the little things - the postmaster / shopkeeper ejects his chest and takes off his cap before sending a letter from France! The amused expression of the general as his enjoyment of a pile of perfect grapes triggers a biblical relationship with a depth that deserves to be there. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is fantastic and the gloomy minimalist village with its washed-out color emphasizes the splendor of the festival when it comes. I have a friend who claims to be descended from the Borgias, and the family's motto is, "If it's worth doing, it's worth being overblown" - Amen. <br /> <br /> I laugh out loud every now and then crying I watch this movie
