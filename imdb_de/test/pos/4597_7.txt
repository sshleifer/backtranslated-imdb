Idiocracy, as a social satire, is as good as Office Space, but with a wider scope. To criticize this film as pueril is a bit too short, I think. There are certainly fart jokes, etc., but they are not supposed to be really fun for the audience - they define the state of "culture" in the world visited by Joe in 2500 AD. As background for the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakened. The real humor of the film lies in the many visual gazes and attitudes that exist in this future society and are only a shade of what we encounter in our daily lives and should serve as a warning. My personal favorite is the presentation of Fox News. The subtle brilliance of the film lies in the fact that it also digs for "intelligent" people and average Joe's like the protagonists. Notice the times in the movie where Joe and Rita almost unconsciously adapt to the idiot around them, and you realize that idiocracy is not designed to focus on any group of people, but on the culture of idiocy in general , I do not know what to say about Fox's behavior in publishing this movie, but if it's not in your local theater, challenge it. We all have to watch this movie, if not for the social commentary, at least for the fart jokes ...
