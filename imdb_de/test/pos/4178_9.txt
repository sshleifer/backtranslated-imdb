For a long time I declined, a fan of the TV series "The Monkees", "Head" because it was not about the characters of the TV series, which were warm and wonderful. Instead, "Head" was referred to as a cynical, dark film. Finally, curiosity tended to give way. Of course I did not find a new episode of the TV show, but a fascinating film that appeals to my dark side. <br /> <br /> I have always been fascinated by dreams, and "Head" was very similar to seeing someone else's dream, with incomplete hints of stories and a small detail at the end of a scene, which led to it that the film was moving in a new direction, very much in a dreamlike stream of consciousness. The unfinished stories really keep my imagination going wild! <br /> <br /> The film also features very striking, beautiful cinematography, the epitome of which is the black and white, white and black look of "Dad's Song". The music is haunting, especially the lush arrangement of "The Porpoise Song". ("The Porpoise Song" is the favorite song of my dark side, while my bright side prefers "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.") <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the TV series would have something of "Head "Drama, intrigue and intensity used. But "Head" could have used the warmth, humor, and friendship of the TV show.
