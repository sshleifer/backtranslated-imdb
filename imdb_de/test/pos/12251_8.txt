This is a love story against the background of television news. The three main stars William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle while working in the Washington office of a television station. <br /> <br /> Tom Grunick (Hurt) is the handsome reporter groomed be a star. Jane (Hunter) is the producer who realizes that Tom lacks intellectual weaknesses to be a true journalist but he still falls in love with him. Aaron Altman (Brooks) is the man who shares her views on journalistic standards who really loves her. Holly Hunter was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award, but lost to Cher (Moonstruck!) And was robbed! This is Hunter's movie. Her character Jane is smart, ruthless and totally driven. She is also funny neurotic. Your performance is perfect. All you have to do is look at her face while watching the video of Tom's interview with a rape victim. The scales are literally out of their sight. <br /> <br /> Wiliam Hurt's performance is less noticeable. He plays a man who is aware that he is a scammer and cheater, but is smart enough to know that his rise will be relieved by people like Jane. He gives little hints to a man who is extremely calculating. The film comments on celebrity, journalism, integrity and commercial pressure on news in a medium that focuses on the media's bottom line. It was predicted that news would be suppressed and standards slowly lowered by commercial pressure. Think about it: This movie was released before the end of the Cold War and before the rise of reality TV. Still, he predicted that the news would be dumb. The release of Paris Hilton from prison was treated like a big message! To see how prophetic this movie is, just have a look at your evening news and notice the set, graphics, and moderators. Tom Grunick and his clones are really alive!
