As a fan of gangster films from old Warner brothers, I had to try it out, it was the second best movie in the adventure classic DVD, which also had one of my favorite films, Scott of the Antarctic, which became a good movie in 1939. Brothers films have a great cast: John Garfield, Claude Rains, Ann Sheridan, and the dead-end kids, who later became known as monster pictures as the Bowery boys. Well, a boxer (Garfield) is framed for a murder he did not commit. He is on the run and is being followed by a tough New York detective (Claude Rains) ending up at a fruit collection run by a pretty woman (Gloria Dickson) and the dead-end kids (Huntz Hall, Leo Gorcey, Benard Punsley, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Gabreil Dell), he later returns to boxing, but tries to maintain a low profile. Director was the famous director Busby Berkley, who directed timeless classics like the 42nd Street, Goldgiggers of 1933 and 35, the Footlight Parade and many others. I want to call Platinum DVD / Video to release a lot of low-priced DVDs like Adventure Classics (see my Scott Antarctica) I give them a criminal 10 out of 10, awesome movie. I have to point out that I only saw two John Garfield films, this and body and soul. I thought he was a very good actor.
