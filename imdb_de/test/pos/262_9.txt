It's just one of those movies, you either love it or hate it, my girlfriend and I loved it, my brother hired it, and he hated it, said it was too flashy and colloquial, then he's just going to big action movies so that probably did not disappoint him enough explosions. There were some great new talents (I had never heard of the leads anyway)? Brady (the director's brother?) Was especially good. I played a real dick in the beginning and thought he would never save himself, but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created, and in the end I was really busy with him. A very surprising movie with all my heart. If you can live without body count and explosions, this movie is very original. Yashimo Brixton in the UK.
