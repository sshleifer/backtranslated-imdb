LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, engaging and emotionally charged HBO TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also appears in a minor role). This joyous filming experience focuses on Santiago-Hudson's childhood watchman Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, generous black woman who ran a boarding house in the New York State in the 1950s. Nanny was a one-woman social institution whose boarding-house was filled with drunks, cripples, cripples, drug addicts, outsiders, and everyone else in the city who needed a handover instead of a handover. At the heart of the story is Nanny's relationship with the young Ruben (beautifully played by Marcus Franklin), a boy whose divorced parents could not properly educate the boy. Nanny picked him up. S. Epatha Merkeson, wasted for years Lieutenant Van Buren's thankless role in NBC's LAW & ORDER (NBC's LAW & ORDER) is portrayed in a powerhouse performance as Nanny, the neighborhood's mother figure whose boarding house is a symbol of oppressed blacks in their city became.

Behind Merkeson is an impressive All-Star cast, including Terrance Howard (brilliant and heartbreaking as Nanny's husband), Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael K. Williams, Jeffrey Wright and Henry Simmons Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def and Hill Harper as adult Rubens.
