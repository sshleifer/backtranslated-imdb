I've "only" seen about 200 Hong Kong movies in my time, and I have to say that this movie is one of my top favorites. The plot is not only appealing (and in a sense surprising, which is rare for any movie these days), but the chemistry between the two main characters is also excellent. First-class casting! And while even the most serious HK movies often add a sense of humor between drama and action, which often takes a beating on the mood, the jokes here are kept subtle and woven into the plot, which even improves the relationship between the characters. The music is also very well done, and the two main themes are very nice. With the release of the HK special edition they even cleaned the picture (first publication was grainy) and the subtitles, even if the quality of the translation is still missing (there nothing new). All in all, if you have to watch a HK movie that is not directed by John Woo or has Chow Yun Fat in it, this should be on your short list! A really fascinating and entertaining watch!
