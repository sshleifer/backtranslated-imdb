Yes, I noticed that there are 347 other comments. I think that's a good sign for a movie, even if some are negative. I saw this movie two and a half times. I love it and would take another look at it. It's very smart, but I can understand why some people hate it. They do not get their charm. Yes, I have a weird taste in movies, but that's a great movie. Some lines are as fast as the whole scene in the Chinese restaurant. I started to die and laughed. that and when he spoke in the assembly line with the contact. Jude Law was wonderful, though it was funny, he tried to disguise his wonderful accent. In any case, I do not consider myself the film goddess as a critic of this film. If you have nothing better to do than write pseudo-intellectual film commentary on films that you hate online, I'm sorry. Why do not you write about movies that you like, like me? I just love how everything is connected. It lets you guess, even if you guess wrong. The end was interesting and not over the top. it was just smart. I would not compare it to the Matrix because I think people get the wrong idea then. I went to this movie and expected nothing except jude law and a sci-fi. I was blown away. I have no idea about other films from Cronenburg, but I love it of my own merit. another clever thing was predicting with the dog. definitely watch this movie.
