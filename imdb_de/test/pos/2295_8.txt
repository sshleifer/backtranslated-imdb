SIR. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a "light sports comedy", it truly has a heartwarming core that is as human and universal as some of Capra's best. At the action level, there is the paradox of baseball, a fine old American game as played in Japan - flipped over, with American values ​​and Japanese values ​​flowing into the game. (Some of the superficial "sports comedies" result from Jack's uncomprehending disbelief of how "Basa-Boru" is played in Japan.) They also have a main character presented as an aging baseball star aging above the mountain, but who is actually pretty immature - Pro Ball allowed him to postpone growing up. And you have a main character who irresistibly resists the changes in his life that are forced upon him and refuses to accept the curveball that life has given him, in the midst of a new land a new manager, a new team, and a new friend who greets him and tries to accept him. Sounds like heavy stuff? Not really. It's a charming "Clash of Cultures" comedy that takes place nationally, athletically, romantically and professionally. But if you find it sensitive enough, you will also find a great story about a man who has to give up his immaturity and grow up too late in life (causing some personal pain) and succeed in places he would never have expected , I love the story, but I also have a lot of respect for Selleck's performance. he bares (literally) to portray an ugly American who insults people and throws tantrums in public, then lets us into that figure to understand his dismay. It does not hurt if you're a big fan of Takakura Ken like me. SIR. BASEBALL is a surprising story about the loss of innocence.
