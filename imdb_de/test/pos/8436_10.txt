This movie is definitely the best movie of Fonda. The plot is amazing, the acting is incredible and the direction is incredible. An eternal classic, this should have won the best picture, not kramer Vs. Kramer Although it was not even nominated. Jack Lemmon and Micheal Douglas are also the best. One of the best finishes ever. If you have not seen this movie, you can not borrow it. Should have been on Afis Top 100. Do not just see it for Fonda, but for everything
