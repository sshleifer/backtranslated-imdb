Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard - Did you expect a funny movie that the whole family can enjoy? These and other directors were obviously selected because they did not follow the mainstream but created it. For those who complain that they have not kept to the original story of the opera - how often does the music in a movie relate directly to what's going on in the movie? It depends on the mood. I believe that the directors of these films did this: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. Mostly they succeed wonderfully. With all these operas, who will they all like? We could have used more Beverly Sills. <br /> <br /> What is art (even opera) without some naked women?
