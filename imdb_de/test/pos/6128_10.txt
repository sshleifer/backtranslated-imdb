Of course, my rating of 10/10 only applies if you are prepared to pay off in full *. Because you know that only John Waters can do that. In "Pink Flamingos" (his directorial debut), he portrays two imprisoned families in battle to see who can be the dirtiest man. What makes Divine famous in the end answers the question pretty well. But other than that, the movie is basically an excuse to shock people with what you normally imagine. You should have a strong belly to watch this movie. Even some of the lines are pretty stunning. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise avoid this movie as you would with the Ebola virus!
