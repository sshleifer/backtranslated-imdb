Not a great show, but better than most other sitcoms. It is reminiscent of shows like Married With Children and Roseanne when they go to places that are not traditionally treated in sitcoms. It's funny sometimes, even if you ignore the laughter, but not rousingly funny. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters are pretty funny (the gay friend) and some of the other drop-ins. This is also one of the few shows where the characters (with apology for slaughtered spelling) are actually effective and witty. Absolutely not. It's definitely better than a show like Til Deat (probably the worst TV show of all kinds). Oh and the mother does not look bad and the Hilary character is a little hottie
