To understand "crash course" in the right context, you need to understand the 80s on television. Most TV shows did not make sense. The sitcom beat the drama by at least 3 to 1. They still found out where the lines were to cross them. (TV shows like "Hail to the Chief" were a bold step!) In this movie, "Crash Course", developed for the TV, all-star actors from all the classics of the 80s were united: "227", "Family Ties", " Who is the boss? ", Et al. The directors had to have had a certain preference for these all-star films. Nevertheless, this film offered very light fare and a simplified view of heroism and maturity. And that is not bad sometimes. Viva Soleil Moon Frye.
