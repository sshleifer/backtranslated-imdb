Surface was great, I do not know how many Mondays I survived at school just because I was thinking about the new episode of Surface. I loved it, sometimes I had to call home and tell my mother to pick it up for me. I was pretty angry when I heard that it had been canceled. So you can have your new Tina Fay comedy (you could not pay me for it, I think the commercials made me more stupid). I'll miss Surface's Monday night repair, even though my sister made fun of me. although kidnapped looks good and they still have L & O: SVU (I think I still have to check it) (I just wrote the two lines because they said I need ten lines).
