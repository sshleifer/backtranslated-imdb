I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I've always been in love with Ms. Hayworth's look, so I thought I'd try. <br /> <br /> This could be the best showcase for the talented Mrs. Hayworth. She never looked more beautiful in a movie (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she is the sex symbol par excellence). Rita is more than adeptly supported by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy may be dated, but it's still pretty amusing. Kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances and dances out of a window with the picture of himself. <br /> <br /> But Rita drives the whole movie. An excellent cast with Otto Kruger and the always wonderful, wise Eve Arden does not hurt. <br /> <br /> Rita sings, Rita dances and looks incredibly beautiful! The music may be classic, but the lyrics to most of the tunes are pretty smart. <br /> <br /> I think this movie works better than 'Gilda', which I consider a flawed movie. To Hayworth's merit, she also comes "Gilda," and Gilda brings out every red-blooded male madman. <br /> <br /> The movie lasts well after all these years. Much leg sweets for the male audience is a nice bonus!
