Intelligently written, well played, intense and exciting. This show lives in the real world, not as fantastic as "24" (and by the way I'm a big fan of 24). It has credible characters and in many ways is much smarter than most of the others in the genre. It tries to present both sides of Islam. So far I have looked at the first 4 episodes and find the story more balanced. The terrorists are more complex and not one-dimensional. Because of this balance, the terrorists are more frightening than the typical villains portrayed in film and on television. Last but not least, the hero is really heroic without being a cartoon. I can recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of 24 and so on.
