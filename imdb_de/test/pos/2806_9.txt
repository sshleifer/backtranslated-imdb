I have to say that this movie was produced excellently and surpasses the rating as a typical science fiction movie! I enjoyed it .. it's a sci-fi movie if you want a thriller to watch a different channel. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellent produced by Scot Vandiver, one of Sci-Fi's best producers! OK, the special effects were not great, but what a great cast! A little more money could have been used for effects, but that in turn has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you do not like these types of movies. Movies like Mission Impossible and Braveheart are great, but these are not sci-fi movies done .. let them out!
