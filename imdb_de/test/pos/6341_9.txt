I have just seen "Return from the lonely pigeon" and it was very good! I've seen a lot of negative comments on that and do not think the viewers are real! In the television / film business it is difficult to get all the actors back for a second or third part. WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE OTHER MINISTRIES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO YOU. This production was first-rate with the original music score, and the actors put their hearts into it (you can say that). If you want to watch lonely d. with Robert Duvall and Tommy L. J. then look at the original. Return to L.D. Did not have so much joke and takes on a more serious tone, but is still totally fascinating. From the touching moments to the villains, this winner is a winner! "Wonderful !!!"
