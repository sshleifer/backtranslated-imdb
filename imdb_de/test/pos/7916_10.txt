Alexander Nevsky is rightly recorded as a cinematic masterpiece. However, it has aged very badly. People decide not to mention this and talk about the big battles and the great music. The sound effects may have been good, but apart from the unsuspecting organ, all sounds are audible. I may be filmed by movie fans, but I'm sure Alexander Nevsky's modern-day viewer will agree that the blatant propaganda and horrific music are affecting the film. I have given this movie 10/10 because it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. However, it has its great parts. The costumes of the Teutonic knights are great and the fight scenes are pretty good for the time. However, it is a masterpiece that shows his age.
