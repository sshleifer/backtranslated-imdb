HAIR's 1979 film sound was loosely based on the notorious 1960s Broadway musical, which became famous for its notorious nude scene. The stage musical is little more than a group of skits lined up with some amusing musical numbers. For the film director Milos Foreman (who won an Academy Award for directing ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the authors have taken the basic requirements of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more "user-friendly" Screen. In the film, the naive farmboy Claude Hooper Buchowski (John Savage) is in the army and decides to spend a few days in New York, where he meets a group of aging hippies (Treat Williams, Dorsey Wright, Annie Golden, Don Dacus) who involves him in a group of crazy mishaps, including the persecution of a nasty social girl (Beverly D'Angelo). The story is broken down into a series of vignettes ranging from ridiculous to sublime, but all were photographed with a skilful use of locations in New York and imaginatively staged music numbers (superbly choreographed by the legendary Twyla Tharp). Treat Williams illuminates the screen as Berger, the unconventional and free-spirited hippie, who does his best to make Claude loosen up, and scene after scene of Savage is like Claude, who gives Claude a lovely sweetness. Annie Golden is a charmer because Jeannie, the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by Wright or Dacus, does not know who the father is and does not care. There's one outstanding musical number after another here ... "Aquarius" is a tour of Central Park, which involves dancing horses ... Treat Williams disturbs a fancy dinner party in "I Got Life" ... " Black Boys / White Boys "With the deceased Nell Carter and Ellen Foley praising the men's ethnic virtues, and" Easy to be Hard "is a powerful rendition of one of the best songs by original actress Cheryl Barnes, Wright's ex-girlfriend and mother This is a beautifully photographed, well sung, sung and danced psychedelic acid journey of a movie that has to be seen and seen once and trigger multiple sightings, as this Blendler has too much to offer in a show to catch.
