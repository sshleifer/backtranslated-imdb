Spoilers in front of us. <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film of the late Stanley Kubrick. This is not a movie you see to be entertained or amused. Instead, it offers you a banquet full of food for thought, images that will stay in your memory long after the movie. It's a movie that you could meditate on. <br /> <br /> The film purposely offers us more questions than it can answer, turning it into riddles and riddles, but leaving the viewer with awe and reverence (that allows it to be in the process of contemplation involved, the enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the part of the audience). The questions he raises are great and threatening as far as the origins and fate of humanity are concerned. The ultimate place in cosmic design and the existence or lack of creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself. <br /> <br / > The first of the films Four Quartets gives us a clear insight into the past of the species. We see our distant ancestors, half-apes, almost starving. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts have almost starved to death. An alien object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by the presence of tools and violence. They turn into carnivores overnight, and when two tribes meet near a source of water, the trunk, which has the ability to make tools and credibility, destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the victorious tribe, who is empowered by the first technical remnants, triumphantly throws the bone he uses as a weapon into the air. We see the bone turning into a floating satellite containing nuclear weapons. We soon learn that the world is being torn apart by nuclear paranoia. The features inspired by the look of the monument that once made us survive endanger our very existence. <br /> <br /> Once again humanity is in crisis. Once again, the sinister presence of the black monolith will support humanity in the next step in its evolution. When exploring the moon, a monolith is discovered that is identical to the one we saw earlier. The governments of the world, usually deadly enemies, have secretly gathered to discuss the implications. A mission has been arranged. The monument was involved with Jupiter in a kind of radio link. A few men travel to the destination of the broadcast. Most of them are kept in a state of paused animation for most of the time. The pilot of the spacecraft is HAL, a supercomputer programmed to mimic all human traits. The movie has many outstanding sequences. As usual for Kubrick, the use of classical music is excellent. The most memorable ones are "Blue Danube" and "So spit Zarathustra" (especially suitable as the subject of film transcends ordinary consciousness.) Cinematography is also particularly good. After a single look, the last 30 minutes of the movie will inspire your life for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The character of HAL is the most important from the point of view of the central thesis of the film. By imitating all qualities of man, he also has his negative qualities. The paranoia he developed, which almost leads to the demise of the mission, is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has caused the political situation on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits we must leave behind if we want to move on to the next phase of our development. <br /> <br /> The architecture of the film is also significant. The designs of many spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the film. The end of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever made. <br /> <br /> In this film, life is portrayed as similar to the poems of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegans Wake. It represents a pattern for history and human evolution that is cyclical yet progressive, repeating the same events at great intervals, but the human race evolves according to the will of a being with a greater sense. Although we never know what that purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not destined to fail, but fate is far beyond imagination. I still wonder that many people still consider Kubrick a misanthrope despite this film. <br /> <br /> This is a religious film, not in the traditional sense of clinging to a particular belief, but because It is a call to wonder at the wide panorama of existence and its engagement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth. <br /> <br /> In the hands of another director, this might be a bit too much. Hollywood's attitude to life is too small, usually to capture the size and intensity of a vision like this. But Kubrick was a visionary, he leads with the utmost confidence, not only that he can handle material of this kind, but that he is the only one who does it. The production process of this film has used all its creative resources. The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most prolific in film history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used for the amazing climax of the film. The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought it to life. 2001 is an absolutely unique movie experience. Those who miss it do so to the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative abilities.
