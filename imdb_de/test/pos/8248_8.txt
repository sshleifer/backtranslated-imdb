David "Master of Debonair" Niven plays the Big Boss (IVAN), who exploits the unlucky Richard Jordan (PINKY) by forcing the unfortunate ex-con to take advantage of his badly found new position in a bank. Elke Sommer (Miss PELHAM) is most effective in ensuring the female interest that Pinkie can not resist. <br /> <br /> It seems they could not choose a name for this movie, instead they used four .... makes sense ??? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this turns out to be one of Niven's last roles. Overall, this movie is fun and worth seeing if you manage to catch one of its rare or late-night TV screenings. <br /> <br />
