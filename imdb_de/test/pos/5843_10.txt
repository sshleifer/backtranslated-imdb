Oz was a fantastic show as long as frequent male nudity does not scare you off. There was far too much frontal male nudity on this show, more than any other show you would see on a porn channel. Besides, it was the best show on TV, and a former commentator said "better than Prime Suspect." Prime suspects are Tom and Jerry against The Simpsons. No competition. If you have DirecTv, re-run it on channel 101 from the beginning. You are now in episode # 3. Highly recommended. The creator Tom Fontana also made Homicide, a great show. But why all the male nudity? We all know the stuff happens in jail, but did they really have to show it that often? That was the only thing that distracted me from the show. If I want to see naked men, guys who are being raped, I'll kill somebody myself and show it first-hand. Otherwise I like my TV shows every five minutes without black penises.
