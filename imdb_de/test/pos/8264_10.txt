I was fortunate enough to record this wonderful drama, both parts, when it was originally broadcast on Masterpiece Theater. I loved it, but I lost it. Then, one day, while going through old tapes, I found it again. I recorded and watched it on DVD and --- WOW! I still like it! The notes are excellent and my only complaint is, I wish we had seen more Kester! What a man! And Prue. She is so strong and wonderful ... she lives in a time and age when her suffering and how she deals with it is considered unhappy and evil. Even her own brother tells Prue to her face that he doubts that a man will ever have her. * sigh * Unfortunately, my copy is not the biggest, worn over time, and I would very much like to have it on a professional DVD if it ever happens.
