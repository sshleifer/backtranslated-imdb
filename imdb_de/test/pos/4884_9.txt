League of Gentleman was the most troubling British sitcom on TV and how can a funny movie be rated so badly that it simply has no taste. This movie will make you look again and again and still find it funny. <br /> <br /> it's surprising that it went bad, but it's British that the movies shit most of the time, but this time it's (in my words) a boost with a comedy featuring a giraffe about Lady's spunks is British comedy and better than Dodge Ball, so and that will not prove wrong, since I'm not really laughing at movies, but this movie was amazing with comedies with the best characters, but I was a bit disappointed with that Edward and Tabb's were back for writing this movie and it will not disappoint.
