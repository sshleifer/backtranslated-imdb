I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it first aired on British television. I was shocked after seeing this masterpiece, and despite some close competition from people like FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, this movie is still my absolute favorite for almost 20 years after I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> This leads to the problem of how I can even start commenting on the movie. I could praise the technical aspects, especially the tone, the cut, and the cinematography, but all the others seem to have praised (rightly) these accomplishments, while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been mentioned, and everyone else has this mentions strong images of the Dou Long Bridge and the mounting of the boat that drives upriver after passing the border. <br /> <br /> How about the script? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director, but as a screenwriter he is always a genius, as he was said as a director. I was "was" in the past because the movie seemed to have burned every creative mind in his head. but his sacrifice was worth it. In John Milius's original solo draft, we have a script as insane and disturbing as the one on screen, but Coppola's involvement in the script brought in a narrative that mirrors those of the war. Watch as the script of all jingoistic and macho begins with a star turn by Bill Kilgore that would not have been out of place in THE GREEN BERETS, but the more the story progresses, the more shocking and crazier everything gets. Time has come the outpost of Kurtz. The audience is watching another movie, much as the characters have sailed into another dimension. When Coppola says "This film is not about Vietnam - it's Vietnam," he's right. What started out as a patriotic war to defeat the communist aggression in the mid-1960s, in the context of the film (the Manson process suggests that it is 1970), had the American view of the world both in itself and in the world It's the crazy beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterpiece of cinema and more about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians (What did you do during the Vietnam War, Mr. President?) made as Michael Moore I hope to say it in a lifetime. I did not see the REDUX version, but when I saw the original print I did not feel like there was anything missing in the story that, like all really great movies, is very simple. In fact, the premise may be suitable for many other genres, such as a Western, in which an officer must seek out and kill a renegade Colonel who runs a contracted war party, or a science fiction film A UN assassin destroys another UN comrade A soldier leading a resistance movement on Mars, though this is probably due to Joseph Conrad's original source novel. <br /> <br /> My ever popular movie, and it's very fitting that I chose this movie for my thousandth report on IMDb
