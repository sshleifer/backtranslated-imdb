It was a rare pleasure to see "Checking Out". The characters touched me, I laughed a lot at the wonderful screenplay and was deeply moved by the righteous emotions that this ensemble and above all Peter Falk has magnificently portrayed. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children, in which he tells of his life experience, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his future life, is so deeply real that it is at its best Oscar winning prizes. He is a consummate actor who has outdone himself in this film. The scriptwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge, timing, a talent for dialogue, and fun situations in which I had to laugh aloud in the theater. I highly recommend "Checking Out" to anyone who wants to enjoy world-class storytelling.
