I went to Thanksgiving to a friend and watched a DVD of the movie, Eddie Monroe. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years (I loved the Brothers McMullen) and was impressed by how good this movie is. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this movie was shot on Super 16. The photograph was so good, it looked like it was a 35mm shoot. Besides, the music combined with Fred Carpenter's direction was art. The plot was original and brought to an end that surprised all of us ... very cool. The acting of the entire cast was good, especially the actor who played Uncle Benny. He was great. This movie was a great vacation experience and I was very pleased to be one of the first to watch a movie that many will see in the future.
