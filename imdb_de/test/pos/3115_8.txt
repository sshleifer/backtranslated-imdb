In 1950 there were two very different and interesting Westerns: "The Gunfighter" by Henry King and "Wagon Master" by John Ford. "The Gunfighter" was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's "High Noon" (1951) and later revisionist Western , <br /> <br /> However, I find that "Wagon Master" is superior to its contemporary counterpart. Ford's smaller masterpiece is not much about telling stories. it should rather be understood as a poem that describes the ideas of the old West. Although we are optimistic and warm in the heart, we are deserving of naivety because it is completely free of presumptuous underlines. Border scenes are well used as they perfectly support the poetic narrative. Add naturalistic camera work and we are transported between the Mormon travelers to see western folklore, which is told in a cinematic way.
