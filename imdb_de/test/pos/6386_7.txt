An unusual movie that begins with the classic premise of a rowdy marrying a girl who loves him to flee the country. But a turn of events soon turns history upside down. Most of the films hit the right buttons: the story is developing smoothly, the acting is solid (Sienna Miller's Doodle is priceless, she really can act!), The chemistry between the two main roles and rolling US landscapes and quirky minor characters make really a good time. The mood, which begins as light and romantic, soon turns into something darker and downright sinister. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the pace just slows down a bit more than we would like, but do not let that stop you watching this unusual little movie experience.
