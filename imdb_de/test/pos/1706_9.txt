To tell Thora Birch, "I kind of like this movie, it's the polar opposite of everything I hate in a movie." <br /> <br /> This obscure movie was too inconspicuous and too intelligent to get a theatrical release. The chance of success would have required a costly advertising campaign. And a coming-of-age story in which nothing spectacular happens - where focus is instead on character development, has a limited audience. Who has heard of a mature teen movie? <br /> <br /> But if you have the opportunity to see this, or if you can part with a few dollars from the DVD, you could make things worse. "My Teacher's Wife" is not revolutionary, but it has a lot to offer and withstands repeated visits. Jason London (high school Todd Boomer) is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in "The Man in the Moon" and "Dazed and Confused". He is helped by extraordinary work from his supporting role. Tia Carrere in the title role is a revelation (she can act) as Todd's calculus tutor and love interest. Christopher McDonald as a teacher in a self-parodying performance. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as Todd's best friends and Jeffrey Tabor as his dad. <br /> <br /> As previously commented, this is a "mature" teenage film, as romantic relationships are generally unsuccessful, at least through traditional happy-ending standards. Even Todd's parents are indifferent, and his father gasps for the title character and his mother (Leslie Lyles) on the phone during their entire time on the screen (a device that provides increasing comedy relief with each subsequent appearance). The London Carrere romance has an unexpected charm and is far more credible than any other older women's business you'll likely find. <br /> <br /> But the real strength of the movie is the evolving relationship of the three friends. There is no overworked melodrama here, just three immature people who alternate by testing each other and trusting each other. This is subject to the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing. They actually manage to build a "credible" three-person relationship, perhaps the first in cinematic history. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
