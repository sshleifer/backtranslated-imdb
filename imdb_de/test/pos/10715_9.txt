For some inexplicable reason, I saw this movie for the first time a few days ago and understood from the start what the hustle and bustle is all about. This movie caught my attention from start to finish and went through the full range of emotions (and maybe helped me discover a few I never knew.) Dustin Hoffman shines as Ted Kramer. He is absolutely confident, as a man who has to master at least three different challenges in life: eccentric husband, workaholic ad executive and loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less focussed on the film just because Joanna was absent for much of it, but when she was on the screen, she gave Hoffman the money for his money. However, the real challenge (in my opinion) had to be the young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victims of a breakdown in marriage, and Justin seemed to be absolutely natural and totally credible in this role as he deals with the contradictory feelings about his mother and his adaptation to life with Dad, only then To have confusion why he should I have to leave his father when it was his mother who left him. Young Justin did not seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent, Oscar-worthy film whose only weak point in my opinion was really disappointing The decision for the juicy and happy ending, given the destructive custody that Ted and Joanna have gone through had, was completely unrealistic. Otherwise there is not much to complain about. <br /> <br /> 9/10
