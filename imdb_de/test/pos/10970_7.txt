1959 was a milestone in the world of film. Several great directors of the classical era published career-capping classics that were among their best. A look at the titles is instructive: Hitchcock's North By Northwest, Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot, Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life. Add a couple from the previous year, Orson Welles's Touch of Evil, Hitch's Vertigo and Nick Ray's Wind Across the Everglades, and you've got a pretty good summary of what was possible in the classic Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> At the same time, two films have appeared that point to a completely new way of making movies. One was Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, the other was John Cassavete's Shadows. The two films had some similarities, largely improvised acting by non-stars, handheld cameras, low budgets and a certain youthful, jazzy Swagger. In a way, they could not be farther apart. Godard still believed in the director as a referee of style. He knew more about film than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was filled with the iconography of classic crime thrillers. Cassavetes, on the other hand, was an actor and a refugee from New York's underground theater scene. His first film shows him little impressed by the cinema and a great belief in actors. Godard's film always refers to his own artistry, whereas Shadows seeks a certain naturalism. <br /> <br /> He does not reach him, especially because naturalism is a myth, especially in the cinema. But it feels powerful and kinetically, yet it is as cool as the cool jazz in the score, certainly the main inspiration for the film shown here. Ultimately it does not stick together, mainly because the actors of Cassavetes here are amateurish beatniks, where the style of Cassavetes requires strong, resourceful actors. His later work with Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazarra and Peter Falk blows them out of the water. Due to the technical inexperience of the director some dialogues had to be re-selected later, which negates the freshness of improvisation. Still, it is fascinating to see both the great moments (such as the scene in which Leila Goldoni speaks of her disappointment when she loses her virginity) and watching a pioneering artist find his way.
