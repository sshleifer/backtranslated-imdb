For a movie like this little hidden gem that hits the market in the 80's, it's shocking that not many people know about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth a look. It has everything you need for a horror movie. especially the good old showers. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but I could not remember the name of the movie, so I came to IMDb a few years ago to ask Help finding the title. I finally got the name of the title and bought the movie. I still love it the same way I did many years ago. <br /> <br /> buy this movie !!
