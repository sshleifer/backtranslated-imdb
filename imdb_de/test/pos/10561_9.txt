After watching "Tipping the Velvet by Sarah Waters," I decided to see "Fingersmith." The characters were just as good in both performances, although Rachael Stirling was missing in the adaptation of "Fingersmith" The choice, the twisting and the unraveling of the characters were incredible! Only one excellent watch is missing Rachael Stirling! <br /> <br /> If you love the romance of two girls, this is not one of the best movies you can watch. <br /> <br /> It takes a different version than Tipping The Velvet, but is just as good. <br /> <br /> Can anyone recommend it!
