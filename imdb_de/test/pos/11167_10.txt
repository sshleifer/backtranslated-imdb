ABC's version of the deceased pope's life: you only marginally presupposed the CBS version and it may have suffered, but the program itself was excellent. It moved quickly, as it only had two hours (and the ad needed time) to cope with the long life of this great man, but Thomas Kretschmann was admirably up to the challenge He has - unlike the CBS biopic - the role played from youth to old age and managed to be "realistic" at both ends of the scale. His credibility has never diminished. He has an amazing range and depth. It's a shame that the program could not have been longer and more detailed, but within the time frame they were in, I think they were an excellent piece of work and put it on the small screen.
