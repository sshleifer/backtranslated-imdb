since the conspiracy like Vertigo or Brian DePalmas obsession to the score of Peter Chase, reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's sounds, seems to see this little pearl of a few. Remarkable play by Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris by the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD is French and English. Directed by controversial artist Gilles Mimouni, this could be considered a small tribute to the Cinema Masterworks. It's a French movie, and like all, not for everyone, we could say an d'essai movie theater. Even if it is not made public, it could be remembered for a variety of reasons.
