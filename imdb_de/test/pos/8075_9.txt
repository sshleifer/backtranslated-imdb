LA ANTENA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005). <br /> <br /> In this fairy-tale story by Esteban Sapir, shot in black and white and with virtually no dialogue, this is a totally unique interpretation of dumb cinema. "La Antena" is a feast for the eyes and a must for lovers of German Expressionist cinema, whereby most of the works are directed to Fritz Lang and Friedrich Murnau. <br /> <br /> "The city without a voice", "La Ciudad sin Voz" is ruled by Mr. TV. He has taken the voices of the residents and is in control of all spoken words and images, so everyone has to eat their own brand of TV food. Mr. TV is not only a monopolist, he is the personification of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika appears several times as a symbol. He secretly works on a hypnotizing device to control all citizens' thoughts through his television programs. To this end, he kidnaps the only one left with The Voice, a beautiful singer, but a television mechanic witnesses the kidnapping and escapes to an old television antenna in the mountains to stop Mr. TV's bad plans The production design is breathtaking with beautiful sets and pictures. Although Esteban Sapir was mainly shot using the basic language of the silent film, he also adds some new techniques of his own, such as a combination of typography and animation techniques. Everyone talks about balloons (which usually hover near their mouths). The louder they speak, the bigger the signs. The texts themselves can be pushed away or crushed. In the opening sequence, we see a book titled "La Antena" that opens and turns the pages into a paper city. There is little evidence of Argentina. It's constantly snowing, giving the film a very unarggenic feel, while the surreal environment suggests every major city in the northern hemisphere, with only a few of the songs revealing the film's Argentine background. <br /> <br /> Tempo is fast and there is so much on screen that it's difficult to follow the film's surreal story. Not only is it breathtakingly beautiful, we also have some news about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are simply packed. One of the most original films I have seen in years. A joy. <br /> <br /> The film was shown as an opening film at IFF Rotterdam 2007. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
