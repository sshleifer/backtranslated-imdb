The Brass Eye TV series by Chris Morris has always provoked a variety of complaints, both from the audience and from the participants. But nothing he has done has led to more controversy. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the onset of the overrated Jerry Springer Opera, the Brass Eye Special set the record for the majority of complaints received on every TV program broadcast. Many complaints were voiced by people who have never seen the program! The topic that handled the program has brought many heads, but the message has been widely misinterpreted. The news even went to some who had enjoyed the program, lost. This was not a show mocking pedophilia. The show dealt exclusively with the media and the presentation of the topic. Morris is and remains a media satirist. The idea that the program makes fun of pedophiles and abused children is completely ridiculous! Morris never tries to do that. He just makes us aware of the overwhelming and often stupid media hype around the subject. <br /> <br /> Morris uses many of his established 'Brass Eye' characters, such as Ted Maul and others, to show how the media is flooding everything that is very small on a subject that they themselves have created and built The result is so funny, if not funnier, than anything Morris did before. With his proven formula, Morris succeeds in convincing several gullible celebrities to work on a reputable documentary. In reality, they should look exactly as they are. Retards. <br /> <br /> All in all, the Brass Eye Special must be seen to be believed. With a first line Morris summarizes the entire media situation from 2001: "Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!"
