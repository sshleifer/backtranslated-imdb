First and foremost, those who are feeble-minded should absolutely avoid this movie. Even those like me, who are desensitized in the movies for most graphically violent and sexual acts, should be careful. I'm not telling you to distract yourself from the movie, but be aware that what you're about to see is a disconcerting material. In any case, a pleasing movie to watch, but nothing is shown strictly for the shock. But I have to admit, when I saw the movie a second time, I had to jump to the next chapter when the "razorblade scene" came up. <br /> <br /> The main character is one of the least sympathetic characters I can imagine, but later in the second act of the film, we'll see the humanity of her character better. In one scene, she stuffs broken glass into a student's jacket pocket after being unsatisfied with her seemingly unsatisfactory performance and becoming nervous in front of a live audience. The student enters her pocket and screams in pain as she stares at her bloodied hand. Besides the razor-blade scene, that bothered me the most. The student's mother is not much more sympathetic than she is. When she learns that her daughter can not play, she talks about it as if she had hurt her hand as well. She is one of the spoiled mothers who tries to torture her daughter to become a defector. <br /> <br /> Although the film intrigued me and aroused my interest for the most part, I wanted to learn more about Isabelle Huppert's character. If a woman is intrigued with sadomasochistic pornography and interferes in this behavior herself, you want to understand the cause of the problem. The film shows that she desperately wants to be loved. Why then the hateful attitude towards everyone? Why does she get sexual pleasure out of pain? <br /> <br /> The show is great and I liked the shiny, stylized lighting. Overall, it's not a movie I'd recommend if you're in the mood to be entertained, but as I said, it's very fascinating. And I'm sure if I looked at it a few more times, I could see certain subtleties that shed more light on aspects of the film that I did not initially realize. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
