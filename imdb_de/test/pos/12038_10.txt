This is a tough movie you can visit in the US, but if you can find it - and you're interested in the life and music of Percy Aldridge Grainger, you'll be looking forward to something. That's historically pretty accurate. Richard Roxborough's Grainger looks amazingly similar to Grainger at this time. Emily Woof's Karen Holten is a bit prettier than the real Karen, but that was an inaccuracy I liked to discover (!). I think what really impressed me was how well Roxborough captured Grainger's incredible personality. Barbara Hershey's rose was also a sweetheart. If she looks much younger than Rose at this time, it's more than made up for how well she captured Rose's obsession with Percy. It's an easy-to-recommend movie. (I should note that when she saw "Passion", my wife had no particular affinity for Grainger (and his knowledge) and music, but she was totally fascinated by the film.
