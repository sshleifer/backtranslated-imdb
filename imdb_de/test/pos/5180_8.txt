This is a quiet movie. It's a simple story about a writer who can not write that he's going back to his hometown to get started, but he's starting a friendship with a weird old man whose outward life may well be the writer's inner state - it's one Museum of unfinished ideas, outdated equipment and "useless" people. <br /> <br /> There are no extraordinary circumstances or big moves in the plot. It's a movie about internal changes. Stuck in their lives, not developing much further, the main characters can help each other to transform, stop, leave dreams and achieve something, or at least make a change and give their lives the desired and long-awaited new direction / > <br /> On the film side, I can only imagine one flaw that could also be considered a feature - we do not get much character description or insights into the inner world. It's very narrative on the side of thoughts and events, and we have to think about their true feelings, which are rather hidden, but you can still see them. This is what gets your mind going and tries to understand it and understand the impressions made by these people, and it's not empty of it - the actors definitely hold some inner states that are intrinsic to their characters. It's close to real life, where one usually never knows someone well enough to fully understand him, and that kills us and introduces our own feelings and choices. <br /> <br /> The most important thing for me is that this simple, almost flat story will make you think about your own life, about your own dreams and successes, are there some or are we involved in the routine and the joys Leaving or dreaming about 100%, we could do more and move to a place where we want to be more than just saying goodbye and others telling stories like "I'll do it someday" to move a finger for this to actually happen, or "I'm fine where I am" because it's easier to go through the habits than actually make a change? At least that's the impression it left on me, and it was very timely for me, which enhances my appreciation for this widely acclaimed film. I definitely recommend it to anyone who chooses the movies for the heart, but those who need events and actions should stay away.
