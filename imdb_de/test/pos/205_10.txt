I just want to tell you a few things before I think about seeing this movie. If, at one point or another, you have thought that you have seen good camerawork, be prepared to wonder about this movie. For the record, this movie was shot in Russia in 1957, but the technique used here is probably something that we did not see much later in the Western world ... about 20 years later. The degree of emotion in the film varies a lot: happiness, love, war, despair, but in the end, you are left with something very unique: the joy of seeing a masterpiece of filmmaking. The young directors of our time should learn more about these types of films, and maybe they will be able to do something similar ... even though I think films like these are very hard to get ... If you Having seen "I am Cuba", this film would appeal to you very much, but if not, be prepared for a unique experience. The Russian directors have something in common: very small budgets, great actors, and a joy in creating art ... and yes, they can do more masterpieces than any Western country combined. I'm not a big fan of Russia, actually I hate anything that's communist, but filming in this part of the world manages to create emotions that are hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it. <br /> <br />
