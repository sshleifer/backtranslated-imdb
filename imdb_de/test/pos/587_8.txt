I really enjoyed THE MUPPET MOVIE. It was the first of the Muppet films and is by far the best because he's so creative and fresh. In later films, the ideas just did not seem so original. But here we see Kermit and Miss Piggy on bicycles (an incredibly difficult scene), an outstanding ensemble cast and just a lot of fun. I loved every minute the Muppets appeared, and I rated the movie much higher, except for a serious problem. In this and most of the subsequent Muppet films, some forces had to be considered muppets, especially non-muppets - especially many, many cameos of stars. Some worked well (like Charles Durning's), but many seemed irrelevant and brought the picture to a standstill. The worst of them was probably Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was an amazing man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew, but the tiny scene he's in was neither needed nor most of the cameos. Despite this big complaint, it's a great movie for the whole family - from kids to the most demanding adults.
