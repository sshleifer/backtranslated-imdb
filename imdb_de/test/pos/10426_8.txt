I loved this movie. I loved the romantic game with COlby and the girl ... Rachel (?) 4 got her name .... I was honestly interested only in the. I loved her in the movie, I want to see more movies of it. but please do not end sad ones where they can not be together! = (It made me cry, but the romance between them ... The plot, the trauma, everything was great.) I was just more concerned with Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) Everything about this movie was exciting to keep you in your place. Honestly, my only personal wish would be more for the couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent ending. I hated the end, a better one could have been better thought out, not the fact that he forced COlby to his death and that Rachel had a son. The end would have killed the movie.
