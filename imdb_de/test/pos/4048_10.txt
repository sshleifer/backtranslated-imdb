I've probably seen the movie 4 or 5 times. I am increasingly impressed by how far the desire of a young heart can go, and the power of Kai and Gertha to fight what they believe in. <br /> <br /> And the whole story is portrayed, you are simply transferred to the plot and before you know it, you are there. You can see ... yes, there's Kai ... he's working hard on the mirror ... a little jump ... there's Gertha fighting for her love ... and there's the Snow Queen ... <br /> <br /> It's just a wonderful mix of love, adventure, excitement. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant 10 out of 10 points
