First of all, I'd like to say that I can only hope that the creators of this movie and its sister film The Intruder (director of the great, outspoken stylist Jopi Burnama) know in their hearts how much joy they have brought me and me to my friends in the sleepy northeastern town of Jarrow. <br /> <br /> From the opening pre-credit sequence, which, despite the fact that a man has fallen through a window on a motorcycle crashed through a window, is easily dragged to the merciless destruction of a quiet laboratory Introducing one of the most annoying and anemic villains in film history and costume design that Jean Paul Gautier would find utter and shrill. Do not make a mistake; This is a truly unique experience. Early highlight - an explosion (getting used to, much more, where that came from!), Followed by a close-up of our chubby heroine and the funniest line reading of the word "dad" in vivid memory. And then ... the title song ... <br /> <br /> Yes, that deserves its own paragraph. Sung by AJ, written by people who really want to remain anonymous, the songs for the Rocky films sound like Schubert. This is a crappy 1980s heroes motivation narcissism with an all-time high, with exquisite lyrics like "It's just me and you, it's getting on the line" and there's a lot of talk "crossing the line" (it will make sense Time - our hero does not care much about the boundaries of policing, not to mention the Indonesian Supremes, who seduce the title of the film seductively, and at that point, anyone who wants to officially switch off does not have a pulse. <br /> <br / > Our hero is the Semitic cop Peter Goldson (brilliant of Intruder star Peter O'Brien), the "stabilizer" of the title.The bull of the man in a china shop approach to crime fighting and in particular his less than unobtrusive covert work really does allow for but he is undoubtedly an entertaining guide through the streets of Downtown Jakarta, where Captain Johnny tows with the local Sleaze-Ball connection Dew, as well as Peter's own waste of space partners in fashion crime Sylvia Nash, which does little. So many highlights, so little time - the "slide please" arrogance of Peter's not too convincing controversial case against boss buddy Greg Rainmaker (Intruder fans will know the slimy bastard Craig Gavin as the monstrous John White - no! Oh!) Well. ..), the x marks the stupidity of the location map, our hero exploits the heroine Tina Probost for a moment of weakness for her, and this one emerges during a sting operation dressed as a member of a particularly extravagant dance troop. And believe me, that hardly conceals it. <br /> <br /> There was not even time to focus on chasing a drug-detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable national pride. Or our hero who comes to a funeral, as if he's an extra at Boogie Nights. Or the absolutely hysterical madness between Captain Johnny and Goldson - two guys have never done any heavier weather with their Buddy Buddy Shtick than these clowns. The trowel might have been too subtle, I think. <br /> <br /> Ah, people are being scared off, and you never thought scenes of wanton destruction and general chaos could be so incredibly boring, but the interaction with the characters is amazing, the dialogue really invaluable and the incompetence that is somehow lovable. Oh and the shoes people - watch out for the shoes!
