I remember when this movie came out and looked at it several times on VHS. I was so happy when it was FINALLY released on DVD. I hoped for widescreen, but at that point, what was available would be taken. I love how they used color in the film, the outdoor scenes are so vibrant with color. The trees are the greenest I've ever seen. The film was shot mostly in Stillwater, Minnesota, a beautiful town on the St. Croix River. You really need to have been looking for filming locations because they did a great job. The story is well written and directed. I would rate this as one of Peter Horton's best. I'm also surprised that Andrew Dintenfass (the director of photography) did not do it anymore. He did an incredible job. The action is also up there. It's amazing how two actors at such a young age pull off this kind of movie. Annabella Sciorra did a great job as Dexter's mother. Who would not want her as a mother?
