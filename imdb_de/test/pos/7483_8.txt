Thursday is clearly a modification of the "new wave" of crime thrillers that have been taken by storm with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction since Quentin Tarantino's early 90s, but he has enough of his own ideas to make sure he remains an interesting little movie , Thursday uses a few characters, most of which are in one place. It works because every character is stubborn enough to be memorable, and when you put it together, what you have is a very funny little thriller. There is little substance in the plot, but it does not matter because nobody gets involved in this kind of film and expects a life-affirming experience. The action follows Casey; a former drug dealer who has just left and now lives in suburbia with his wife as a successful architect. The couple wants to adopt a child, but it goes awry when Casey is visited by his old criminal, Nick, who has brought a case heroine and a load of money from the police. Thursday will be a very interesting day for our former criminal ... <br /> <br /> The first scene makes the movie quite nice and makes us know what to expect. We see that a coffee order goes awry, which turns into a murder scene that hides the culprits immediately when a police officer comes to a refreshment. The scene is steeped in dark humor and witty dialogue, and that will continue in the rest of the movie. Thursday is a very funny movie, and scenes like the one in which the adoption visitor turns up at an awkward time make the film difficult to averify. It's true that the film does not bring anything new to the table, cinematic or plot-wise, but the fact that it likes to make fun makes the absurd situation have more time to build the central characters. The drama is decent enough, and the entire cast obviously enjoys this action. Thomas Jane holds the film in the lead role well, while amusing portrayals of James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke support him well. It is unlikely that this film will impress the seasoned film fan, but if you just want a fun little movie with a few pleasurable twists and performances; The Thursday should be enough.
