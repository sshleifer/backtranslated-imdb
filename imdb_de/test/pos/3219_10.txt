I love this program! it's incredible ... I can never miss an episode, even if I've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts ...... i love gilmore girls! I got all my friends to see it. Even her parents are watching it now. I watch it daily and usually more than once a day. I wish my mother was like Lorelei. My friends say I talk and behave like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. It's a great teen show because they actually learn something from it. My vocabulary has expanded with the reputation of Gilmore Girls. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bled El are perfect for the parts of Lorelei and Rory. I think Luke and Lorelai should get married because Chris left Lorelei and Rory too often. and also broke Loreley's heart too often.
