I actually heard about Favela Rising through the IMDb website. I am especially interested in afro-brazilian culture and movies. Favela Rising is one of the gems that give a new meaning to human transformation. Beautifully documented and filmed by Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary, the story is Anderson Sa, a former drug trafficker from Rio De Janeiro who becomes a Christ-like Malcolm X and Ghandi after the death of family members and friends. Sa founded AfroReggae, a grassroots cultural movement that uses Afro-Brazilian hip hop, Capoeira drumming (Afro-Brazilian martial arts) and other art forms to turn the hopeless and mostly angry adolescent into vibrant, viable, caring, caring, community-loving people do. > <br /> A few years ago I remembered that I went to a screening of City of God (Cidade De Deus) and went completely deaf from the theater. The pictures were grim and yet stunning and you could not take your eyes off the screen. I remember how hopeless some situations were in the favelas and how decadent society was by the neglect of governments. How drug trafficking was a way of life, no matter how indifferent the slums were, because death was a common occurrence. As in City of God, Anderson Sa talks about how the people of the favelas were desensitized. He talks about the corruption of the police and how the communities were so immobile through drugs and gangs that you could not visit family members in other favelas that you had to meet in a neutral place. Unlike in City of God Anderson's grassroots movement, AfroReggae offers solutions to anger, hopelessness. <br /> <br /> There was a part of the documentary in which Anderson approached some teenagers in the spirit of a preacher and asked them to join them AfroReggae. These exhausted teens were so drawn to daily survival and violence. Their role models were drug dealers, and they wanted to be. Anderson then said that drug dealers do not live very long. Of course there was reluctance, but five months later he managed to win some of the youth for AfroReggae. <br /> <br /> The visuals in Favela Rising are incredible. It is clear to me that Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary are not only great storytellers but also visual artists. This is a must documentary! There are some truly magical and transforming moments in this documentary. I do not want to spoil her for you. I want you to see it for yourself. Please tell your friends, scientists, youth counselors and family members about this wonderful movie. They will take care of the world and our children. <br /> <br /> I would give eleven stars!
