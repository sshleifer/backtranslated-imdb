There are a limited number of fans of films around the world who would love to see a particular genre go down in the depths that this crew has undertaken to accomplish something the author of the original film has never accomplished. This is a wonderful exploration of the true devotion and love it takes to achieve a potentially very successful cult movie. Originally, with the blessing of Alex Cox, the crew began producing one of his films in absolute punk fashion. Their goal is to capture the atmosphere as it should be for the original movie "Repo Man". <br /> <br /> This is a great story of devotion and betrayal that can occur along the path to wonderful filmmaking. A really entertaining story and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer.
