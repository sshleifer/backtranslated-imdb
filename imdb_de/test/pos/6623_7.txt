If you want to know more about the development of skateboarding, you should find enough research material at Dogtown and Z-Boys. This is not to be confused with Lords of Dogtown, the sad Hollywood attempt to redeem themselves for the success of the original Dogtown revival. <br /> <br /> Directed by Stacey Peralta, a former Z-Boys and Pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s Bones Brigade, and written in collaboration with skateboard photojournalist Craig Stecyk, this documentary tracks how a group surfs Children from the streets of Southern California (known as Dogtown), who founded the Z-Boys skateboarding team (in fact, there was a girl - Peggy Oki), revolutionized skateboarding. The film features interviews with almost all Z-Boys (the whereabouts of Chris Cahill are unknown). The most notable is the bad ass Tony Alva and the youngest, Jay Adams, whose talents (along with Perlata) seemed to be overcoming the rest of the teams. There are interviews with the team's founders (and the Dogtown shop), surfboard designer Jeff Ho, Skip Engbloom and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews with people like Tony Hawk (obviously), Ian McKaye (Fugazi) and Henry Rollins, who were young kids in the 70s when Dogtown had an influence on skateboarding (skateboarding has been a very different context in recent years the documentation explains). <br /> <br /> It not only shows you who the Dogtown team was and how they formed, but also why their style has not changed only in skateboarding (Poolskaten became immensely popular and woke the way to the Vert) He also facilitated the sport (though not in the extreme commercialism that it is today), as it was more than just the fleeting trend, as those surfers whose waves had run out in the early morning were looking for opportunities spend her time, and finally started skateboarding. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand were long gone when Dogtown paved the way for the new generation of skaters, at least through the fame of their skate team. As Dogtown drew all the attention, they could push skating to the next step. <br /> <br /> It's a great documentary in the way it's put together, though Stacey Peralta always knew how to do that, even though Bones Brigade's production of mini-films / skate demos like "Ban This "and" Search for Animal Chin ". The film told by Sean Penn is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, lots of archive footage and lots of interviews to give you a real feel of who the Z-Boys were and how they had their influence in skateboarding.
