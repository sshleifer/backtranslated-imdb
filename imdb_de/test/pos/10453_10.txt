Spoiler in this review! Despite a few less unlikely scenes, including boys measuring their penis in a contest in the penis and the few compulsory teenagers trying to lay themselves down, this film captures the painful essence of high school in a way that few teenage films do have ever done. This is achieved by not only showing the Friends of the Trio Gary, Dave, Rick as smoking, drinking, always looking for young people, but also the nature of the friendship itself, as these three friends are loyal let test. This film is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends. For the shy, romantic Gary, he immediately falls in love when he sees the lovely Karen for the first time. The awakening emotion in Gary is written big on the canvas, and he proves his love for her by capturing her when distracted by her lover. This love of Karen signals the end of Gary's innocence as the bonds with his two best friends are tested and broken throughout the story. The self-confident lady-man Rick is the person in high school, whom we all secretly wish: beautiful, cool and always the incredibly beautiful girls faint. Rick turns out to be Cad, but you have to remember that his character is only 17 years old. He panics and makes a bad decision. From the perspective of Rick, the story is about finding the only girl of his dreams, a bad separation, and then reconciliation in the end. The look on Rick's face as Gary walks in and sees Karen kiss Karen shows that he finally understands that his best friend and he love the same woman. As in real life, you do not bow because your friend has an unrequited love. This is the tragedy of the movie. Rick is not a bad guy and he keeps reminding Gary and Dave that they are his best friends. However, the soulful quality of Gary's performance is at the heart of the story. Lawrence Monoson is a nice loser. He does everything right, his heart is in the right place and he is consumed by the love of Karen. But Karen is not touched at the end by Gary's devotion and kindness. Karen represents all the people in the world who take care of themselves, who exist in a vacuum of their own self and never stop recognizing the emotional damage and trauma they inflict on others. This movie is brutal in his statements about love and friendship, but that makes him unique among teenagers. It ceases to be a comedy and becomes a hopelessly romantic film, even if it is condemned to a tragic conclusion. Anyone who has ever found the girl of their dreams and has not won them will understand. The heartbreaking swarms of high school are just as real as the emotional stresses of adulthood, and this movie will remind you in bold strokes. Gary's last reversal as he drives away with the inscribed medallion is as powerful a moment as any other in the cinema. After watching you have the feeling that it really consists of two films. The first part is a stupid teenage sexploitation movie, and once the story starts, it's a dramatic drama. A terrific movie. It should also be noted that the soundtrack was predominant in the selection of many emerging stars such as the police, the cars, Devo, Oingo Boingo, the Plimsoll, the waitresses, the Shining Towers, and Phil Seymour.
