Forget about any espionage movie you've ever seen - that's what life was like in the USSR and is still in many places in Russia and the former Soviet countries. Vera dreams of leisure life, as she imagines the West; Their reality is different, with a bitter mother, a violent father, and omnipresent alcohol. And their future prospects are not much better. She finds a man and they try to live a life together, but he is affected by the same environment both socially and physically. The scenery in this film is brilliant and sits comfortably in the company of post-apocalyptic films, which are obviously not associated with the film any special effects; They just came in and shot what was in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Forget your stereotypical, cold Russians from spy movies. This is the true deal: people are passionate, alive and present in a way you will never see in a Western drama.
