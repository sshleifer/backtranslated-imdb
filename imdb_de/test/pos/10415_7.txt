This image is an interesting story of the pioneer struggle led by Daniel Boone in the wilds of Cumberland Gap while under threat from enemy Indians. A traitorous Frenchman is the cause of all the difficulties between the settlers and the red men, while Boone tries to convince the Indians that the pioneers only want to build houses and live in peace. The film has a certain appeal, as it is not a polished production, but there are good action scenes, albeit a bit violent. The cast consists of B-actors, but all are good, especially Lon Chaney as Indian boss. Bruce Bennett is fine as a Boone, but is cut a bit too clean and soft, to be credible as a frontier worker. The dialogue is rather banal, but the scenery lends itself to the realism of the backwoods of Kentucky.
