Excellent exercise for multiple plans: <br /> <br /> - Show the unfinished colonialism in France <br /> <br /> - generally the boring thinking of the superiority of all Westerners. <br /> <br /> - A renewal of the spy and thriller movies: OSS 117 is uncultivated and stupid! <br /> <br /> The good idea is that in spite of all these messages, it is a funny movie, lots of jokes and gags, very light and sparkling. Special mention to Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. Definitely worth a visit. I wonder how it is valued in the US. <br /> <br /> Seems to be a success in France, so probably a next version will come.
