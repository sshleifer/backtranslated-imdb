So it's a bit older, it's almost 30 years old. Amazingly, I have this on BETA tape and it's still going well. When it comes to DVD, I would snap it in a heartbeat. <br /> <br /> Drug humor is not much appreciated nowadays. Then it was not so "harmful". Similar to driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I can remember that my father was crying and he laughed so much when I saw that. I had colleagues in the 90s who had seen it and I could give them up by putting on the intercom and saying "Iiiiiiiivivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy". <br /> <br /> Great lines, great parody of the original and still funny for me even three decades later!
