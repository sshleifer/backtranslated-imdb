The film was filmed, filmed and premiered in Oxford, Miss., The Hometown of W. Faulkner, the site of the 1948 book. Most extras were locals. I was in Oxford and it has changed a lot. In this film Will Geer is seen as Sheriff, he was later blacklisted. It was the authors and actors of social dramas like this movie and Grapes Of Wrath who were HUAC's targets a few years later. I do not remember if the actor who played the young Mallison boy (Claude Jarman Jr) did anything after the television series Centennial (1978), but he was great in that earlier film. And do not miss Elizabeth Patterson, who later played in Little Women.
