This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and does a good job in her swordfights. (To the extent that she may do the action twice, it's hard to say ... but Peters obviously does a lot of it and does it well.) Could have been an excellent movie. But basically it's cheesy. Still entertaining. ++++ No ordinary Jacques Tournier movie, but definitely over a normal Jean Peters movie. The color is typical for this period of the 50s. too glaring and not realistic. The actors for Blackbeard and her first buddy and the drunken doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a bit weak. I do not think Debra Paget was right either. But surely Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two best looking female stars of the 50s.
