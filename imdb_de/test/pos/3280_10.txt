I think Mario Van Peeble's movie Posse is a very important movie. It's an excellent introductory film to one side of the story that many are unaware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cowboys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a pot of gold. Peeble's main character is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism of the new black settlers and the infantrymen is examined in this film with outstanding castings, including Melvin Van Peebles (Mario's father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane. <br /> <br /> Feeling that Peeples was eager to use as many notable blacks (and some not so remarkably smiling) actors :) Maybe too many, some notable characters (Issac Hayes, Pamela Grier) are just a scene in Cameo, others short as Tone Loc. The feeling and effort of Peebles efforts to expose these actors are understood by some. The big cast (a feat for every director) works well and does a good job of telling the story in the classic "Revenge and Fight Against Justice" from the West. Most notable was the wonderful narrative role of a veteran actor Woody Strode (from Once Upon A Time In The West), whose own life was a barrier-breaker, was linked to an earlier, incomplete one Era faded from memory. No other actor could have done better. Read Woody Strode's mini-bio here for a primer: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The film makes a good balance between action and slightly sardonic humor. The dialogue was excellent, if a bit contemporary! And as others have mentioned, worldliness was not accurate at the time. The sex scene was a bit much - not really necessary. There are some historical inaccuracies, such as the apparent electronic branding of livestock, etc. But farce is a good attempt to hopefully open the door to historical and creative works that reflect other unspeakable stories and events. The actual photos of real cowboys in the credits were very nice.
