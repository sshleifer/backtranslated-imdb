Food is always a good topic in movies, as "Chocolat" has shown. "Babette's party" is the same. Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) is a French cook who flees from her homeland after the suppression of 1871. She moves to a very religious Danish village. The people in this village just have nothing to enjoy. That is, until Babette prepares one of their exquisite meals. <br /> <br /> It's not just that this movie is about bringing fun to a place it has never been known before. Like other Scandinavian films (and non-Hollywood films in general), this shows that a movie can arouse your interest without exploding explosions, chases, etc. This is a movie you should not miss. <Br /> <br /> something else. Do you think that the Danish word for "Fest" sounds a bit like "Tastebud"?
