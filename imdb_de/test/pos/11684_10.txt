Spheeri's debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time. And as far as I know, it's the only one that focuses on the punk explosion of L.A. in the early 1980s. It's all there: not just great, great bands like Black Flag, Fear, X, the Germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose impact on today's alternative rock music is not too high, but also the organizers , the media and especially the audience - the punks - all in a way that makes them laugh, shudder and wonder at the energy, anger and anger of these teenagers in their music. Where is it today? The eighties may have been a bit of a hassle when mainstream music was used, but the underground was rocking. If you need proof, see the performance of Fear in Decline. Unsurpassed Excellent movie! How come that this is not available on Vid, LD or DVD? P.S. Succession rejection Pt. II is also funny
