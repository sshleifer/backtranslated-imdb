It would be so easy to dismiss an alien abduction movie before he saw it - as I did - but that's worth a look. If you think about it, it's not an easy topic, but this film manages to expose the unbelief, which in itself is a feat for such an outgoing topic. Acting as a doctor was a sensible step that made him believe he was ready to believe in alien abduction. Vosloo plays it very sensitively, involving us in his pain and confusion at the strange events that happen to himself and his wife. Special effects are used sparingly, but to shock effects, and sometimes the film is completely exciting, but unfortunately there are a few points where the action passes and causes confusion. After building up to a tense climax, the end is a bit disappointing. The minor characters were unnecessarily weak (the alien hunter) or menacing (the psychiatrist), which also distracted. <br /> <br /> But all in all, she raises some interesting questions, among which is a pronounced line, "How do animals feel when we experiment with them?" <br /> <br /> The concept of "lost time" was also found to be stimulating.
