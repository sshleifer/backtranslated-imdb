This movie is for entertainment. It's the funniest movie I've ever seen. The lines, the action. And the clothes, wow, talk about 70's. If you ever see this little gem, buy it. It's worth every penny. Incidentally, the opening song is great. If anyone knows where to find it. Please send me an e-mail.
