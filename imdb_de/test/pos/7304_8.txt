I liked this movie a lot, but the feeling I got the most was the memory of how much I liked the novel. The film features two of the best actresses working today - Jessica Lange, who is great here, and the divine Jennifer Jason Leigh, who gives her best with her thin figure that she gives and a surprisingly outstanding figure, Michelle Pfeiffer and a solid Jason Robards. The adaptation is essentially true to the book, at least as faithful as in an hour and forty minutes. The film does not really dazzle, except for certain scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer, but he can portray this wonderfully tragic story thoroughly through and through. As far as movies were adapted from novels, this was definitely one of the better ones. Last but not least, it sent me back to my bookshelves to rediscover favorite passages from Jane Smiley's great novel, and back to King Lear to brush up on the minor characters to see how deep the parallels are. It's definitely worth spending your time as a movie, and hopefully enough to remind you that reading great literature is also a pleasure.
