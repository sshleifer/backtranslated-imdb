I first saw this movie a little over a year ago. I have seen it 4 more times since then. I had never heard of it before and consider myself a classic cinema. A genuine, cut diamond in the raw state. <br /> <br /> This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (main character "Conrack") as a young teacher working on Yamacraw Island teaching the islands' children in a school. First, the students state that they know very little about the world beyond their island home. The heart of the film is that Conrack finds inspiration to awaken her young spirit to the world around her. Students quickly reward their teacher with a learning urge and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that were previously unknown to them. Conrack uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that happen to be a bit fun! God forbid AND learn fun? Together? Can not be, say the responsible. To avoid a spoiler, all I have to say is that Conrack finds resistance with the Bossman .... and the end is really bittersweet. I am a 35 year old white man with some teaching experience, so I should identify with the main character Pat Conroy (aka Conrack, Mr. Petroy). But I do not identify with the black kids. As a child, I was taken to school on the other side of the city from Grade 4 to Grade 6 (around 1979). These kids in the movie remind me of my classmates back then. Fortunately, 4th grade does not mean 8- or 9-year-old racism. I just remember that we were all kids and played 4-square, kickball, hide and seek and relays. <br /> <br /> This movie is very moving. There are delightful and poignant moments from beginning to end, without interruption. I often found myself with tears in my eyes and suddenly laughed out loud. It's a funny movie. <br /> <br /> "Git away from this Winda !!" ... "Sir" If you're ready to crap, I should tell you that Rabbit was doing it in your lap right now ... "" So you're the white teacher, Mr. Conrack Conrack, you're a good-looking teacher, you're a handsome white man. " ..... "Wind 15 miles per hour the east Small boat warning Small boats paid attention Big boats OK, do not worry about anything." ... "No fry chef, but Eleanor Roosevelt, no stock cutter, but (a little Latin). .. that is latin ... they are waiting! "..." Conrack sings like a frog ... I sing well, what is that conversation?! ". <br /> <br /> It still puzzles me that I still do not hear about this movie or that it has very little respect or allegiance. I intend to look for more reviews, comments, backgrounds and tidbits when they're out there. What baffles me is the acting of the untrained children. One of the kids, Mary, I understand, was an actress, and you can say it. The other children, however, have many lines and real reactions. I wonder how they did it! I suspect that Conrack and Mary had a precise dialogue with which they could work, while some of the scenes evolved naturally or ad libbed. <br /> <br /> Conrack is a special movie. In my opinion, it is one of the few films that are so good AND so unknown. Others in this category are King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 with Bogie and Bacall), Gods Must Be Crazy ('80) and Bad Day at Black Rock ('55). I recommend them to everyone. But first take place in the class of Mr. Conrack.
