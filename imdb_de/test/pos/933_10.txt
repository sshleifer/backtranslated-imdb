The final part of the Kieslowski trilogy, based on the colors of the French flag, finds the director content with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the film's image. In red are images in the foreground and the obvious, but clever color coding. However, Kieslowski's Red is not an empty aesthetic based on the "Cinema du look" but a multi-layered, dense meditation on the nature of fate and love. In red, love and destiny are interlinked, but complex intuitions dictated by the whims of people as well as the invisible parallel associations that seem to transcend us. You sense that Red is really an allegory, a reenactment of Prospero's ubiquitous gestures in The Tempest, but it's more than his story appears. Red demands countless visits, and every time you look at it, something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structure. <br /> <br /> Although red alone is a masterpiece by Kieslowski, it is best to consider it as part of the trilogy. Elements of blue and white are referenced in red, which will please viewers.
