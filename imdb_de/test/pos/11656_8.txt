This film is the story of a Catholic nun advising a convicted murderer on death row. The film describes what she does as a nun who does not play a productive role. She may have doubts about her real role. But, finally, she does the role that only a nun can play who has nothing but faith in Christ. There are so many films in America that describe convicted criminals or prisons. These scenes, especially the execution, are too different from Japan.
