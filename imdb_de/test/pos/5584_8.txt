I saw this movie as a child and long to see it again. did it survive? I recommend the version of 1980 as fluffy. I'm sure there are many who do not find it necessary to get these films. It is such a shame to discover a lost gem after it has disappeared. Today, young people do not recognize the hallucinatory quality and impact on life that an early childhood movie has in later life. This movie, "The Blue Lagoon," had this effect on me. How many of us wanted to be in a place away from the fears and chaos of the modern world. This was an idyllic story of a boy and girl being driven out on a tropical island. There are problems to be sure, but in the end they fall in love and have a baby. Life should be so easy and beautiful.
