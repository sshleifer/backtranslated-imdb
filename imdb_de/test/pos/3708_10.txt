Much of this movie was beautiful. The drama, scenery and no doubt Aaron's cinematographic backgrounds were revealed on the beautiful footage. It's definitely worth it because your attention will be captivating all the time and ends up in the right tone. <br /> <br /> The acting of the newcomer Jonathan Furr was excellent, because you think he was a professional actor ever since. He later starred in other feature films, but this starring role will always be remembered. <br /> <br /> The movie sometimes feels like an academy award, where it's slow and scenic, quiet and peaceful. It's not a movie being added. Kids can sit by. The rustic feel of East Bend and Yadkinville, however, was a film of the 1940s era.
