Oh, it's a great job to be sure. In fact, some of the best scenes in the cinema or at least in Bergman's cinema can be found in this film. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow are as good as you would expect. Are these two bad services? Sven Nykvist delivers some masterly, if unconventionally masterful, cinematographs. The script is very good, especially in single scenes. Sometimes the movie stays behind and the tempo is uneven, though probably deliberate. <br /> <br /> So, what's the problem? Well, the movie is too dark for itself. Other Bergman films are similarly bleak, but not nearly as hard. At some point I just gave up and got a little irritated. I was often very concerned during the film, but in the end I felt uninvolved. It's a great movie, but I doubt I'd ever see it again, and I would not recommend it to friends. Or, if I suggest it, I would for sure warn you what lies ahead. 8.10.
