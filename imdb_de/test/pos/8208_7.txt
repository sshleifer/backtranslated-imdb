Following the advice of a friend, I got this movie. I generally like computers a lot - so a 1995 film about identity theft on the Internet should not go unnoticed. I had some bad echoes about it, but in the end I was not so disappointed: the story, though classic, is somehow interesting and must have been really new then when it first appeared in theaters. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that unlike what we normally see, computer-implemented actions are somehow realistic as they use Windows 3.x and regular computers. Storytelling is average and does not bother the viewer. The ending is typically American. The performance of the actors is fine worldwide, Sandra Bullock usually annoys me with her way of behaving, but this time she seems to have self-control. I would recommend this movie.
