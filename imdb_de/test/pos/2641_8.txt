While I consider his predecessor "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" as the standard against which to compare other teen comedies, "The Wild Life" is one of the better, lesser-known films of that time - and a worthy sequel to it it can be called that. I think the slogan is, "Faster by the creators of FTARH." This definitely applies. Although it lacks in depth when it comes to topics like first date, sex with teenagers and abortions, "The Wild Life" is still a great movie. It's a sheer chaotic fun, especially because of the overwhelming character of Chris Penn, Thomas Drake. If Spicolli did not weed with weeds, he would be Drake. Eric Stoltz is great in his first starring role as the straightforward Bill Conrad. The two characters work well together. Think of a younger, hipperes odd pair, complete with 80s shine. Outside of them, there are many other great things about this movie that are worth mentioning. Lea Thompsom has never looked sweeter, especially while working in the donut shop. Jenny Wright is just delicious and fun to see. Rick Moranis plays a great nerd / pervert who really wants to get his pants on. Thomas Drake's wrestler buddies are hysterical, especially Benny, the little Puerto Rican who says a few memorable lines. One he screamed out in a strip club one night had me on the floor when I saw it for the first time. That says something! Finally, the film ends with one of the best 80s partying scenes ever made. Watch special appearances by Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones, Leo Penn (Sean and Chris Pennes father), and a random Michael Jackson look-alike at the party. Give a score of none other than the man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you can not go wrong. For Van Hagar fans, keep your ears open for riffs found on such albums as 5150, OU812 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. <br /> <br /> If anything bothers the flow of the movie, this is a small subplot with Randy Quaid as a burned-out Vietnam veterinarian. It just seems out of place and unnecessary. Besides that, it's almost perfect. If you're a fan of mindless but funny 80s movies and have not seen this movie yet, you'll expect something special. RENT NOW !!! <br /> <br /> ps. - The credits say Cameron Crowe has a cameo as one of the cops in the movie. Did he turn his back during his scene because I have not found him yet? Someone please help me.
