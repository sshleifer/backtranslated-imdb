Although Flatliners is 15 years old, I saw it for the first time today. I had heard of the movie Flatliners, but there was never a reason why I wanted to go out and borrow or put a point to see the time. Well, I saw it in one of the premium channels and I have to say that it was very good. <br /> <br /> This film was about brilliant young medical students who chose to die. They have found a way to make a person die and bring him back to life. Apart from the All-Star cast, this film had a serious bite. The very idea of ​​exploring death is intriguing enough, but I really thought that the author and director did a great job to give a different but outrageous view. This was not a generic attempt to excite, scare and rattle your thoughts ... this was the real deal. Instead of making an empty, superficial, star-studded thriller, this movie had substance. A nail biter, a white knuckle, a seat edge, a tough nose thriller. I give an 8/10.
