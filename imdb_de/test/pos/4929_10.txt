This was one of my favorite movies from my childhood. I've watched it so often that my band was worn out at some point. I was a big fan of this show and it still is. What I love most about this movie is that it appeals to so many people, young and old alike. I'm watching this movie now and laugh just as hard as the first time. I can now appreciate all the adult jokes I've never experienced as a kid. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my dad (also a big fan of the movie) and I still quote lines from that movie. I love the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the movies. "You save the seats, Shirl and I grab the Dadgum snacks." I also loved the story of Plucky and Hampton and his family who went to Happy World Land. Wade Pig reminded me of my father. I love the role when they finally arrive at Happy World Land and just ride the monorail. This movie is funny and appeals to children and children. The animation, the jokes and everything about it are first class. If you have not seen it, rent it. You will not regret it.
