Before this was shown on MTV or VH1, it was playing in my local theater just before the main movie. I remember this short film more than the day I saw that day. It was the first time I had a music movie like this, but I'll tell you that a 35mm print in a dark theater on the big screen makes a much better impression than a truncated pan and scan version of VH1 below Halloween.
