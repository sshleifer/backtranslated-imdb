This movie is a sleeper - I have seen every mini-series that has ever been on television several times, and this one is the best. Wonderfully cast, played well and the characters are well developed. Helen Morse fits in perfectly with Jean Paget's part - strict, controlled, sharp and a bit warlike. She rebounds well from Joe Harmon, the cowboy / silent / "It'll be ok". I'm sorry that the movie did not stick to the book because there was no romantic interest between Noel Struan and Jean Paget. For those who do not know, this comes from a true story about Japanese women who had been marching in Malaya for three years and did not know what to do with them. Very few of them survived. Neville Shute spoke to one of them, and this is her story. This movie deserves to be in every collection that loves stories from World War II.
