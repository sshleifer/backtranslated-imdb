15 Park Avenue is, as everyone knows, the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister. The manifestation of schizophrenia is still considered a disease that people often ignore when ignored. There are also those who, however far-fetched it may seem, when shown in the film, think that the disease manifests as a result of a supernatural influence. I think Ms. Sen deserves a lot of praise for "15 Park Avenue". It has made a good turn, not just for the general public, but for those dealing with schizophrenics ... relatives, social workers, psychoanalysts. The film actually helps to dispel many myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this mental disorder. I'm told that the film is largely based on their personal experiences with a very close person suffering from this mental illness. In that sense, I am sure that nothing has been disproportionately blown up by what has been shown ... on the contrary, it is a true representation of facts. <br /> <br /> The services are good the whole, as you would expect. Konkona Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi and of course Rahul Bose are very good. They appear as very "real" characters ... credible enough to identify with them sometimes. People may find me awfully strange, but I think there are times when you can identify with Meethi! I suppose we all have a trace of "madness" in us ... maybe more than others. These are the people who are being singled out. Do not we all have our secret fantasies and dreams? Impossible at times? Would we be called "by our rockers" if people could look into those areas of our mind? Would a person with low self-esteem be considered schizophrenic because she / she avoids the company ... would rather live in a world of its own, because that is the only space in which there is a sense of security? <Br /> <br /> Konkona is excellent like Meethi! Her performance is so effortless ... she lives her part. She has shown the ability to lull the audience, to forget the gap between reality and drama! An example is the part in which she is disturbed by Saddam Hussein's arrest on the scene shown on television. Her reaction seems to be so unrestrained and intense ... as if she were really heartbroken in this tragedy! Their brand of Indian English is also so spontaneous and natural. <br /> <br /> However, this can not be said for at least a few other actors. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, both excellent actors, seem to feel uncomfortable conducting their dialogue in English. Their diction is less than perfect ... stilted and influenced, the fact that they make the highest effort becomes more than obvious. Their dialogue delivery is staggering and tends to break the smooth flow of history's unfolding. <br /> <br /> The brutal rape of Meethi (Konkona) seems a bit unnecessary. Any other incident would have been just as good, I think. The point here is that something is triggering the extreme manifestation of the disease. As the psychiatrist explains, one can not say with some conviction or certainty that the incident of rape has helped to emphasize the hitherto latent tendency to schizophrenia. Then why are we exposed to the scene where Meethi is bleeding and unconscious? Did Sen try to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people using violence to stay in power? If so, then the scene of the rape is justified, but not strictly in the context of the main part of the film. <br /> <br /> The end seems to be a bit abrupt. Is the audience expected to find a solution? Where does Meethi disappear? Does Ms. Sen want us to feel that what the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and therefore more credible is true? In other words, is she trying to say that we are not inflexible in judging who lies on this side of the borderline between reason and madness? I am not really sure. <br /> <br /> A movie that is thought-provoking and worth seeing. IF you are the kind of person who likes things neat and tidy ... cut and dried everything, with a waterproof solution for every problem that crops up ... this movie is clearly not for you!
