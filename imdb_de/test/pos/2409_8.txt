I am not sure how to make ten lines from this question, but I will try. <br /> <br /> When Julie went to the dance and danced to slow music. What was the name of the song and who played it? <br /> <br /> I love this song! And I watch the movie over and over again just to hear that one song. <br /> <br /> I did several searches online and even looked up the soundtrack, but I can not find the song. <br /> <br It could be that the song they danced to was not a complete song and was only incomplete. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate if someone out there knows how the name of the song and the group that sang know it. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br /> Frank
