When A Stranger Calls is actually a pretty good movie. I had never seen the original, and when I saw it, I thought it was unique. When When Foreign Calls was announced on TV, the trailer betrayed the end. Well, I never saw the trailer. When I saw this movie, I was surprised how good it turned out. One day I passed him and decided to buy. Now I'm lucky because I thought it would be a very enjoyable movie, which is a nice little movie. It's treated a lot unfairly, and if you're even interested in this movie, you will not hear all the negativity. Camille Belle is not as bad as an actress, as everyone makes her, and she has done a great job in this film. All the haters you hate get over themselves, try to relax and try to enjoy this movie as it is. A funny, youthful Bopper, popcorn stripes. If you have not seen it, please do it because it is much more fun than many of the other slashers that have been made lately ...
