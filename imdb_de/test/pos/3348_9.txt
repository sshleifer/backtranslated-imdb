I only awarded nine instead of ten stars because I really do not approve of pornography. Pornography has a useful purpose in society (I can not always say I can always think of one), but probably also. <br /> <br /> Personal views put aside, I really thought this movie was pretty funny. I did not buy this movie because it was pornography, I bought it because I'm one of those 'Alice' obsessive people who will be watching 'Alice in Wonderland'. I own almost every version available on DVD. It was therefore obvious to complete my DVD collection with it. I have to admit, I was scandalized beyond my expectations, and the whole thing would have been completely offensive if it had not been so weird. Besides, the music is really good and I like musicals. <br /> <br /> Not everyone can make a good Nudie musical. Anyone who has seen "The First Nudie Musical" knows what a stink bomb that was. Considering what a cheap budget with Bill Osco has worked, 'Alice' as a musical is quite remarkable (it's better than some musicals made with expensive budgets). I usually watch the XXX full shock effect, and some of those scenes are scandalous (scandalous, because we're talking about Lewis Carroll). I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed when 'Alice' (Kristine DeBell) started to masturbate. I felt like a voyeur. and the free lesbian scenes with 'Alice' and the cat cats were a bit too unpredictable. <br /> <br /> But the movie has a great sense of humor. There's a particularly funny moment during the Queen orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says, "Who do I have to have F --- K to leave this movie?". Hilarious. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I buy all the sex, it's good for you if you bring your brain here, but sex is human and nothing human detests me. (I do not know if I really feel that way, but I can not resist saying it), some people think everything should be sex. I do not know. Gosh, just show some frick 'in responsibility and decency. This movie definitely brings points for sex addicts, but I would not push your luck the next time you really freak someone out. I mean, we're dealing with children's literature here.
