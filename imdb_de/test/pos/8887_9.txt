Today, we live in sad times when it seems like every comedy movie and TV show is painless and laden with cheap, harsh or bad humor. Most people do not know what it really means to laugh about a comedy, and these people are bound to watch "throw momma off the train." I say without hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, from beginning to end. The comedy is so unpredictable and twisted that we have to laugh out loud again and again. Do not be fooled by the murder story. The plot is not serious enough to worry us about what's going to happen. The story is about a young man (Danny DeVito) who wants to get rid of his annoying, grumpy mother (Anne Ramsey, nominated for an Oscar whose role I think was completely flawless) by killing Billy Crystal's wife Crystal wanted dead because he had stolen his novel. I do not want to spoil the jokes and gags in this movie, but I can only say that you need to watch this movie if you want to laugh. Fast and sincere, a real treat for lovers of comedy movies and the kind of movie you do not see today. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of ****
