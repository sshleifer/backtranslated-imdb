The questions and answers of the human mind are all contained in this masterfully crafted historical documentary. The shearing beauty and horror of a man who goes through life are revealed in the totality. Dieter and Duke are combined and linked by a mental labyrinth transformed into a single straight corridor, into which the walls are plastered with images created by a man characterized by the vibrations of his own vocal cords. This movie has discovered a new dimension of storytelling for about 80 minutes. What do I call this seemingly new meaning? Only God finally knows that a MIRACLE is not something that God does for us, but decides to remain ANONYMOUS? <br /> <br /> This is a requirement to see. If you want to experience the beautiful horror of war, this documentary will cleanse your soul to the core.
