I absolutely love this movie and have seen it many times. I recorded it around 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four, but my cassette is now heavily worn and I would love a new copy of it on video and as far as I know, it has not been repeated since the 80s. I had no answer and it still has not been repeated. The services are excellent. The movie has everything. It's funny, sad, disturbing, exciting and brings you back to school. It's extremely good and keeps you from start to finish. The scene in the shower room is especially terrible. I also can not hear the song Badge by Cream and do not think about this movie. This movie deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is great. Please re-show channel 4 or release it on video or DVD.
