Millions in gold travel by train to the US Treasury. Mitfahr is Lois Lane to report on it. On the way, the train is attacked by masked thieves. They take the car with the armed guards and attack the others. This leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves. The thieves overwhelm them, then Lois Lane jumps in. She throws the thieves off the train (eventually with a rifle), but the train gets out of control. Lois can not stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold. Good that Superman is on the way! <br /> <br /> Fast, exciting action without interruption. Probably one of the best of all cartoons. Just great.
