I really enjoyed this movie when it was first released. Since then I've seen him every time. The political drama is effective, if not particularly new or inspired. The decades since the release of the film have shown that the willingness to cut costs at the expense of public safety is definitely not just presented by a screenwriter. Film is Jack Lemmon's achievement. It is absolutely amazing to watch him at work. He has the gift of communicating so often without saying a word. Next time you watch this movie, look at Jack's face if he does not say anything. He does not have to speak (or even worse, to attack him) to let you know what is going on in his mind. He sees the film in Lemmon's last scene as he lies on the floor, feeling a slight vibration. The horror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images I've ever seen in a movie. It's a perfect spectacle, because it instantly conveys the threat that will arise - if Jack's character is so scared, something terrible will happen. And it does.
