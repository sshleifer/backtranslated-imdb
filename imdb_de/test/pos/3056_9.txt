Utopia, made in France in 1950, was the last film produced by Laurel and Hardy. With the duo's bad reputation for its productions after 1930, I expected this movie to be awful. Although admittedly not up to the standard of their "vintage" comedies, I was pleasantly surprised. It is visible and sometimes really funny! And surely the plot is of the same standard as you would expect. Some gags are derived from their previous work, but considering that this movie was the first movie five years after their last Hollywood-produced film "The Bullfighters," the routines are executed safely as one would expect of these professionals. Some scenes are not much, but the value of this movie is that some scenes are funny and therefore absolutely priceless. I especially liked the bedtime. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I was sad. Our heroes stay on their own lonely island. It is such a metaphor for the truth of real life. Hollywood and its audience had brought the stars to a lonely island of memories, and that was to be the last image they portrayed in the movie. Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later. Stan declined an offer to appear in "Mad's Mad Mad World" in 1963. What a pity that was - a color film, only two years before he died. His health was probably not too high. <br /> <br /> These guys are probably the best comedy actors of all time, and although the movie is far from their true potential, it's still an honor to see them for the last time in the movie and touch those Echoes of her outstanding talent.
