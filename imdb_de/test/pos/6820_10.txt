The Youth In Us is a perfect gem. I saw this stunning short at this year's Sundance Festival. The story took me on a deeply transforming journey. The direction of Joshua Leonard, the acting of Kelli Garner and Lukas Haas, the art direction, the cinematography, the score - each element was faithful. One can only hope that this exquisite and agonizing film will be the prelude to a great work by this gifted director. <br /> <br /> Just as a short film before a feature film is shown in Sundance, commercial cinemas used a similar format to the past. It would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like The Youth In Us could reach a wider audience this way.
