Given the chan films that would follow, this is not bad. Many stereotypes began with the black man at the beginning and when the police officer ordered this "every Hindu in the city". A parade of stereotypical characters enters the scene, including Shemp of the Three Stooges. Charlie seems to be moving quickly from town to Sutton Pl. to the W. Village in no time. The end is stupid. An obvious toy airplane is used when it rises through the sky and then dives with the nose. Ed Wood could not have done better. The final scene is absurd as the killer appears to be straining himself in trying to calm the person who knows his identity. Overall, a look is worthwhile.
