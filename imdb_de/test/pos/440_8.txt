Although Renoir's French Cancan does not seem to be very promising, it's still an effortlessly charming film. The story is a cliché: a lingerie girl, Nini (Françoise Arnoul), is discovered by a nightclub owner, Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals her from her baker friend and drops his current girlfriend, both of whom return for their former lover. Nini has to decide whether to return to her modest life with the baker, to continue the show with her employer or to become a princess, as a prince falls in love with her at some point. I am glad that the film was not the obvious choice, as a smaller film would certainly have. The film ends with the opening of the new Danglard nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, and some beautiful songs and dance numbers. The first of them, "Complainte de la Butte," which also forms the basis for most of the movie's film music, is simply one of the most beautiful songs ever written, and Renoir wrote it himself. If you are a fan of Baz Luhrmann's film Moulin Rouge! You will recognize the melody that appears just before the beginning of the film sung by Rufus Wainwright. Although not very prominent in this movie, everyone I own the soundtrack loves. French Cancan not only has one of the most beautiful songs ever written, but also one of the cutest actresses to decorate the screen. It's hard not to fall in love with this girl from head to toe. 8.10.
