I just watched Eddie Monroe and was very impressed. The story was easy to do when the conspiracy came to a surprising end. Heart-warming performances, action, humor and drama filled the screen. Topnotch from some talented Long Islanders. Great script. This is the best movie Fred Carpenter has done so far, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is based on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. Hard to believe that this is an independent film with a low budget. Imagine what Carpenter can do on a budget in Hollywood. Paul Regina is the last movie and he is very much missed and loved by all. He was a wonderful, successful, talented actor and a great person. He will take care of all of us and we will never forget his dynamic smile and his spirit. Great work for all who participated in this movie. A few beloved scene-stealing and humorous cameos that resolve the serious content. You will enjoy this movie, look at it!
