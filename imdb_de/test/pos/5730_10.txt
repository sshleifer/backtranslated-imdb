Many of us who have attended high school have probably done quite well without having to take a physics course - I know I did not. But after watching this program, I wished I would like it. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a guide to the "Holy Grail of Physics" - the quest for uniting all the fundamental forces of the universe into a "master equation" that Einstein escaped in the last years of his life. Brian Green, a professor at Columbia University, introduces us to this amazing theory in a wonderfully simple way, making us even better at the universe in which we live. <br /> <br /> We begin with the tantalizing possibility of a "master equation" that could unite and explain everything ... everything, including the four fundamental forces that we know exist: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear power, weak nuclear power and gravity. Green takes us on a tour of how our understanding of the universe came into view with Newton, Einstein, and later the quantum-level physics revolution. <br /> <br /> But it's at this point that we come across a problem that has plagued physicists for years and no one has been able to solve it yet. How can we unite all the forces we know? We find out how Green keeps pointing out the problem - that the answer to this confusing problem could be in string theory. However, if we want to describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a very high price. <br /> <br /> It turns out that out of the head anesthetic mathematical equations of string theory that as a consequence we realize that we may live in a universe that does not consist of just three dimensions that you and I see daily plus 1 (for the time) but rather that we actually live in a universe of * 11 *. Dimensions. But the mathematics that results from this theory does not stop there - there is a possibility that there are actually parallel universes. some of them right next to you and me! Could we possibly take seriously such a theory that leads to such consequences? As Green points out; We still have to figure it out, but we know that the mathematics that emerges from these equations shows us that the universe still has much to show us. For those of you who are afraid you will not be able to understand the concepts in this program - do not worry. Professor Green does a wonderful job of doing away with the mathematics and harder concepts of physics, and instead focuses on the * concept * - which, taking all the math out of it, turns from a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple and green one always on an "elegant" concept. Viewers of this program do not need a scientific background; The concepts are so simple that even a child can understand them. When you finish this program, you will really understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe we live in.
