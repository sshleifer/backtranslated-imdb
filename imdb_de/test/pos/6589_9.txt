I was very lucky to see this movie a few days ago as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005. I have to admit that I am very partisan with films that focus on human relationships, especially the tragic sides of life. I also love the majority of Scandinavian cinema productions. Often, the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn is of a particular quality. Character formation in this film is extraordinary in its details and depth. This is despite the fact that we meet a number of characters with very special personal situations and places in their community. The audience at the end of the show was very quiet and thoughtful. I still play some of those scenes in my head and am still amazed at their power and importance.
