I just watched this movie in Austin Texas at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and it was my favorite of the festival. The gymnast is a movie that should not be missed. It's a straightforward "coming-thing" story about relationships, self-discovery, aging, and the courage to change and move forward. This is not just a good story, but the glorious aerial performances by Dreya Weber and Addie Yungmee will take your breath away! Watch this movie! It will soon come to a festival in your area. This movie deserves to be picked up immediately from a large network or studio. I will certainly buy it if it is available on DVD.
