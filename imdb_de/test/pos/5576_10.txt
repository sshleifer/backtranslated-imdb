I love this show. It's a refreshing interpretation of older science fiction styles. They are not afraid to shoot, and when they die, people die. Far too many shows are afraid of it and aim to show the weapons and then have a distance. Farscape is also supplied with many heartwarming characters. They all grow to the point of confusing you to hear them take some of the animatronic out of their box to do the miniseries. From start to finish, farscape leaves you with a sense of hope and despair, as new and unexpected things happen and people live and die and surprise you each time. Worth a watch, even if you do not have time.
