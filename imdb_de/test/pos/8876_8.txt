If I just think about the movie, I have to laugh myself. Anne Ramsey plays an unforgettable role as "Momma", probably the most unpleasant and funniest matriarch ever recorded in the film. Danny Devito and Billy Crystal make a fabulous duo that gives the movie a real warmth. Although not overly complex, the cute story will keep your attention and make you laugh all the way. It's a fun comedy to brighten things up and even entertain the kids. I give my full recommendation.
