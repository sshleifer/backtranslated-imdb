I'm 17 years old and an avid Muppet fan, and although I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, the Muppet movie absolutely deserves to be there with the best. It's hugely entertaining, thanks to the snappy script of Jerry Juhl, and the movie looks pretty, with beautifully staged music numbers. As far as the songs are concerned, I really liked them, sure that they are not the best song score in the Muppet series, but they were very nice to hear, especially Never Before. Never Before is now one of my favorite songs by Muppet along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. The Muppets were fantastic as always, especially the always lovely Miss Piggy, and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was great. And what a brilliant human cast - from Bob Hope to Orson Welles, from Madeleine Kahn (the same wonderful actress who gives us funny movies like What's Up Doc ?, Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman, from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor, which made memorable guest appearances if they did not overshadow the Muppets in a fantastic movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox
