Hello. Hello and goodbye. but before I leave, I want to talk to you. I just want to briefly mention some important points about this film. the first is erotic. especially homo-erotica. <br /> <br /> yes good. Let us begin. If a man and a man love each other, they merge in a spectacular, not to forget delicate explosion of cinema, which we call the merchant of Venice. <br /> <br /> The homoerotic love was in the worst sense sensual. and even more sensual. it was hardcore and emotional. It touched me inappropriately and I'm pretty sure I touched it again. and when nobody looked, I also touched a bit. <br /> <br /> I laughed because portia was rejected. She was the second in line to our girlfriend, the homoerotic love. oh antonio. antoni. only toni i love you. more than you loved this guy. its name may or may not contain a "B". he was pretty ugly. Antoni was very greasy. He foamed his body in a shell of his own hair grease and sensual juices, and went on to wriggle over the Screena and present himself to the guy by the name I like as a movie. for the love of a man like Antoni. only toni
