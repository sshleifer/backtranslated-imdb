Cupboard land. The title itself evokes thoughts of secrets. And that's what Amnesty International is all about in this movie. Government secrets, personal secrets, both are integral parts of this story. By far the biggest spectacle that has been seen for a long time, both Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe were phenomenally victimized in their portrayal of a government interrogator. With only the two actors in this unusual, standard-length movie, it is immediately clear that both actors were dedicated and talented enough to pull the viewer into this small bubble of a world and close the door. <br /> <br /> A WORD CAUTION ... <br /> <br /> What is not mentioned in the description of this movie is that there is a subplot dealing with childhood sexual abuse. While there are no graphical details about the abuse, the nature of the film may be difficult for some viewers, especially considering the intensity of the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Amnesty International films, but this movie attracted me because acting was so extraordinary and I can not help but make this movie one of my personal favorites.
