This movie was released when I was 15 years old and I was able to easily study the topics of the movie. <br /> <br /> That was over 24 years ago and I have not seen the movie since. This time I huddled with some actors, but I still appreciate the movie for what it is. <br /> <br /> Life is not always fair and the good guys do not always win. I think the movie worked well. To reflect this, especially as teenagers, spanking with many girls was always better. It does not matter how nice you are, you can not make anyone like you. Girls / boys like who they want, no matter how hard you try. Sometimes you just have to let go and say next. <br /> <br /> Gary does a good job and shows the intensity of his feelings for Karen. This applies to teenagers when they are fixated on someone. <br /> <br /> I remember sitting with some comrades laughing at some antics. Compared to Fast Times at Ridgemount High, acting is not quite as good, but it's annoying about this movie just because FTARH has a lame, friendly ending where this film has a realistic ending. Good guys finish last !! Gary appears as a rather lame, shabby, dignified material, but we all know those types that are too sensitive. We all know a David, a fun guy who makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Some people here end up, but hello, the end is just what can happen in real life. Some chicks just return, no matter how bad the guy treats them, especially at this age. I experienced that first-hand. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack too !! U2 "I will follow" - Jesus is it so old?
