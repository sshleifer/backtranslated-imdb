Many thanks to The FilmZone for showing you this shabby softcore sex movie at 1 o'clock. I really enjoyed it. To be honest, I expected much more from a sexy cast featuring McKayla, Dru Berrymore and, of course, the talented Chloe Nicholle (as Rebecca Carter). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are really bad, mainly because of the low budget, but a little more effort would not hurt. For example, cinematography makes it like a hardcore porn movie. There is absolutely no effort in flashing. But let's ignore this fact, because we are honest, we have observed "Pleasures of Sin" because of the high levels of sex. <br /> <br /> The sex factor is pretty good and offers sparkling, explicit scenes. Chole Nicholle delivers the best performance of female performers. <br /> <br /> So, my advice is, watch this movie if you're in the mood for explicit sex, or just look at it, if you're a fan of Mrs. Nicholle <br /> <br /> Recommended only for the sex scenes; Do not expect anything else.
