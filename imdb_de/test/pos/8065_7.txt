Although the concept of a 32-year-old woman representing a 12-year-old girl could be a stretch for today's demanding audience, in the 1920s this was what the fans of Mary Pickford expected and expected from her favorite star. The opening scene reveals Annie's tomboy character as the apparent leader of a multi-ethnic street gang in a comic "fight" with a rival group. The sight of a young girl being kicked and kicked in the chin may seem a bit rough, but the scene is played "Our Gang" so hard to take seriously. Annie can definitely handle it and take it too. Once Annie returns to her home and replaces her street buddies with more girlish clothes, it becomes harder (especially in close-ups) to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street kid. For those who can afford the necessary suspension of unbelief, the rest of the movie has rewards. The movie fluctuates between comedy (Annie's gang shows a show) and sentiment (Annie plans a surprise for her Irish policeman's birthday) to tragedy (her father is killed on his birthday). The film gives Mary ample opportunity to show a range of emotions would please her fans from any era. <br /> <br /> Of course, eventually the required "happy ending" will be reached; The perpetrators are caught with the help of Annie's friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her buddies, who drive along a busy passage on a sunny day. This is a great way to end a Mary Pickford movie. <br /> <br />
