"The Devil in the Dark" is the favorite episode of William Shatner. It's also one of my favorite episodes. The program is pure Star Trek because it is one of the main themes of the series: respect for other forms of life. I do not think you could get a clearer example of one of the show's most interesting ideas. In this episode, Kirk and his crew face a monster killing miners on a distant planet. History is an excuse to explore the right that humans must destroy creatures that are an integral part of the environment. Today's concerns about the environment make the show more relevant today than ever before. It's extremely well written and performed with enthusiasm by our beloved actor. A memorable sequence is that Spock joins the spirit of the monster. A lot of tension between Spock and Kirk (who want to solve the problem with different methods) adds to the fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy do some of their best work here.
