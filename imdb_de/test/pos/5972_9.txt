Fantastic Russian film from World War II. Like most Russian World War II films, The Ascent is incredibly cruel. It is also dense in its symbolism. The story tells the story of two partisans, Sotnikov and Rybak (Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin), who are searching for food. On their journey they are discovered by German soldiers who wounded Sotnikov. Sotnikov kills one of the Germans again, which causes trouble for the two partisans and all the others they encounter later. The biggest success of the film is its lively location. Russia is frozen and covered in snow, and it's hard not to feel that the cold is going directly into the bones. Shepitko keeps her shot close to the figures and examines every promontory of their faces. It was probably not the choice, but the film is framed at 1.33: 1, giving the film a sense of claustrophobia. While the entire movie is quite a achievement, I felt that the first half was stronger than the second. My main complaint about the film is that it culminates in a very inconspicuous Christian allegory. I just do not think that the symbolism significantly improves the process, especially if the debate between the two partisans has fascinated me. That's not fair. I weighed the pros and cons of their argument. I started to lean on the point of view of a certain character and then the director shows up and tells me that he is Judas! Despite some hard hands, this is still a must.
