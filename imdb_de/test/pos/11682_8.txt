Let's start by saying first that I was a punk fan most of my life. I have always had a certain lack of respect for LA's scene in the early '80s, which documents The Decline of Western Civilization, with the exception of X and Black Flag, who are more New Yorker and English punkers. After watching this movie, that has changed completely. The depicted people may look like a bunch of idiotic, strung-out kids who think they can achieve something beyond street-cree through their lifestyle, but it's a great display of hedonism at its best, with a bit of fun and a loud skirt 'n'roll. One of the best and most revealing scenes is the interview with Claude Bessy of Catholic Discipline or "Kick-Boy," as he was known to the readers of Slash magazine. The native Frenchman rages like a dirty old Frenchman about punk and gives the viewers hints to many aspects of the punk or the DIY attitude to music, politics and life in general. Darby Crash of the Germs is an idiot most of the time, but Manimal's performance is pretty decent, complete with a young Pat Smear. Black Flag's performance with Chavo Pederast on vocals (filmed in the band a few years before Henry Rollins's entry) is decent, and X and FEAR are the best performers in the film. Watch out for the interviews with the young punk kids. In a documentary, you'll hear some of the funniest things you've ever heard. Highly recommended.
