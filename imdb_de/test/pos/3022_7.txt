After you have watched enough movies, hardly anything reminds you of other films. Nevertheless, this was an observable, if somewhat disturbing, film. I had to switch it off now and then and come back later. Like "Silence of the Lambs," it involves the search for a serial killer who has kidnapped and confined someone to his chamber of horrors. Like "Flatliners", the main character explores a dream world through an experimental process. The surrealism of the dream sequences makes this film as one finds the characters in a situation and landscape where literally anything can happen. And beyond that, continuity and "making sense" are not necessary, which is why it is also a dream for a filmmaker to deliver the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons. They actually feel sorry for the little boy inside the man, but the boy's innocence clearly can not be separated from the man's horrible deeds. The focus, as it must, varies from saving the man to saving his victim.
