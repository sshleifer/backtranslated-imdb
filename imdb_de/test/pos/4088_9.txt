Like a few people I know, I came to Stingers late. only in 2000. Three years later I would miss no episode. The show is really good and, unlike "Blue Heelers" for example, has kept its integrity. The crime is the thing; Personal life is only there when it comes to investigations! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he was a great fit, which did not surprise me. Gary was able to compete with a British or American actor in a similar series. The cast changes occasionally, but every change brings something new and fresh. With arguably the best Australian crew behind the scenes, "Stingers" will continue to be a progressive drama series.
