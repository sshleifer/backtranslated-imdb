FIVE STAR FINAL was one of the best films of the early 1930s. Starring Edward G. Robinson, it was a very sensitive story about a rundown newspaper and its willingness to do anything ... EVERYTHING to sell newspapers. In particular, the old story of an innocent woman is glued over the pages and helps to destroy her happy life - many years after she was accidentally involved in a scandal. The reason why I liked the movie so much was that it was tireless and did not hit you - which shows how low the publishers can be for selling newspapers. <br /> <br /> Here in TWO AGAINST THE WORLD, it's a remake of FIVE STAR FINAL - with a few changes. Instead of Robinson, this movie stars Humphrey Bogart and he's a program director on a radio station, not a newspaper. Otherwise, the story is essentially the same - except that she is a little less nervous and lacks some of the weariness and sensationalism of the original. That's not to say that the movie is bad - it's just not as good as the first movie. In other words, if you have to watch one of these movies, you'll see the first - even if this movie is quite powerful and enjoyable. I loved the story so much that I saw both movies and really enjoyed both of them. High Brow shows that he gets low ratings. The owner asks for dirt - a lot of dirt to get more listeners. They discuss, for example, a multi-part dramatization of a famous murder that took place two decades ago - even if the murderer was acquitted and killed only in self-defense. However, they choose to play the story as if they are guilty, and they even go so far as to send home a writer pretending to be a minister (!) As well as spreading their current name and whereabouts. It is needless to say that this ruins the woman and leads to a terrible tragedy. Then and only then does Bogart feel genuine remorse for producing so much garbage - leading to a final on journalistic integrity and propriety. <br /> <br /> Well played, a great story idea and a message that is. Today it is as important as it was in the thirties. This story must be seen. In particular, pay attention to the wonderful and very emotional confrontation scene in which the daughter attacks the owner and Bogart - it is a true example of drama and writing.
