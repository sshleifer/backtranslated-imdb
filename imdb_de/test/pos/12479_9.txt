Great artists, always suffered when they were young. I could mention Mozart and Beethoven, but that's not the point. <br /> <br /> This film was shot by HG Clouzot, whose family wanted him to succeed in the legal professions. <br /> <br /> His main actor is Louis Jouvet, who studied and practiced as a pharmacist before becoming "The Greatest Actor" and also director of French theater before and after World War II. <br /> <br /> Both had health problems. Clouzot had TB at a young age, Jouvet had heart problems and died on a theater. <br /> <br /> Such events shape the character of men (and of course women). You could even say that today's artists are so poor because they have never suffered and fought for their lives. <br /> <br /> For me this is the biggest movie of Clouzot. "Wages of Fear" is bigger in "Suspense", "Diabolique" also has more "suspense" and a better conspiracy and is more of "female evil". <br /> <br /> Quai des Orf√®vres is more human. Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulle's retinue (mainly Communists and Jews) of collaborating with the Nazis and forbidden to make films until the departure of De Gaulle in early 1946. De Gaulle returned as President in 1958 The protagonists are all good souls: Jenny L'Amour can perform on stage as "Putain", but she is not a "whore" (dictionaries make these words synonyms, but they are not the same), loves her husband, and rejects the slight advances from her (presumably lesbian) girlfriend Dora, the photographer, Maurice, the husband, is jealous and shy, but runs away from the crime scene.He is a coward because he is in a In love with the woman and finally exchanging a more demanding career for love. <br /> <br /> Antoine, the detective (interpreted by the great Louis Jouvet, basically a stage actor, does not play Noir in this French "Gray", as does EG Robinson in "Double Indemnity") shows the flair for pseudo-criminals, tenderness for a negro son (?) and compassion for the true originator of the crime, because he remembers that dad's latrines in a nobility has cleaned the room !! Clouzot was able to slap an actor's face to get him into the right mood, but deep inside he was very human. <br /> <br /> I have his horoscope in front of me. He had Venus in Sagittarius, which means warmth, devotion, charity and altruism. For those who do not believe in astrology, my most sincere apologies ...
