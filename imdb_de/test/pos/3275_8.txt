Ok, maybe Posse can not compare to other popular cowboy / western movies. But that's because there was no funding for these films. If you want to produce a story like this that focuses on African American historical engagement (and NO, servants and "mammals" are not a historical commitment), Hollywood is obviously not too supportive. And believe me, that they were not. The producers and actors sacrificed many "out-of-pocket expenses" to make "posse" just so the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable. Posse may not be an Oscar material (and they do not like black media), but it's a start. It's entertaining and introduces us to the black cowboy that most of us are unfamiliar with.
