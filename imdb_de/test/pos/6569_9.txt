"Uzumaki" takes place in a small rural town in Japan, where people go crazy. They go crazy about vertebrae and spirals. The crisis is getting worse because people are turning into snails and whirling everywhere. "Uzumaki" must be one of the most bizarre and original horror movies I've ever seen. The plot is really smart and the gore scenes are really funny because the movie does not take itself too seriously. "Uzumaki" is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is first class The characters are sympathetic and there are enough shocking surprises to satisfy the fans of Japanese horror. Despite the funny scenes, the overall tone of this movie is pretty dark. "Uzumaki" is not as good as "Ringu", "Ju-on" or "Audition", but if you like Japanese horror movies, you will not be disappointed.7 out of 10.
