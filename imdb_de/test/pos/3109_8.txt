Gosh, I'm learning pretty fast that sometimes, when you're a teenager, you see a movie, and then 20 years later, you get a different perspective - especially because you learn more in 20 years. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great the director was and how much of it made this film fly. All I can say is that I really liked this movie because it touched an area that corresponded to my life: the lifelong friendship between two women. Can that even exist? Well, in certain doses, yes ... and this movie has been a bit outspoken ... "like". <br /> <br /> As a youngster without much life experience, I saw for the first time Therefore, I focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part between the two. At the time I had no idea that there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered it was there ... and how that would affect their friendship. Through her men, her career, the decades that shaped her. And to realize that something was stronger than anything else ... their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else would have. <br /> <br /> Then I got older, studied a bit of film ... and watched the movie again with my best friend from high school. We understand the "rich" and "fancy" angle ... and we are still the best friends ... but this movie is not a cinematic masterpiece ... it can sometimes be considered a bit competitive ... a bit over the top Points (somehow on a "Dynasty" and "Dallas" level for me ..) and frankly I can identify with the "Teddy Bear" scene because we share a bear that means much more than a stuffed fun toy through ours Exams and afflictions with men / careers, etc., so it is not as exaggerated as it seems ....! As I said, Meg Ryan and Matt Latanzzi, as well as Dack Rambo and David Selby, are great in this 1981 play. that's a nice "chick" stick!
