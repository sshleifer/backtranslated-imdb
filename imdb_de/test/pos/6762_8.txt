This is a novelty in Danish film. The mood is not unlike that of Blinking Lygter, also by Anders Thomas Jensen, but with a novel touch. One difference is that there are fewer characters, leaving much more room for them. And what characters ?! The two butchers are perfect. Mads Mikkelsen is a dominant, confused parody and Nikolai Lie Kaas is an indifferent loser to a twin brother who is more or less an unholy pair of the two.
