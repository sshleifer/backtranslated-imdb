Two great stars and a legendary director created a beautiful, pulsating love story that is memorable on many levels and continues. Henry King introduced Jennifer Jones in their first hit "Song of Bernadette" and directed Jennifer Jones again. This movie and Miss Jones are perfect in this role, offering an exciting, beautiful performance that illustrates the conflict between the character and Bill Holden In the 1950s, with a series of smash-hit films that began with Sunset Blvd, Stalag, they found a homerun after the home run. Born yesterday, Country Girl, Picnic and, of course, the River Kwai are in this Great role. I can only imagine that this movie is just Holden. I loved and cried the end every time I saw it. For anyone who has ever loved and lost, you will understand. For those who do not have, you will not.
