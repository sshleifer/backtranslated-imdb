This movie was awarded in Cannes for its acting and it is not difficult to see why. (A few spoilers - but in the end you have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of the war between Russia and Germany in World War II is Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) in Boris (Aleksei) in love with Batalov) but they have one Spit, when she learns that he has reported in the army. Boris goes forward before Veronika can tell him she loves him. Boris is shot dead, but his last fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family. Mark, Boris' cousin, rapes Veronika, who feels obliged to marry him. Demoted and humiliated by the cowardly Mark, Veronika clings to the hope that Boris will one day return. Excellent camera work and wonderful set pieces by director Kalatozov. (For anyone interested in motion picture technology, another film by Kalatozov, I AM CUBA, has at least two great set pieces - one of which is a long camera ride that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana and two stories about a cigar factory Windows and follow the procession on a long, long alley - all without a cut.) Excellent spectacle, especially by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as uncle of Boris), which becomes all the more poignant by sheer understatement. A devastatingly romantic film with a stunning performance by Samoilova. (This film is often associated with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.)
