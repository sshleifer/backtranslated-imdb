I liked this movie. I saw it the day after the gala kick-off at the Toronto International Film Festival in front of a crowded house that must have gone well. Director Gavin Hood should be present for today's movie screening, but unfortunately his twins were born just hours before, so he had to fly back home. "2 births in 24 hours," he joked about it. Rendition refers to "extraordinary rendition" - a term in which suspected terrorists in the US can be sent without the legal consent of their parents to question and detain prisons abroad , <br /> <br /> It is fairly predictable - an innocent Egyptian-American man who is falsely accused of being a terrorist "disappears" while on his way from South Africa to Washingon DC. He is sent abroad while his wife (Reese Witherspoon) is struggling to find him and free him. But what makes this movie special are some good storytelling possibilities: 1) A story with a human touch of what's going on in the scene where a suicide bomber bomb explodes; 2) the humanity of a CIA agent who tries to understand and be honest about what's really going on; and 3) the storytelling chronology, which makes it a tight, tight story that moves and twitches at the right moments. Ah - relief! And a mix of emotions spinning around as the story fights for an end. <br /> <br /> Allround-strong acting with Meryl Streep as outstanding Vixen.
