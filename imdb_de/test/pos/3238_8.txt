I just went to Northanger Abbey from the local library and did not expect much. Imagine my surprise with this gothic pleasure! Northanger Abbey is one of the weirdest places you've ever seen, with empty passageways and ornate rooms full of hidden secrets. The glory of the film is that it never reveals everything: your imagination is free and runs with the imagination of the main character, a Kathrine M., our real world. <br /> <br /> If I were to describe this excellent film in a word, that would be surrealistic. Throughout the movie, dreams are woven that enhance mood. Sometimes it's hard to say what's real and what's not; That's wanted, I think. Atmosphere prevails. The music is not what you'd expect from a movie by Jane Austen: it's scary, flute and drums, high and haunting with an undercurrent of fear. If a soft, pleasant melody were played in Northanger Abbey, it would be inviting. Well, it's a premonition, a gloomy palace with crazy walls. (But the characters, you have to see them for yourself!) <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a very nice evening, Northanger Abbey is the place for you.
