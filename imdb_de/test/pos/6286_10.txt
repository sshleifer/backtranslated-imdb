This was such a funny movie that was soon forgotten, probably because there are so many young and young adult comedies like this one. The movie is not as predictable as you think. Crawl is uninteresting, but funny and caring, and above all, a very dedicated friend. Nevertheless, an unlikely game for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly friendly friend at home. If he helps to feel better at school by showing them in the neighborhood and encourages them to socialize more, they become friends, but it is completely platonic. When she realizes that her boyfriend may make a suggestion, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to enjoy her free relaxed college party life in college, is not yet ready to have a life in marriage and marriage Responsibility to live. They learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her that he will help her out of the marriage. When her friend suggests her in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot. He tells the whole family to make her a suggestion, and gives her his diamond ring, which he expresses, was all his time (he must have come from money or something, well, they never really show a close-up of the ring). The message of the film seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and to judge them before you get to know them. Rebecca's friend, whom her parents love, became angry when we found out that he had slowed down his new girlfriend after Rebecca (Amber Thesan) and crawl, so that Rebecca stopped crawling and thought they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was mad at him, which, considering it, was somehow unfair since they were not a couple, but I think they started liking each other. And I think she thought there was more. The film never showed that they actually became a couple, they left the audience free. They never actually kissed, even though there was one part they almost did. That seemed to misunderstand most viewers. Many people saw it and said that it would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends all the time, even towards the end. And she did not introduce him as her friend; Still, they never told their parents that they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did it. Even if he never became her friend, they could still have been friends. For some reason, Femanin men were in the '90s, and there was this big stereo type that women liked Femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that). They say that women like the sensitive guy, the crawl was proved by his friendship with Rebecca. But when I saw the movie, I have to admit, when I look around, I thought I went for the first boyfriend. Still, it was a creative film that tried to learn a lesson about friendship and judging others.
