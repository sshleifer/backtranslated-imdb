SPOILER ALARM !!!! This was my son's report about the movie he wanted me to write. He wrote that, I swear it. With Malcolm in the midst of Frankie Muniz and Nickelodeon Amanda Bynes they can show business. They work together with actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar and turned it into a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) must go to L.A. to retrieve it. Jason's father does not believe he wrote this essay. Every time they see each other, Jason Wolf (Paul Giamatti) asks to call Jason's dad because he wants to RETURN his essay !!!! Wolf does not make the film, but the company's president does it. In the end, the family and Kaylee watch the movie Made by Wolf Pictures, based on a real story by Jason Shepherd.
