I Sell the Dead is a big, sloppy horror comedy that does not take itself too seriously. This has advantages and disadvantages. The movie's 85 minutes are bubbling over and the movie is full of bits, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes bloody, occasionally all three at the same time, but the individual bits are far better than the sum of the parts of the movie. <br /> <The story as it is follows the professional grave robber Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monaghan). Arthur's criminal Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) has just cut his head off for murder, and Arthur has one night left before his own head is forfeited for the same crime. Arthur insists that he is innocent of murder, but there are many other crimes he wants to admit when bribed by a Catholic priest (played by Ron Perlman) with Irish whiskey. <br /> <br /> Since the film is a series of grave goods that Arthur has confessed to become a kind of horror anthology - a series of disjointed stories, all by a similar cast (Arthur and Willie) and a similar topic (grave robbery) are interconnected. Like most horror anthologies, there is no unified mythology, as all mythologies are true and occur simultaneously, even if they contradict each other. <br /> <br /> It probably did not help that I saw this movie the same night as Trick Treat, a horror anthology that avoids all the traps I sell the dead to. In fact, Trick 'r Treat's anthology tells a more consistent, consistent story than I Sell The Dead, which is conceived as a united narrative narrative. The other problem with the movie (and I recognize that this is an insane nicks-picking.) So the movie plays fast and easy with the story. Grimes is killed with a guillotine. We could stretch a point and say that he was killed by a Scottish girl, a forerunner of the French Guillotine, but the Scottish girl was abandoned in 1709 and this movie is filmed a good hundred years later since Burke and Hare were mentioned and they were turned down Murder executed in 1829. Grave robbery as an industry became obsolete with the passing of the Anatomy Act (1832). Therefore, the movie must take place beforehand. <br /> <br /> I know this comes up The ultimate in historical nerdiness, and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all kinds of dead, undead and legendary dead are possible. The simplest way to anchor a fantasy in order to convince the audience to expose their unbelief is to let the imagination bounce off using something genuine and authentic. And it's not that the story of grave robbers or body robbers or the resurrection (call it what you like it) is a boring story. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing is that writer. Director Glenn McQuaid clearly knows the story above all the good parts. When Grimes first arrives at Arthur as his apprentice, he correctly tells Arthur that as Resurrectionists, they do not steal the clothes from the dead, because stealing corpses is an offense punishable by a small fine while stealing clothing Crime that can be punished by deportation or possibly even death. So you would expect Will and Arthur to take off the body at this point (and for the rest of the movie), but of course not. You could blame the director for ignoring his author's script, but not if the author and the director are the same person. <br /> <br /> My point is not that there should have been a lot of naked bodies in the hand. In the movie, I would like to say that if you want to address this peculiarity of the law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur would do that Even if this means that Willie and Arthur are chasing a zombie through a cemetery and trying to take off his clothes and stuff them into the empty coffin so they will not be deported for stealing the clothes of the walking corpse. Do not consider the matter at all. <br /> <br /> Aside from the historical nerdiness, I Sell The Dead is a small but funny horror movie that could have been much more.
