The Scandinavians are pretty good at making me laugh at the sad nothingness of my soulless life, huh. The filming here was incredibly meticulous, every bit of framing, every dead look, every element of the color palette, every snippet of muzak or waddle that street cleaner was there to hammer home the quiet emptiness of this world. I think I would have found the general sense of emptiness to be presumptuous if its absurdity had not been genuinely funny and understandable. As if Andreas tells his boss that he misses children and looks up and the guy is smiling and standing halfway to the door, this is a kind of sad, but true reflection of working with people. They spend 7 to 8 hours a day with them and see more of them than of the people you love, but in the end they know in the depths that they are not taking care of your problems and you. <br /> <br /> This could have been a movie the Coens would have made if they had been born in Oslo and not in Minnesota. I think their humor is more aggressive and penned into the cinema's past, but they have the same technique and their films have the same basic feeling that life is pretty trivial. <br /> <br /> I will stop before I go to persuade myself to take a bus into the wintry wilderness.
