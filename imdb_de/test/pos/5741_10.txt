My partner and I saw a bottle of wine last Saturday, and although we initially had our reservation when the story started, it was actually quite gripping. The scene, in which one of the characters was brutally murdered with knitting needles, was particularly shocking and reflected the work of Korean New Wave author Park Chan Wook. The weapon of choice was a special masterpiece, allowing us to look into the psyche of 'Granny' and change the connotations of a loving, warm grandmother into a murderous witch. The dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical in expressing the innate paranoia of the protagonist. Pavlosky's staging of mise en scene also highlights the nerve-wracking and manic atmosphere of nocturnal events. In conjunction with the Oscar-worthy performances, they create a frightening and thought-provoking masterpiece. The end, which I will not spoil here, reminded my partner and myself of M Night Shyamalan's institutional masterpiece, The Sixth Sense, because it is a startling turn that made me think for weeks after viewing. Definitely one, to see repeatedly!
