I saw this movie thinking and thought it would be absolutely terrible and was ready for all the dizziness, bad special effects, etc. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not to say it's the best vampire movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst. I liked the whole alternative reality / dream state that went into the movie. The graphics were pretty good for a movie directly on DVD and I liked the overall picture of the movie. I enjoyed the main character Sai. I usually hate the female leads, but there was something that interested them. Yes, she makes some bad decisions, but that was to be expected. Yes, the other characters were stereotypical, but I expected that, too. I do not know if I would highly recommend this movie, but give it a shot and you'll be pleasantly surprised. I put this on my guilty list of joys.
