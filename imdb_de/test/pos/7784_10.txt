Well, this is the best comedy movie I've ever seen ... My two favorite actors have done a good job. Salman Khan and Aamir Khan rocked. I hope to see Andaz Apna Apna Part 2 as soon as I hear that they will come back with Part 2 as well. I have a request to those who have not seen it yet. Please buy a DVD and have a look at it. You will not be bored. I watch this movie once a week. Everything else was good in this movie too. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others The music is good too, there are also beautiful songs. There is a certain feeling that will kill you from laughing. Salman Khan played a very nice role and also Aamir.
