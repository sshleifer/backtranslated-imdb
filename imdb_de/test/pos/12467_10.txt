Beautifully filmed director Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire) creates a story that brings the entire legend of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke and Tarzan of monkeys to life with reverence and dignity, to an extent not previously available in Tarzan films was see. Christopher Lambert makes his debut as a young lord raised in the wild by a female gorilla after the death of his parents in Africa. Later he returned to a world alien to him, class and privilege. He feels completely out of place. As soon as he finds out what happened to the monkeys that raised him and her world, he realizes he has to go back. A sad but triumphant story told against the backdrop of fantastic views. This is one of those movies that is essential in any Cinemaphile collection.
