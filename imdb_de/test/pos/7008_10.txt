While most films depicting horrible aliens are in the end cheap copies of the "Aliens" series, Pitch Black is a fine piece of sci-fi and a great movie. Maybe my favorite aspect of the movie is the lighting. In this film, many different colors, shades and light intensities are used, which determine the mood and give the film a unique feeling, something other than the normal movie lighting, to which we are usually exposed. Vin Diesel brilliantly brings his character to life by skillfully avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal. After all, the film is the personal journey of Riddick (Diesel's character), which is why Vin fortunately does not drop the ball. The rest of the cast (with the exception of the talented and gorgeous Claudia Black) was unknown to me, but all performed wonderful performances and animated the different characters with unique quirks and mannerisms. Pitch Black is a perfect example to make a great movie without the resources of an excessive budget. The special effects are more than adequate, but, as in many high-budget blockbusters, they are by no means the only focus. It's a great movie because it uses science fiction as a medium to narrate a gripping, provocative story rather than telling a mediocre story to exploit the flash of science fiction.
