The image of this image will only grow over time. Better than one of the best image nominees in the year 97, and repeated sightseeing will be rewarded. I've seen it three times now, so I know it. Anderson has been compared to some of the great American directors (Altman, Scorcese, Tarantino), and he could have those influences, but chances are that after a few more movies he's considered part of the shortlist himself. <br /> <br /> One last note: Julianne Moore's "Amber Waves" will be remembered long after other 90s movie characters have faded. THE best performance of the year in all four categories.
