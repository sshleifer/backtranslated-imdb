That's really fun. I really enjoyed it, even if it was not that original. Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great! All the characters are cool and the story is pretty good, with Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy just amazing! Rene Russo is outstanding in her role, and there's a lot of laughter (especially when Deniro plays Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover's lines), and the finale is just great. Yes, it's just another run of the mil "Buddy Buddy" movie, but it works because of the fantastic chemistry between De Niro and Murphy !, and there were also some great car chases! It's nothing really great, but I found it very funny and the perfect time to pass the time! However, the main rogue was very weak and not good at all. This is far from being the best "buddy" buddy cop movie, but it's still a very entertaining movie, and I thought it was pretty well done and well written! Besides, the end was pretty funny. That's really fun. I really enjoyed it, even if it was not that original. Robrt De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great, I highly recommend this! The director is very good! Tom Dey does a very good job here Great camera work, cool angles and a fast pace of the film. Acting is a lot of fun! Robert Deniro is as always incredible and incredible, he's weird, very personable and had fantastic chemistry with Eddie Murhpy. Usually awesome stuff, pulling some really funny faces, seeming to have fun, having some funny lines and having a really cool one Character! (De Niro Rules !!!!!!!) hilarious, just as De Niro did his usual fun stuff, obviously to be loved in front of the camera, and while he can do that while sleeping, he still enjoyed watching ! (Murphy Rules !!!!). Rene Russo is fantastic here! She had a cool character, and although she was not very busy, she added a lot of screen presence and always made her character interesting, but she was just great! (Russo rules !!!!). William Shatner is surprisingly funny here and has not exaggerated it. He brought some good laughs into the movie. The main villain is fine, but somehow weak and rather boring, he has nevertheless done what he had to do sufficiently. The rest of the cast is doing well. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel. *** 1/2 out of 5
