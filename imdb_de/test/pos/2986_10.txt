A remarkable movie that brought to the surface all kinds of feelings I had when I was a lot younger. I loved it and the Elton John music. I remember being in the movies as a kid and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone who saw this movie when it was released. <br /> <br /> The dreams that inspired him I have never parted with myself for decades, and when I saw the movie recently, it threw everything back. However, I admit that my children (in their 20s) have not experienced a similar emotional onslaught. A generation thing? <br /> <br /> Why is not it on DVD?
