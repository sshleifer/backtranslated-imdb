I've seen and enjoyed all the Chameleon movies, and I have to say that they get better with every movie. Bobbie Phillips is awesome and my granddaughter wants to be just like her. I'm glad they brought a "Brother" character for Bobbie (Kam), so we can expect more exciting shows. Bobbie is beautiful, sexy and cute and at the same time independent and everything that every woman could wish for!
