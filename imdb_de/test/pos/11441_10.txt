This little movie awakens many loving and bad memories of what can happen when you're a musician. The not so pleasant space for the band, the management of the venue, telling you what to play, the sheer ecstasy of applause ...................... ......... In fact, it is very accurate in the way musicians, professional and others, are portrayed who have come a long way to perform a season of performing at a venue. There are times when things are going perfectly well, and there are times when you immediately miss your partner and wonder what the hell you are doing so far from home. In the end, you have to make the most of it, because there is no other way out.
