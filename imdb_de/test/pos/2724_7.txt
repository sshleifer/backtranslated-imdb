Aparna Sen 15 Park Avenue is a film about the nature of reality. <br /> <br /> A young, insane girl who likes to imagine things and hear voices, possibly out of sheer boredom, is considered schizophrenic by her educated father and a controlled senior step-sister. Mastered, compassionate and treated like an invalid (even if she is out of love and affection), she has the chance to develop as a normal person. When a boy offers to marry her, father and stepsister passionately try to prevent him from taking such a step. A traumatic experience, which was primarily caused by her protected existence, finally leads her across the line of no return and she lives all day in her own delusional world. <br /> <br /> The family and society around them are intolerant of their delusions and want to suppress them with medications, electro-shock therapy and everything else, even if they all have delusions of one kind or another. <br /> <br /> Her mother does not see the irony of being deluded by a ghost craftsman. Her stepsister is a professor of physics and teaches, among other things, quantum mechanics, a discipline in which a stream of experts accepts parallel multi-universes and much more dimensions in space than the three we see. A friend admiringly recounts an experience with a holy person who claims to hear hallucinatory voices. Far removed, George W. Bush has real or false delusions of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction and may invade Iraq. <br /> <br /> As some audiences have already pointed out, Aparna Sen has refused to attack the mother of all delusions - the main religions, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> In other words, accepted reality is what a majority or influential minority believes. have suffered as a result. <br /> <br /> The controversial and difficult end of the film was necessary to show that this is a film about the nature of reality rather than the case study of a schizophrenic girl. <br /> <br /> All performers have shown great performances, but Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma have distinguished themselves. Aparna Sen has produced an outstanding philosophical film.
