Brilliant actor and brilliant picture !! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning, it's just so touching and at the same time real, but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was anything but human, and I think these movie shows are terrible human beings who can act under certain circumstances. Modern war films spend so much money on effects. This is just a direct, intelligent movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A film that really represents evil and hatred in fear and fate. How crazy the world is and the power of will and friendship, love and passion. An unconditional film and without a doubt the best war movie ever! Many have tried to copy, but still there is no movie that is as good as this !!
