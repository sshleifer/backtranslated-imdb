I saw the first demonstration of driving lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows that he can pass Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing like the presumptuous mother. Julie Walters is funny as Lady Evie Walton, her mouth is worse than a sailor. I hope this movie is picked up by an American distributor so everyone can see it. This movie is not just about driving lessons, but lessons for life. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between the desire to obey his arrogant mother and his vicar and to live his own life. It's an amazing movie by an amazing director who has taken his life and put it on the screen so everyone can see him and anyone who can.
