In 1989, Aardman Animations introduced the two heroes in The Grand Day Out. In 1993, they fought a bad penguin in The Wrong Trousers. And in 1995 they had to rescue sheep in A Close Shave from a bad robot dog. In 2005, they are back fighting something that used to be cute and cuddly in the Were-Rabbit's curse. In this feature, Wallace and Gromit work in Anit Pesto, a pest control company. There will be a giant vegetable competition, but the rabbits will eat the neighboring vegetables. Wallace and Gromit take care of this problem. But Wallace had an idea. He will brainwash the rabbits with his machine. After that, something suddenly eats all the vegetables in the neighborhood and it's big. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the day. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. It retained what the three previous chapters possessed, and instead it added many Hollywood actors to voice overs. Wallace and Gromit has not changed. Wallace is still the cheese-loving freak as always, and Gromit is the dumb newspaper reader. Besides, the script was not as shabby as other family movies. There is a twist of who the Were Rabbit really is. The direction of Nick Park (the director of the three previous chapters) does a really good job with the story. Instead of adding the Hollywood formula, he simply adopted the style of the previous chapters and added a little dark fantasy. Well done, Nick. The rabbits are also funny and adorable, but the funniest bunny in the movie is one who has the mix of Wallace in it. The characters were not bad and they were not annoying, but they will never outdo Wallace and Gromit. The animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful. I've never seen a sound-animated movie that's been so great since Chicken Run. Overall, fans of both Knuckleheads (including teenagers) will love this awesome movie. It is a successful film that should receive an Oscar next year. Hurray, Wallace and Gromit. 10/10
