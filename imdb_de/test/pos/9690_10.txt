Jackass Number Two is by far the funniest movie of the year 2006, beating the funky Clerks II as well. It's one of the best recent installments that has outdone Jackass The Movie in every way. Well, this movie is perhaps the funniest, but it's also the most offensive, horrific, and most disgusting. You will feel sick several times throughout the movie. I am serious when I say that you should not eat before watching or during the movie because there is a high likelihood that you will literally come back to persecute you. Keep drinking as low as possible. You have been warned because exactly as the slogan says, you will beg for mercy. Jackass Number Two follows the crazy men of the hit series Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius, Preston Lacy, Honorable McGhehey, Dave England, Brandon DiCamillo and Jason 'Wee Man' Acuna (absent from Chris' Raab Raab is Raab), as they perform the most vile life imaginable - threatening and vile stunts. I'm not going to say what the stunts are, but I want to warn you that any scene with an animal will be sick or mentally scary and that a performer (again, without saying so) will flirt with death several times. <br /> <br /> What makes Jackass Number Two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves, but how the cast reacts to them and to them. To put it simply, if they loved it and had a great time, so will you (this applies to 99% of the stunts). All stunts are very original and 90% of them have never been seen before. You will see a few recycled, but they are faster. You would not believe it's really important to make a movie like this, but it does. Jeff Tremaine's director makes the movie so much funnier, because he accompanies the gang in their comedic timing, which is just awesome for him. He could have just sat back and slept during the shoot (actually, you see in the movie he slept through the filming), but he went out and helped those crazy guys do the stunts as much as he could. I give Mr Tremaine two thumbs up. Another great thing about Jackass is the bonanza of famous cameos, and this time BMX legend Mat Hoffman, skateboard god Tony Hawk, director / actor Jay Chandrasekhar (super troopers & Beerfest), actor Luke Wilson, actor by Jason Dolphins and Jason Taylor Director / Actor Mike Judge (Office Space). The scenes with Hoffman, Taylor and Chandrasekhar are some of the funniest in the movie as it's even funnier to see these men as part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is one of the most politically incorrect, morally degrading, and just the wrong films of all time, if not most. Still, it's so original and so funny that you do not care. You'll gasp for breath, laugh so hard you'll cry and jump out of the seat while you laugh the entire movie. Due to the explicit and potentially disruptive graphical content of this movie, no one under the age of 18 should watch this movie. You were warned. I hope you like Jackass Number Two as much as I do. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - Spy
