Chokher Bali was shown at the (Washington) DC Film Festival on April 15, 2005. Director Rituparno Ghosh was there to give a short introduction and then answer questions. As always, I think Aishwarya does a fantastic job. I can understand those who think they should be more aggressive or bitchier, but would that be realistic in 1904? Maybe, maybe; I'm not so sure about that. I think their interpretation was valid, although there could be other ways. <br /> <br /> I hate to use the word, but this was the "most unattainable" Indian movie I've ever seen. I know some Indian history, Hindu religion, etc., but the level of detail here was far above me. Of course you would understand the film much better if you know Hinduism and its customs, especially Customs. as they were c. 1904. I've missed many things - one of which was the fact that my mother-in-law wanted to have Binodini in the house as a kind of counterbalance to her daughter-in-law Ashalata. * Spoiler * Ghosh had several things to say that made the movie much better for me declared. First, the original Bengali version was 20 minutes longer. So what was left out? Apparently, three main points: an initial segment in which Binodini (Aishwarya) E. Bengal leaves for Calcutta. According to the director, different characters speak W. Bengali vs.. E. Bengali - some political comments will be added later. Of course, all this is lost in the Hindi version, and certainly for a non-Indian like me, it would not have bothered anyway - but a statement of the Bengali situation would certainly have done it. Next, there was a segment in which Binodini wrote a poem - a sign of their independence, etc. Finally, a few things about the jewelry. Although some people think it's too long, I think the original, longer version would have been clearer. <br /> <br /> The women's hair was apparently another sign (again Ghosh) - the mother-in-law had short hair (short hair for Hindu widows), her sister - also a widow - had longer hair (more modern!) and Of course, Binodini / Aishwarya had extremely long, waist-length hair (rejection of the status of widowhood). <br /> <br /> The end really threw me. Binodini, who had never had any political thoughts, suddenly writes a political manifesto. Whoa! Ghosh explained that he was at a film festival in Locarno when the subtitles were finished. The subtitles use the word "land" in Binodini's letter. Gosh said a more fitting word would be (I forget his exact word) something like "self" or "independence" - she spoke of her own liberation and "finding" - not of Bengal, India and the British. Why does Binodini disappear the day after he finds Behari? Apparently, because she realizes during her stay on the Ganges that she does not need a man, not a man, to define / complete her. She can just be herself. So she rejects Behari, who threw herself a few months earlier (?), And just starts. Of course, I'm not sure how she buys her next meal, but that's another question. <br /> <br /> The red cloth (again Ghosh) she buys represents both "revolution" and "passion". I am not 100% sure why she is covering the dying woman with a cloth, but she may reject the passion / revolution? The binoculars Binodini uses throughout the movie (Mahendra and Ashalata, the boat on the Ganges, etc.). She is a voyeur to see a life she yearns for but can not. In the end (I missed it!) If she leaves the binoculars with the letter on the table and shows that she no longer needs them - she starts walking to lead her own life. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Tagore quote at the beginning said how he apologized for the end ... Obviously, Tagore wrote this as a series, hooking his readers with the sexy widow's pieces. But in the end he sold himself for conservatism, and Binodini knelt down before Mahendra and Behari and asked for forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote to Tagore and put him to task because of his sold-out ending ... and Tagore replied with his apology for the end. Of course Ghosh goes the other way in the movie.
