From the first drum hit of "I'm Gonna Groove" to the last guitar hit of "Whole Lotta Love", this set of two DVDs may be one of the best music DVDs released since the release of the Beatles Anthology have come at the beginning of this year. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this DVD is that on Disc 1 you can find a whole concert and many TV appearances. For example, the entire concert of the Royal Albert Hall is on the DVD, as well as some of the best performances of the band's last concert in Knebworth. At the Royal Albert Hall Concert, for example, the band had plenty of room to improvise. Jimmy Page's guitar solos make "Dazed And Confused" a huge rock-power ballad, in contrast to the relaxed blues song on Led Zeppelin I. <br /> <br /> Next on DVD 2 is a promotional video for the Led Zeppelin III hit "Immigrant Song". The video is one of Zeppelin's toughest rock songs. It's about as sketchy as a pre-MTV video, but it shows a lot of guitar power from Jimmy Page, as it comes from a live performance. After the video is over, we are overcrowded in the transition with a brief image of fans filling the seats at Madison Square Garden. The following are performances that should be part of "The Song Remains The Same", but did not cut it. Excellent riffs as in the songs "Black Dog" and "The Ocean" were both available. After the Madison performances, we are treated to Earl's Court. Most of the Led Zeppelin IV material was played here, the most popular song Zeppelin ever recorded, "Stairway to Heaven." It's brilliant as always, even more than the version on IV. At the end of more than 5 hours of live material, Led Zeppelin's last concert at Knebworth in August 1979 can be heard. As a Spectator Watching this, they must admit that the voice of Robert Plant is getting throatier and deeper through all the cries he has made in the past, and this is obvious here. For songs like "Kashmir" and "In The Evening," Plant does not have his old vocal boost, but returns to "Whole Lotta Love" for another song. <br /> <br /> All in all one of the best music DVDs ever released, just next to the big "Beatles Anthology" dossier set that was released earlier in 2003. The sound, in both 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital, gives you, just like the Beatles DVD, a sense of being on stage with the performers standing right next to them, as you would feel on the Beatles DVD when they jam in the studio. Although the Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different bands, they each received different DVDs. Although this set only appears on two discs compared to the five Beatles sets, it still feels very filling to the viewer after they have gone through all the content. It is also a pleasure to watch again and again, not only because of the sound quality, but also because of the sheer energy on stage when Robert Plant starts to sing. <br /> <br /> A brilliant effort by Atlantic.
