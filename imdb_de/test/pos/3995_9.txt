It's not surprising that this movie was made at the time of I'm Kwon Taek. He examined the early beauty and tragedy of the life of the Chosun dynasty in Seopyonje and delicately researched a well-known Korean folk tale in Chunhyang. This included his last two films. Most surprisingly, Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 offer, is not presented in the pansori style of these two previous films. Nevertheless, the experienced hand of I'm getting through. Together, we explore the life of a real person: a nineteenth-century Chosun painter who rides on the edge of modernity, but is not a nobleman, and that is why contemporary Korean society is causing a stir with its fame and audiences and artistic expression contempt for the old Korean nobility and his contempt for possibly Japanese colonial rulers. The painter Chang Seung Up, known as Oh Won (played magnificently by Choi Min Sik, the famous star of Park Chan Wook's legendary "Old Boy"), is becoming more influential throughout the movie and therefore more dangerous. The contemporary Korean public will support such a hero, regardless of the fact or perhaps the fact that he was so outlawed in his day. At the same time I feel the beauty and the tragedy in the story is preserved. I'm a master at capturing the former idiosyncrasies of his country, and in this film he almost trumps himself. As expected in a movie, cinematography is breathtaking, the editing is precise, and the story is central. <br /> <br /> Actions are directed against Seung Up, family ties are tested and broken, scandalous behavior is alleged (and is sometimes real), anything to overthrow the man who has "painted fire". But despite all the intricacies I have from Seung Up's detailed but sometimes complicated account, Seung Up somehow manages to survive. He becomes legendary through his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after just one glance. Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money with "Oh Won". In other words, lines of people who want to use the real seung up, an artistic star, are starting to form. But he can not be manipulated. His prudence in fending off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience, if not the cast. <br /> <br /> What is Seung Up thinking? He has strong feelings and opinions about painting, such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and never really finished. He abhors those who would try to turn art into profit. And he does not care about politicians who use their power to bring about artistic beauty and then discard the artist as treacherous. But he also means that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals. Dreadful scenes with foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. I am the historical epic motif of the signature and its influence on the empire remains prominent in this million epic. <br /> <br /> The protagonist gets more grief when he refuses to paint, and those who look after him. At that moment, history takes on a whole new meaning, not just political, but social in nature. I accept the topics praiseworthy realistic. <br /> <br /> He, won oh, becomes a Jesus figure. People believe he is capable of artistic miracles, and the government believes that they need his artistic support, but the protagonist remains stubbornly independent and contemptuous of what others want or do about him. After all, both the government and the people come in a way that comes directly from the Bible. His holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; he dies for the sins of the citizens, the art critics, the politicians who persecute him. <br /> <br /> But does he die? As with most of my films, there remains a question. Will Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not address this question; it merely represents a possible end to the true man of Chang Seung Up or Oh Won. No death is depicted because no death is known. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find a flaw in this movie, but I've become so good at portraying various historical absurdities in its culture that it hardly surprises. As usual for my films, cinematography, editing and writing are first rate. It's a well-developed film, marked by I's uncanny narrative ability. Granted, he can best do this through the ancient Korean music art of Pansori. Nevertheless, the film contains a stretch of this admirable art form, and in the end, the audience feels as if they are privy to a grand, unimagined story. And they have, because that's what I am gift.
