It's been a very long time since someone last made a movie like this one. A so-called B-movie. Maybe it was not a great movie, but it's fun to see the classic Bruce Cambell, he has his good parts, funny, disgusting, even artistic. <br /> <br /> ****** Spoiler Ahead ******* <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---- --------------------------------- ------------- -------------- ------------- <br /> <br /> The part in which his wife is a dummy robotic avenger I do not know about you, but I felt so funny, so sad and disgusted in a good way. I compare this scene with the scene from Fly 2, where his dog dies as a monster. Lets you think, my God. <br /> <br /> ---------------- ------------------- ------- ------------------- ------------------------ ------ - ------------------------- <br /> <br /> ******** No more spoilers ****** *** <br /> <br /> If you're a Bruce Cambell fan, you definitely want to have this movie in your collection. If you are generally interested in movies, you may want to. Just remember that the purpose of the film is to make you smile, annoy you (do not worry, but not too bad either), and make sure you have a good time with your friends. Attention, I said friends, future girlfriend is not possible.
