There are many well-known Hitchcock elements (past and later films), and this time they merge into a fun, but barely exciting conversation. It can be said that Dorothy Parker was involved in the script. The most memorable scenes are the dialogues of hero Cumming with the Blind and his encounter with a rather bizarre group of circus people. The famous highlight of the Statue of Liberty seems a bit cumbersome - measured by today's standards, but also compared to other Hitch monuments (eg Blackmail, North by Northwest).
