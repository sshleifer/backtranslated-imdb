"Classes tous risques" is one of the best "gangster" films France has ever produced. Perfect cast: Lino Ventura, a young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who made "a bout de souffle", Godard's Thing, in the same year). Marcel Dalio and an outstanding minor cast, brilliant screenplay by José Giovanni, who also wrote "le trou" Beckers masterpièce in the same year! What a year for him! Wonderful black and white camera by Ghislain Cloquet. And exciting action, first-class director Claude Sautet, who surpassed Jean-Pierre Melville. While the latter films gangster film with metaphysical claims that sometimes take more than two hours, Claude Sautet manages men of flesh and blood, and the presence of the two children adds extraordinary moments - a melancholy Melville has never been able to produce. And Sautet avoids pathos and exaggerated sentimentality: The last time Ventura drives his kids down the subway is a culmination of restrained emotions. Ventura. Ventura portrays a gangster who is casting the cube when the movie begins. He thinks he can count on his former acquaintances, but those are all cowards. We are a long way from a male friendship very dear to Jacques Becker ("touchez pas au grisbi") The Sixties, sometimes supported by evil women (the film Noir-Misogyny par excellence) who live in a lazy microcosm and willing to inform - we are a long way from Jean Seberg's simplistic behavior in Godard's Opus. <br /> <br /> Cloquet works wonders with the picture: The scene on the beach in a starless night, in which the two children see their mother die after the firefight with the customs officers, is absolutely stunning. <br /> <br /> There's a good voice output that Sautet only uses on demand, so the last few lines make the ending even stronger than if we had visited the scenes. Claude Sautet had found a good niche, and he followed the rules of "class tous risques" quite well with his successor "l'arm à gauche" (1965), in the Ven Tura again, taking advantage of a lonely island and a ship well. If he had continued in that direction, France would have had a Howard Hawks. In his subsequent work only "Max et les ferrailleurs" (1971) showed something of the brilliance he saw in the first half of the sixties. From "les choses de la vie" he became the director of the Cinema de qualité B. "Cesar et Rosalie" (1972) focused on affectionate-bourgeois citizens. , "Vincent François, Paul et les autres" (1974) or "Mado" (1976)
