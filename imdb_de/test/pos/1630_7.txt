I was in Rome last night at the premiere of the movie. I'm not an expert on the book, but there are many changes from the book to the movie. The tempo of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things have been cut, otherwise this would be a 4-hour movie. Many things have also been changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feeling of the film and it works well for Hanks, Brown and Company. <br /> <br /> There are some things in the book that would seem very implausible in the movie form. I do not give spoilers, except that the end of the movie is handled a bit differently. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who watch the movie might be interested in reading the book to learn all the details of the story. Some minor details were also cut from the film. <br /> <br /> Although they filmed in Rome, they had to shoot inside. As I took a tour of Rome the day before the film, I can say that the interiors are authentic. Kohler is not in the movie and CERN does not show much. Hanks is doing a good job and there are some interesting scenes concerning the Vatican Archives. Of course they did not have access to this area and I'm not sure anyone really knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has her break as Victoria Vetra in this film and does a good job as eye candy for Hanks. <br /> <br /> This movie should be better received by critics and the public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and when we saw him and the cast before the movie, this was just a movie.
