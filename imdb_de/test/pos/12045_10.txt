Watch this movie to see how Shahrukh Khan says, "I love you, K-k-Kiran ..." It's both heartbreaking and frightening when he says this from start to finish. This movie has made him famous, and I highly recommend it: D It's very entertaining, the music is evil and you'll laugh here with Shahrukh ... you'll be really scared of the hero and the heroine and feel Strange enough to identify at least one of the characters. At the same time you will feel sad and happy and relieved and anxious. Watch this classic Bollywood movie with your good buddies and good food and enjoy a day. After watching the movie, you have the songs and the scenery in your head ... forever.
