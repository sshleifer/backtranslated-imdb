The movie does not take itself seriously, and if you follow its example you will have a lot of fun (as long as you do not mind that your murders were really dammed up and your horror was crowned with extra cheese)! <br /> <br /> This movie winks at every horror fan and then shakes hands with them. It knows it's shit and that's why it's the best of the "Child's Play" series. <br /> <br /> It does the "stoopid humor" angle so well that you do more than just laugh, but MIT. And believe me, the whole time you laugh, atcha laughs back. <br /> <br />
