I'm a Mario fan as long as I can remember. I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a child. This game has brought many of these memories and added something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment of the amazing Mario franchise. This game is very different from all other Mario games, while the key elements of Mario are preserved. The first striking difference is that the story is in space. <br /> <br /> The story begins a lot Like any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a party in her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. Once in Peach's castle, Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.), who attacks the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and lifts her castle into space. In the middle of the castle Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talkie star named Luma and taken to the Luma home, a floating space station. Here Mario meets many other lumas as well as their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space station's power stars and scattered them throughout the universe. It's up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and rescue Peach. The adventure begins. <br /> <br /> The Way You play the game by flying from the space station to other galaxies. Each galaxy consists of several planets under which Mario is traveling across levels in order to retrieve the Power Stars. Mario can often go all the way around the planets without losing gravity. Some planets are small and others are big. Many planets are similar to the classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game is the controls. All things like jumping and the like are still the same, but the Wiimote is used in many ways in this game. They shake the remote. Mario executes a spin, which is used as the primary attack in the game. In addition, the shooting stars are activated. You can also point the remote at the screen and shoot asterisks at enemies or nearby objects. Then there is the graphics, this is by far the best graphics on the Wii, it's just hard to describe how great this game looks, you could almost say it looks as good as some 360 ​​games. <br /> <br /> My only little criticism is that the up-up effect takes some getting used to and the story is pretty weak. The worst thing is that you lose all your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had on the last shutdown, and restart at 4 lives. Apart from these minor issues, it's a great game that is very entertaining and very challenging. We've been waiting for the Wii for these kinds of games. <br /> <br /> A perfect 10 out of 10!
