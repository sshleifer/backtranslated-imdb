This is a wonderful new movie currently being shown in cinemas in my country. His director, the Calabrian Gianni Amelio, is in my opinion perhaps the only contemporary Italian director, along with Nanni Moretti, who deserves to be called great (that is, apart from the old masters who are still nearby and occasionally still produce films). It is one of my biggest regrets that contemporary Italian cinema has been down since the mid-1970s, mainly because of the very poor financing needs and the promotion of new talent that can be transferred to most areas, making Italy one of the most static industrialized countries in our continent Time production (both industrial and cultural) ... unlike China. And this is, among other things, the subject of Amelio's latest film. Few directors can talk to me about the true, present state of my country and the world as Amelio can, but his images are also of precious timelessness and universality. And for those who are worried that they might be slow, cumbersome, and worthy, rest assured, of those I've seen, the safest is not, at least not when you're used to, a high quality one To have European cinema The floor plan of the plot: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is a technician in an outdated steel mill somewhere in Italy, probably in the north. He is played by Sergio Castellitto, one of the most versatile and talented actors of the present day. When a large Chinese steel company acquires some of the industrial machinery of the Italian steelworks, Vincenzo, who tries to communicate with the non-Italian-speaking Chinese director, tries to tell him that the machine is broken and the converter needs to replace an element. He himself works on custom-building , He warns her that this could have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile, a young Chinese woman named Liu Hua acts as an interpreter between the two men, but seems to have difficulty finding adequate translations for some of Vincenzo's technical terms. The Italian finally loses his patience with her, practically pushing her aside and asking her to hand over the Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he can translate on his own. He finds the next morning despite Vincenzo's warnings The Chinese factory director and his staff have returned to their own country, ignoring his advice on how to properly use the industrial machine. So Vincenzo travels to China with his great integrity. And here begins an endlessly fascinating road movie through China, a state-of-the-art odyssey of the 21st century by the Asian Giant. A Quest for the Secrets of the Mysterious Nation by Marco Polo? Not quite. As in all of Amelio's films, the journey itself is much more important than the final "mission" or not. In fact, the way the point is literally brought home is not without a hint of humor, a lovely, poignant paradox and irony that made my eyes look good while smiling at the same time. The viewer is taken in by the secret that Vincenzo's journey was ultimately completely useless, but he himself does not know and goes home as a contented man, a deluded innocent. At least, you imagine, he is happy. Art. <br /> <br /> The journeys made by Amelio's figures are completely uprooted and reduced to the bare essentials. You do not currently have a name, status, or someone to give them a word. These Theo Angelopoulos-like themes are also explored in Lamerica, my favorite movie Amelio, followed closely by La stella che non c'è in personal preference. In the 1994 film Lamerica, two Italian thugs travel to Albania to "do business". Like Vincenzo, they want to go there, do what they need to do and then return home. Instead, one of these two Italians accidentally lands on an almost Homeric journey through this devastated land immediately after the fall of Communism. <br /> <br /> But back to La stella che non c'è: once Vincenzo In China, he predictably states that the seemingly "simple" task of handing over the converter to his new owner is far from easy , The new location of the machine is apparently hard to determine, unless he undertakes a tedious journey through China. When he encounters Liu Hua, the young interpreter he has now abused as a librarian, he tries to talk to her, but she reacts hostilely and informs him that she has lost her job as an interpreter because of him in Italy. Liu Hua, played by relative newcomer Ling Tai, soon becomes a Vergil of Vincenzo's Dante, reluctantly stating that she could do worse than serve the Italian on his journey as a leader and interpreter (obviously for a consistent sum Cash). While this young Chinese actress does not have the beauty of Ziyi Zhang or the glamor of the movie star of Gong Li, her charming, expressive, and handsome face exudes a combination of defiant strength, intelligence, dignity, and comic humor that make her features difficult forget once you've seen the movie. Besides, she and Castellitto have wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars. <br/> <br /> Amelio weaves dramatic dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realistic and humorous while having a heartwarming ability to explore the fleeting nature of humanity in everyday, everyday circumstances. A documentary naturalness conceals a meticulously conceived tapestry of faces and places, a view that also creates a cinematography of breathtaking beauty. The photography here is functional yet beautiful, as befits a movie about displaced people in an industrial and emotional wilderness. <br /> <br /> Amelio's attentive eye is an adult, disillusioned, but never cynical or misanthropic eye. The masterful camera perspectives also often convey a sense of Vincenzo's strangeness in the eyes of the Chinese and convey a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that is very rare in films about a "known" Westerner exploring an "unknown" non-Western country , I can not recommend this movie enough.
