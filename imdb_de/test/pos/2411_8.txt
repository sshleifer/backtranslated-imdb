OK, so that's a complete rip off of the first karate kid. However, I think there can never be too many movies like the first Karate Kid. There is something about this kind of story that is especially true for people like me. You get a general sense of overcoming adversity by finding new things about yourself. In this movie, Hillary Swank is a special gem as Next Karate Kid. You can really say that she has a bright future ahead of her. <br /> <br /> Not to say that this movie is not without problems. Contrary to the first, Mr. Miyagi seems a little excited to get Julie to learn martial arts and engage her in the fight. It almost seems as if he had forgotten what his values ​​from the first film were. In addition, one must have a floating unbelief in the study of the monks. Through the film, the monks seem to have a far too simple view of life and do not really explain why they do what they do in the plot. The bad guys are also a bit questionable, even if they are really evil guys. I also have a suspicion about martial arts films ending in the prom night. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's not a perfect movie. Maybe this is not the best movie you can borrow on a Friday night. However, it is a guilty pleasure in many ways. Hillary Swank is just so gracious, and the story works, even if it's not original. In a genre of films that seems to be about nothing but action and violence, this is a breath of fresh air. Unlike all these Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme, this is a movie about the mind and the heart. There are people who need movies like these and we take everything we can get. My rating: 8/10
