Hello, looking for a movie the family can see on a Friday night? Can not you find what you are looking for? I thought that would be an extremely enjoyable movie. Good for the whole family. I found that it was a remarkably rare combination of adults and children. It was brilliant, to say the least. Bruce Willis's acting was first-rate, there was a lot of humor and a great movie overall. In my opinion, it's a movie you have to see. And I do not think about many movies, believe me when I say it needs a movie to make me do it. It is clear that Bruce Willis and his cast have done a lot of work to complete this film. Excellent story, good acting and overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
