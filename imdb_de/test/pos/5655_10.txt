Any American who thinks he or she understands World War II should see this movie. Few Hollywood films about the war have defied the stereotype of Japanese soldiers as emotionless beasts that follow orders without thinking. We like to believe that every Japanese man was ready and able to fight until death on the day we bombed Nagasaki. "Fires on the Plain" shows another reality: troops are defeated, demoralized and starved to the point of cannibalism. They euphemistically refer to human flesh as "monkey meat". The film and the novel on which he is based have also killed the myth that all Japanese soldiers would prefer death: they had good reason to believe that their enemies did not want to take prisoners. For me, this raises a question that most Americans would rather avoid: if the Japanese military had been crushed at this time of the war, why was it necessary to destroy Hiroshima?
