I've only heard about ITV advertising for Driving Lessons, and to be honest, I did not know how much I liked it. I turned on the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest, simple movie that attracts you from the beginning. Rupert Grint plays the role of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly. He is definitely one to look out for in the future. Lady Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film for me was Evie's rather colorful poem. It shows how friendships can arise between the most unlikely couples. In my opinion, watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. The landscape was also remarkable, especially the landscape. Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy "unforgettable" does not agree
