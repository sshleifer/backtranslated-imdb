I originally watched this movie in a movie theater in Times Square in the late 1980s. Who would have thought that this movie produced two sequels and followed this cult. The Night of the Demons was like most other movies that came out at that time. A group of horny teenagers are caught in an isolated pub and then killed in various cruel ways at a time. Considering that the formula is still used and still seems to work, as evidenced by Saw II, I recently saw six years ago and she was so meek! I think that makes her a pretty good actress, if she could manage to play this demon-obsessed woman in all those horror film fights. The movie still lasts. A bit slow in the beginning, as I remembered when I saw him for the first time, but then he speeds up. One of the horror classics of the eighties and worth a look!
