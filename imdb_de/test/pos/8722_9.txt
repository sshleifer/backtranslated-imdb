What an absolutely adorable movie. The cast is wonderful and the story is funny and funny. An all around pleasant movie experience. Although the plot is reasonably predictable, it does not make the story any less enjoyable, in fact I did not want it to end. I've always been an Ingrid Bergman fan, and I was interested in seeing her in a weird role. She did not disappoint, Ingrid Bergman's performance as Ms. Dickinson is fun to watch. I loved her interaction with Toni in the music business as well as her dancing and "the Dentist". It has just further proven what I already knew, that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time. Goldie Hawn is also very pleasing to watch. Her fun, loving and lovable Toni is the driving force behind the film. You do not even ask why she was so worried about the wife of Finacee, you just accept that she's just that kind of person who would not be happy if she did not know everyone else was. And Walter Matthau is great as Julian. His actions never create a sense of hostility for the viewer, in fact they make him almost more enduring. There was no unlikely character in the group. This movie has definitely passed the test of time, I saw it last night and I think it's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. If you're looking for a fun, carefree, romantic comedy, you've come to the right place.
