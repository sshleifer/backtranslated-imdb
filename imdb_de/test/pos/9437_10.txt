Do you like explosions? How about fighting? Well, this movie has both. You know the other thing you could not have without a movie: a pedal bike, the guy who ricochets someone's head and throws it out at the same time. You bet the stabilizer has one. There is even a classic clip scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, I am quite proud that I even saw this movie ... and even more proud is that my review is the first one ... YES!
