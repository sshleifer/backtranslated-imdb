This is undoubtedly the best outcoach to Jackass ever made, heck, it even blows Jackass out of the water. <br /> <br /> Imagine the following: You have a group of people who just do not want to grow up, throw in a lot of money and some really cool stunts, and you have Viva La Bam. <br /> <br /> This show is such a family show and not just "the gang" running around and making complete idiots (as in Jackass) .For example: Bams parents, April and Phil, are in every episode with performances The reason why the Margera family makes us laugh is simple: someone in our family can tell something April: The woman who wants to live the life of the book and follow the tradition Phil : The guy trying to be a good dad, and finally Bam: That son who never came out of high school. <br /> <br /> The jokes and jokes in each episode will make you laugh, Surprising is how easy Margera gets over it, he said in interviews that he does not act for the majority of the episodes and acts instinctively. <br /> <br /> What I liked best about the whole thing , is the influence of Margera has over MTV. He wanted Slayer to play in his backyard, MTV did. He wanted to spend a day with Dani Filth and have a Cradle Of Filth concert in his garden that happened. <br /> <br /> Add his passion for the love metal band (and as an emo debate) to HIM and his brother's garage, CKY, and there's a lot of headache. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass, you'll fall in love with this one. Last year, I borrowed the first season from a friend and I would give up my legs to meet the Viva La Bam crew. You will not be disappointed, and I can promise you that you will have an end to everything!
