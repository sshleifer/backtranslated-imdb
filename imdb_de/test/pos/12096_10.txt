This movie is one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. I reluctantly went with a Turkish friend who recommended it. I'm not an avid proponent of music documentaries, but when Aynur Dogan, a Kurdish woman who has been banned for years from singing in Turkey, sings her song, the theater was thrilled. I would give anything to listen to a CD recording of this haunting, beautiful song. And she is just one of many interviewed and recorded artists who talk about her experiences in Istanbul. Even today, a month later, I remember the recordings of Aynur sang in an auditorium and I try to remember the music that echoed in the cinema. Well done to Faith Akin, the director of this film, and his great idea to capture the many great sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. It would certainly encourage me to visit Istanbul.
