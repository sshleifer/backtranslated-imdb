Spike Feresten is a funny genius. "Talkshow" demonstrates a new perspective on the kind of weird disrespect that made shows like Letterman and The Daily Show successful. His sympathy is palpable. He seems to find the unique angle of the joke, not the predictable sitcom path ... thank God. His comedy is reminiscent of the award-winning Arrested Development (tick 'talk show' has a longer life). The topics he emphasizes are usually the things that pass unnoticed by everyone else. But if he makes a joke around them, ask yourself how you missed it the first time. I liked the sketches very much ... "Unfair Target" becomes a cult classic in no time at all. Set your Tivos people ... this show must not be missed.
