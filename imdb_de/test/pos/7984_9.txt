Tim Burton is essentially an expressionist filmmaker who is not interested in the dimensions of the character and is obsessed by the Gothic. He relentlessly chooses style rather than substance throughout his career. Since his style is so passionately appealing, I, like many other moviegoers, forgive all the myriad shortcomings found in many of his films and immerse myself in one-hundred million dollar art films. <br /> <It's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally involved ghost in the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially if the target group of franchise children are halfway 15-year-old boys. Batman Returns should have been just as commercial as its predecessor, providing box office and cheap (in fact very expensive) thrills and entertaining without really involving the audience. If this had been the result, Tim Burton would certainly have had to instruct a third installment. Instead, Burton delivers something that can only really be defined by the phrase "out there." <br /> <br /> From the melancholy opening, where a high society couple weigh a jail containing their newborn deformed baby In a river, it's clear that Batman Returns is not a picnic at Buckingham Palace. Thirty-three years later, during a political speech held by Max Shreck (malicious actor of Christopher Walken), the Red Triangle Circus Gang attacks Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returns to the role) makes his first appearance with a new logo and finally saves the day. Shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and endorsed with the black mail to confirm the baby's political return, now a full-blown penguin man (Danny DeVito in a terribly perfect make-up) whose motives for returning only Batman are suspicious In the meantime, Shreck attempts to drive away his curious and clumsy assistant Selina Kyle (played perfectly by Michelle Pfeiffer, who seems to have earned more recognition for her performance), who turns into the deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman seeking revenge and haven from unexplainable Reasons is a deadly revenge against the Dark Knight. Batman Returns is grim. The production design is stunning, delivering a cold, haunting Gotham City with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. Danny Elfman's film music brilliantly supports the film, from invigorating to tragic. The tone and direction of the entire film itself is intensively brooding, like a sad nightmare, Burton's direction overshadows a diabolical screenplay with an almost irrelevant storyline, and is also perfect for Burton's visual film style. And while Burton's action sequences struggle for amusement, the real thrill lies in the directional decisions that show the demise of each of his protagonists, the downfall of the penguins, the mental state of Catwoman, and the lonely fate of Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> Warner brothers hated it, while the audience's criticism and reaction were mixed. After all, they wanted a Batman follower, not a weird, horrible horror movie in which a deformed psychopathic orphan tries to kidnap and drown a group of babies. He has to vomit constantly, which can only be described as a green slime. The production company wanted the McDonald's clan to be known for their happy meals, not for a movie with irresistible characters, including a sexually repressed secretary bumped out of a skyscraper and revived by a feline ghost unconscious by chewing at her bloody icy fingers. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand the mass disappointment after the release of Batman Returns. The movie never felt like a Batman blockbuster. It is debatable whether Burton really knew who Batman was, or even whether he was as interested in the character as he was in the film that matched his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted, lonely characters, the seldom oriented to social standards and expectations. That's why Burton failed to create a great Batman movie. He did, however; Create a nostalgic and stunning, spherical piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favorite of mine. <br /> <br /> This may not be a great Batman movie. But it's a great Tim Burton movie.
