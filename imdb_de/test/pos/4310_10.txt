A unique mix of musical, film noir and comedy - with a few sex scenes. The only other movie I can think of with a rather wild and crazy mix of themes and clichés is the French movie Billy Ze Kick - but that's a bit more unreal and whimsical. <br /> <br /> Not this movie would not be unreal or whimsical. The humor is sometimes subtle, at other times scratchy in your face - and often goes beyond the line of offense. To give an example: In post-coital chat with a prostitute, our hero Max Müller challenges them to stop those responsible for a recent murder with the words, "shoot!" To reveal. Literally, this sentence means "shoot!" in German, and that's what a hidden assassin does in response. In other words - this beautiful woman was sacrificed for a pun. Müller's office is also one of the rare examples of funny sex scenes. Larry's romance is accompanied by the song "I want more" - while the song perfectly underpins the action, the meaning of his words changes a few times, suggesting in the end that Larry can not offer any further services. The love scene of the film between Max Müller and Bettina Kant lacks such subtlety - which is breathtaking, especially when Bettina's vocals are slowly moaning, of course, all to the rhythm of the music, unless you are one of the slightly offended.
