What a great cast for this movie. The timing was excellent and there were so many clever lines - several times I still laughed minutes after they were delivered. I found Manna From Heaven to experience some surprising moments, and though there were things that I thought would happen, the way they came together was anything but predictable. This film is about hope and injustice. I left the theater feeling to do the right thing. Bravo to the five sisters.
