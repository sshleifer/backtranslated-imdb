It might be a remake of Capra's 1937 movie, but it's wrong to just look at it! It was supposed to expose Hilton's novel in a completely different way. There is a musical excellent. The scenery is great, the characters are good, and anyone like "Leonard Maltin," who thinks the Bacharach music is horrible, must be completely deaf! I highly recommend it.
