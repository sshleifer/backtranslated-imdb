I went to "The Closer She Gets" and knew this was the story of the mother of the filmmaker fighting cancer. I expected it to be a very shocking, depressing movie. And while the theme is certainly emotionally exciting, the notable feature of this film is the positive message it sends. It shows the entire commitment of a family to jointly master the challenge of cancer. They refuse to lose faith in each other even in the darkest moments. <br /> <br /> The most moving moments for me are the revelation of this belief. Small comments that mother and family make to each other, that reveal their (and their) will to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family cohesion. In this way it is an uplifting and deeply hopeful film. We should all be so happy that in times of serious illness we are surrounded by such a family.
