Probably the best movie for my money - or at least the purest movie film - director Ford ever shot. The dialogue is quick and to the point. The story begins at the very beginning and ends only with the credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs it and photographs it with a verve and momentum of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly played (hard to believe Johnsonj could not become a leading man afterwards), with the best photography and cut in a black and white American movie. Thanks a lot to the processing technique of Sergei Eisenstein, but never as cool, distanced or "scientific" as Eisenstein could often do. And a great score. A great panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in American history. <br /> <br /> One small point of criticism: It is not clear why the film involved the Mormons, who to the best of my knowledge were never the Quaker pacifists and Amish. This confusion leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie, however, is a celebration that is easy to ignore. In every other respect a true masterpiece of American cinema, which must be revived and considered again (and over again).
