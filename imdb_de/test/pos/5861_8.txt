"Murder by Numbers" plays with Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt two rebellious high school students who are satisfied with the perfect murder to overcome their broken self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays the heroic thorn in the spirit of her plans as Det. Cassie Mayweather. This is far from the traditional finger-pointing murder mystery, as the movie graciously reveals the killer (Gosling and Pitt). Instead, the film focuses on the purposes of their killings and whether they have what it takes to commit the perfect murder. <br /> <br /> The title itself has been rightly chosen for various reasons, especially as the "numbers" in the title are the loudest. The focus will focus on the reasons for the horrendous killings, but will persecute you with its deterrent dialogue (especially from the callous boys), but it does not live entirely from the origins of what led them to their deadly frenzy. The characters are intriguing, they have the handsome rich boy Richard (Ryan Gosling) and the smart but socially awkward Justin (Michael Pitt). At school, they pretend to despise one another and even have a liking for classmate Lisa (Agnes Bruckner), but outside of school they are allies and work together in a ritual where murder is an escape to the To free the mind. <br /> <br /> The story with the boys seems to be exciting, but in the background becomes a rather banal subplot with Det. Mayweather (Bullock), who assumes that his murders were due to discrimination (hence the arrogant looks of Gosling) and unexplained properties, but manages to get it right. At first, the audience may despise Cassie's character because she seems very obstinate and unhelpful. She shows dominance and control over her young partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Even as he tries to argue with her, he knows it's a battle he's unlikely to win. <br /> <br /> The reason for her behavior of the tyrant is that Cassie was the sad victim of a crime leaving a lasting mental scar on her. This side story does not have much room in this movie, in part because it does not offer anything to do with the main plot (the boys' murder rush). It also provides some development for Bullock's character in the movie, but it's just a half-hearted job and not very fulfilling. I would have liked it if the diabolical students had a side story. The resources were just in front of them for the perfect detective film, the creative plans the guys use to manipulate the police with their fake evidence, and lies just to get out of a possible life sentence despite the one-sided negotiations and the pointless ending "Real Killer" shows "Murder By Numbers" a strong performance by a great cast. Sandra Bullock convinced as a tough, dogged policewoman, trying to put her inner pain in a more positive light. Ben Chaplin shows his strength as a young detective who tries hard to understand her partner and is able to fend off her occasional tyranny. But the scene stealers are the devilish duo of Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling, while they keep you in their place and wait for what they'll do next. The boys' chemistry is reminiscent of Matt Damon-Jude Law in The Talented Mr. Ripley.
