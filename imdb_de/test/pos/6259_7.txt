Malcolm McDowell diagnoses Megan Gallagher's daughter and she has a form of illness when they believe that they see "The Huldre", troll-like creatures that live with "the rock and the roots" (to quote the film). <Br /> <br /> Basically, a family moves to an older house with a smaller dollhouse in the backyard. The daughter (played well by Sofia Vassiliova) begins to befriend the creatures until they become vindictive. The family cat disappears too. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes with Megan Gallagher ("Millennium") and Malcolm McDowell as psychiatrists. There is also something strange that has struck one of McDowell's patients. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of story, you may also like "Bad Ronald", who had a similar, weird theme, and the house is being pursued by bad Ronald (Scott Jacoby) is just the movie the 70s. 10.7.
