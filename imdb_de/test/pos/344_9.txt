I saw this movie at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is the first Indian movie I have seen in Tamil language, and although it has some similarities to other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director is trying to do more than just entertain , The film tells the story of Amudha, a precocious nine-year-old whose parents tell her she was adopted. This begins an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka. Beautiful visuals mix with horrible scenes of violence to say something expressive, even though it's a simple one. Amudha is by P.S. played. Keerthana, and she is one of the few child actresses I have seen that can be precocious and yet not annoying. Her charm and her beauty kept the movie together.
