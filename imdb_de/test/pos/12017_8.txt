This movie is a coveted member of my movie library. It's not a mainstream movie, but in my opinion a highly effective noir film that totally underestimates Eric Roberts as an actor. (I would call him a much better actor than his sister Julia, which is overrated, but that's another review ...) Roberts plays the out-of-control reporter with the perfect mix of narrative precision and jade idealism: two ingredients that are part of an effective film noir. Roberts' first-person narrative improves the quality of the film and lets us appreciate the actual motive behind the crime. <br /> <br /> In Palm Springs, everything related to the film's backdrop is slowly progressing. Understanding metaphor: Asch (Roberts) is suppressed by his past; The police are oppressed by the wealthy residents of Palm Springs, who treat them as servants. meanwhile, the rich are oppressed by boredom (see Johnny Depp's classic performance as a revealing child who just wants to be loved ...); The isolation of each character is omnipresent and enhanced by the heat and isolation of the desert. <br /> <br /> There is an audience for this movie when looking for a more modern version of Film Noir. Although there may be elements of the film that may have been more tight, I recommend keeping a copy of this movie and putting it in your movie library between The Big Sleep and Chinatown. (The film is based on the book by Arthur Lyons, CASTLES BURNING, and if you like Roberts' acting, you might want to get a copy of The Ambulance, in which he presents his funnier, lighter side.) FILM: "Careful, beware I should have asked, only fools ignore the strange warnings of the Trailer Park Ladies. "
