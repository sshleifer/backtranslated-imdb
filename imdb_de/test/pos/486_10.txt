I have only seen it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart that it is a damn time when they made a film about us as human beings and not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human lives as this story may have been a good will. And Eric is hotter than ever. In the films, First Nations people are often seen as different from ordinary people. We are always portrayed as boss or medicine people. Hey, we are just like everyone else. And this movie has shown exactly that. We hurt when injustice is committed and we can win in search of justice. It is a pity that the big film companies can not see that. I can not wait for it to come out on DVD. Thanks to everyone who has shown this story as it really was.
