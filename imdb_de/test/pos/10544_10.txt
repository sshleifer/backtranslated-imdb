At first glance, it seems to be the current love movie in which a girl meets a boy and falls in love, but the point is that this movie has the feeling that others do not have him I had to go. But as I walked along, I thought I must see it again, but until then I had no opportunity. One year passed until I saw this movie in a non-free channel and I saw it and I recorded it. I saw it once, twice ... until 200 times and no joke. I knew all the dialogues of Hart and I do not know why, but I saw it every day and never got bored. And I have to say that I'm not used to watching a movie more than twice. The deed is very good. Gardard Depardieu is also a talented actress and Katherine Heigl It's a movie I can not forget.
