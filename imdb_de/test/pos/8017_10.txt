Okay, I also love Aidan Quinn's acting with a bad script. This is not the case with The Assignment. As other viewers have said, this was a movie I came across via cable and was so busy that I did not want it to end. Take a Cuban American naval officer (Quinn) who is an upstanding, sincere soldier and family man. Add a crazy agent (Donald Sutherland) looking for the world's most notorious terrorist, and add a Ben Kingsley, and you have "The Assignment." Sutherland witnesses Carlos's most famous terrorist acts in a cafe on a fine day when he is so deeply shaken by the man's evil that his only reason to live is to get that man while he breathes. Take a soldier on a passport in Israel that is a dead bell to this man and is beaten and held by Kingsley until he realizes that they have a plan. By accepting Carlos because he is or forever responsible for never contributing to ridding the world of him, this is a very heavy order and guilt. By not helping his country, as a man and his military duty, he is required to make wise decisions. So the training starts. Let's say Carlos's education is high up with the Academy of Arts and Holocaust. When I say that these intense and wonderfully busy, script-based and executed film rates are the best, then I do not underestimate them. All three actors were able to save almost every script. All in all, this is a movie that can be seen from the first picture to the end credits. I'm not in terrorism or in movies about it, but I got addicted! Bravo once again to Aidan Quinn, who for once plays a heavy man who could withstand any actor, including Gary Oldman. That is a compliment. Rent it and get lots of popcorn. Oh, did I mention the sex? It works better as "Last Tango!" And his education.
