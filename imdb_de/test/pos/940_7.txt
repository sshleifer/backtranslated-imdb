I saw this movie by accident. It was shown on television very late one morning. I was awake and struggling to fall asleep, and this movie was released. <br /> <br /> This is an issue that has been discussed often elsewhere (it is definitely not as good as clarifying Rita, despite some extra twists) and has a very predictable ending. Despite the obvious flaws, I liked the movie very much, and this was more due to the acting of some of its players than the story or the play as a whole. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Sam Neil and have him seen in many different films, including: Dead Calm; The piano; sirens; Children of the revolution; Event horizon; Bicentennial man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park. He was very good, but he could have played that role with his eyes closed. <br /> <br /> Some of the acting were, in my opinion, the terrible Rose Byrne, for example, and some of the elusions were pretty hard (all) The board-mate in empty lives, for example, is all dressed in white. <br /> <br /> However, two actors (whom I have not seen or seen before) impressed me a lot, as did Sin√©ad Cusackn Frances Kennedy and especially Matthew Newton as her son David. Above all, he was very convincing and I would like to see more of him.
