The only and the only one! <br /> <br /> The only really good description of the punk movement in LA in the early 80's. Even the definitive documentary about legendary bands like Black Flag and X. Mainstream Americans' repugnant views on this movie are absolutely funny! How can music be SO varied in a land of supposed freedom ... even 20 years later ... find out! <br /> <br />
