Grown up in New Jersey and spent many days and nights in the streets of New York during the 1970s, the movie "The Seven-Ups" or its kindred spirit, "The French Connection", always attracts memories of a time and a place which for some could have been the darkest hour of NYC, but for me in my early twenties it was always a fun adventure after another. I really miss these times. One critic commented, "This film aptly captures the austere, cold, and business-like atmosphere of the winter season in NYC as it reveals the underworld of the area's infamous underworld of crime and policing - a great snapshot of a place and a time and culture "A punctual characterization of the film and the city. The outstanding features of this film - the storyline, the cast, the characters, and of course the chase - are described in detail in many of the reviews here, so I will not go into that except for one of My favorite moments during the chase, when the camera focuses on Richard Lynch's shotgun for the crazy Bill Hickman. The horror of Richard Lynch's face, along with the defensive gestures for an actor much more known for being the source of terror rather than the object of it, is so extraordinary that it's funny to watch him. I laugh every time a giggle out of it.
