This is a normal price of a director who has long been one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> Even though it's very shallow compared to many of his other works, but it's his Argento and this may be biased, but I'll do it Give him a good rating anyway. <br /> <br /> It contains many good ideas. The subtle voyeuristic element. The needles under the eyes. The bloody and disturbing death. And the Argento clich√© flashback. <br /> <br /> The smears include the heavy metal soundtrack, acting and the end. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is worthwhile for the birds in the theater sequence near Ende. <br /> <br /> A pretty good movie from Argento, but he did a better job. Much better!
