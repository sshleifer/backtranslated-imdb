As you can see, I loved the book so much that I've been using the title for my Internet alias for more than 15 years. (Okay, so it had to be written phonetically to meet the BBS's name limit, but what could I do?) If everyone finds this movie, I'd absolutely see it! Janet McTeer is great in everything I've seen from her. I think she made a great Prue. And there are even early Clive Owen - from before Chancer (a great series herself). What is not to love? I hope the forces that are wise will soon be available on DVD! With some of the real dredges they pout, it's time to bring well-executed productions to market.
