"Bon Voyage" has the high tempo that somehow reminds me of the films of Indiana Jones / Star Wars - it's like being in an express train or a roller coaster ride of romance, mystery, thriller and farce; All this and more, including open observations on the reactions of French society during the Nazi invasion at the beginning of the Second World War. And it is also an exhibition of juggling involving 7 main characters. The scenes all seemed to be historically correct (to my eyes) and gave an excellent feeling for the time. All the actors were well-staffed and performed well, but IMO was the best of Isabelle Adjani played the role of an opportunistic, selfish French movie star; Not only did she convincingly play the role of a young actress, perhaps half her age, but she also played her in love convincingly, but in such a way that the audience sees her as half serious and more complex than a gold digger. Her character and her energy drive the film through from beginning to end. It was not until I read the review by Roger Ebert that I discovered she was 48 at the time of the movie. What a beauty !! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the end - it's satisfying, but lets you write your own conclusion about what's going on with the main characters. <br /> <br /> As another user comment has stated - DO NOT arrive too late; You must be in the opening scene. Good advice. <br /> <br /> I gave it 9 out of 10.
