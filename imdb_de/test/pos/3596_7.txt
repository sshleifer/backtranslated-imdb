I did not read the book. I am not interested either. The movie was a beautiful romance, and I think women will enjoy it. No, it was not a "10" movie, but it was fun. Women, if your husband is bored like mine, then watch for yourself. hurt is wonderful as a philosophical doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue about "in love" and "loving". <br /> <br /> Even if you like Nick Cage, he was terrific and funny. I enjoyed watching the evolving romance. <br /> <br /> Even if you like Christian Ballen - see him in balance. This is a "10" science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> watch this movie. Ignore the comments of the previous user. <br /> <br /> One - especially the ladies !! Also visit my website under my name as a word and a "dot" com.
