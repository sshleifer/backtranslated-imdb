If not, this film explores a whole new genre of perfect imperfection - serenity, truth, fun, talent and circumstances that make MAGIC. <br /> <br /> From creative musical numbers to the cuff comedies in which actors are at their best. If I had not known better, I would have thought that there was a full script here What you get: A powerful wind meets conversations with God meets something so new, new and adorable that it becomes its own entity. The rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts ....... only small actors, and all parties should be knocked on their backs, taken to dinner and considered for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> well done!
