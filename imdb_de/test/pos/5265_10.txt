As an experienced screenwriting teacher at Richland College, Dallas, and a former MGM scriptwriter in the days of decent movies, I'm glad I accidentally clicked on Channel 33 in Dallas tonight and saw this enchanting movie in which Betty White is and is GORGEOUS A longing for the good days of really good movies before Hollywood started to talk all that garbage out to the youngsters. If a producer listens, I'd like to say that there are enough of us over 60 who happily pay a dollar to watch a movie that has no weapons, no killing, no special effects, no sex, no violence, and only one good movie touching story of human relationships that leaves a good warm feeling like this movie did for me.
