I am 13 years old and write this review in my mother's application. She will write her own review later. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie. He was shot in England in 1944. I often saw him when I was little, that I was wearing the videotape. I love this movie and it changed my life! The beautiful landscapes. The mighty, groovy thoroughbred horse. The simple little Irish village with the young girl, who wanted to do what no other girl has ever done, competes with the most beloved horse, The Pirate, in The Grand National Steeplechase. All this made me ride horses (which I have been doing for 7 years now) and learn everything about their breeds so I could draw and paint them as well. It is a groundbreaking film in which you win against adversity, overcome your fears, believe in yourself, and achieve difficult goals by working hard. Also, the horse racing scene was one of the best ever made, and I've watched a lot of horse racing movies. I never get tired of watching this movie. Everything is perfect. Especially if you are a young girl and are passionate about horses!
