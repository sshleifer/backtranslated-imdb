I was pretty shocked by the bad rating this film got here. This is a young teenager, Sandy Ricks, who is sent by his mother to Coral Key to spend the summer with his uncle Porter. There he makes friends with a dolphin called Flipper. There are many adventures amidst the predictable relationship between nephews and uncles, as well as a little romance for Sandy with a girl from around crispy and weird Uncle Porter. For starters, he keeps an endless supply of spaghetti-o in his house to serve as his usual meal, heated with a blowtorch! Elija Wood, Frodo of The Lord of the Rings, seemed playful enough to play the young Sandy, a boy who did not necessarily love his summer vacation. <br /> <br /> Of course, the dolphin is great and it gives it some wonderful underwater scenes. Filmed in the Florida Keys, it was apparently shot in the Bahamas. This adaptation of Flipper makes for great family entertainment, a sweet, sentimental and funny movie that is infinitely superior to many of today's movie theater offerings.
