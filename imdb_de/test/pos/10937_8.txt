This splicing by THE SEARCHERS is one of the craziest films I've ever seen, filmed by a British guy in a foreign, unfamiliar Mexico. It is often said that the best films about America are made by foreigners who can turn to the familiar with the gaze of an outsider. But this crackpot movie is something else. Although it seems to be settled in America after the Civil War, this is not America recognizable from myths, movies, television, etc. The film has an atmosphere of timeless fable that deals specifically with Western mythology. <br /> <br /> Director Harvey uses the title horse as the focal point for connecting stories that all deal with the traditional Western clash of primitive and civilization. The former seems to have the upper hand. The vast scrub and desert of the film landscape are unbroken and ripe for allegories of the mind. The only short places of civilization are a stagecoach of missionaries and landowners and their hacienda, both of which derive behaviors that are anything but civilized. The basic story includes three stories. In one, an aimless deserter, Pike, steals his trading partner, a miraculous horse, Eagle's Wing, so called because of his grace and speed. In the second, an Indian, White Bull, owner of this horse, Waylay's a stagecoach, and abducts one of her female inmates. In the third case, the Spaniards sent word that they would ignore this search for a murderous, pillaging spree. <br /> <br /> Although a revisionist western, the treatment of the Indian is problematic. Unlike Pike, his character is never explained, forever inscrutable, a voice denied, except for a torturous song part. If he is not a strange other, he is a symbol whose role is not fully understood-one wild beast at one point, and another that embodies nature and freedom. <br /> <br /> But Pike notes at the beginning The film will accompany the time of primitivism before civilization. In many ways, the film is similar to 2001 - A SPACE ODYSSEY, especially the opening sequence. Part of the strength of the film lies in the connections between the three different characters that force us to see the mythical battles and quests in a different light. Indian culture and Catholicism are connected by superstition, ritual, greed and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic. White Bull is demonized by both Pike and the abductee as a "bastard" and unknowingly demonstrates the tactic of illegitimacy used by the colonization of whites who have infantilized the natives and become "necessary" fathers themselves. This film deals with History, civilization and progress. He is a double detective story that interrogates the past, leaving its mark. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this film is, despite Maltin's remarkable uniqueness, racism, his insolence. The climax of the climate is more of an Artus competition. The film itself largely avoids the dialogue with courage, creating a kind of visual and aural tapestry that Malick missed in THE THIN RED LINE, and something that few Hollywood directors would have dared to do. The existential duplication and quest motifs are more of a European myth than the American one (similar to another British Harvey Keitel movie, THE DUELLISTS). <br /> <br /> Most amazing is the use of nature. Most westerns use scenery as an impressive backdrop: there is little point in living in the west. In many ways, EAGLE'S WING is like a movie by Powell and Pressberger, with nature a powerful, pantheistic character - alive, dangerous, hostile, beautiful. There is a sublime scene reminiscent of A CANTERBURY TALE as the jewelry trapped in the trees by White Bull is suddenly blown into the wind: there is a haunting, tingling, magical, exciting effect more like the Arabian Nights as an opera reminiscent of a horse. Stopping heart.
