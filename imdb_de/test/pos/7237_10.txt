Yes!! They have finally perfected it. What a great idea, a refreshing exploitation epic for Generation-X, whether you know it or not. After disasters like Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD and Lloyd Kaufman, who was screwed up by our hero's blockbuster, just decided to stop dealing with the distributors and let Troma be as much Troma as he could possibly be , Lloyd would make this film the most uncompromising, eccentric and downright hilarious Troma movie. This time around, Lloyd captures Shakespeare's love story, turns it over, trumps it, and adds the long, lost entertainment value that was always lacking. Entertainment value such as Lemmy Kilmister (the narrator), Debbie Rochon (the cook), Joe Fleishaker (the fat guy) and, of course, brutal mutilations and toilet humor. Tromeo And Juliet is the final release of a rather lackluster story and the crown jewel of the Troma Universe. Years ago, in Tromaville, the business partners of New Jersey, Monty Que and Cap Capulet, start a film company Silky Films, which would produce supposedly tasteful, soft core films. Monty sees Cap as his friend, but Cap wants to kick the poor fool out of his stake in the company. On paper and in books, it seems Monty has given away his life's work for free. Fast forward to Manhattan in the mid-90s, we have two families extremely dissatisfied with each other. It is so far that they are only looking for a reason to take a limb or preferably a life. Monty has a son, Tromeo, nephew, Benny, she and her boyfriend Murray Martini, who is just a little too excited, are at war with the incestuous Capulets, except Monty, he's too drunk to care. As in the original, there is a confusing situation that causes Tromeo to fall in love with Cap's daughter, whom he has never met or never knew about. Sadly, Cap is a sadistic pervert who, unlike Tromeo's dad, has something for the bottle, and that would of course mean that Papa's little Chenshaw melon is physically and emotionally abused and molested and kept in a plexiglass cage every now and then depending on how bad mood is. Cap also forces his vegetarian daughter London Arbuckle, a billionaire, a butcher, who makes everyone, with or without raisin bread, discomfort. With all these inconveniences, the young lovers believe that Eloping is the best decision, but how does this affect the big feud? It may or may not be a bit like the original, but figuring out how it ends up just will not happen, you'll never see it coming. <br /> <br /> "The one with Leo" is downright sleep-inducing compared to Tromeo & Juliet, but when the watered-down, over-capitalized Hollywood budget is, garbage is exactly what you're programmed to do. Then you should definitely do it, but if you're in the mood for something more colorful, something that really does strike and does not follow the "normal" movie pattern, and if you have a rather unusual sense of humor, then you may not like this movie to hate. Tromeo and Juliet shake the mainstream. Full exploitation with as much common sense of humor as anything younger John Waters did. In addition to some bad performances, Tromeo And Juliet plays a thunderous score that includes the legendary Motorhead, not to mention the many submissions from James Gunn who really brought this album together. Further information about James Gunn can be found in Lollilove. If you want to know more about Lloyd Kaufman, read his next vision, Terror Firmer. Tromeo And Juliet is a breathtakingly priceless exploitation for the 90s that has brought us the only and only king of B-movies. Thanks, Lloyd. 10/10
