Fred was such a great show. It was simple, but somehow very addictive. I can still remember the days I saw this on Kids WB Saturday, but then Kids WB did the unforgivable "hip" and "funky fresh". * shudder * They became like relatives who all want to look cool, but the attempt is a dairy. They brought home Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad and all the other good shows from the most pointless shows I've ever seen in my life (Johnny Test). The only thing that makes me watch KWB are the occasional pieces of old shows and the anime on 4kids show you the schedule. This brings me back to my first point ... BRING IT BACK !!!
