Unfortunately, this film is, so it seems, referred to the "curious" status. Many people I asked "Did you know that the Monkees made a movie?" Usually answer 'no'. That being said, if you belong to that large number, I recommend that you see it, but with the following restriction: If you expect the monkey style, it's in there. It just is not the same everywhere as in the TV programs. <br /> <br /> Yes, they try to break their TV form a bit by making fun of it, like a bunch of non-teenagers who were here the short end of many sticks. <br /> <br /> No, you do not have to be drunk to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> No, you do not have to be drunk. Understand it. <br /> <br /> If you like classics, you'll love the interspersed clips everywhere. <br /> <br /> If you like the psychedelic era, you will love some of the cameos. <br /> If you're a fan of Monkees, you may recognize some of the jabs they are making in the hard commercialization of the band. <br /> <br /> In the almost immortal words of one of my best friends, after watching 5 minutes of it, "This is a funny movie, man." In fact, it might be better if you do not try to understand it, just sit back and respond. It's weird, it's weird, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (yet) ... there are many things. Overall it is an experience.
