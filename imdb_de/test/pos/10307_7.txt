The theme of the film is poignant and very real. It happened. One can discuss some artistic freedoms that the director and screenwriter take away. The theme is what makes the film tick - nothing else. I saw the movie for the first time after the real Phoolan was gunned down in New Delhi and served for several years as an elected MP in India. Incidentally, she was not the first untouchable to be elected to parliament, as some critics said. The so-called "untouchables" have been elected for decades in restrained constituencies in the Indian parliament. <br /> <br /> While Shekhar Kapur is a hero for many of India's directors for making commercially accepted international films-- "Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and an endearing children's movie titled "Mister India "who was accepted by the average Indian audience) - and even received Oscar nominations for Elizabeth, I do not consider him a top notch director from India. In each department, he fails as a director, unless he manages to get above-average performances from his actors. Subtlety, finesse and charm are not easy to find in his films - the melodrama is expressed in them. His idea of ​​using Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's vocal playback of the song in the early parts of the film was perhaps his only major achievement on the undistinguistic soundtrack of "Bandit Queen." And then maybe the creaking doors during the gang rape sequence. Otherwise, the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence, apart from the great music that connects them. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good-looking Indian movie director who creates a quality, world-class cinema, you should not see Shekhar Kapur's films. It is the later work of the three Indian filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen and Girish Karnad and of course Muzaffar Ali's "Umrao Jaan". It is unfortunate that none of these directors had the financial support that Kapur had to make available to them and their films internationally. For example, Sens "Oka oorie katha" from Telugu or Satyajit Ray's "Sadgati", based on Munshi Prem Chand's "Kafan", are more comprehensive than films for an intelligent onlooker dealing with the state of the untouchables in India. Sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence, but merely suggested it. Of course, Sen's nugget made no headlines, while Kapur's efforts shocked her. To Kapurs merit he is articulated and took advantage of his limited talent and his modest resources in the Mumbai film industry to take his products home with the audience. For this effort, I greet Kapur. But "Bandit Queen" will remain a great topic waiting for an experienced director to deal with.
