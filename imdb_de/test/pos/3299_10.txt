"Boy Next Door" is a hilarious play by male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the movie takes us on a journey that most full-length features can not even reach. Great performance, great camera work and editing - this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis, who has taken on two responsibilities both as a director and as a star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a pleasure to see Richard Moll again. If you thought he could only play "Bull" on "Night Court", think again. This gem of a movie features the incredibly funny writing by Stephen Garvey. Remember that name. Forget Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garvey is the real king of whimsical comedy.
