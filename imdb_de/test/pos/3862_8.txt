This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella or Bambi, but it's a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well made Disney animation feature. <br /> <br /> Of course there are lessons included for the kids and some kiddie cheeks, but there are plenty of them for the adults too. <br /> <br /> While this is a bit of a regurgitation to the Classic Disney RomCom adventure, there are some elements that only belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the "tramp" and Dutchess is the "lady", but Dutchess has several kittens and they all try to come home. Phil Harris is our cat O'Malley. You can recognize his voice because he has also given the voice of Baloo, the bear in the jungle book, and Little John in Disney's Robin Hood. Eva Gabor gives Dutchess her silky-sweet voice. <br /> <br /> Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who directed or worked on every Disney animated film until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite Disney animated films and is part of every Disney collection. The 2-Disk Special Edition will be released this summer (2007). <br /> <br /> This is the 8.4 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
