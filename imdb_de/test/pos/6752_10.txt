The mascot is Ladislaw Starewicz's masterpiece. It tells the story of a stuffed toy dog ​​looking for an orange after it happens to hear that the mother tells her daughter she has no money. The dog is picked and sold with other toys. After jumping off the others while the vehicle is driving, the dog stays in the truck, waiting to be picked up by the store before leaving alone. He manages to turn orange after biting Ms. Bein as she holds and sells the fruit. As he runs, he meets the devil and accepts his offer to stay at the nightclub. There he meets the other toys that have jumped from the truck. The cat, who was next to him in the vehicle, is especially determined to get the dog's orange. I just stop to mention that in the nightclub, other wonderfully bizarre things happen that you have to see for yourself. Suffice to say, if you love Starewicz and are interested in all the animations of the past, I definitely recommend you to watch them!
