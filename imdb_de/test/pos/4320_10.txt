* Can contain spoiler, can only be read after the last episode season 2 was seen. * Think about it. The boys at the North Pole? Center of the Earth? Are you looking for unusual magnetic behavior? They also said something like, "Did we miss it again?" So there was another abnormality? That was natural when the plane crashed! I think the whole island is a setup. Posted by her father. She has experienced it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for? <br /> <br /> So basically it's an island in a magnetic shield. Everything is wrong. All signs are there. Bad beards, wrong doors, wrong medicine, wrong observation stations, with false air ducts leading to nothing. It's indeed a project and because of the closing scene in the season two finale, I know it has something to do with Desmond, his chick and dad (and probably Libby, she's weird, maybe she actually has something with him) OK, now I'm drifting off. <br /> <br /> Also in this episode, Henry Gail tells Michael to go to some coordinates and he'll rescue her, which is probably a kind of door in the magnetic shielding. "Once you're gone, there's no way back." <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty obvious, despite the numerous issues I still have, and hope answers for next season If you think back to what we learned in season 1 and 2, we'll certainly get answers in season three. <br /> <br /> I can not wait. <br /> <br /> May Anyone agree on this theory? Hope to hear from you ...
