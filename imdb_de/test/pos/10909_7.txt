I remember seeing that a long time ago, and I knew most of the concept, but no detail. That's why I'm glad that I saw it again from director Frank Oz (The Muppets Take Manhattan, Bowfinger). New star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) has just won the Oscar for his latest title, playing a gay soldier, and he does the usual thank you. He even mentions his former teacher, Englishman Howard Brackett (Golden Globe nominated) Kevin Kline) and he turns him out as gay! Howard is determined to clarify his name and come out of the media limelight as a denying gay man, especially as his marriage to Emily Montgomery (Oscar and Golden Globe, which Joan Cusack was nominated for) is under way. So, it's the wedding day, and when Howard says yes or no, he's superior to himself and admits himself and everyone that he's gay. Of course he is fired as a teacher, but on graduation day everyone stands by (in support), and Cameron even shows up to clarify things so everyone, especially headmaster Tom Halliwell, knows. It's in Okay to be gay. With Tom Selleck as Peter Malloy, Debbie Reynolds as Berniece Brackett, Wilford Brimley as Frank Brackett, Gregory Jbara as Walter Brackett, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg and Jay Leno. The highlight of the film must be when Kline can dance to Diana Rose's version of "I Will Survive". That must have convinced him of his sexuality. Kline is always good, Cusack is a surprising Oscar nominee, and all supportive cast members play in this very funny comedy. Very well!
