Great company Vs. Conscientious Do good. We seem to experience events (both real life and role life) of this kind all the time, and greed usually wins by using all (dirty) means and suppressing the truth. At least in this movie, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) has earned his points and paid dearly for them. We've seen several films of this kind in recent years, the most memorable of which was The Insider, in which Russell Crowe played a tobacco industry scientist trying to whistle his pipe, claiming the industry was adding more cigarettes Add nicotine to addicted smokers. There was also this reporter-protagonist corner, where the reporter is looking for the dream of his dreams and the protagonist faces this moral dilemma, where he has to choose between justice and his livelihood and sometimes his life Jane Fonda played the reporter Kimberly Wells to perfection. She plays a reporter who wants to follow serious news while her bosses value her more as 'eye-candy'. She and her crew (the cameraman, played by Michael Douglas, who is also the producer of the movie), experience an accident during a visit to a nuclear power plant. The cinematographer Michael Douglas gets inconspicuously / illegally film footage of this event on tape, although he is not a photography zone, and smuggles it out of the station. The station refuses to air it and informs the company that owns the nuclear station. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, chief engineer Jack Godell begins his own investigation and discovers irregularities in the equipment of the reactor. This starts with the whole dirty politics of corruption and greed. <br /> <br /> This is a good thriller and it managed to create a lot of suspense in the audience right up to the end, and the funny thing was that there was no background music to suggest all the scary moments. This is great and unusual in movies. The performances were all good and I love Jack Lemmon. We know him mainly for his comedic roles, but he is equally good in dramatic roles. I give this movie an 8/10.
