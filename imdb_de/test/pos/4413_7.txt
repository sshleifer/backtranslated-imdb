Grab, crackle, pop! The shattering sound of any change in the camera angle. The white flashes and the cut off ends of almost all spoken sentences are not to be mentioned. What in the world did they have in the editorial room? Or could it be that this approach was intended? Certainly not. What purpose could it serve? Despite all the technical flaws, this is an interesting movie showing a day in the life of Joe, a hustler, who is determined to make $ 200 for his wife's pregnant girlfriend. Joe Dallesandro is great as a carefree, passive, laid-back young man who is willing to let the other person mainly talk while listening with a distant look in his eyes. The story is sketchy and sketchy, documenting the insecure life of a man who relies on occasional road traffic to feed his young wife and baby. One thing is certain: Joe is unrestrained when it comes to being interested in sex or posing for an artist. Understandably so, because he has a pretty face and an equally beautiful body. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the film that is remarkably effective. There is no sound, no dialogue. Joe kicks naked on the floor and feeds his little baby with cake crumbs. In these quiet moments there is a beautiful serenity and tenderness. <br /> <br /> Another scene of amusing interest is the one in which Joe desperately seeks a $ 100 loan from a friend in the gym who asks for the question. A very cumbersome approach. <br /> <br /> Joe tries to look interested, but hesitates to talk when an artist gives him an uninterrupted summary of Greek and Roman art. It's a temporary opportunity for another occasion when Joe takes off his clothes and presents himself as a discus thrower in the classic style. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie we have the impression that we have met Joe pretty well. After all, he has revealed more than his soul.
