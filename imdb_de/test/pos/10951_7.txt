A vampire prince falls in love with a human girl, unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter. This is the underlying theme of this martial arts trumpet, which incorporates ideas from "Underworld" and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer," but manages to maintain its own style. The title "The Twins Effect" from the UK and Hong Kong amused me because there are no twins in the story. It turns out that the two main female characters are played by Hong Kong pop stars who act as "The Twins". Do not let that dissuade you. These girls can (at least good enough for this type of film) act and give the process a lot of charm. Jackie Chan appears for a couple of cameo performances and adds a touch of slapstick chaos. All in all, this is great fun for those who like to lure their vampires with a touch of humor.
