That was an excellent back when it came out. It had some of the best talent and a funny story. Between Candace Cameron and Tatyana Ali, it was hard to decide who was prettier and to add Carlton from Fresh Prince and all the other big names. Okay, one made for TV blockbusters, but still. If you can find this train, do not miss it. <br /> <br />
