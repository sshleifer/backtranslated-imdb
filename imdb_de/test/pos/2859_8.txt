Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, The Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors, to this fun and original thriller / comedy / road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her poor husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre form of amnesia and escapes into his car, unaware that there are a lot of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit people who follow her. <br /> <br /> What Betty is hunting for, apart from a fresh start (though she can not remember the old life), is her lover, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). The only problem: David is not real, he's a soap opera character in the series "A Reason To Love" and he's really a selfish actor named George McCord. <br /> <br /> To say something else that would have been too much, but sister Betty is certainly original. His batsmen, like the hired killers of Pulp Fiction, are violent yet philosophical, they record soap operas with terrific parody material, and their acting is the best feature of all. This was one of the best cast films of recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Sister Betty, with the constant glow in her eyes that drives her on her quest. At the end of his career, Morgan Freeman brings his constant mercy to the role of a murderer, and Chris Rock is his partner, a man of anger and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is best as a vain actor / soap opera doctor. There are also great supporting performances from actors like Emmy winner Allison Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasiers agent Bebe Glazer) and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER). In fact, the supporting actor is a who's who of the best performers of television. <br /> <br /> A unique movie that is funny for a moment and frustrating the next moment. Nurse Betty is a mix of great acting, casting and a great script.
