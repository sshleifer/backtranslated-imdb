Krajobraz po bitwie, like many of Wajda's films, may not be understandable to the rest of the world. The story is based on the few narratives of Tadeusz Borowski, who was the prisoner in the camps Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen during the Second World War. Borowski describes in his books an inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the point of view foreman Tadek - porte parole of the writer, who also occupies a privileged position among the prisoners. Borowski was merciless to humanity and merciless to himself. He describes human history as an endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. Ironically, on his return to Poland, he stopped writing artistic prose, became a Communist propagandist, and produced a stream of anti-imperialist and anti-American press releases. After a few years, he committed suicide. In the film, Wajda changes perspective. Foreman Tadek - character of Tadeusz Janczar - plays only a minor role. The story focuses on the poet who was destroyed by the war and captivity and his one-day love affair with Nina, a Jewish girl who fled communist Poland, though she actually hates Jewish life and mentality. As background we can observe a sad grotesque of the so-called "dipis" (expelled) life that is settled in SS barracks after liberation by the Americans. Marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and / or prostitutes of German girls. <br /> <br />
