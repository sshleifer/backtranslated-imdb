I can not imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than Quentin Tarantino's. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the man who exploded in the scene at the beginning of the 90's with cult classics like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since then he has been a disappointment to some. Well, I'm relieved to say Tarantino has not lost touch. He's doing us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so. <br /> <br /> We know the story, a World War II story that only Tarantino can tell. (Fictitious of course) A war movie has not been made that way yet. Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi-occupied France. Your goal - to kill Nazis. A similar role is played by Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa on the other side. He is known as a "Jew hunter" and is as ruthless as anyone else. The third sub-story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who is witnessing the slaughter of her family. And of course she wants to take revenge for her devastating losses to the Germans. Here are three stories that connect and connect with each other. If you know something about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new to him. War has never been so funny. The Basterds are haunting, but at the same time very funny, sometimes even funny. The dark comedy aspect plays as in many other Tarantino films a major role. The entertainment and fun are led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I could not wait to see him back on the screen. Despite his crazy accent, he works in this kind of movie. MÃ©lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz were also very impressive. The movie was filled with remarkable performances. <br /> <br /> History itself has so many historical inaccuracies that you have to count, but then what? It is not intended as a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun, just like us. The film department earns big props with beautiful, vibrant colors that highlight the movie. You really have to love the last line of the movie ... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino is, among other things, an entertainer. World War II is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino somehow manages to enjoy it. Inglourious Basterds is a funny movie. He is incredibly entertaining, shocking, dramatic, exciting and funny at the same time. Jam is packed with everything you're looking for in a movie, with a certain Tarantino style, and it's worth taking a look. It's time for yourself to see what war is like with Quentin Tarantino.
