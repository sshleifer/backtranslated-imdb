Here's what you need to remember about this movie ... ITS A KIDS MOVIE !!!!! I do not know what the rest of you are, but I am a child of the 80s. I was obsessed with Rainbow Brite. Of course I love this movie. But if you look at the other Rainbow Brite movies, this is by far the best. But as I said, it is a children's movie. You have to judge it as a children's film. For kids, it does not matter if acting, animation or script is fantastic or even good. All she cares about is what happens to the characters. If the good (or girl) wins, it's a great movie. If not, then it is bad. You all know what I mean. They were all children once.
