I like this movie above all others. It is "multilayered"; There is so much to see and appreciate. Each consideration brings with it a new appreciation of the action, the plot, and the characters. Flawless and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to see and appreciate it. I love the interaction between the players. the subtle relationships; the period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as a brooding lover, and Geoffrey, the unfortunate husband, is wonderfully underplayed by Colin Firth. The scene in Sandstorm, where Catherine and El-Masy discuss the various types of sandstorms, is one of the highlights of the movie and the story begins. The other relationship between Hanna and El-masy is another "layer" of the film that is absolutely adorable (and heartbreaking). A worthy winner of many awards.
