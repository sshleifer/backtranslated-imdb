Watching this movie It's really a good trip through the trouble of making an indie movie, and what happens when it pops the face of the filmmaker. There are a lot of things about punk rock and the philosophy behind this movement and their relationship to this project. So if you're into old punk, American punk, you're going to dig it out ... but beware, there's a ton of badly working bits from the failed project being built in ... but they sometimes look weird. and indeed, some of the best parts are listening to people who have never worked on the pontificate of films, and what they've been through in the three years it took to bring this together. Anyone who is currently shooting a movie, especially if you have not attended a film school or worked in the field, should see this and learn from the filmmaker's mistakes.
