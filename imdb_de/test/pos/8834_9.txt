Obviously, the answers were written here many years after the release of the film and can not be related. This film was bloody funny in 1980 in the English reworking life. We were glad to laugh at something, and Rising Damp, with his sympathetic mockery of a complete social class, was one of the best British sitcoms of his time, if not at all. In almost all human beings it hit a chord, and in the true British way we laughed at the Rigsby in ourselves. America had nothing to touch that kind of humor because self-aggravation was not amusing to our foreign cousins. Leonard Rossiter was one of the best actors in England, on stage, on television and in films. His dedication and professionalism were second to none. Richard Beckinsale, though young, was a perfect comic strip for Rossiter and should be considered great at all times. Had he not been taken so young, I would be sure that he would now be ranked as one of Britain's greatest comedy actors. Frances De la Tour found her best television moment in Rising Damp and never quantified her undoubted ability for me with other roles. If you did not see the movie at the time of publication, you can not comment on it just because you can not understand why it was funny, the humor of the moment.
