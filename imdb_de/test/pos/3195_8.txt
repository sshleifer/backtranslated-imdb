I remembered seeing this program as a little boy in Australia in the 60s, and I enjoyed it as a 50-year-old father of young kids again. Although the bad guys are mostly flat characters and there is a component of violence, I am very happy that my 6-8 year old kids are watching because the central characters are deep, friendly and honorable. The violence is not bloody, no one prides itself in it, and the program is beautiful to look at. It does not promote nightmares, but reveals much of the culture that must have primarily influenced the design of the Jedi Knights in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVDs leaves something to be desired. Video perfectionists will not like this. It's very reminiscent of something held on 16mm film and projected onto the wall in a basement ... which may be the case. The soundtrack also lacks the quality we expect from home theater. However, my children only noticed that it was not in color and I suspect they only noticed because we had recently talked about how old things often are. The beauty of Mt. Fuji even shows in black and white. Something about the scenery from the 17th century makes the quality part of the atmosphere, as if you look through a window into the past. <br /> <br /> Overall, this program is better than most broadcasts in the air and far better advertising for Japanese television than Pokemon, but you may find it petty if you did not have the experience in the 60s to see. My score of 8/10 takes into account his age.
