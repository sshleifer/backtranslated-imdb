I love this movie, it's excellent and so funny, Ben is FIT and I would not mind meeting him on vacation !! I rate this film at 10 because it's gr8 and I hope that they will never do it again because it would never be the same. Funny is who Andre looks at the moon and he yells at Nicole to 'come outside and watch the moon', which always makes me laugh and never gets old. Another thing is that Nicole looks much older than 14 ... but she's a gr8 actress. But I need help with something. Does n e 1 not have the name of the song played at the end, who Nicole and Andre are dancing ??? It really annoys me because I want no, whatever it is, because it's a beautiful song !!
