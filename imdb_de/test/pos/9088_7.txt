Countless TV displays and the memorable performances of four of today's megastars (as well as the debut of Hope Davis) are making sure Flatliners are still in the spotlight. The plot is about a non-academic study of five medical students pursuing their crazy idea of ​​discovering the mystery of death and experiencing what happens after death and then bringing it back to life. However, the story is not as intriguing as the idea of ​​action. <br /> <br /> There are popular clichés for developing a regular teen slasher script in Flatliners. There is Nelson, who creates the idea of ​​decoding death, the pretty but introverted Rachel, David, who cuts off the Gordian knot so as not to get out of school, the ladies man Joe and finally the smart guy Randy ("I am They did not come to medicine. "School to murder my classmates, no matter how confused they are.") They team up in an experiment that stops Nelson's heart and stops them again, then they decide to keep the experiment strictly confidential at night Not long after Nelson's experience, everyone starts racing for the wildest and longest death experiences, risking one life at a time, but they soon realize that their daily lives are influenced by the experiences they have made Visits to the hereafter bring back their criminal feelings from their childhood memories, depolarizing their deep unconscious vigilance and begin to have somatic delusions and visual hallucinations. When the point at which the subconscious explanation comes in, director Joel Schumacher states that every person has an unconscious personality he does not know. This inner personality prevents you from changing your identity. If you lose or depolarize this subconscious personality, you will definitely lose your identity, rather than refreshing childhood memories. I wanted to add this as a film error, which was mentioned in the early 90s by film critics. Obviously, Schumacher has had the least influence on the actors here. Why then do they hesitate to continue the experiment after learning their lesson, as if the death of God was undiscovered? David had been introduced as an atheist, now he believed in believing in God, as he recalled a childhood recollection. After witnessing this 180-degree change in David, it is clear that Schumacher's film was so conservative and full of lilies. That's why it's never considered sci-fi. Oh! It had a good potential. She even tried to distinguish the unconscious maturation from a death experience and began to believe that death is so simple and only part of human life. <br /> <br /> More than what's in the movie, it's also remembered what's in the movie. Jan de Bont, a cameraman who worked with Schumacher almost every time, creates a dreamlike atmosphere as if it were a gothic horror movie. The blue shades of color on the walls, reflected in the faces of the actors, provide first-class lighting that fits perfectly with the film. The close-up of the Gargoyle statues in campus buildings, Catholic frescoes on the walls, stop-motion cameras, and dynamic camera speeds were among Bonts skills. Flatliners have become a cult movie in time with his sociological pen portrait of the X-generation juvenile, especially through his futuristic cut style with storyboard-connecting sequences as part of a video music clip that is so aesthetically pleasing. These were the days when fast-paced and multi-clip video clips were on the rise. This style was very rare in the years following Tony Scott's pioneering "The Hunger" (1983).
