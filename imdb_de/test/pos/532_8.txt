I'm sorry, but "Star Wars Episode 1" did not do Natalie Portman's talent (and undeniable cuteness) justice. As Queen Amidala, she was completely unused, and when she was used, her make-up was frighteningly horrible. For "Anywhere But Here" she puts off her awful makeup and she behaves normally. And she can not only behave well, she also does it well. I'm a bit older than her (she's only 18 years old) and I have little or no chance of meeting her, but hey, a guy is allowed to dream, right? <br /> <br /> Even if Susan Sarandon does it Take a good turn in this movie, the movie belongs entirely to Portman. I have been an observer of Portman since "Beautiful Girls" (where she was younger, but just as cute). There are big things for you in the future - I can see it.
