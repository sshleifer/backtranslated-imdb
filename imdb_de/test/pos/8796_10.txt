Hello everyone, all I have to say is that Human Traffic and all the characters are so real that it's funny. I live in Australia (Melbourne) and am finally out of clubbing and stay the whole weekend lifestyle. This movie explains everything that is going on in the world right now. So that's why I can not stop looking at him ... I was just like Moff, so my friends said and I had not even seen the movie yet. I had left the weekend behind about 3 months after four years. I was in a DVD store when I saw Human Traffic. I remember my old friends talking about it. So I bought it to see what it was all about. I watched it four times in a row, because I could not believe anyone made a movie that explained a T. everything. Anyway, this movie is by far the best and funniest movie I've ever seen. It's funny because it's so truthful in everything that goes on in the movie .. AND Moff is a legend !!! That's all I have to say .. :) Enjoy 11/10 my socks out how real it was, it's just what's going on in the world .. hr rm i jabber a lot. <br /> <br /> take care of everyone ...
