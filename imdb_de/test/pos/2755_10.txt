In my opinion, Flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego. He was disrespectful to his dance partner, trying to boast of all, and was unaware of the spirit of Riverdance. It's good that he left the show. Colin Dunne, the new male lead role, is great, and when he and Jean Butler dance together, magic happens! Eileen Ivers' violin playing is amazing (as is Noel Eccles' percussion) and Maria Pages' fire dance is worth the price! When Pages and Ivers come together for a musical duet at the end of the show, it's a real treasure. I agree that editing is not free, but no technical shortcoming can suppress this extraordinary tour de force. That's the one you get. There has never been anything like Riverdance! That's the true one!
