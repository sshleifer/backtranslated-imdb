This movie was originally released as a soft "X", apparently the explicit sex was deleted. Later, the producers gave way (skate money) and released it again, with the cut out scenes restored (apparently only about 3 minutes). I believe since Kristine was of age she has been held against her and her promising career has come to a standstill. I think it's all on schedule (witness Pam Anderson's career) - but Ronald Reagan was responsible during Kristine's debacle (we had not heard of Nancy Reagan's affairs). <br /> <br /> Sex is just the icing on the cake, satisfying both versions. This naughty musical is comparable to others released at the same time.
