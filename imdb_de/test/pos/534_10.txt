When I was 15, I really enjoyed this movie !! I have more to do with the figure of Ann August than most would. My mother is not as eccentric as Adele, but the feelings of loneliness are the same. This film is perfect in terms of Ating and Natalie's and Susan's performances are so closely related that it's the best dual screen I've ever seen. Their chemistry brings the characters to life, they become real people! I would recommend this movie to anyone hoping to escape. Because there are a lot of people who want "Any But But Here" and me too! And if you can, watch this movie with your best friend or mother. It's the tears that mix all around you more !!
