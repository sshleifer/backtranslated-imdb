After about a 7-year stony road on NBC it was decided to run only one last super-rate. The series had been in the bubble several times because it did not have the numbers that would qualify them as the blockbusters of a TV hour. It had always had a considerable, hard core of hard henchmen. <br /> <br /> It was almost as if the series with the full title "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET" (1993-99) was a kind of "Mr. In-Between" series. It was too big to just break off, but too small to end a case of 'Rabid Ratings Ravings'. <br /> <br /> During the precarious Friday evening they had presented some of the best and most daring Artistic of Hourly Dramas. There I said it artistically, artistically !! But please remember, we mean artistically, but not just phony, pretentious, pedantic, politically correct preaching. <br /> <br /> When it was finally clear, it was the end of the line for "HOMICIDE". ; This super-episode was prepared when it was made 2 hours for TV Movie. <br /> <br /> If you look at the events of the past seasons and the parade of regular characters, the production team went off and showed us what turned out to be a great farewell. <br /> <br /> OUR HISTORY? ????? As we join the story, we find that the commander of the Baltimore Homicide, Lt. Al Giardello, "pulled the pencil". But 'G' is not ready to retire yet. Instead of finding a rocking chair or a fishing rod, we find out that Al is running for mayor of 'Charm City'. <br /> <br /> While in the city, he does some campaign stops and speeches, the former detective lieutenant takes the bullet of an assassin. Alive, but in a coma, he is taken to the hospital. <br /> <br /> The news spreads quickly and as if officially called, we find all the detectives of the Baltimore Unit we saw on the show to offer their services and support. There is a great meeting of all these past and present gumshoes as they join and follow every trail and every possibility of a trail. The producer has found a way to deal with those who had previously died their memory in the story. They managed to answer some long-standing questions and ask some questions they had even found out. The whole story makes the series in a very satisfying and original way. But at least for the moment we leave that as "classified". <br /> <br /> If we pack everything into a small, tidy package, this TV movie will certainly find our approval. When rating the "THE HOMICIDE MOVIE" we even have to award an A or A +. But regardless of the grade here, it did not score as high as a typical weekly episode.
