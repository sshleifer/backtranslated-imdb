For those who believe the dialogue is worth something and appreciate a farce clever enough to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a "whodunit" for people who can not follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid). Cornell teaches in Southern California near the University of California Tarpits. He has not published a novel for four years, his wife divorces, he drinks a bit and is blessed or cursed with a caustic joke that he frees his students. He recommended a friend for ascension, and a bright young student submitted a manuscript to him as an independent project. Cornell does not even want to read it, so there's an "A" and push it aside. He leans back with a drink in his office and stares out the window as the young, smart student walks past his window to meet the sidewalk in an exciting encounter. Hal comes to talk and they chat, drink a little more. Cornell realizes he has to read the manuscript now. When he goes home, his wife is waiting with divorce papers. He is still drinking something. She leaves, and he goes to a faculty affair to find her there. He drinks more. And when his wife learns that the student is dead, she faints and learns that she had an affair with the student. This of course causes him to drink more seriously. The next morning, he wakes up and finds himself in the dormitory of one of his students, a first-born named Syd (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> He feels worse than a hangover, goes to the doctor and learns that he was poisoned, is irreversible and has 24-48 hours to live. He does not have much time to find out who killed him, and there are subplots, motives, relationships, and surprises on every corner, though in the end everything makes sense. All his discoveries and exchanges are adorned with sarcasm, witless wit and keen observations. Let's just say that this film will give a new meaning to the saying "publish or go down." <br /> <br /> There are no bad performances in this film. There are recurring images and symbolics that are used at close intervals. Watch for the cracked glass and distorted images. Some of the camera shots are revolutionary for 1988 and some of the violent actions are carefully and skillfully choreographed. The music is inconspicuous and appropriate, although occasionally it makes its own statement in the lyrics. The look in this movie is impressive. <br /> <br /> If there are mistakes, the first 20 minutes are a bit slower and you almost fall asleep. However, the pace is increasing rapidly, with just the right amount of exposure between the action segments. <br /> <br /> There are no explicit sexual encounters, although there is violence and a bad language. <br /> <br /> This is a writer's film best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure. I think if you are serious, you are already in big trouble.
