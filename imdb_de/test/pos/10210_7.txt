Fleeing a bank robbery, outlaw Vance Shaw helps out Edward Creighton, the chief engineer of the Western Union, who oversees the Wild West and has had a horse accident. In 1861, Vance regenerates and is hired for the Western Union, along with the team that installs the poles and cables from Omaha to Salt Lake City. Vance and Harvard engineer Richard Blake (Robert Young) flirt with gorgeous Edward's sister Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore) and she chooses Vance. However, his past haunts him when Outlaw Jack Slade steals Indian-camouflaged Western Union cattle. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" is a good, but predictable western directed by Fritz Lang. The story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men who are responsible for the West's installation of the telegraph and face thieves and Indians. The entertaining story has action, drama, romance and funny situations, but with the exception of the identity of Jack Slade, there is no surprise in the story. Randolph Scott is another great performer with a great cast. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("The Conquerors")
