I saw this movie when it was first released, and I loved it. What a movie. I'm in my 40s now and have two teenage kids and I want them to watch this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance or older Elton John music. <br /> <br /> I've searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but they have not yet hit <br /> I've bought some old movies like "Melody" in Hong Kong, which had a whole bunch of old movies, but they did not have them. <br /> <br /> I also watch the sequel Paul & Michelle. <br /> <br /> Can someone please tell me how to get a copy of the VHS or DVD or VCD? <br /> <br /> Really appreciate. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
