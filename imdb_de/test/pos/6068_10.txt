THE ENGLISH PATIENT not only has everything (damn romance, tragic war, great characters), but also in a way that no other movie offers. It's a compelling story told through flashbacks and amazing achievements by all involved, stunning images, characters that matter to us, and the most delightful love story ever told. A cinematic landmark, the best movie of 1996 and one of the best of the 1990s.
