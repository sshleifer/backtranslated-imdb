The last few days have been a very moving movie for me, showing how hard and disrespectful the gay community really is. The movie enchants true passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters. The film has a deep compassion for the gay community because it really expresses itself for the gay man. Personally, I think it's high time that the homosexual community of all religions no longer holds their heads in shame just because they're beautiful there. The film was an eye opener for me, as I could not believe how antihuman this world really is. Even in schools, when a child does not like something, it is called "gay." I really hope that more films like this one will be filmed and that they will be referred to not just as a "gay" movie but as a love story because I believe that gay directors should take care of themselves and tell their story through their eyes.
