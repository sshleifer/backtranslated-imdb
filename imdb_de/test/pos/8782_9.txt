Ah, Hitchcock! It's hard to find a bad Hitchcock movie until he lost it to THE BIRDS (1963) and SABOTEUR takes the point. After years of admiring most of the director's work, I had managed to skip this work, perhaps because I had no interest in Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings as lead actor. Of course, I was familiar with the climax of the Statue of Liberty, as I had seen her repeatedly in film reviews, but I wrongly assumed that the story that led to it could not arouse my interest. I was wrong! The thrilling plot cooks through a chance encounter between the bad guy saboteur and the protagonist of the Good Guy False accused person and continues through a series of other random encounters and close escapes. All known hitchcock elements are there: the innocent person who is wrongfully accused of a crime; People are not what they seem to be; dramatic or unlikely places that intensify the exciting scene that unfolds in them (airplane hangar, ranch, bridge from which the captive hero drags himself to flee the police, a lavish charity ball in a palatial villa, a skyscraper upstairs, and finally the torch of the Statue of Liberty). <br /> <br /> The humor is provided by supportive gamblers, generous deductions of the social commentary from the early 2nd World War, moments of human warmth in which suffering people find it, to help a fellow human being, get nothing for it? In short, there was always a basic humanity in the heart of Hitchcock, but also the gruesome traps - a sensational cast of supporting players, mostly Otto Kruger as the slimmest villain on this side of George Sanders (his Broadway credits include Noel's male lead role) Coward PRIVATE LIVES ?? and that's all there is to it) and why Norman Lloyd as Titular Saboteur, not to mention Alma Kruger? no relation to Otto ?? as a prominent social dog, who participated in the fifth Column Intrigue (her character indicates that of Claude Rain's mother in NOTORIOUS). Priscilla Lane does a good job with a difficult role. For most of her early scenes we can not say if she considers the hero innocent or guilty, and she seems to be constantly changing her mind, coming to her side late in the process. You can not tell if it's her fault or if we should stay in a state of uncertainty, but the plot's development is so fast, funny, and smart that we really do not care what she thinks. <br /> <br /> Then there are the peculiar Hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the storyline. Twice the Lane character pauses to change a quarter? Once, to reimburse their kidnappers for ice cream and call again from a pay phone. Why these scenes were inserted is a guess to perhaps make the movie more realistic and thus increase the credibility and suspense. Or maybe give the audience a moment to catch their breath? Some of the characters are over the top? the talkative truck driver, the incredibly friendly and trusting blind man living alone in a pristine manicured cabin, the political-philosophical "human skeleton" and other members of the circus caravan hiding the protagonists from their pursuers.
