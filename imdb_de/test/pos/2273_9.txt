I have just seen the Telluride Film Festival "Everything is lit up". This is a really remarkable movie. Very emotional, sometimes funny and heartwarming. Bring your handkerchiefs! For those of you who are enjoying a movie that brings tears to your eyes, I am reminded of the end of "Babette's Feast" and "The Notebook". The stories were totally different, but had the same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes, just like in this movie. <br /> <br /> No spoilers here. The summary is, as IMDb describes, a young man's journey to Ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up. The dialogue is in English and Ukrainian (and Russian too i believe)). This allows for some wonderfully linguistic moments in which a character, depending on the circumstances, more or less faithfully interprets the English speaker in the group. <br /> <br /> The scenery is wonderful and the music score is a with wonderful Eastern European influences. Make sure you hold the credits for the final piece. <br /> <br /> This is the directorial debut of Lieve Schreiber and is well done. I'm giving this movie a 9, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I highly recommend it.
