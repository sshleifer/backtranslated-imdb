Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbolist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood had decided on the Da Vinci Code, as the latter's rather controversial theme makes the belief in itself nervous. The Catholic Church was in the first movie in the gun, but did not seem to pay attention to the first film. And it's not hard to understand why Ron Howard decided to make a flat action piece that would serve as a great tourism video for Rome and Vatican City, and likely to increase attendance given the many beautiful on-site scenes except For St. Peter's Square and the basilica was a scaled model used. <br /> <br /> So if I needed the bulk of the budget for the sets, the ensemble needed to be scaled down accordingly. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female emptiness of Audrey Tautou, but given the fact that Tautou was much more involved in the film at that time, Zurit's Vittoria had to do much less than just wait in the wings a few batteries to change canisters filled with antimatter. In the book, of course, she feeds Langdon to share his extensive knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati, and the great feud between the two, but here she is neither a love interest nor an intellectual partner. <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, chews each scene in which he is as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who temporarily takes care of the papal office, while the other are prominent cardinals in the Sistine Chapel, to a new Pope to choose. And he plays Patrick with that gleam in his eyes, with nuances enough to let you know there's more to it than you would at first glance. There are no surprises for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance is one of the movie's highlights as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks. <br /> <br /> and had much more action points about science versus religion and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and combined in a fictional work. When I read the book a few years ago, I thought that if a movie was to be made out of it, it's easy to fall for the set action pieces. Unfortunately, Ron Howard's film did so at a speed that does not allow for a brief breather. Unlike the first movie, where you set the characters to "talk time" over a cup of tea, things moved so fast, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page, just to watch the movie arrive in the middle of the action. <br /> <br /> Catholic critics have called Angels & Demons harmless because I think she has not responded to her many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code, which has taken a nerve at the center of the festival , And if anything, this movie served as a great tourist promotional video with a beautiful showcase of the many prominent tourist landmarks that would tempt many around the world to visit. Of course, certain areas such as the catacombs under St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican's archives are out of bounds, but the walk on the path of enlightenment is now almost free. Nothing new for those who have read the book differently than to see it alive, but for those who have not done so, this movie can simply force you to pick up Dan Brown's novel, only a little more about the importance of landmarks and characters like Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini, which are closely linked to the conspiracy, but remain much unspoken. Popcorn entertainment that leaves nothing spectacular.
