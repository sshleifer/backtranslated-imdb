I met Arthur Penn's "Four Friends" on HBO late at night. Since I had never heard of it, I expected very little, but I watched because I was interested in what a team of Penn and screenwriter Steve Tesich would look like. For the next two hours, I was fascinated, watching this incredible team of talent and the story they had woven. "Four Friends," a semi-autobiographical story of a young immigrant to America growing up in the midst of the turbulence of the 1960s, tells the story of Danilo, an Eastern European immigrant (the brilliant Craig Wasson), from his arrival in the United States by an American Citizenship decade that has changed the American landscape. Danilo's companions on his journey are his friends Georgia (the radiant Jodi Thelan, in a role she unfortunately never had), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston). "Four Friends" is way too much for me to explain here, but if you have not seen this movie yet, I urge you to search and watch a copy (it has just been released on DVD). You will not be disappointed. Tesich's script is wonderfully poignant? sometimes funny, sometimes incredibly sad, but always fascinating and honest. Penn manages with a sure hand and an obvious love for the time and the people whose lives we pursue. The cast is consistently excellent. This movie should have made a great star of Wasson, who is truly one of the most wasted talents in the country. Jodi Thelan, not a normal Hollywood sexpot with Hollywood spirit, heats up the screen in a performance where the audience falls as easily in love with their character as the characters in the movie. The subtle performances of Metzler and Huddleston could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co-stars, but they are excellent and anchor the film. Also excellent are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith. I have not released a copy of "Four Friends" since the day I first saw it on HBO many years ago. It's been one of my favorite movies of all time for over 20 years. I can not recommend it enough and feel that if you give it a chance, you feel the same way.
