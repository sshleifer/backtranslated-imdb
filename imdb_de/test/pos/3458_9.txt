A stunning movie that has brought so much disability to the public that people are usually scared. It showed how understanding can be conquered by less than willing bodies, and how difficult it must be to see how other people, who are sought for the disabled individual, experience it. Love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humor and so many other things were so well captured. The 2 main characters were played very well by the 2 capable actors and laughed with laughter, tears, anxiety, joy and dismay. Be too much for sympathy or just hold on to negatives. However, it was a beautifully designed story by two friends. <br /> <br /> I loved it.
