if you have not seen Vijay in "Ghillli", "Gilly" or "Ghillie". look at it. Impressive. it is devastatingly funny. I do not know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was serious or not. There are a lot of hot guys in this one, look for someone who calls Velu "Maacha". The one with the brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. His teeth are also brilliant. Vijay rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It's very deep. Look at it, you will not regret it. There are some great laughs in this. If you do not speak Tamil, you will learn it. Then you get all the inner jokes. It's one for the whole family, except maybe the violent parts should be skipped. I have seen and counted this movie about eleven times. <br /> <br /> Wow!
