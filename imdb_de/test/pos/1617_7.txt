To defend this film, I have to repeat what I said earlier. The movie is called Arachina, it has no name and I have no name as with actors who play in little-seen art-house films. I do not mean a name, because your local high school decided to shoot a movie with no name, and he could have a budget of $ 2. So what do you expect? Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> I felt like the movie never took it seriously, which automatically puts it off the worst movie list. This list is only for big budget Star Cast movies that are too serious. The Movie The Oscar comes to mind, most of Sylvester Stallone's films. The two main roles were not Hepburn and Tracy, but they did their job well enough for this film. The woman kicked her butt and the guy was not a bleating idiot. The actor who played the old man was really good. The man who played the anal remanent professor was not Clifton Webb, but he had done a good job. And the Bimbo's were played for lack of better performance by two competent actors. I laughed at the 50 cent special effects. But that was part of the movie's charm. It was like a mix of Tremor's Meets Night of the Living Dead. The premise of the film is as with all Giant Bug movies of the 50s. A meteor or radiation stimulates the ecosystem and, before you know it, we have giant ants, lobsters, rocks or lizards that terrorize the locals. A meteor was the cause of the problems this time. I was very entertained. I did not expect much and I go much more than I expected.
