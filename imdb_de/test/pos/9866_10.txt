This review is based on the Producer's Cut: <br /> <br /> 'Halloween 5' was a big disappointment at the box office in '89. Personally, I've always loved it and I'm proud to have it in my collection. But because of his failure, and also because of the rights issues, it would take us 6 years to see another installment. The film had what it takes to be one of the best, if not the best in the series. A hardcore fan who wrote the screenplay, the return not only of Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers, but also the return of the character of Tommy Doyle from the first film, a large studio that supports the project, and a case All published the film as a hit in the making. What went wrong? I'll give you two good reasons: re-shoots and bad editing. Due to a bad test screening and the unfortunate abdomen of Donald Pleasence the movie was changed and not for the better. The film, like Parts III and 5, was performed at the box office and received negative reviews from critics as well as most serial fans. Thanks to the magic of bootlegging, the original cut went through and many fans, including myself, were very happy. I'll end this part of my review by saying this: This movie is at least my favorite movie "Halloween" so far, and I'm not afraid to admit that. <br /> <br /> Pros: The score is just fascinating. Has some of the best lyrics and dialogues in the series. "Halloween 4" mimicked the original, which was more about suspense and mood than blood and guts, and at 6 it was the same. Great performances, especially from the late and very missed Donald Pleasence. Moving at a breathtaking pace. An interesting explanation for Michael's evil and why he will not die. Some brutal killings. Some nice moments, where I like Kim Darby's character. Many really cool nods to the previous films. Some good surprises. As in the two previous sequels, this one also has a fantastic cliffhanger end here. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: The explanation for Michael's evil is intriguing, but makes it less scary. Since when can Michael move so quickly from place to place? <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: This was the first "Halloween" I saw in the theater. I was so excited because I really thought 5 was the last and then I heard that this happened. I enjoyed it at the time, but over time I've seen what it really was: a great movie caught up in an OK movie with a terrible end to it. Why did the filmmakers have to listen to people in the test screenings? If she had released this superior version, she might have gotten a lot better and the series may not be in the mess she's in right now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
