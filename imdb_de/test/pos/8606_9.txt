Shohei Imamaura's Black Rain was released in 1989 at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. This is a fact that further stresses the movie about the slow deterioration of the victims of Hiroshima radiation. The black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash, radioactive fallout and water that fell an hour or two after the explosion. There were other books and films about dropping the atomic bomb, but none as unique and as powerful as this one. Based on a novel by Masuji Ibuse, which collected information from interviews and diaries of real bomb victims, the film shows how a whole family is affected both mentally and physically by the bomb years after the original explosion. It is a terrible vision, but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, when soldiers and civilians go about their normal daily activities. Suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderbolt can be heard. Almost every single building is destroyed or irreparably damaged. The first atomic bomb ever to fall on a city is now part of the story. Survivors have to start their lives somehow, without being aware of the devastating aftermath of the bomb. Filmed in high-contrast black and white, the story revolves around Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka), a young woman caught in the radioactive rain as her boat returns to the city to search for friends and relatives. In Hiroshima, Imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us: a boy whose skin hangs from his body asks him to recognize him with his brother, and an elderly man is in tears over the inability to free his son from debris A mother is in agony as she rocks her child's black body. <br /> <br /> As the family returns to their rural home, Yasuko's life is forever changed. She sees her friends die nearby, waiting for the inevitable onset of radiation sickness that her uncle Shigematsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and Aunt Shigeko Shimuza (Etsuko Ichihara) have already met. The family claims there are only shops as usual and denies that the bomb hit Yasuko. "She has forgotten how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, everyone forgot about it, they forget about the hell of the fire and gather like annual parties, I'm sick of it," says a friend Katayama (Akiji Kobayashi). Yasuko internalizes the tragedy, is ashamed of being different from others and being guilty of being contaminated. When her aunt and uncle try to find her husband, the legitimate men refuse to marry her on suspicion of her health, even though Shigematsu has copied her diary to prove that she was not directly exposed to the bomb. The only admirer she feels comfortable with is another injured man, Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida), who has a panic attack every time he hears the engine noise. In the end, the beauty of life becomes so fleeting as Yasuko goes to the pond and sees a sight she has longed for her entire life. The carp playfully jump in the water, as if he would say that there is still joy beyond despair. Unfortunately we hear on the radio statements from politicians about the re-use of the bomb in the Korean War. "People do not learn anything," says Shigematsu. "They strangle themselves. Unjust peace is better than a judicial war. Why can not they see that?" The rain from Immamura has hopefully allowed us all to see more clearly.
