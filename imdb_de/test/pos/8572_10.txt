I'm setting this movie on a bend, in other words, it's not the best movie ever made, but it does exactly what it was supposed to do. This is an excellent T & A movie. I have no idea how many T's or A's were shown in this movie, but I've seen a recording that was just T-16 at once, just to give you an idea. There are no girls everywhere. There is a wet t-shirt contest scene. The highlight is a touch football game between two all-girl teams. Each time you score a touchdown, the entire opposing team loses a piece of clothing. I do not know why this is rated so low here. Maybe the people who rated it bad to visit Citizen Kane thought. I love this movie and I hope to find similar films. If you're looking for a good Campy T & A movie, I recommend it.
