Two Hands is an extremely entertaining Aussie crime capsule that ultimately manages to bring the film the right balance and feel through the way the film combines exciting dramatic moments with very funny characters and situations. The comedy of the film is natural and the laughs are not too lavishly arranged and have not been edited too much. It's really funny, thanks to the fact that every character in the film is superbly populated and every actor / actress recognizes Australian humor and can relate to it. They portray it very well and very realistically. Of course, they are helped enormously by a fantastic script by writer / director Gregor Jordan. I read another review of this movie from an American who had seen it, and he criticized it fiercely and basically turned it into a pulp-fiction clone. I think that's just garbage. This film does not try to be Pulp Fiction, the feel and style of each of these great films are totally opposite. Without wanting to sound superior or arrogant, I think to fully understand this movie; The humor, the sincerity, the characters, etc. You must be Australian or at least understand the culture of which the other man obviously had no idea. Some Americans whose reviews of certain non-American films seem somewhat uninteresting (and have difficulty understanding anything that is not an American product). It's a pity, because this is a really great movie. The love story between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real, sincere and sweet way. I am very proud to have this film in my collection. 4.5 out of 5.
