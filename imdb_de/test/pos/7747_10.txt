I found this movie funny. I have never really seen old movies and this was a really great first date. It had warmth and heart and mind. Was kind of corny, but in today's movie industry is cheesy cute. I gave him a ten and I strongly recommend renting, buying or watching the movie wherever you can. Gene Kelly was very dreamy and a bit sarcastic, and you knew the character thought he would have everything. The female lead was cast perfectly because her two personalities had a spark and you wanted to hold on and see what would happen. The grandma in the movie was priceless. The perfect complement to a great old movie. I love the fact that it was black and white and Gene Kelly is so cute with all the kids in the movie that you can not help but like him. Do you see it.
