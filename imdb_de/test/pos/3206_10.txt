Gilmore Girls is a funny show with never-ending sarcasm, wit and charm. At the age of 16, Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents' house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship many mothers and daughters envied. They are best friends. The girls have extensive knowledge of movies and television programs and quote them constantly. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton (a highly rated high school). They like to give them the money, but Rory has to have dinner with them every Friday night. I highly recommend this show. I love it!
