Great show! With time comes a reality TV show that closes generational gaps. The participants are aged, some seem to be old enough to see the movie when it first came out. And others looked so young that maybe parents or teachers would have passed the film in hope, hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touched them. Fat has really become an American icon. Fett is a fun and entertaining movie in which young and old can find each other. "You're the one we want" will surely win more Grease followers. The only thing I wanted was more character history. On the other hand, it's nice to leave some of it to the nostalgic imagination of the 50s. I can not wait to see the next show ... and then on Broadway !!!
