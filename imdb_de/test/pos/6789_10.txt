I hope we never become a society that appreciates the simple beauty of this film: beautiful to look at with its romantic English landscape and beautiful in its message of faith and faithfulness. Watch this with your children, especially your young daughters. Velvet Brown is a wonderful role model for girls. This was one of my daughter's favorite movies. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a bestselling book by Enid Bagnold about a girl, Velvet, whose whole life her horse, Pi, and her determination is pursuing her "impossible" dream. I will not say more about the plot, I spoil it for first time visitors. She lives with a large, loving family in a small coastal village. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that made Elizabeth Taylor a star and seeing the movie is the reason to understand. She is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that corresponds to her outer beauty - trusting, passionate, innocent - she is the emotional core of the film. Mickey Rooney does a wonderful job as Mi, the young man who arrives on the doorstep one day stays and helps Velvet train the Pi. This is one of his best performances. Also noteworthy is Anne Revere as Velvet's mother in an Oscar-winning role. Her strong, loving, and wise character understands that life does not have much value if you do not follow your dreams: "We are similar, and I believe that once in a lifetime, everyone should have a chance at a breathtaking piece of folly. "<br /> <br /> I heartily recommend this very sweet, very inspiring classic from Hollywood's golden age.
