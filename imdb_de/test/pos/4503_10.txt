This is absolutely one of our favorites of 2007. <br /> <br /> The story of two boys from different worlds, but as close as brothers, is told brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot and scripted - from childhood to adulthood, it will never falter. <br /> <br /> A brilliant insight into a lost culture and a very good way to understand the cultures and traditions of the Farsi, this is also an extraordinary story. It is both compassionate and exciting, uplifting and filled with immense sorrow, joyful and depressing. <br /> <br /> With excellent cast and excellent technical skills behind the camera, this is really a movie at its best. <Br /> <br /> Highest Recommendation: A real piece of life that rises and informs.
