This was a surprisingly good movie and an interesting idea. However, it was a bit disappointing that the "twist" was a bit too predictable and only a little too early in the movie. Looking at it, it became a bit bizarre and confusing, to the point that the only reasonable result was the inevitable conspiracy of the plot, but it did not ruin the film flow. There have been great performances, there has never been a boring moment, so it's worth to see this one. It interested me until the very end, and for me there are not many films that can do that today. I highly recommend that people see this great little movie.
