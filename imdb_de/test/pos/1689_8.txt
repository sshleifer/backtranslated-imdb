The film undoubtedly corresponded to the true life story on which it is based. It was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the facts, but when I found them, I realized that the truth in this case was more than a fiction. Judith Light was terribly evil in her role as a mother in this film, so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role that I consider to be a great accomplishment. Rick Schroder, as her son, who also defended her in court, had no idea how difficult it can be for a child to accept a parent's actions, no matter how criminal. You can find mistakes in the film, but not in its treatment of the reality on which it is based.
