In Moscow, the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) love each other. With World War II, Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front the day before Veronika's birthday, and they have no opportunity to say goodbye to each other. While waiting for news from Boris, Veronika is raped by Boris's cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they marry. However, Veronika does not forget Boris and is always waiting for him. <br /> <br /> "Letyat zhuravli" is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in wartime. The direction is excellent and uses ellipses along the story, including in the capital scene, when Veronika is raped by Mark. The camera work is amazing, with sophisticated levels and angles and long journeys. The scenes of Veronika in the middle of the tanks or in the train station with many figures are fantastic. The great cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the DVD. T. Samojlova has an extremely beautiful face and a touching and sensitive performance. The speech in the last scene is another great example of an anti-war movie. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Quando Voam as Cegonhas" ("When the stork flies")
