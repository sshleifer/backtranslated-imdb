Susie Q is a great romantic promo movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great actress. I think she has done a great job. I hope the Disney Company can bring this movie to DVD someday. I think it's kind of cool and a bit weird. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a car accident at the beginning. But in the middle, when no one suspects Susie Q, it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little secret in this movie, but not much. Still, I would recommend this movie to the whole family if it likes comedy, mystery, or romantic movies. It is great! I think Amy Jo Johnson is cute as Susie Q.
