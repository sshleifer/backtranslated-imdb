Toward the end of his career, Jack Arnold, a very efficient director who gave us classic 1950s creatures such as "It Came from Outer Space", "The Creature from the Black Lagoon" and "Tarantula", partnered with the former football star the 70s blaxploitation movie headliner Fred "The Hammer" by Williamson for a pair of movies. He produced the loveable, if unremarkable western, "The Black Bounty Hunter" and this refreshingly airy, clever and extremely entertaining 70s action action on your standard 40s movie noir down-the-heels private investigator yarn. <br /> <br /> Williamson presents a charming combination of dry, self-deprecating humor and relaxed, laid-back self-esteem such as Shep Stone, a cheap, sympathetic and forever Former Los Angeles cop became a private detective. Stone is so tough on cash that he uses a bar as his office and barely manages to make penny-ante low-wage cases that the police do not want to deal with. While hammering the street for one of those deceptively simple appearances (Stone tries to find the wild daughter of a guy hiding somewhere in Hollywood to find the guy), Stone finds an elbow deep in a complex, dangerous, seemingly bottomless criminal Action that includes a unfolded Jesus freak religious cult, various skull-hippie dopes, a dirty porn ring, a priceless gilded stick that belonged to a legendary silent movie star, a nefarious underground drug smuggling operation, and a growing number of new bodies. > <br /> Without the viciously playful, mischievous ingenuity of Robert Altman's masterly "The Long Goodbye" or the haunting, unyielding pessimism of Arthur Penn's beautifully gloomy "Night Moves", "Black Eye" still tops the score. Successful Hip'n ' Flip 70's Spin on 40 Mystery Suspense Thriller. Arnold's capable direction keeps the tempo on a nice, even clip that is interrupted with sporadically exciting Mano-a-Mano-naked ankle combat scenes and the superb use of various, colorfully studded locations in LA (the rundown, abandoned amusement park at the end of the film is special effectively). , The script by Mark Haggard and Jim Martin provides quite a few rather complicated and often really surprising plot changes. And the expected selection of bizarre, harsh, secondary characters is an interesting comedian, with particularly notable twists by Rosemary Forsyth as seductive, powerful owner of a lesbian modeling agency (Forsyth has the best line of the image and boasts Stone as) she first meets him ( "I'm a LOT of Wife"), Teresa Graves from the television series "Get Christie Love" is a loyal bisexual friend of Stone (the casual, unrated portrayal of Foryth's unconventional Femme Fatale and Graves' alike) atypical gal Friday is one of the strongest Asset) and Bret Morrison, who played the voice of Radio "The Shadow" in the 1940s, as a smug, filthy pornographer. All in all, it is a modest but sure winner.
