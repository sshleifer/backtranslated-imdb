This movie requires a lot of patience. Since the focus is on mood and character development, the plot is very simple and many scenes play in the same set - in the home of Frances Austen (Sandy Dennis). The film, however, is becoming a worrying climax. <br /> <br /> The characters create an atmosphere of sexual tension and psychological tricks. It's very interesting that Robert Altman directed, given the style and structure of his other films. However, here and there the brand Altman audio style is obvious. I think what makes this movie really so is the brilliant performance of Sandy Dennis. It's definitely one of her darker characters, but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary. Michael Burns does a good job as a "dumb" young man. The regular Altman player Michael Murphy has a small part. The festive, atmospheric set goes very well with the content of the story. In short, this film is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual oppression and despair. Be patient, absorb the atmosphere, and watch out for the wonderfully written script. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Robert Altman. This is one of his many films dealing with unconventional, fascinating topics. This film is disturbing, but it is sincere and will certainly elicit a strong emotional response from the viewer. If you want to watch an unusual movie - some even say bizarre - this is worth the time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, finding video rentals is very hard. You may need to buy it from the internet.
