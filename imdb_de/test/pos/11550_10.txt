Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and cameramen in the industry. Therefore, it is not surprising that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most courageous story ever. Serious. If I had found a way to climb into my video monitor, I would have beaten Pierre to an inch of his life. No one has the right to be so selfish and stupid, both at once, except perhaps Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. After 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a big glass of brandy. I've never been so mad at a main character. Okay, but Pola X is a stunning movie with one of the few absolutely honest sex scenes I've ever seen in a movie ... which means another brilliant filmmaking ... and I'm talking about graphics here by the way. Pola X is going to beat you up so damn sure, so make sure you agree if you decide to look at it.
