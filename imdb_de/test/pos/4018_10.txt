An interesting film based on three novels by Jules Vernes. Given the special effects and computer-aided animation of today, this film is a historical marker of cinematic ingenuity and imagination. Karel Zeman brought to life the lithographs of the original texts by Jules Verne. This is a must for classic science fiction and history buffs. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 9 out of 10 points. Have fun !!
