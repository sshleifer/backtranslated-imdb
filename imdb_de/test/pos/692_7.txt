This is an excellent tub hoppers from the war years. <br /> <br /> John Mills takes a fine cast of British B-Movie Stalwarts in a solo submarine attack on a fictional enemy battleship. <br /> <br Filmed in black and white, the tempo is good and well placed, considering that there was a war at that time. If anything, it shows how seriously the authorities have taken positive propaganda. <br /> <br /> The mission side of the movie takes place in real submarines. Things are tight and claustrophobic. The actors look accordingly dirty and sweaty, without offending the heroic palate. Other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details, such as the trim of the ships and the forgetting of reading instruments as well as the activities of the engine room. This is probably the first movie in which Debris (and a dead German is blown out of the torpedo tube to deceive a hostile destroyer, and it is the ONLY time I've seen a part of the ship that fades - a risky risk if ever there was one. <br /> <br /> I'm a little skeptical of whether a submarine or not could bang its way through a wire rope net. The speed underwater was barely twice as fast as the speed In addition, the engineer was in the same workplace and operated the same levers both on the surface and under water, again, this seems implausible because either diesel or electric motors were used and they themselves or so it is said. <br /> <br /> There was a bit too much land drama for my taste, but then this was a propaga It clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to watch over their behavior, as this could affect the service morale and thus the war effort little adventure. Nowadays, films of such vintage series are usually shown in the afternoon, while more modern and inferior films enjoy prime-time. But then; It is no longer politically correct to mention the war in the presence of our European friends (too many of them have guilty consciences) or our own leftist fascists (none of whom has ever fought for the freedoms he now takes for granted). , <br /> <br /> As a submarine film, it is perfectly collectable. Better than "The Enemy Below", I think, though less demonstrative. Not as authentic as 'The Boat', but not so rude.
