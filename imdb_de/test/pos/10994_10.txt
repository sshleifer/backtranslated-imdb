We saw Manna from the sky, my husband, two friends and me and we all enjoyed the movie. The characters are funny, the story is amusing and similar to real life. I think I liked that best, I just saw something believable, no murders, no science fiction, just good, clean fun. It's something you could take your children or older parents with you, without worrying about it. How many of them are already available !!
