Well, where should I start? I came across this in 1993 and made "record" on the VCR out of habit, more than anything else. "Citizen Kane" is certainly not ... but if you had a bad day and are in the mood to fall for something that is not too intellectually stimulating, then I suggest that this may just be your "thing" , , <br /> <br /> We have a lot here - great title track, more stereotypes than you could shake on a stick, unconscious comedy, the bitchiest fight scene of all time and more, more, more! David Hemmings plays the diametrical opposite of his role in the 60s classic "Blow Up" - still a photographer, still hormonally stimulated, but not "quite" the same. John Philip Law is an easy-to-beat actor who lacks a protocol, but that would not be fair since he had about five minutes before he accepted the role. <br /> <br /> Wexler as "Amanda"? Suffice to say that it was their only and only role! However, the real star in this movie is Ethel Evans, who plays a secretary (?) With the moral of a street cat and the ambition to achieve it. The way she manages to reconcile her present life with that of a future future with her future comedian husband touches in an earthy, pithy, what is going to be, how it will be. <br /> <I really love this movie when I'm in the mood for it ....... and would not touch it with the proverbial bargepole when I'm not. <br /> <br /> Kudos the cast to keep a (relatively) straight face while filming. <br /> <br /> A "classic" in the Edward D Wood School of cinematic aspirations!
