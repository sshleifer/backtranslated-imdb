What can I say about this movie that has not been said hundreds of times? It is an American classic. It has produced dozens of imitators. Or none. Midnight Madness is unique. From the ridiculous opening assembly / music to the Bonaventure Hotel I was thrilled. Leon has made us all so young and carefree. One question, how did he always have these two hot hookers with him? And how did we have time / money to organize such an event? The cast is first class. David Naughton is best here. His tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. His little brother Michael J Fox (in his first leading role) is a real brat. There is also Naughton's love interest and a jerk and the obligatory black guy in a fisherman's hat in the yellow team. Michael J Fox does bad things, like stealing beer at the Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery and runs to Flounder's delivery van. The flounder team gives us the most comedy. What exactly is the deal with the blonde in this team? Is she dating flounder? Or Melio? Or blade? Yes, the Mexican gentleman's name is Blade. The other guy in the Flounder team has the best lines of the movie, I will not press them here. The Meat Machine team is a bunch of drunks. My personal favorite is the armpit. But even the silent black is great. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians (two of them are 450 lb twins). <br /> <br /> You know the end from the beginning. That does not matter. This is the Me genre of the 80s at its best. Do not rent this, BUY it. and buy now
