Somewhere on the IMDb there is a discussion about the best director ever (Spielberg, Copolla and others are mentioned there). The biggest argument was about Spielberg and whether he is a good director or not. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his films lack depth. Ryan's saving is really outstanding from a technical point of view, but the message is boring and though she's entertaining, she's not thinking about anything. AN is the best movie I've ever seen, combining great filming with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things, from war in general to the clash of civilizations, to the condition of a wartime soldier (is a soldier Hero or a murderer? Brando says he is neither, the Frenchwoman says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they are arguing about whether these points are true or false. But a great movie and a great work of art in general should encourage quarrels, not solving them ... Maybe Coppola is right or maybe not, nobody has the truth anyway. You can see this movie for its outer beauty, amazing scenes, great plays and catchy quotes and you will be completely satisfied. But what really makes this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can not help but compare with the actual Fahrenheit documentation. Both Copolla and Moore deal with similar topics, but while Copolla presents things objectively from the outside, Moore takes a very biased position that challenges the whole point of a documentary ... It's a pity that one Film like Fahrenheit 9/11 has won a prestigious award such as Cannes. However, if you want to know a bit about the Vietnam War, the Iraq war, the Second World War and any war in general, you should definitely watch this movie and not the others.
