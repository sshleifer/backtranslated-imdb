The best romantic comedy I've seen in years. Not the overjoyed Hollywood stuff of Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler and much less syrupy than a Hugh Grant epic. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are perfectly staffed and both deliver smoothly professional services. The engaged couple who decides to spend some time before marrying to sow their sexual oats. Instead of just laughing, the authors and the director have put together a nice mix of human emotions and comedic action. Nicholson is just great because the awkward seductress and Mohr do a great job because the man who reluctantly gets into the game soon gets too pleased with his bow. We just see enough supportive characters to complete the story nicely, without distracting from the main story. Especially good are Andy Richter (serious girlfriend) and Helen Slater (desperate single mother). There is enough sense and emotional complexity to do so much more than a normal boy-girl farce. With only a slightly better tempo and a little more editing, this movie would be a top ten comedy.
