This movie is BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> I can not remember that this film was also in the cinemas. I think it would be "straight to DVD" and I have relatively low expectations, even though I'm a big Mike fan judge. It has some kind of comic book satire like "Brazil" and "Demolition Man," but taken to the next level. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the cast; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, who were all brilliant. <br /> <br /> This film convinced me in the first 5 minutes, where there are more than average people with fewer children and the poorest, dumbest, trashiest people with many ignorant children, and how this is reversed Development leads. It takes this concept and then shows where we are with this pollution of the gene pool. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I do not think it will take 500 years as shown, but probably only about 50 years. I already see the shocking increase in the "slight delay" in the general population, the media and culture. People who like classical music and art are ridiculed and not respected. The lowest common denominator seems to rule, especially in Hollywood and on TV (eg, "Jackass the Movie" and any reality show where you eat something disgusting or be humiliated for money). <br /> <br /> Everything Apart from the political / social satire, this movie is also just LAUGHING LAUGH! And I do not say that easily; Some films actually make me "LOL", but they did. <br /> <br /> Many of the best jokes are word / sight gags in the background, so you really have to be careful to get some of them. I even had to pause and zoom in on some of them (for example, when Joe got his government passport and for "hair" he said "yes" and for "eyes" also "yes"). The prison has engraved "Special People's House" on the front page because the cops in the movie (like real cops) call everyone "individuals" instead of people, and so on. Again, this was just a screen on the screen moment ... this is one of those movies that you can watch again and again to cut through the funny layers. <br /> <br /> Also, I usually watch subtitled movies, and that helped me. In some jokes that may pass your ears in the dialogue mix, the police are constantly talking about people "dismissing" instead "escaping" and there are many other false pronunciations that have simply brought me to my knees. But maybe I did not pick it up through the dialogue with music / sound effects; It is very subtle, but still funny. <br /> <br /> Also, the special effects for a science fiction / social satire were REALLY GOOD. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but overall I think that's one of those movies, if you do NOT find it funny, it's probably going to make fun of YOU! I intend to recommend this to many, many people!
