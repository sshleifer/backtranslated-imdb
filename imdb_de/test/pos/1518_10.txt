Just beautiful. One of the best minds - uh ... screws - that exists. Both Rickman and Stowe play their role in this narrative of a children's book author who - maybe? - wrote a subversive move. Moscow learned a few things from the torture techniques in this film. You could also make it worse than hiring Alan Rickman. Five out of five stars and currently (1-20-2000) # 2 on my top 100 films ever.
