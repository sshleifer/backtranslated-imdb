Oz is a great show, one of TVs that are undervalued. It has a certain relation to the soap opera, because something bad always happens and it is the unfolding of every single evil that fascinates. After my talks with people who are actually in prison, it sounds right. Every interaction has some background knowledge. Behind every action hides a plan, an action that someone else can work with. I like this series so much that it is one of the few TV shows that I have bought completely on DVD. <br /> <br /> And, yes, I agree with the author, who commented that it contained elements of satire. The character in the wheelchair, who offers his lazy view of life, does so with a certain ironic humor.
