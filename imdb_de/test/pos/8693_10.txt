This is an extraordinary movie. It is partly comedy, partly drama, partly tension. The dialogue is exquisite. Most actors and actresses were very famous in their day, and with good reason. You will probably recognize someone, even if you do not normally see older films. They are also each in a role that suits their talents. <br /> <br /> A correction to be made to another user is that two people (and not one person) are told to die in the accident. Perhaps the unfortunate two reflect what the author considers important in life. The movie is too intriguing to worry about who he is until he passes. <br /> <br /> The story is ahead of its time, but does not lose the quality of an older movie. Much time and effort has gone into perfecting the camera and soundtrack, something modern filmmakers forget.
