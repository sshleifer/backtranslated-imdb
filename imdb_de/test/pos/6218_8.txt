My favorite story from "Stories from the tomb". Brion Jones was born to play the role of the crazy lumberjack. The ax wields the madman Steve Dixon. After seeing him in Tango & Cash, I can say that this actor never got the right credit he deserves. A jealous husband condemns himself with his wife, who is interested in a young worker he has just hired. And you know when Dixon finds out that it's going to be a hell that needs to be paid? How should a blind lumberjack work? A tribute to black humor, if ever there was one! The co-stars do a pretty good job supporting Ted when Dixon started suspecting that his wife wanted another man. Although Ted should have done the way and left, if he could!
