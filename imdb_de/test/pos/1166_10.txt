One of the best "guy" movies I've ever seen must be the wind and the lion. Gad, the scenes ... <br /> <br /> Raisouli's bandits swarming over the wall ... A confident British gentleman rises quietly with Candice Bergen from the tea and drops three of them in the coat with a Webley revolver , A whisper from the spirit of the Empire ... So we do not forget! So we do not forget! <br /> <br /> USA Marines coming ashore from the long, long-gone Brooklyn. They had Krags with them, it should have been Lee, but oh wow. And the Winchester 97 blows big holes in daring natives and even more daring and treacherous Europeans ... <br /> <br /> Raisouli - Sean Connery, o, Wow! "<br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt - Brian Keith, o Wow! - Wondering" What kind of weapon does Raisouli use? and another furious letter to Winchester about the share of his Winchester 95. <br /> <br /> Raisouli, armed with only one sword ... A Prussian cavalry officer, HOLSTERING his pistol and drawing HIS sword, that's long dead from a long gone world, but Raisouli would never have flown a plane full of kids into a building ... Milious at Milious' terrific best and now on DVD.
