This was a wonderful little movie that was really creative and funny - something you rarely see in movies. The film begins in Russia shortly after the overthrow of the communist government. As a result, society seems to be in chaos, and life needs to improve after the end of the old regime. Dirty cities, crime and lack of housing still plague the poor people of St. Petersburg. In this scene of desolation and insecurity comes an idealistic music teacher. He is one of those who have no home and FINALLY receives a letter from the government informing him that he has a tiny room in a nearby apartment. When he arrives, the place is a mess, but people seem to be friendly enough that everyone has a nice party. In the middle of the night, they are awakened by an old lady coming out of the huge closet in the room (I half expected Lucy and the other kids to come out of THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, but they did not.) t) They are too shocked to do anything at first but soon decide to investigate instead of just being a closet, the closet opens to Paris! How the dwellers respond to this magical gateway is truly mesmerizing. Some, like the music teacher, are enthusiastic and in awe, most of the others are more pragmatic and mostly dealing with looting everything from Paris before the gateway closes once and for all.These Russian thieves are terrible people - greedy, rude and Rough but deep down - VERY DEEP - are hearts of gold, I like that this is a metaphor for the nation now on the edge of capitalism They pack everything they can and only later do they reveal some depth - but most of the time they behave like guests in THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW. The movie has many twists and is both funny and fascinating. The only negative is that, due to the harsh language and a nude scene (albeit very funny), this is not a movie for kids. That's a pity, because with a few very small cuts this could have been a great family movie.
