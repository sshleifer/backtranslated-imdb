I can not believe that the Bostock's Cup is not yet available on a real video or a DVD. I only saw it once, on a dodgy copy that was taken out of the TV, and although I was not a running fan (at all), I thought it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The famous sloping slope, wherever it was, the unsuspecting coachman ("Ponty-this, Ponty-that", "I'll take the next exit"), the pointless plot; it summed up to aching pages. <br /> <br /> Because I'm stuck in the US, I'm desperate for good British humor, but not enough to spend the amount the production company demands. Come on, get it on kosher DVD.
