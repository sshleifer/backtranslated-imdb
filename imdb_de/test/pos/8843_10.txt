This is one of the most outstanding horror movies I have ever seen in my life. Forget the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies. John Carpenter as has a tour de force horror epic with superb special effects, great performances by Kurt Russell and Co., and a great soundtrack that will haunt you forever! The best thing about this movie after 17 years is that it's not dated. It looks fresh and new and you do not get many movies like this. In 1982 there were against E.T. and of course it faded and was a cash bomb. Over the years THE THING has become a cult evolving from video and TV sales and as many new fans. In the end, this movie comes in the ass and for me it is never losing, the pants deters from you and for me a horror movie. Long live John Carpenter !!
