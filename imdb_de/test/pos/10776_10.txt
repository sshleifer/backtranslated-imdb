This is a movie about passion. The passion it represents is largely misguided even for the leading man. Therein lies the incredible power of this film: it shows us that what we believe can be contaminated by nonsense and even lead to doing things that are destructive - to us or to others. In addition, those who try to escape the passion (watch the drugstore that visits the studio) risk self-destruction. The world needs to hear the message of this movie more often.
