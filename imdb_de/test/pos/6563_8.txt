Wow ... I just saw this movie on the Sundance Channel, and it's really bizarre. Although I'm not a movie expert, it's probably the most bizarre movie I've ever seen as an average movie fanatic. Whoever had thought of it had a great imagination. I'm a little fan of Japanese dramas and there are often actors in drama films. (Matsushima Nanako, for example, the main character in Ringu, is a great J-drama star.) But it does look like the first movie for Kirie and Shuichi's actors. I have to say, if they really make their debut here, they are doing a pretty good job. Kirie was a very likeable character that I had an easy time with. She was good-natured and kindhearted, perhaps not the most popular girl, but nicer than some of the other eye-catching girls. She was also pretty in a classic way. I hope she makes more films, but it's been a couple of years, maybe she has no such plans. <br /> <br /> The end was strange. I will not reveal anything, but the rest of the bizarreness of the movie was somehow ashamed. <br /> <br /> Very bizarre, but very imaginative and unique movie. I would recommend it to Japanese horror fans, though I warn you, it's a lot more bizarre than Ringu. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I would give for originality, imagination 7.5 out of 10 points, good characterization, above average action and just fascinating.
