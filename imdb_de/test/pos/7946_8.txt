Many accuse Rod Steiger of playing exaggeratedly, and anyone who has seen Amityville Horror and the "Flying" section will find it hard to say anything else. That means he's brilliant in that regard. <br /> <br /> It's never on TV, you can not buy it on DVD (legit). In 1988, when Channel 4 still had a recipe for innovation, they showed it under a small amalgam of 1960s films, Privilege, etc. - and I remember a substantially theatrical experience that was well translated into the movie. The great thing about the theater is that it's included - how do you make it available on the screen and interesting? PH is almost done. Since this kind of movie is never to be found on cable or Sky TV channels, it's difficult to start a debate, but for anyone who has seen or remembers it, my memories of a straightforward, almost shrill performance by Sally Geeson Everyone has taken care of it "(she renounces almost unruly general performances of her and her siblings in many early 70s), she says. There are several of them - important lines that you remember years, decades later. That's the strength of a movie like this one. <br /> <br /> PS: I just saw him again and I'm just as good. One day, the television will also be lit.
