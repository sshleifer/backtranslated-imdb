Kane is a murderer named Jacob Goodnight. He lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight juvenile convicts carry out cleaning work. Most of them die down to three. In my case it was not the best typeface or the best one ever. I still thought that the killer scenes were done really well. Like when a girl is eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be, as he pushed the phone into the mouth of the blonde. Kane was a really big horror movie actor, he had taken the whole movie so seriously and would never change. That was his only look the whole movie. Great action and deadly scenes, I do not think I could give a full 10 out of 10, but 6 seems to be good.
