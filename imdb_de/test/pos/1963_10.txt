I have just seen this movie for the second time. I first saw it as a Vanguard video selection in the mid-90s. It has retained its power. <br /> <br /> It is interesting from different points of view. For one, it is based on a true story. Second, it's a launch pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And thirdly, Dennis Hopper has one of his better social misunderstanding / psychotic roles. <br /> <br /> The film is also a study of the way people act in different environments. They have characters in one-to-one conversations, in the family, in peers, in school, in general attitudes of society, etc. History shows itself very well in showing how a person behaves in any environment Find the details of the actual murder to compare him to the movie. I've seen a short piece of evidence suggesting that it happened in California and that several classmates wanted to see the body. <br /> <br /> This is a good choice for a rainy video rental. Be prepared to feel insecure in the end.
