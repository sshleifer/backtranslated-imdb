I was born in 68 with little parental guidance, which I saw on TV (as a kid in the 70s). I've always loved this movie (and the French Connection), and I'd always try to catch it whenever it's running (look at the Sunday TV Guide). I bought it a couple of years ago on DVD and have watched it twice since, and I have to say, I still love it !!!! Roy S. was a great 1970s actor (Jaws is one of my absolute favorites, Marathon Man, etc.) and although the 7-ups are not an Oscar-worthy movie, that puts you in the very early days of the 1970s Years, just like French Connection) and gives you some hard characters and insight into life as a police officer at that time. And yes, the chase is one of the best times ever.
