A SUPERMAN cartoon. <br /> <br /> As America unveils its colossal new bomber, JAPOTEURS, an elite of Japanese spies and saboteurs, is slamming. Steal the giants, with intrepid reporter Lois Lane on board, and the goal of either Tokyo or the destruction. It's time for Superman to get involved with Max Fleischer for Paramount Studio. They offer great animations and tight, fast-moving charts. They are to be screened in cinemas and are far ahead of their colleagues at Saturday Morning. Bud Collyer is the voice of Superman. Joan Alexander is making the honor for Lois Lane.
