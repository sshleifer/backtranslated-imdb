This was an interesting movie ... half comedy, half political thriller. It had many good elements, though it was a bit predictable. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams Stars is Tom Dobbs, a popular comedian with a hit show in which he gives political comments. Think daily with John Stuart. While recording one of his shows, a woman in the audience says he should apply for the president. This, followed by some serious jokes, was all it took to get the ball rolling and start Dobbs' political career. <br /> <br /> He runs independently and opposes both Democrats and Republicans alike. It is straightforward and honest and is becoming more popular - but perhaps not popular enough to actually win. He is clearly the outsider in this election. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a corrupt software company has developed a program that makes voting easier and simpler for ordinary people - but there is a disruption. The glitch is discovered by a young lady named Elanor (Linnley), who is placated by the software developer with the lie that he has fixed the glitch before the upcoming election. <br /> <br /> It's an election day and Dobbs is declared the winner. (Big surprise!) Elanor knows that he is not really the president - he did not legitimize. - She decides to inform the President ... but complications occur. Her society went so far as to poison her to silence her. Besides, she likes Dobbs fast. <br /> <br /> The story takes a few twists and turns before coming to an easily predictable conclusion. But it never got boring. Robin was great as always and Christopher Walken often stole the show as Dobbs's manager, who became a political advisor and best friend. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie and it has a good message. I recommend it if you are in the mood for dark satire or something that makes you think. Overall, I give a 7/10.
