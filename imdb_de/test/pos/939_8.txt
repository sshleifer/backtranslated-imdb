Brilliant Aussie movie ... A little slow in the beginning, but once it starts, you can not stop laughing. When I first saw the movie, I only vaguely knew the storyline, as I'm not sure that many people are aware that this film is based on a true story, especially the director and his mother (obviously names have changed). I only knew that the director is a friend of my family. When I saw the movie, my stepmother somehow kept it secret that we should meet Matthew Newton after the show ... Such a beautiful gentleman (apart from a particularly bad incident with his ex)! Brillian casting with Sam Neill and others! A good reason to continue to support the Australian film industry
