This movie is not as bad as some say, it's really accurate, I think it's more fun than the original. Maybe some people hate it so much because they do not want to admit that this is a good (not great) movie. <br /> <br /> Most, if not all, movies were made by CGI, which I did not mind at all. It was an enjoyable movie anyway. Phil Buckman - (Chris) was the best man in the movie in my opinion, Julie Delpy was pretty attractive, she brought the sexiness to the movie. <br /> <br /> There were many jokes in the movie that I thought were good. This movie is in my collection but the original is not because I do not like it like this one. I was not bored when I saw this movie watching me. Unlike some horror movies that I could mention, one could say that it is two say an alien waswolf movie that should be in the collection of people if they like werewolf movies, maybe someday I might get the original. I have only one complaint and this is Phil Buckman - (Chris) should have been more in there than he was, but otherwise the movie was fine. <br /> <br /> rating for this movie 8/10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst out there. <br /> <br />
