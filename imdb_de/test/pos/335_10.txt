A classic performance by Maniratnam and his team. You can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals because it has everything to call it a "classic of all time". The war and its effects in Sri Lanka through the eyes of a ten-year-old girl are all about the movie, but the scenes and circumstances will not be what you expect. No wonder he's one of the country's best actors, who can still add beauty and a unique identity to his role, and if he is perceived as a father to three kids, he really needs to be brave of his glamorous personality in the industry. The music of AR Rahman makes the film a special movie for those who love melodies. Especially the story and the way it is told make it the best movie of the last time.
