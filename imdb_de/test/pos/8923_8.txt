This is an excellent movie, full of complexity, themes and great dialogue. The characters are well drawn, with Phil the biggest loser of all time. Adam Haddrick's character is the most vicious thing I've seen since Alec Guinness 'portrayal of Adolf Hitler in' Hitler: The Last Ten Days. "<br /> <br /> I just wish they could all get away with it. But without giving too much away, there are some situations that you just can not lie to.
