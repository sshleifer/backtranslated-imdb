"Four Daughters," a sentimental story of a solid middle-class family of four sisters, was remarkable in one respect: Mickey Borden invades this romantic, idealized milieu? Dressed carefree, with an uncompromising attitude to all bourgeois values, does he really let the hearts of the sisters shine? His criticism is directed not only at him, but also at himself. <br /> <br /> One day Ann (Priscilla Lane) discovers him passionately playing the piano. "That's nice," she says? "It stinks," he answers? He falls in love with? and marry? Ann, but finally, when he realizes that their basic incompatibility leads the marriage to disaster, he takes the equally uncompromising step to bring about his fall. <br /> <br /> The role was excellently played by John Garfield, and it not only earned him fame, but also, perhaps more importantly, won his place in cinematic history as the screen's first rebel hero. <br /> Garfield was born in New York's eastern side of Russian immigrant parents and spent his youth as delinquents. However, he continued to question and reject some traditional values. He was occasionally suspended from the studio and kept a cynical view of Hollywood. At last he ended his career and his life as one of the victims of McCarthy's witch hunt. He was blacklisted by Hollywood for suspecting sympathy on the left, and friends claimed that a work ban contributed to the heart attack that killed him at the age of 39.
