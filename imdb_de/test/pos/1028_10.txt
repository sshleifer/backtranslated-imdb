>>> Good news, a BBC DVD release is scheduled for July 31, 2006 in the UK. In addition, a publication in the United States is planned. ! <<<<< br /> <br /> >>>> Here is my original comment <<<<<< br /> <br /> I agree with all the other reviewers - it's just amazing that one of the The biggest TV dramas have never been released on DVD. <br /> <br /> The plot is exciting - the acting is outstanding and the character development is captivating! <br /> <br /> Here in the UK, we have a pretty long history of posting TV series and movies with popular campaigns on DVD. <br /> <br /> It's very hard to understand why the rights holders are not in start a DVD production? I will e-mail one of the leading players in this grassroots movement and see what happens. Who made the production? Was it BBC? RW
