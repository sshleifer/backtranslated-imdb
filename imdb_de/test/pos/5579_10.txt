Well, how can I categorize Farscape without giving up superlatives? Ok, here it is! The scripts are awesome, and each episode offers so much entertainment, drama, humor and unrestricted playability. The casting is perfect, especially that of Zhaan (The Blue Lady), played by Virginia Hey, each character has a depth that is simply not present in the Star Trek series. <br /> <br /> I think I'm playing with an Australian spin The show does it for me, Australia has thrown quality films for years and Farscape is no exception. <br /> <br /> I have only seen the first four episodes in the UK and they have a quality that gives each 45 Minute Show (in the UK) stand out more from a movie than from a weekly TV series. <br /> <br /> The episode that really makes it to me is "I, ET," which turns the alien concept where Moya (a living ship, even the spacecraft has a great character) land on a planet that needs to make the first contact and is surprisingly earthy and Crichton hits a radio telescope operator and * he * the little green man is' to them. Exciting stuff. <br/> <br /> In short, the effects are great, the scripts are of the highest quality and the main characters (none of them really more important than others) are interesting, not always 'good' and well, just excellent. <br /> <br /> Roll on the second season!
