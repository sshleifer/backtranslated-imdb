After a long wait, "Bedrooms and Corridors" made it to Perth's cinemas - and that was not a commercial mind - and I found it funny, honest and took a look at these 'tribal scream' groups that were running around to catch up Looking for stones and "what's behind my eyes". It plays here full houses because it tells a story, acts actorically and says something about the human condition.
