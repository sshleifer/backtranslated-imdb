Good Movie, the acting was great, especially by Eriq Ebouaney (Lumumba) and very well directed. It also shows how Lumumba was cornered by the Belgians, the United States, and the United Nations, and how they scared him of being called "Communists", as they did to all honest, true African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. It shows how western countries preach democracy while still having something else in mind. It's a story of injustice, struggle and brutality. <br /> <br /> It shows that Lumumba was not able to control his people, they were his people, but before we blamed him, he was enough if any of the people in his government like Mobutu has appointed? Or his colleague had other things in mind to find out, go to the movie! Surely Mobutu has plundered the country for the next 35 years before being overthrown and leaving the country. Died a billionaire. <br /> <br /> Some shortcomings: There were too few explanations how the man (Lumumba) could even be resurrected. There should have been more explanations about the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly known as Zaire, when it was under Mobutu. There should have been an explanation why he (Lumumba) could not keep Africa's second largest country in one piece. And also what was going on with Chambe and Katanga. Only if you want to watch the movie, which was controlled by Tshombe, he controlled the Katanga region, which (if I am not mistaken) is the world's leading copper producer. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good movie. You will learn something new about Africa, its leaders and its people, and will probably open your eyes to why this continent is plagued by war.
