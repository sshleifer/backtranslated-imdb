What an original work. I've always loved Liev Schreiber as an actor, but now you have to value the man on a multi-dimensional level. How did he come to this sunflower field? If it was computerized, it looked real. And how do you suggest a dog that knows you will achieve that kind of performance? Does the academy have a category for animals? I think I say that I really enjoyed this bizarre, offbeat little indie movie. From the excellent cast (you would never know that Eugene Hutz was not a pro-actor) to the cinematographer (some nice shots), the music (bought the CD when leaving the theater) and of course the two "D's" (directing and the DOG). All in all a "10". <br /> <br /> /
