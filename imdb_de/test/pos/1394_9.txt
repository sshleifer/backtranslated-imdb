action-packed, with my favorite kind of guy. I will not give it away if you have not seen it, because it is worth sitting down and solving the mystery of the things presented in this movie. Sometimes it is slow, and those were the moments in which mine Wondrous minds that could easily be moved anyway, but humid of it, kept me quietly agitated, where you'd keep it in mind rather than letting it out, probably the mood I was in then. Effects and action sequences could excuse you for the occasional break feel. Of course there are a lot of films out there, just like here, the film still has its own style and style, which I respect from underground independent horror movies.
