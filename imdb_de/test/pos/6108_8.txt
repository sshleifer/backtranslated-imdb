Pink Flamingos: A Representation of the Past of the Society <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos, a film shot in 1972 by John Waters, is a very disturbing account of the negative impact a traumatized childhood can have on future life , Babs Johnson grew up in a very unusual home. Obviously, you can see the impact on society through their actions to the point where they devour dog waste. Was this film just a morbid and twisted perversion of endless, bitter events or was it a symbol of something deeper? Being on the first page would be the easiest way out, and the side with the latter might be crazy, but possibly true. The film has some credible similarities with the actual events of our social past. Any leader whom we humans consider "terrible" has characteristics similar to those of Babs Johnson. Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolph Hitler and Joseph Staling all had a "disturbing" childhood. Babs Johnson had a disturbing childhood and is therefore in the same class as all the other rulers mentioned before. Because of this, many of their actions throughout the movie can be distracting. Was her act her own fault or society because she made her grow as she did? In addition, each character in this movie represents either an earlier leader or an event. Another coincidence is the obsession of Edith with eggs. This can be open-minded with the genocide and Hitler's attempt to destroy the Jews. Some see Hitler as a genius, others as a madman. John Waters must have seen him as a crazy man because his portrayal of Edith was actually mentally ill. Edith's son Cracker and travel companion Cotton symbolize what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. Both names are colloquial expressions that represent a period that most of us would rather forget. These characters are crucial because they suggest that our society in America was sometimes no better than what we often regard as a vile act of social attacks in other cultures. The chicken kingdom is the epitome of what was wrong in our society at this time and is still wrong. Chicken, is a slang term for women from the 70s. Therefore, it may be possible that John Waters attempted to work out the issue of rape through the actions of Cotton and Crackers. The antagonist family was, if a single antagonist can be identified in this film, the marble family. Marble is often mentioned in connection with wealth. Therefore, this can symbolize the struggle between the poor and the wealthy, a struggle that continues to this day and is likely to last forever. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film for its disquieting scenes, but should also be noted for its disguised political agenda, which Waters in his entirety so benevolently presented.
