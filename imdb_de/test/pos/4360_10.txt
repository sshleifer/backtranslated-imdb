Wow, that's a touching story! First I saw "Rescue Dawn". I did not like it. And now I have seen the person, Dieter Dengler, who is told about this story by Herzog. Very impressive. Dieter is a driven man who encounters the most opposite emotions in his life on this planet. His story about the arrest by Patet Lao / Viet Cong and his suffering is frightening, but most impressive is his incredible will to survive. How could he find the strength? In a haunting way Dieter tells us in flowing phrases about his terrible ordeal during his captivity ... He is a great storyteller and Duke gives him the righteousness this brave man deserves "Little Dieter has to fly" says it all! Since nothing is left to the imagination, "Rescue Dawn" becomes a superfluous movie. The horror does not become more real than in the words of Dieter Dengler himself. He completely manages to paint the picture.
