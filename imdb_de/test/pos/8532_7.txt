The shooting is cheesy. Some of the actors have done too much. Some of the actions are not explained and inexplicable. But ... <br /> <br /> This film is in the nature of the psychological dramas of the 50s. <br /> <br /> It is a moral game. Similar to the movie in which a "Method" actor becomes the evil character he depicts on stage, Ed is forced to watch Slasher movies because he is the film editor. It gives him a nervous breakdown that leads to a complete psychotic break. <br /> <br />
