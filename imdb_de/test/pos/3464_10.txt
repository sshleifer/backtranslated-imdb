If you want a movie with all the emotions, look NO. dramatic and witty and scenes of rushing emotions; I can certainly guarantee that very few will be able to see this warm and VERY human movie without ever losing a tear. It's hard to believe that the two leads are trading. They would swear that the two young men really suffer from muscular dystrophy (Rory) and cerebral palsy (Michael). quite simply two of the FINEST performances I've ever seen; These are also two very credible characters, and you never have the feeling that things are "thrown in" or cause sympathy only for dramatic reasons. In the DVD version, they have "deleted scenes" (including an alternative end) as "extras" and an "extended party sequence". Why these clips were not included in the final movie is hard to understand because they are perfectly connected to the rest of the movie and are in no way superfluous. But I can warmly recommend this movie to everyone without reservation. one of the best I have ever seen.
