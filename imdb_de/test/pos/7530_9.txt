I just saw this movie and I have to say it surprised me. It was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at students from Japan in puppy love. <br /> <br /> The look and feel is very different from many movies and you can easily get involved in the movie. Much of the emphasis seems to be in the story itself, which is extremely subtle. The main theme and relationships with other characters are a bit complex. But the overall impression of realism and dimensions still attracts you. <br /> <br /> A major withdrawal are, of course, those who like something simple. Which is not here. You have to be open to many things, including a new culture, to immerse yourself in the movie. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie though. It is worth seeing.
