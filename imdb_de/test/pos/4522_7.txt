Chan is in New York, trying to sabotage a new aircraft design. <br /> <br /> The war was more than a year away from America, but World War II was already raging all over the world and so it stained everything as most people probably realized war was coming. The war is not mentioned here, but the fact that the film is at least concerned with the production of airplanes plays on it. The mystery itself is pretty good, the idea of ​​aircraft sabotage works well for some pretty tense moments. To be sure that we are talking about Charlie Chan, we can be sure that he will fight another day, but there is no guarantee of which situation he is in and not if anyone would survive around him. > I really like this movie a lot. It is not one of the nest and far from the worst. It's one of the really rare things, a really enjoyable one. Definitely worth a look or six.
