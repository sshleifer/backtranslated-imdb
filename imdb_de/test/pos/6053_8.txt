I was Corpsman on Parris Island in the late 1960's, just over 10 years after "The D.I." was shot. I was in some barracks where some of the interior shots were filmed. I knew many drill instructors and many recruits. I think the movie is as close as any other movie to show the life of a recruiter and a drill instructor. Without a doubt, I think it's the best thing Jack Webb ever did. If you were in the military, you have to watch this movie. It was like this. It shows how important it is to turn some raw recruits into men who are ready to defend our country. I found it fascinating that most characters are played by real marines, not actors.
