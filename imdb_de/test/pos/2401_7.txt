I saw the film in turns with tears and smiles. Anger penetrated me to see the ruins of Hanoi after the 12-day bombing raid. And if I live in the countryside with my parents living in Saigon for 50 years now, I realize we're feeling much better now, and it would have been better if the Americans had not brought a war here. As I watched the movie, I learned more about the different kinds of wars the US was planning in Vietnam and what catastrophes they caused. But I do not like that some people just give generic opinions, like the analyst at the end of the series. I forgot his name. <br /> <br /> There should also be more documentary images, such as living in the army camp of South Vietnam and the North (if possible). There's also a sudden change from 1972 to 1975 (I'm not sure if the split time was censored because I watched this series on TV).
