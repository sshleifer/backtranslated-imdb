I love this movie (do not know why it's called Pot Luck in England - what a trash and a completely irrelevant name!). I spent 8 months in Barcelona, ​​not as an Erasmus student, but lived with other foreigners together. It brings back so many great memories of the fun with all my friends from different countries and the city itself. I really want to see the episode 'Les Poupees Russes' (the Russian dolls). I suspect it will not be published here. My brother saw it in France and said that it was not so good, but had many of the same cast (Wendy's brother apparently marries). Does anyone know something about this movie? and whether it may be published?
