Lady and the Tramp II is very colorfully animated and the songs, especially the Junkyard Dogs, are pretty good. However, the family seems even too idyllic, and I can not help but understand that Scamp is dissatisfied when everything is forbidden. I also feel sorry for Angel, who has never had a loving family until she meets Jim and his darling. In any case, it's clear that the original lady and the tramp are better than this sequel.
