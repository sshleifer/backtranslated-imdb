Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the movie does not nearly match the quality of the TV show, it is still very funny and has some really bad moments! I loved Ali G since I saw the material of the show for the first time. I think he is one of the best comedy characters of all time. With Peter Dragon ("Action") and the Blues Brothers. The biggest surprise with this movie was that they have some serious actors (Dance and Gambon). After that I will respect them even more, to have the good sense to take advantage of this opportunity. I can not say anything really bad about this movie, it's very funny. Very young, but hey, so what? <br /> <br /> something to mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE! <br /> <br /> **** / *****
