I am sorry to say that many people considered it low. The series started very well and after the first season it was not so good. People tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at it in the end. That's not good, you should look at the grand total, not the bottom line. It's sad that many of the "usual" characters have died, but damn, we had a lot of nice NEW characters. the plot. Please understand that I did not like it when Boone died when Augur died, but well ... it has to be done. Can you imagine that everyone will live on the whole series if he is in constant danger? Come on, imagine, if they did not die, they would be invincible. In this way you will always maintain the tension, will he survive, will he die? I realize that people attach to characters, so do I. My favorite character was Augur, who could reach any computer he wanted. He was the one who was secretive, he could do things with the computer that nobody else could do. I would like to make a statement to all those who have voted negatively so low a rating? Should we look at the last season instead of the grand total? Should not we see how good the show was when it started? Should not we see how much we liked it?
