I just saw this movie this morning and loved the great wealth of faith. Babette gave them a different view of life; not a substitute, but an improvement. She shared everything she had with those who gave her little. I see the story of God here. He sent his only son to the people. Man could not possibly give something that would be the same. Therefore, we receive an ultimate treasure for our little sacrifice and are therefore transformed. In this film, the quarrelsome citizens of the city have consumed themselves with a little interpretation of God. Babette has shown them that life and God can indeed be beautiful in the best sense of the word. The love God's Son has shown to people is the love we should show each other and our lives will be all the richer. Even the movie is a metaphor. At first it seems slow, but the investment of time and attention to detail will be rewarded in the end. It was really a celebration.
