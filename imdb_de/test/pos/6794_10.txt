This movie is timeless and would probably appeal to children today, even though the whole thing is not a Jedi. Of course, Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful kid in the world and her acting is great as well. Even Mickey Rooney is good; So are Anne Revere and Angela Lansbury. When this movie was released, the world was a different place, and it's certainly a great place to visit.
