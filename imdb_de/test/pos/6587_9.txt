Before I saw this movie, I heard a lot of praise and a lot of exclamations about how "horrible" it was. In order not to take credit for this film, I think it was not so terrible or even shocking. It's just a movie about people who live on the dark side of the city. And a good one, when it comes to presenting the point. <br /> <br /> There is great acting and a well thought-out manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a renowned writer on the Finnish film scene, and he is the best at describing contemporary Finnish culture (although he is not the sole author of this film, but I dare say that he is still the lead author.) Correct Me if I'm wrong). <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, except for Jasper Pääkkönen (the pseudo-main character that I think should have stayed in the soap opera scene) and the sets, cuts and sounds are also very well done and give this movie a great atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This film is a story about loosely connected sad destinies, which according to the famous song of a famous Finnish band (Eppu Normaalis "Tuhansien") Murielist Laulujen Maa ", which VERY roughly translates into" Paha Maa " It is the side of Finnish everyday life that 80% of the population does not have any awareness of unless it is Finnish society, leading to a sad, dark ending, accompanied by alcohol, loneliness and bad choices , films like this are being made.
