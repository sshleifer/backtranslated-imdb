If you know something about the Manhattan Project, you'll find "Fat Man and Little Boy" at least an interesting account of the events surrounding this story. The film is in all respects a very realistic account of these events and in many ways it is almost too real (eg scenes with radiation poisoning). As always, Paul Newman is brilliant in his role and always manages to show himself like a real person on screen. The minor cast such as John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia and Natasha Richardson is also quite good. However, this film is not one of the best examples to turn a true story into a movie. Great movies can record a true story and use only enough artistic license to excite the audience for the entire movie. However, this scene tends to go through a bit, and some scenes (like the love story of John Cusack and Natasha Richardson) could have been completely eliminated without the movie losing much. Still, there are enough interesting facts and tiny funny pieces to interest the audience enough to see the entire movie. It's not always entertaining, but as far as great portrayals are concerned, that's very accurate, intriguing and will give the audience something to think about. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
