Sleeper Cell is what 24 should have been. 24 is a cartoon. (I look at 24, but feel cheated with every stupid episode, every four or five seasons.) Who can keep track because they're all the same Jack gets in trouble, Jack gets into trouble and then instantly gets back into it Trouble then ...) Sleeper Cell is really well done and far superior. Unfortunately, they did it by the end of the second season. I can imagine a half-dozen better end of my head that would have been better for the author's obvious goals and not so well done. Too bad for the authors that they destroyed the end of a really good series.
