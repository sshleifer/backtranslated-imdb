If you want your movies to pull your emotions out of you, if you like your films with a man you can admire and connect with? If you like your movies in black and white you need to watch this movie! Watch it from start to finish because you do not want to miss a beat. Sometimes it's slow, and you wonder when something will happen. When the story begins to unfold, you are on the edge of the seat! I know I was! My mother told me about this movie because our family had some of the same things as the movie. We loved Frankie, who convincingly plays the lead role. Whatever you think about Frank Sinatra, in the movie he is thin and does not sing, so stay open. For the time it was made, it tells a story that is still told in homes across the nation and possibly the world. Please, look, if you like older movies, give it a try.
