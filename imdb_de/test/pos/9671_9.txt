Seth McFarlane is a true genius. He has created a show that is witty, culturally sharp and downright hilarious. <br /> <br /> For those who think their "offensive" approach to social or cultural issues does not make a meaningful comment that can only cause "attacks" refer to this quote: <br /> <br /> Peter (comes from the stem cell lab): how long was I in there? // Guard: Five minutes. Peter: Why do not we finance that? <br /> <br /> Why, indeed. <br /> <br /> Many thanks to the family that she is not only the funniest show on TV (with the possible) except for the beloved, much missed Futurama), but also that he is quite smart.
