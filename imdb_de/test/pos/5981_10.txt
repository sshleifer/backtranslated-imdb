This is one of the very few films that are so overwhelming that it is unlikely that you will see it more than once or twice in your life (other examples are Claude Lanzmann's documentary Shoah and Come and See by the husband of the director, Elem Klimov - which covers almost the same unbearable territory, but in a very different way). <br /> <br /> I suppose this is just as good as it is difficult to ever see a pressure. <br /> <br /> Apparently it is extremely open. Christian symbolism and the admission that there were active Russian collaborators made sure that this was hardly ever seen in the USSR - and of course, post-Soviet Russia has very little Interest in films from this period. <br /> <br /> Uniquely I saw it in London in a festival of Russian films from the Glasnost era (probably around 1988) - although it has been shown several times in the UK lately, there must be at least one subtitle print here , <Br /> <br /> As far as I know, it has never been published in t If you have not seen it, your best chance is likely to join a film company and nag them endlessly to find a trigger and show it off ,
