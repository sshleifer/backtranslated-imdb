I've never posted anything here, but after seeing Noroi, I just had the feeling of writing down my thoughts about it. <br /> <br /> First, do not compare that to Blair Witch, this movie deserves much more than that! In short, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!). <br /> <br /> I really liked how the film does not present itself as a standard horror movie, but as a documentary filmed by a reporter (I think so?) called Kobayashi and his cameraman. Without spoiling too much of the conspiracy, I can say that it starts with Kobayashi exploring a series of seemingly incoherent events that connect with something far darker and more sinister. <br /> <br /> The story may not be so original in itself, what really fascinated Noroi was the incredibly weird atmosphere. If you are looking for cheap anxiety and sitting-jump scenes, this movie may not be for you. This film is all about the mood he presents with haunting images and a sense of foreboding. The documentary filming only makes the farm more credible. <br /> <br /> This is also greatly helped by the acting, which is great, although it is not perfect for the general part of the movie! Far better than most other films in this genre. <br /> <br /> Well, I can highly recommend Noroi, it's exciting, scary, well played and the first movie that has scared me for ages.
