All I can say after watching the first season DVDs is that I can not believe that NBC has "greened" this show. It's so different from what's currently fashionable, except for Lost. Who misses the X-Files may have a worthy successor. Not as mysterious or intense as Lost, I find it more entertaining overall. <br /> <br /> This kind of extended story is hard to make. I mean, it could become a childish dribble if most elements do not belong together. But I think the cast is excellent, the writing is spicy, the location and props first class and the special effects for a TV budget very good. Sure, it pushes what's plausible, but it never gets so stupid that it insults your intelligence. I doubt it's going to be a classic runtime like X-Files, but in the meantime, I recommend buying the DVD if you missed it the way it did the first time. This fall, my shows have definitely increased by another series! <br /> <br /> PS: I just heard that it was stopped by NBC.
