What a great show! A very underrated dramatic show. It's great that there are no main characters, and in each episode, other characters are the main characters. I think the best character in the series is Vern Schillinger. He is a tough, bad guy and moreover an Aryan, which makes him a true villain, of whom there are many who are known to be. This show has many murders, I think it's a little over the top for the murder on the show, but I have to admit that this is one of the reasons why I think the show is so great early, but some made sure still noticeable. You can not compare things like Prison Break with this show, they are totally different. I think some of the actors in the show are also very good and undervalued and should be able to deduce what's behind them. A great show, my favorite. A show that should be considered by the greats for the next few years.
