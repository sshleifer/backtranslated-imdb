This movie is undoubtedly one of the biggest milestones in the history of cinema. Looking back on this film, we can only retrospectively conclude that 1950s world cinema had a purely humanistic dramaturgy, a sound and appropriate use of sound-image montage, and almost religious admiration of ethical decisions in human life. Cinema was not just an art form. It was much higher than normal life and there were many people hoping to live after the tragic war. It is said that even Picasso moved and cried that such a work of art can only appear once in 100 years! At that time, the audience was different too. I read that after watching Kurosawa's "Ikiru (Live)" in his first release, the young couple quietly said, "It's a good movie, right?" I think that contemporary cinema, although technically developed and has opened a new narrative perspective, has lost the most important audience confidence people hope and ideals. In this regard, "Letyat zhuravli" as a classic of all time as "City Light", "Ikiru" and "La Strada" must stand in the pantheon of the classics.
