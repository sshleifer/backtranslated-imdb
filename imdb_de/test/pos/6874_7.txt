An almost wonderful mix of comedy, romance, and medical chaos has a 50-year-old swinging, single doctor tired of making concerts with nubile airheads, dating a patient of his age whom he met on his rounds. The screenplay by Julius Epstein shows some sophistication, though he does not have enough material to fill in the last third of the image, and one can almost feel the film slipping. The subplot about the hospital, which is being investigated for its modest business affairs, is not satisfactorily worked out, and it feels ridiculous anyway. Nevertheless, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are a fantastic team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney are very funny in support. Director Howard Zieff makes everyone sit up and even if Epstein's one-liners refuse Neil Simon, Zieff happily moves with them. The results are dry and sometimes very sweet. Followed by a failed TV series. *** from ****
