I do not understand why this show did not continue. There could have been several ways to continue the Darwin and Farik line after the second season. Obviously, Darwin could not have been the UC agent infiltrating cells and sabotaging them inside, but still they should have given this show at least one more season. <br /> <br /> The show is well-attended, credible and looks at the Islamic religion both from a normal and an extremist perspective. It touches controversial topics in detail and has a dramatic meaning that can be said of a few shows these days. I'm really sad that I did not know about this show until the end of 2007.
