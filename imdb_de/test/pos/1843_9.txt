Especially considering that I can count on the romantic comedy films I've ever enjoyed. Minnie Driver is very good as a heart transplant patient who has a mysterious connection to Duchovny's recently deceased wife. (I can imagine several horrible films using this story - I think there was an LMN movie with Jane Seymour.) However, this film is a guardian. <br /> <br /> Duchovny is sympathetic and the scenes with his dog are sweet and sad - the dog misses his deceased wife. All his friends want him to find a replacement, and there's an amusing scene where he has blind dates and Driver is the waitress. His date is terrible and he is fascinated by Minnie Driver. Carroll O'Connor is also well suited in one of his final roles, as the curmudgeonly grandfather. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi (this is the only movie I liked) complete the comedic aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie because the story works and is not too romantic. and does not offend the intelligence of the audience. Highly recommended 9/10.
