I love Aaron Carter, but I even expected Popstar to be predictable, but I was so wrong! Aaron Carter was really fun in it and a great actor! Even the actress who played Jane was a brilliant actress! Everyone I have not seen loved it! <br /> <br /> The music in it was really good too! <br /> <br /> The movie's favorite lines are "You can not send me." I am a CELEBRIDEE !! "and" Take your time, it comes to you! "<br /> <br /> Although the ends are somehow cheesy, all the good chick flicks do it! This movie is great and a really good chick movie, I can watch me again and again!
