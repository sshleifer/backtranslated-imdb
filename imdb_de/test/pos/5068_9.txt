Very good political thriller on the consequences of terrorism and the use of political torture to achieve its goals in flushing out the terrorists. The story is interwoven, where two families are affected by the terrorist events /> <br /> This is one of the best roles of Meryl Streep for years. She plays a cold, calculating, sly director of the CIA who allows these things. She is from the George Bush-Dick Cheney School, which manages the war on terrorism. Had her role been expanded, Miss Streep would certainly have received an Oscar award. Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. A CIA agent who really does not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> We have a terrorist who has a heart and at a fine pace saves his life in this well-directed film br /> Alan Arkin briefly appears in the role of a convening senator. Mr. Arkin seems to get better with age.
