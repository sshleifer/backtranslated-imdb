This is a movie that needs to be linked. It should not be seen unless you've seen the first two movies, but the kind of people who watch this movie will probably own the box or at least know someone who does. And you should not expect Blade Runner. The budget of the films is not so far, and it's a much crazier way. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the film is a sci-fi set that will be shot in the future by Yokohama (shot in Hong Kong, obviously) about a society where it is forbidden to reproduce. Sho Aikawa plays a similar role in Dead or Alive 2 and Riki Takeuchi is a birth control detective. Takashi Miike can not tell you all of his reasons on a record, but one can assume that the law on reproduction (enforced by giving people the pill) is due to overpopulation, increased life expectancy, and so on. Interestingly, the dialogues in the film are mostly Cantonese, while Sho and Riki (who play their roles brilliantly, as they always do) speak Japanese and some just English. People have criticized the English as wooden, but I found no problems with it. Another person also found the homosexuality issues throughout the movie offensive; said Takashi Miike was anti-gay. He may be very good (and not all artists have to be left), but I can not see this movie as an insult to homosexuals. He merely recalls philosophies of ancient Greece when homosexuality or bisexuality occurred more frequently. The film contains similar elements of action-packed and poignant moments like DoA 2, though the action in this film is more martial arts based and executed in a very good Hong Kong style. The film's cinematography is very beautiful for the eyes, with symmetrical settings, good color control to give the air a dirty look, and it's nice to see uncut, long shots that are so rare in Hollywood these days. Basically, there is a lot to like in this film: humor, exciting action and some very nice moments. It's a great end to the series. You might criticize being a bit cheesy, but is not that part of the charm?
