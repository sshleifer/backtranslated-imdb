I loved this movie if you did not take it too seriously. Sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all her greatness and laugh as the monks go to Boston, MA. I also think that this movie has a great message about self control and inner strength. Plus Mr. Myagi was so cute, I wish he would teach me karate!
