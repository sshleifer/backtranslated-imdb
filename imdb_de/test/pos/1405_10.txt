A cheeky, selfish Army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous attitude towards the corps. <br /> <br /> William Haines excels in a highly gratifying honorary story & friendship in a role that he has obviously created for him. Haines, a scene A stealer in the first half of the film, has his usual behavior of Silly Billy, who should have kept him in the guardhouse under normal circumstances. The latter half, however, becomes very serious, leading to Haines moral salvation and giving him a good opportunity to show off his acting talents. Unless WEST POINT reaches the caliber of Haines earlier TELL IT TO THE MARINES (1926), this is undoubtedly due to the lack of Costar charisma and the quality of Lon Chaney's interaction with Haines. However, this tribute to the army is a very effective conversation and should be appreciated on its own merit. Joan Crawford appears as a love interest of Haines and plays the virgin daughter of the local innkeeper. Joan is pert and pretty and shines especially in her first scenes when she meets Haines on a Hudson River ferry and is exposed to his usual immature antics. Haines & Crawford made five silent films and were enormous friends for life. He was the much larger celebrity at the time and gave her many clues to get ahead in Hollywood. In the early thirties she herself was a superstar. After an outbreak of MGM in 1932, she set off on her interior design career. The little William Bakewell is cast as a plebe that idolizes Haines; In fact, their relationship is more of a sentimental treatment than Haines & Crawford's. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed in full cooperation with the War Department. Extensive filming at the academy at the academy adds enormously to the ambiance of the production, which was rated by MGM with outstanding production values. <br/> <br /> WEST POINT has recently been restored and given a new score by David Davidson.
