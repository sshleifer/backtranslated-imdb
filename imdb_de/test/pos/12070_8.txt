This is not a great movie, because the cast (especially the kids) miraculously helps this sad but fictitious storyline, cliché-filled with cliché. Poor family in mid-50s, dying mother, alcoholic father, 10 children (1 having epilepsy) and make a terrible decision. It is very easy to see and some children appear to move without being sick or naff. And little Frank and Warren steal the show for me with the last scene and make me roar no matter how many times I see it. A great rainy afternoon movie that I can recommend to anyone. Only those with the hardest heart could not be touched by it. Not comparable to Sophie's Choice, but a good TV movie!
