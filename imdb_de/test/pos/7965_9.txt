I was very happy and at the same time very surprised by other positive comments written by non-Koreans below. This movie is amazingly exciting and shows a very sad but warm view of life, as is typical for Koreans. I thought other foreigners would not understand this tender feeling and underestimate the quiet film as boring, but I was wrong. The attraction of this film should also be difficult for foreigners to avoid. (Even without subtitles ...) <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some points that others have overlooked. Of course, this movie shows the love between a man and a woman. The real topic, however, is far beyond. In fact, it's about time, the value of memory, and death. This film does not focus on the "love affair" between two people. As some point out, they do not kiss, they do not embrace each other without holding hands. Love itself is not completed (positive or negative) in the film. What haunts Jungwon (a leading actor) is rather his imminent death. He's running out of time, he can not hold her and leaves a few back, including his father and of course Darim (a mermaid). So the problem is how to face death and leave something precious in his short life, not how to fall in love with Darim. <br /> <br /> This kind of topic sounds very familiar to us. There are many films about patients with incurable diseases such as "Love Story". However, what makes this film outstanding is the way Jungwon deals with his death. He's a loser, but he tried to do his best while living in a quiet way. He does not tell anyone around him about his death. He hides something in his head, but without rage, hatred, revenge. He was just trying to do the best while he lives. This limited communication and obedience to fate is the typical way of thinking of Koreans and the point that most people in the West do not understand or at best convey misunderstandings. <br /> <br /> This theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film (surprisingly his debut). Some say that he was heavily influenced by Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro, who led Tokyo Story. I remember reading in a magazine that the director himself admitted that he was influenced by Ozu. I am not well informed to analyze his style compared to Ozu, but they have some similarities and some do not. Low angles and static camera remind us especially of Ozu style. In terms of the subject, however, this Korean director seems to have a warmer and more hopeful vision. <br /> <br /> It's short of Jungwon's last photo. Very well done and really heartbreaking scene, I think. Actually, the director had the idea for this film when he attended the funeral of a very famous Korean folk singer, who died young at a mysterious suicide. They say he saw the singer's photograph at the funeral and thought of a movie about death and remembrance. (And maybe hope for the remains, I think ...) <br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie to anyone who has a deep interest in film art and Korean culture. In my opinion, this film can compete with other films like Tokyo Story and a kind of American Beauty. It's so great when there is no language barrier. The DVD version will hit the market in February so it can be of little help to foreigners with English subtitles.
