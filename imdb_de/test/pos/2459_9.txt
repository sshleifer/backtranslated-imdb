<br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful piece HOMEFRONT and turns it into an appealing movie. <br /> <br /> THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally strong cast - everyone seems to get deeply involved with their characters. The spectacle here is TOP NOTCH! <br /> <br /> Credit also has to go to director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were extremely smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were daunting and effectively added to the tension. <br /> <br /> Remove all elements of Vietnam from history, and yet would be interesting characters who deal with the good and evil of the two full family dynamics. (An observer could see this point more clearly if he had the "discover the old photo" scene in mind from the beginning while watching the rest of the movie.) As a movie, I found THE WAR AT HOME to be more direct and to the point Being born on the 4th of July. A fine effort - almost a tenth. <br /> <br />
