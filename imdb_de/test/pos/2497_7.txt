"The Love Letter" is a somewhat pleasant, very restrained romantic comedy in which the use of just the right words in a mysterious love letter releases the secret passions and longings of the inhabitants of a sleepy coastal town. > <br /> It's not for every audience. I think "The Love Letter" benefits from its simple and quiet tone. Never deliberately crazy and fake like most romantic comedies, it's quaint, quaint and comfortable. For exactly the same reasons, however, many viewers will be bored and disinterested. <br /> <br /> The cast is nice. It's great to see Tom Selleck again, and he's such a playful role. And it's hard to believe that this is the same Kate Capshaw we met 15 years ago in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Death. She is naturally well here; I've improved in every role I've seen her since rubbing Indy's nerves. And is it possible that Capshaw gets more beautiful and beautiful with age? (What is this Spielberg !?) <br /> <br /> It's not worth much; but after another loud summer movie season, I'll probably look back with a quick fondness for this feather-fire romance.
