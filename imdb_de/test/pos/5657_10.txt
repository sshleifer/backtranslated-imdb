This is one of the most traditional war movies I have ever seen. Instead of the typical films that emphasize fame and perhaps superhuman characters (like John Wayne), this movie is just the opposite - it emphasizes the de-humanization that also happens in war. The story is about the Japanese who stranded after the return of the United States in late 1944 and early 1945 in the Philippines. At the beginning of the film, the Japanese were clearly beaten, but due to the crazy logic of Bushido, they can not afford to think about surrender. In one of many poignant moments, the lead actor is told to report to the hospital at the beginning of the film because he is unable to fight because of his TB. The problem is that the hospital does not accept him, so his commander urges him to go to the hospital again - and if they do not accept him, he should blow himself up with a grenade! Well, that only happens in the first five minutes of the movie - there are much worse things for this soldier and the few latecomers because they do not surrender. In addition, there is a case in the film in which a soldier tries to surrender but is shot down. This happened much later in the war, because the capitulating Japanese soldiers were so often in the air as they approached. In addition, the film shows the most vivid portrayal of the hunger and accompanying insanity of every movie I've seen. In addition, cannibalism, cowardice and betrayal accompany this very stubborn, realistic and depressing realistic movie. They simply could not have done a better movie of this kind. Terrible, but great.
