I am so happy not to live in a small American town. Because when I'm shown in a small town in the United States, it's populated with all sorts of monsters, among which meat-hungry zombies, evil aliens, and sinister ghosts are the most innocent. In this film, a former doctor who has just spent time caring for his wife by accident in a car accident directs his steps to the next small town - he has never seen a blow over any small towns in his life - what happened to those Purgatory Flats. And of course hell breaks loose as soon as it gets there. He meets a blond chick that most closely resembles a cow of all creatures, both in facial expression and in brain function, and instantly falls in love with it. But there's a tiny handicap, she's already married to a very small drug dealer who shoots himself pathetic in a minute, not dead. To know what's coming out, you should watch the movie for yourself. I'm just telling you that it reminds you of U Stone Stone's U Turn, but is a downtrend in all artistic traits.
