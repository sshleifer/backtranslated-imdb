This movie, one of the best I've ever seen, speaks of incommunicability. It plunges into a lively Taipei, stained in cold colors, where the rain falls incessantly; a DAMP world. It shows us the story of two people living in this world, a man and a woman. A coincidence or fate connects their existences, but they can not open themselves with words. Characters reflect the difficulty of our society in relation to interpersonal relationships. An incommunication, which is brought here to the extreme limits. All characters exchange only a few words during the film, dialogues are almost non-existent, and when some words are spoken, they are often weak and empty, far from the real feelings of the people. The progression of the story, the revelation of the character's feelings (brilliant idea!) Is developed through the musical distractions that are only seemingly meaningless and that spray the film. The progression of the sentimental event and the drama of the female protagonist lead us to a brilliant end, strongly symbolic. A film that differs from the usual, a clever implementation by a talented director. PS. Forgive me my bad grammar !!
