This one-man show is perhaps the most fantastic show I've ever seen. To call it simply an insurrection, it is a great injustice. There is a definite reason that this was a Broadway show. John Leguizamo is a master at making people of every culture feel at home, listening to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general. I would recommend this show to anyone as long as they can handle the language.
