I thought this was a very daring representation of the old, witty 'Tarzan' concept, which was made so popular by Hollywood, Weismuller and others. Yes; There is a lot of stupid stuff. But the idea is stupid. It is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be conceived by chimpanzees until adulthood. I'm tempted to say absolutely unbelievable, but the concept has never been tried. And for the comfort there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism. However, under the circumstances, I find that this would be very difficult to avoid. We now have a much better insight into the issue of acculturation and know that a human being educated without human behaviors from childhood would never learn it in adulthood. There is much to admire that is both imaginative and courageous , Lambert makes the beast with immense serenity. I'm tempted to say that this is the most compelling and likeable role I've seen. There are also many other outstanding achievements. Last but not least, these are Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm. <br /> <br /> What is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the perception of humans in humans. We almost see ourselves from the perspective of the poor, stupid, helpless beasts that we so routinely rule. And it shows well that the fake "civilization" and "morality" with which we veil and justify our behavior is nothing more than an expression of selfishness and arrogance. It may seem exaggerated at times, especially in the hideous museum segregation rooms, but what we see is not just a truth about the Victorians; It is a truth about the way we are today. It is one that needs to be said and can not be stated often enough. Holm's obsession with the "ray-zor" as a symptom of civilization-as if facial hair was a primitive state that should be despised-is a prime example of this. Primitive bearded readers take notice. <br /> <br /> The story is depressing. After all, it's a tragedy. For though he returns to the jungle and is free from moral tyranny, this is truly a human civilization. We know that he is doomed to failure. Before the third millennium is 50 years old, wild Simians will die out as bushmeat and develop their environment for agriculture and the exploitation of minerals to satisfy an insatiable human surplus over us. The path to extinction, which other monkeys tread, must finally be pursued by humans. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for his ethical attitude, despite the harsh moments.
