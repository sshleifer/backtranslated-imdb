As it turns out, Chris Farley and David Spade only made three films together ("Coneheads", "Tommy Boy" and "Black Sheep"), but this was really the "Citizen Kane" of their pairings. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the weak heir of an auto parts company. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires Richard Hayden (David Spade) to take care of him. Big Tom marries a "ten" (Bo Derek), so everything must be alright. After the sudden death of Big Tom, Tommy and Richard must try to sell half a million car parts to save the company from bankruptcy. From then on, the movie is a pretty excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best grandfather. He soon discovered that the characters of Bo Derek and Rob Lowe hid something. But you can completely ignore that and just let yourself be swayed in Chris Farley's antics. Nothing is sure about his stomach, and hell has no anger like his happy attitude. The scene in which he sets the cars on fire, and later the deer scene make for a pure laugh uprising. Chris Farley and David Spade were really the John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of their time. It is my pleasure to be able to think of "Fat Guy in a little coat" over and over again.
