Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show ever. They only aired the first two seasons in India, but I watched the rest on DVD or read online. It is very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist does not sneak around her mother's back, but has an open relationship with her. The chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel playing Lorelai and her daughter Rory is really great. The acting is excellent and the characters, though extremely quirky, are still believable. The residents of Stars Hollow display all the amusing bizarre small-town life that faces the endless snobbery and social norms that make up the high society life of Lorelai's parents. On the one hand there are dance-athletes and firelight festivals, on the other cotillions, DAR-meetings and cocktail-parties. All characters evolve a lot and there is a happy ending for more or less everyone. There are dramatic elements, but also very funny humor. Rory's friends are all incredibly hot, as is her friend Lane. Basically it's a cool, funny, very satisfying show that covers all aspects of life and makes you feel that if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you'll get what you want, even if that's not what it was They intend.
