For example, Udo Kier earns nine dollars and free food, so a win is in and of itself. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film tells a very interesting story about a group of salvagers stumbling upon the broken Demeter. I should warn you, I got around this report very quickly, so strap on. The important things first. Coolio plays a man named 187. 187 likes drugs. There's a bunch of caskets on board and ... now I do not know about the future, but maybe they're smuggling drugs into caskets. Do not tell Gunna, that was the craziest thing in this movie. Later, the vampire climbs out of his fog-filled coffin and then the actual joy begins. First, although this movie contains the word Dracula, it is not really in this movie. I have a theory. Out of the blue you can see the ship of the salvage crew without leaving. In my theory, Dracula was on board with his retarded brother Orlock. Dracula told Orlock he was right back. Dracula has damn well taken this movie out of the movie before he was seen leaving Orlock to play the vampire for the six or so minutes he's in the movie. The best part of this film, and for those of you who have seen this, you know what I say as a gunna after becoming a father, whatever. He has this huge monologue about ejaculating on different parts of Erika Elaniak's body and ... other super cool stuff. Coolio, seriously, you are the best thing ever. <br /> <br /> Something else is happening in this movie too. How Casper Van Dean gets work. Orlock screams a lot and loses his arm and then somehow we lose him for the rest of the movie. And thank god. We find out that Erika's character is a police officer. As the movie comes to an end, we find that the ship is on course to ramble into the sun. The police lot and another surviving character are doomed to failure. Instead of avoiding certain death, Erika's police bot reveals that she is also a whore bot and they decide to irritate and kill each other. Before they die in the sun, they die for no reason, that's right ... their ship blows up for no real reason. <br /> <br /> This movie received the amazing rating for a reason, Coolio. My God, if they were to award black rappers Academy Awards, he would be the first to get one. The only reason why there were no perfect ten is that there was not a drop of nakedness. Now I know what you think, how you can judge a movie by whether ladies show their merchandise or not. Well, easy. A movie like this pretty much requires it. It is part of the process. Gore, Gore, Monster, Nudity, Gore, End of the movie end shock at the end. It is the formula. This had some gage, the monster was fantastic because it sucked so hard that it actually did us the favor of staying away from the camera. That was considerate of him and I respect that. Nudity, not a drop, even though there was a long talk about ... see above statement and as far as the shock / twist is concerned ... I certainly did not see the end coming. That counts. <br /> <br /> I hope, Hollywood does not believe that Coolio has given this movie everything and has nothing left. He deserves more work. Well, until Dracula 4000 I'm out.
