I always knew the day would come. We all knew it. There is just so much oil in the ground, and one day we will be in short supply. But should not enough coal be available instead? And wind power or something. Things for future generations to worry about. <br /> <br /> Then this documentary hit me between the eyes. Oil makes the fertilizer, which is the reason for the first time in world history, almost no one on farms. When the inevitable oil shortage occurs, many things - air travel, many medicines, plastics, life in the suburbs - become impossible. But the craziest insight from the documentary is that oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that our lives have to change without it. Even if substitutes and preservatives are implemented immediately, they at best smooth our landing in a foreign post-oil world that (documentary claims) could start NOW. Despite their grim message, the documentary is often entertaining. It contains fabulous historical material (sober images of dark urban factories and fun stuff from the 1950s) that reminds us why we even moved to the suburbs. It also offers the hope that a massive effort that has now begun could both facilitate the transition from oil and make the world a better place. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the documentation is that they have no time with the mystery of why we find this stuff out now. How can this suddenly be a big emergency? We knew we should prepare for a world after oil in the 1970s - and we began to prepare for alternative energy research and smaller cars. If our failure to impose President Jimmy Carter's initiatives 25 years ago has condemned us to a hard landing in a post-oil world, why did not anyone shout in soapboxes about it? <br /> <br /> In the end I found the documentary very convincing; and it left me the terrible cold to be pulled out of a very beautiful dream. This is a must for anyone who is not afraid to face a very near future for which we still have time to do something. - Charles
