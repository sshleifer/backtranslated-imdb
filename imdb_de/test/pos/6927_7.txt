A ham actor without penny. Who is better than Michael Caine to play such a character? He is totally and totally funny, but as in most of his performances he does it that way. The movie seems to be a showcase for Dylan Moran, and he's great in his dual role with Caine. At this point, however, the script gets in the balance. Moran's imitations should have been taken in a more organic way. They are too much of an act in their own right and allow the plausibility of the plot to fly out of the window. Never mind. Get it, if you can find it. There is enough in it for a pleasant journey.
