It may be hard to explain how, but this movie is a masterpiece. Maybe because I could never imagine that an action like this or a movie with so few words would convey all that poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsessions. Bogard is amazing and it is needless to say that Venice is used as the perfect backdrop: dark, sunken and dreary like Bogard's soul. And classical music is more than a simple accompaniment to human emotions. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of European film production.
