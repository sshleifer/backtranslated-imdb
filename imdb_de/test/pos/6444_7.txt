I absolutely loved this movie as a kid. I can not find it anywhere! I mentioned it to some friends the other day, and not a single one remembers it! Can someone help me? My older sister vaguely remembers it. There was another movie I remember, half live action and half animation, but I can not remember the name. The characters were animated and the background was real ... I remember it was a kangaroo, and I think the location of the movie was in Australia. I try to get copies of these films, which were such an unforgettable part of my very beautiful childhood. Edit: I searched IMDb for this other movie and found out that it's called Dot and the Kangaroo! All I had to do was enter "kangaroo" in the search bar below the characters, and the name of the movie in the list was like a bell! MAN, I love IMDb! Many Thanks!
