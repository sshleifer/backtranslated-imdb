This is one of my favorites of all time. All actors do a great job. A comparison of this film with "Lawrence of Arabia" does not do justice to both films. "The Wind and the Lion" offers a much lower budget with fantastic actors representing heartwarming characters in a heartwarming atmosphere. Action and beautiful pictures are also available, which guarantees me a total of a favorite movie.
