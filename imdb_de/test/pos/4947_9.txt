Iron Eagle has long been one of my favorite movies. It looks like topgun, but with another plot and (many people will not agree with me here) I think it's better than topgun. <br /> <br /> This movie has some amazing dogfight scenes as the fighter jets zoom in through the air. It also has the queen song "One Vision" in the background, which in my opinion is a fantastic song. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Iron Eagle was very good, but the consequences were garbage. <Br /> <br />
