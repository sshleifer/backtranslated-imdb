The best - and that's pretty good - about The Black Castle is that it's a black and white Forties gothic grabber that contains a murderous Irrgray somehow made in 1952. The star is supposedly the British actor Richard Greene. a capable leader who reminds me of an earlier version of Roger Moore. The villain is a crazy count, played by Stephen McNally, who does credible work unless prompted to manic laughter. The long-lost Boris Karloff, sneaking into the shadows, plays a decidedly subordinate role of an old doctor, perhaps the salvation of our hero or not. <br /> <br /> It's the middle of the 18th century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton (Greene) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared near the castle of Count Karl von Bruno (McNally) deep in the Black Forest. It seems that three years ago, Sir Ronald and his friends had defeated a brutal plan by Brunos in Africa concerning slavery and ivory. Not only did the count fail, but he had a scar on his face and a black spot he now wears to cover a ruined eye. Bruno's vowed revenge, and it seemed as if he had partially succeeded. Under a false name, Sir Ronald arranges a count's hunting invitation, and off we go with a coach through a dark journey of storm and howling wolves to the count's castle. It's a huge mass of stone turrets and corridors, shady staircases, huge fireplaces ... and scary passages leading to damp dungeon cells, a torture chamber and a huge pit of snapping, crackling crocodiles. It is also filled with Count Elga's handsome, blond, sensitive wife (Paula Corday, sometimes referred to as Rita Corday) and the count's two close friends, played by the two actors we know from the fifties specializing in slime costume John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There is a dangerous leopard hunt, forbidden kisses, ankle servants, wooden signs creaking and weighing in the cold wind, poison in a cup. Last but not least, Dr. Meissen (Karloff) has a special vial containing a drug that slows down the bodily functions so that death seems to have taken place. The risk is that ... if the person wakes up ten hours later, she should better hope that she is not already nailed in his coffin. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, The Black Castle is always moving forward in all clich√©s. The film takes itself seriously, but it is competent enough to keep our interest, even if we sit back with a smile while smiling. It's even reassuring to realize that The E Dangerous Game exists. When Burton realizes how crazy Bruno is, he becomes even more determined to bring Bruno to justice. And of course he fell in love with Elga. from Bruno, crazy for revenge, but skilled and capable, is a man who loves hunting and is driven by the kill. Hollywood's second creative rule has always been, "If you steal, steal from the best." Of course, the first creative rule is: "If you steal, steal from the best and turn it into a liverwurst." The Black Castle is a nice bite of the Austrian Brunswick.
