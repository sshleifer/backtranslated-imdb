Thrilling characters, beautiful animations, dynamite songs ... all that and cute kittens. There is a lot of excellent humor, but no real threat. So do not worry about your little ones. The two farm dogs steal the show, though they only appear in two scenes. The artwork has a linear quality that may scare off some people, but I find it lovely.
