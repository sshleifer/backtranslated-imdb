This is one of the best movies I have ever seen ... <br /> <br /> It is so full of details and every time you see it, you will discover new things ... As if the father there is only one voice in the shower, and when the girls are flute, they can not do it at the same time, because then there would be two girls, and there are none. <br /> <br /> I have a problem finding out that they are being visited by their "uncle" in the middle of the movie, but why is his wife freaking?!? Otherwise a fantastic movie. !!! The best Asian movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I hope people will enjoy it. There were so many movies where the main character is Sketch-So (The Machinist, Secret Window, etc.), but this movie is way better than him !!!
