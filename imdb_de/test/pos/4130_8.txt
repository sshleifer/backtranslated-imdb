Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of rock'n'roll beginnings. The young singer / songwriter from Lubbock, Texas, has left his mark on modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly spent a lot of time fighting the system to record his rock-a-billy sound. Before his early death, he mixed lush strings with bebop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as voices of adolescent fears. <br /> <br /> This easy-to-follow biography is not without flaws. Some situations, events, locations, and even names were incorrect for a variety of reasons. What makes the movie so believable is that Gary Busey sang in Holly's own vocals. A well-produced soundtrack became a multi-million seller. <br /> <br /> Busey was nominated for an Oscar. Other well-known stars are Don Stroud, Conrad Janis, Charles Martin Smith and Maria Richwine.
