... but it's also Minnies and Pete's! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like Pete, but it is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both are very sweet and sympathetic. Interestingly enough, Minnie is more of a lady than she is today, and Mickey is less considerate than he is now. Pete is still the same old thing, but he looks a bit different. <br /> <br /> In this famous episode, Mickey, Minnie, and a few other characters aboard a small steamboat have a lot of fun and trouble. Even at the first appearance, the three main characters are very developed. <br /> <br /> I really like this episode, although I prefer the Mickey Mouse in the future. I like the animation, the steamboat and music theme, the clever gags - and of course Mickey and Minnie! <br /> <br /> Like many early cartoons, this is very coincidental. Walt had a very simple act and just added jokes. There is also a parrot minor character, which is very annoying and rather unnecessary. These are the things that I do not like. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing in this episode is that no color version was created for it (or if yes, I've never heard of it)! <br /> <br /> Anyone who just likes Mickey Mouse and Disney will enjoy it.
