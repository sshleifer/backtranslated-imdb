Otto Preminger was one of the great Maverick film directors. Like John Huston, he was a character from one of his own films. Like Mr. Huston, he was a wonderful hog who happened to get into the performance, but the end product of his work was unmistakably his own. With few exceptions, now films are made by companies, not individuals, and as a result, are usually highly polished "packages", a product that is roughly like a golf ball, a can of dog food or a car product. Involving people in the process is almost random. Such is the appetite for the product that there is no end to the line of well-crafted, shiny, superficially entertaining, but ultimately empty films that flood countless TV channels and movies. There's no time for a man like Mr. Preminger to do anything to dissociate from the torrent "product" and to create a personal work of art. Of course, filmmaking has always had the art of "art for the sake of art - money for heaven's sake", but now "Ars Gratia Artis" has been assigned anything but the historical ground of history. Today Otto Preminger would be lucky to deliver pizzas in Hollywood. Half a century ago, after making the influential influences of "Laura," "Where the Sidewalk Ends," and "The Moon is Blue," he embarked on Nelson Algren's controversial novel "The Man with the Golden Arm" in his eccentricity filming individuality Instead of putting his camera on the street, he stayed in the studio, using stylistic almost expressionist sets, bizarre casting (Mr. Frank Sinatra - hot on his success in "From here to eternal"), the young, inexperienced, but stunningly beautiful Miss Kim Novak and Arnold Stang, a man whose curiosities were sought after by his own heart, and a remarkable era - a defining score by Elmer Bernstein, featuring the cream of the West Coast jazz people. A film by Otto Preminger has always been an all-around experience that should be seen as a whole, rather than subdividing it into acting, directing and photography. Premingers vision, his creation and his interpretation of Algren's novel appeared on the screen. In a film by Algren's novel, each of twenty competent Hollywood hacks produced it. From the first hi-hat cymbal beat that accompanies Saul Bass with his iconic title sequence, Preminger prefers what is today called "The Life" to a dark realm of hustlers, junkies, cops, drug dealers , Steinspieler is occupied. Jazz musicians, their wives and hangers. The lines are blurry in "The Life", and the dog eats dog there. The inhabitants circle around like sharks and look for signs of weakness that they can exploit. Frank Machine Machine (Mr. Sinatra), a professional card dealer, ex-junkie and aspiring jazz drummer, is a born victim. When the going gets tough, he returns. Although he loses the habit of eating a cold turkey, there is absolutely no guarantee that he will not go back further. Mr. Sinatra's portrayal of an addict in retreat has split critics, but the fact is that most of us have probably never seen anything like this in real life fifty years later, so we do not know how exactly that is when I see the movie In the late 50's for the first time saw, I was very impressed. I've seen him on video recently, it seemed to say it's rude, hammy. He may be a victim of his own success, as many actors "do" later. The cold turkey has taken its performance over the years and refined it a bit. Arnold Stang excels as Machine's friend Sparrow, a feat he has just surpassed in "It's a crazy, crazy, crazy world". Try it on the big screen and see it as a cinematic vision of a true Auteur, a giant among today's pygmies - Otto Preminger.
