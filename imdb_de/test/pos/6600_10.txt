Actually, I have more of a question than a comment. I loved Z-Boys and the Lords of Dogtown. I saw Lords first, then the Doc, and although I loved the story, I'm curious as to why Sid was an important figure in the film, but in the documentary he was not part of the team and was only mentioned as just a kid she did knew. Does anyone know the story? The story of these guys was amazing. I've never experienced the skateboarding enthusiasm I grew up with, but my kids enjoyed it. What I saw in local skate parks was what these guys invented. I never knew that. When the film showed the competition and Z-boys did their thing, they shamed the others in the competition.
