This is a wonderful movie about a soul of ale. This is a journey into the heart of ale. I found it fascinating. The director has done a great job. He brings the scenes to conversation. Especially in the silent scenes. The window of ale is great. The scenes in which he is in bed are one of the best scenes I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Apart from the direction. It was a time when I did not see a movie about a soul. As a philosopher, I can say that this film proves that age does not matter to your soul. Like the soul of ale. <br /> <br /> Since I live in Turkey, I do not care about the other side of New York. This is a universal scene that you can see all over the world. In my opinion, more universal than anything else. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie. Otherwise, you will miss something great. If you have one. <br /> <br /> Baris.Sentuna
