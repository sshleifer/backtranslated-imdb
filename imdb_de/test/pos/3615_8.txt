At first I did not think I would like this movie, but with the progress it got better and better. I love music and I was impressed by how well Cage could simulate the movements of the mandolin playing. My son was with me and he really likes the movie because of its music and the story and the way the story developed. The drama and the story were well done and directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew up on you. The twists in the plot particularly fascinated relations with the Germans. I would like to see it to track all subplots. I also want to buy the soundtrack to hear the music again.
