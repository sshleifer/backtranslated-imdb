"The Student Nurses" is a great film about four women connected by friendship and careers. For the first time, one can see a realistic portrayal of relationships within the workplace, outside the workplace, the risks of those relationships, and the consequences. This film also offers a rare chance to see veteran stage and television actress Katherine "Scottie" MacGregor as a nurse instructor "Miss Boswell". Ms. MacGregor is best known for her performance as "Mrs. Oleson" in the television series Little House on the Prairie. The direction, the music and the ink are very good, as well as the opening theme song by Clancy B. Grass, III. This film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes around the late 1960s and early 1970s that offer a "softer side of life" while appreciating the beauty of the female sex.
