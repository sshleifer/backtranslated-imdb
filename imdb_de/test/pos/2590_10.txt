Strange enough, shorts like these get a 10th. Why? You are weird. That's hilarious. Note the quirky humor. Dated and childish to say no-nonsense, but they do not know what they are talking about. They have learned that cartoons are not just for kids. The art is probably the best non-road runner art of the Looney Tunes Shorts of the 1950s. It's hard to find anything better than the art in The Great Piggy Bank Robbery, though nothing will ever be like that. Shorts like these could have spawned ridiculous LT rip-offs like Tiny Toons Adventures to try to push out all the old comedy, just like great movies like Scream Mist like I Know spawn that Scream is all that old horror, but just like Scream, that alone is great. Chuck Jones occasionally made shorts mistakes, but he makes up for them. Take for example Hopper. Few people like Hopper, but that never ruined the LT reputation, but I'm sure these were things as such. Conclusion: This is not as good as "Duck! Rabbit! Duck!", But close to it. Catch it frequently on the Cartoon Network.
