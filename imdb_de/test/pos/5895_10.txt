Thirty years before THE DEER HUNTER, this film appeared, an outstanding meditation on the effects of the war that the American family experienced on both the war heroes and their wives. A truly ironic title, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE is everything, but since these times have been lost in still images, there remains only an uncertain future for those involved. <br /> <br /> An ensemble despite the top The account of Myrna Loy focuses more on the stories of men in the best years of our lives. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to a household that has changed irrevocably when his sons have grown, though he finds support from his in love wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry can not find adequate work after his return, although he is a war veteran, and is trapped in a marriage he does not want with Marie, a happy-happy girl who wants more from life and increasingly hates him.

This is the movie in which COMING HOME and BORN OF THE FOURTH JULY owe their lives. At a time when the US was fleeing war films, it was a necessity to do so when the end of World War II was still fresh, to allow a more honest film making.
