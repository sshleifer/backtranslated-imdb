Had To Kill A Mockingbird not taken place, this movie would be much more famous. If Gregory Peck had not been Addicus Fitch, acting would have been much praised here. If William Faulkner had not been, To Kill a Mockingbird might never have been written in his shadow. <br /> <br /> I found this movie sad because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, To Kill a Mockingbird, might not be as original as I had always thought. Maybe it was inspired by this very similar movie. Oh, the "whodunnit" is different, but the underlying story, a lone, upright "white" lawyer against a white city in the south defending a black man, is all too familiar. And written by a woman, Mockingbird focuses on rape, the ultimate betrayal of a woman, while this film focuses on brother against brother hatred, the rape a man experiences through fraternal betrayal. <br /> <br /> There is not the depth of Mockingbird here. Not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence. So you're left with the sadness, whether Harper Lee's Mockingbird, whether she wanted to reverse the storyline or not. Nothing has changed in the last 10 years since she read Faulkner's book and watched his movie during college in Alabama. In the later years he unconsciously or not took most of it for himself. Nothing has changed in race conditions, and some may say that even now, many years later, nothing has changed. <br /> <br /> It's all too sadly known, and one wishes there was an addict of our time to put everything right. Where Mockingbird leaves you hoping to waver in the arms of Addicus and wait for a better times tomorrow, this movie just makes you sad that the pride of the blacks could be equal or better to the pride of the whites. However, pride in both is not an answer. <br /> <br /> Rather, Addicus' response we need is comfort that we are all flawed and that we should have mercy in our frailty and not pride when we see each other in our differences ,
