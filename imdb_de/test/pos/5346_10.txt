This movie is what most in the industry have forgotten how to do: FAMILY entertainment, something that is fun for people of all ages. This particular Wallace & Gromit can be enjoyed by all the little kids who like the colors and cute bunnies, to their grandparents who understand the adult references. <br /> <br /> This film has a good direction that I have ever seen, and I mean that literally. It's also filled with tiny bits of humor, and each scene has so many humorous details in the background that I have to buy them, if only to read all the signs and leaflets in the W & G world. <br /> <br /> I plan to watch this movie in cinemas at least twice and then buy on DVD. You should see it too.
