First, I'm a big fan of Buddy Holly. I grew up knowing who he was, and I knew all about this fateful plane ride that erased three incredibly bright flames. But I never really heard his music. I had heard a lot about it, yes, but it was only when I sat down to get something out that I really came to see the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world is different because of him. Because of this adoration for such an incredible man, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without seeing it before. I am torn from my views of this movie. Maybe it's because Buddy feels so alive that I simply could not bear to see Gary Busey in that role. I admit he did a good job, but his vocals sounded so forceful. It seemed to me as if he knew that he did not sound a bit like Buddy and therefore used too much energy to try a similar sound. He succeeded in some parts of the film. But others ... ouch. <br /> <br /> The film covered a period of several years, but I believe that the presentation of that time could have been handled much better. It was hard for me to tell at what point in Buddy's life certain events took place. I also had a serious problem with some historical inaccuracies. I think the worst part was the appearance of cricket. I understand how their real names could not be used and how, for simplicity, only two of them were in the movie ... and maybe that was a good thing. Because the background vocals of the movie were incredibly worthy and I did not like the way he was portrayed as an obstacle to Buddy's career. Something else that really did not make a difference to the movie, but annoyed me over Gary Busley's teeth. They exhausted me! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I do not know why I noticed, but I did. <br /> <br /> I end this review of what I thought was the best part of the movie: Buddy's final performance. His last phone call with Maria, the Big Bopper, brought him and Richie Valens to the stage, followed by the end of the statue. It even startled me and I feel it effectively shows the audience how Buddy Holly was so alive and energetic in a moment and that his flame was erased in no time at all. It was a nice way to portray this horrible tragedy, I think. <br /> <br /> A good movie, despite the obvious problems. 10.7. <br /> <br /> Some obvious shortcomings might need some work ... but not bad.
