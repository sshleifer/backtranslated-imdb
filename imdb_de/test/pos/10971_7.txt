That was really a pleasure to see; The dialogue was for the most part absolutely outstanding (I thought the women's roles were a bit better written, which is a nice surprise). The services were also very good. Frank Gorshin exaggerates a little when he goes into his various drawbacks, but this may be that he overcompensates for what I see as weaknesses in the character's spelling; He is very good otherwise. Harry Groener is doing similarly well with a slightly signed character (Tony), slightly outperforming some of the character's angry scenes. Ursula Burton is excellent as Sister Theresa and really wears the film through some of her weaknesses. Seymour Cassel and Louise Fletcher are a bit understaffed here, though I like their work as always. Shirley Jones, Wendie Malick, Jill Eikenberry and Faye Grant are also very good (I could not help but think that Grant reminded me a little bit of Catherine O'Hara); Cloris Leachman tears into her role, with reasonably good results. <br /> <br /> I wish there had been a safer hand behind the camera. Sometimes the framing or the staging seemed a little outlandish or awkward. The close ups seemed to be overloaded (or unpredictable). And we do not always go from scene to scene as smoothly as we like. Part of the "hard guy" of the federal agent (music, costumes) was also exaggerated for me. And the few fantasy sequences did not really work. But there are things that have been done very well; The opening sequence, for example, around 1970 in Buffalo. And honestly, all the scenes about Theresa's church work (I guess the writer and the actress really liked the character, which is helpful). The scenes between Malick and Eikenberry are very good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably a bit crowded - there seem to be a few too many schemes running at one time to keep them all at times, and the coincidences have to be a little bit too much. And the end bothered me a bit (should we REALIZE that their biggest con has been successful so far?), But the ride along the way is very enjoyable. It would be nice to see more independent films like this one. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
