I have not seen this movie for some time, but finally found a copy. Having been born too late to see "hair" in its contemporary environment, I've known the auditions of UK and Broadway for many years. and saw it on stage in the late 1980s, where it looked a bit creaky, but still great fun. <br /> <br /> The movie. It drops some of the songs (The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills) and cuts off others (Walking in Space). What is left is presented very well. All the singers and dancers are excellent, and the main characters (especially Treat Williams as Berger, Beverley D'Angelo as Sheila, John Savage as Claude) are memorable. <br /> <br /> As a hippy celebration and anthem, 'Hair' can also stay strong in a movie that was shot ten years late. It was no longer the era of peace, love, and Biba, but the era of punk rock ... even though the film is being watched in the time of Iraqi issues, it resonates with the Vietnam issues of the 1960s <br /> Milos Forman, who also did 'Amadeus', has done well. Its scope and feel are reminiscent of Norman Jewison's "Jesus Christ Superstar", especially with the joy of the "Aquarius" scene and the intimacy of "Easy To Be Hard". <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie and consider it a good portrayal of a musical born of the first truly hedonistic era.
