This BBC version of an Agatha Christie book shows the pitfalls when a book is followed too closely. Christie's books tend to move at a gentle, sometimes slow pace, and "Evans" is one that works safely. It also has a solid school of red herrings to confuse the conspiracy. This version is extremely faithful to the book, resulting in a very slow, involved story. As a Christie fan, I gave him 7 stars, but it takes three hours to get through a relatively action-free story. I appreciate much more of the aggravation of the actions the BBC has taken for their later Christie productions. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is a leisurely pleasure, highlighted by the breathless Waif Francesca Annis, who brings a lot of charisma to her role and plays James Warwick off very well.
