While "The Jackal" [remake of the excellent "Day of the Jackal" has a better aesthetics [and a budget for the boatload], this film nails down the actual Persona of "Carlos" The naval officer warns, the Wiley Jackal incarnate to pull him out of hiding, and turns in the hands of Kingsley and Sutherland. He risks his family, his career and everything he believes in, and takes on the task, albeit completely unwillingly. <br /> <br /> To say more would ruin him ... this is an excellent movie <br /> 3 1/2 Niro ~ Stars [out of 4]
