I'm not sure exactly how accurate the film is, but I can tell you that I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. The bluff character, played perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was one of the most unique but entertaining characters to remember lately. This film informed but failed to preach to the audience. It made me laugh, made me sad, I felt alive, and was happy to spend the time watching the movie. It takes no time to understand what's going on and take you on a roller coaster ride with real, human emotions. I thought I knew my story, apparently I did not know it at all! I give this step 9 out of 10 and recommend it to all adults and young adults and the young at heart, not the boy. but as soon as they are allowed to see "r" movies, this should be a priority.
