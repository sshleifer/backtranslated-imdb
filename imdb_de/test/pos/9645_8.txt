You can see that this is the director's first suggestion (who also wrote it), but you also see the potential of this man. This is obviously an inexpensive movie in the spirit of Boondock Saints. Of course, Boondock Saints came out a few years later, so you might see this as a diamond that needs some polish. Acting was good - if you are looking for DeNiro or Michael Madsen in a drama, remember that these are young people playing young people trying to be criminals. They will not be "supercool" (tm) like other veterans. I would have loved to see Justin Pagel (Joe - the main character) do more movies - he was great. Good movie - 3 out of 5 possible stars.
