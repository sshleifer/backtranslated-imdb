Valentine, a model in France, is separated from her lover, who is abroad. They plan to meet in England but seem to be farther and farther away with the film progressing. One night, after refusing a passport created by her colleague, she beats a dog named Rita. The dog survives, and she returns it to her owner, a retired hostile judge who lives as a recluse and an eavesdropper and listens to the conversations of all his neighbors. She is fascinated by the nature of this man and often visits him and often becomes part of his wiretapping. However, a conversation they hear is very important. The conversation between a young judge, who is soon to be a judge and his wife, and who we find out, is similar to the life of the man who overhears them. As we learn more about the couple, the man reveals more of his story, then continues his story, and we learn whether the two men will follow the same fate. Little does Valentine know how her life, this encounter and the fate of the young judge are intertwined. Her blow to the dog that day seemed to be a fate, a divine sacrifice of the dog for her owner. This enabled Valentine to be the savior of the young judge, traveling the same way as her dear friend, to prevent him from having such a gloomy future filled with loneliness and loneliness. It seems the old man's dream is coming true and he can sleep on the face for the rest of his days. <br /> <br /> An AMAZING finale to perhaps the BEST trilogy of all time! Kieslowski always surprises me. He's one of my favorite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema. His use of the colors of the French flag in the three films was incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing films I've ever seen. And his subtle connections between the three films are fantastic. Usually called a subtle pause or a late focus in a scene. See if you can recognize something. I have to mention this and it's a huge SPOILER, I loved the end, as all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry's catastrophe, with Valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching TV, that his fortune over the suffering he had been dealing with for many years consolidated. I could not think of a better way to finish the film than a smile on my face, a great way to sum up a fantastic movie and a fantastic trilogy! I recommend it to ALL who love movies, movies and everything else ... A work of art! 10 out of 10 for film and trilogy.
