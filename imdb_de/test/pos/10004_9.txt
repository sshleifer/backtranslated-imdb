I saw this movie on September 1st, 2005 in Indianapolis. I'm one of the jurors at the Heartland Film Festival, which shows films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A truly moving picture "... explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values ​​of life." Heartland has awarded this prize for this film. <br /> <br /> This is a history of golf at the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, it was the game of upper class and rich "gentlemen", and workers could only participate as caddies in country clubs. It is against this backdrop that this story-based storyline unfolds with a young working-class boy taking on the golf house and the world's greatest golfer, Harry Vardon. <br /> <br /> And the story is inspiring. Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of "Holes") can defend himself against the best golfers in the United States and Great Britain at the 1913 US Open. Francis is ill prepared and has a kid for a caddy. (The Caddy is funny and motivating and steals every scene in which he appears.) But despite these disabilities, Francis shows courage, spirit, heroism, and humility in this world-class event. <br /> <br /> And we learn a lot about the early years of golf; For example, the use of small wooden clubs, the arrangement of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfer's mouth-wielding golfer, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways and the game is not canceled even in the pouring rain. <br /> <br /> This film has impressive cinematography and artistic direction and editing. And without big movie stars, the story is somehow more credible. <br /> <br /> This adds to the inventory of major sports movies in the style of "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans". <br /> <br /> FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures website that lists the winners of the last 70 years.
