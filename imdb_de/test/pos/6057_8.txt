I was a Marine at Camp Pendleton when the D.I. came out (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I remember well working with a number of other Marines to watch the movie at the Star Theater in Oceanside, California. <br /> <br /> We did not expect in the distance that the movie is all that we experienced at Boot Camp. But we were all positively surprised at how good the movie was. The idea of ​​using real marines in the movie was a great idea (I also think they were all real drill instructors). As good an actor as Jack Webb was, he just could not call "cadence" like a real Marine Drill Instructor. <br /> <br /> We all laughed when the "problematic" mother of the recruiter came to the camp talking to the captain. Never in a million years would that have happened, but that's Hollywood, and we did not get away from it through the episode stopped to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In the summer I visited the Boot Camp at MCRD in San Diego from 1956, and at that time there were practically no limits to what the DI could do to you. The "Ribbon Creek" event on Parris Island had not affected the boot camp yet, at least not in the MCRD - San Diego. <br /> <br /> I agree with what many other reviewers say about Sgt. Moore's "stiffness" around his girlfriend. I think this was just Webb's acting style, and although they could have erased that part of the movie, it did not hurt production that much. <br /> <br /> A small note, the character (uncredited) "Pvt. Rodriguez" was taken by one of my Drill Instructors, Sgt. Peter J. O'Neill. Sgt. O'Neill used to tell us that one day he wanted to be an actor. Secretly we laughed about it, but he surprised us all. He was a great drill instructor and I thought he was good in his part. Besides, he really enjoyed throwing knives. This summer he showed us his skills at Boot Camp. I've often wondered if he's still alive.
