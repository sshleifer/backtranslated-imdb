Pretty funny stuff. Charlie was still working toward his peak when he made this rather daring idea of ​​soldiers in the trenches of the First World War. Courageous because the war was still going on and this was a comedy about serious business. <br /> <br /> The jokes are amusing without being funny or crying. One successful scene follows the other as Chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker deep in the water. (From there we got the term "Trench Foot.") Probably the most ridiculous episode has disguised Chaplin as a tree and defeated a lot of German soldiers as they try to execute an Allied soldier trapped behind the lines. Edna Purviance, then Chaplin's main intrusion, is a woman who cooperates with the Americans and is also rescued from execution. Chaplin would later do fun and more ambitious things, but that's better than most of his other shorts at this early age.
