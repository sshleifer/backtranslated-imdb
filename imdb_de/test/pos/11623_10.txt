The film "Severo Pérez ..." and "Earth Did Not Swallow Him" ​​(1994) is recently available on DVD (11/11/08) and is based on one of the most respected and discussed novels in Chicano literature. Tomás Riveras ... y no se lo tragó la tierra / ... and the earth did not devour him (1972) is still widely recognized by many critics and serious readers as a classic Chicano novel. Rivera's novel, originally written in the Spanish style of South Texas and translated into English, is an indispensable presence in the literary landscape of Chicano. <br /> <br /> Perez's film, originally produced as a PBS production by American Playhouse, took some time to be released on DVD. One can only wonder about this matter, because their high quality is not an issue. The film and now the DVD remains to my knowledge the only cinematic adaptation of a Chicano novel and is clearly a tribute to the incredible endurance of the earth. This cinematic version also encounters an extraordinarily deep-rooted nerve, which I claim is both specifically ethnic and general in general. Doubts about the Earth may have arisen because they are too "ethnic," too foreign from an American mainstream, too much "foreign" artindia, too little in economic resources. In his version of the art, however, Perez connects, in my opinion, very effectively, artistically and creates a sharp-edged representation of a migrant collectivity, which focuses on the daily family life. As for a production with relatively limited economic resources, their beautiful film work and haunting pieces of music go far beyond the means available. By watching the movie, the artistic value of this film (or the DVD) is manifested. In short, and the earth does not swallow him in a neo-naturalistic way, the plight, suffering, and suffering despair of Chicano's migrant workers as they follow the 1952 crops north of South Texas to Minnesota. The local priests bless the battered, overcrowded vehicles of these Chicano workers, who find themselves unable to work in the area and follow the agricultural trail of the migrant workers to the north. This Chicano community, like the Joads of Depression in Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, is an epic tide driven by economic needs, a survival instinct and desperate despair, and ultimately a flickering belief. The DVD is a tribute to these people of the earth, a collective hero. The DVD focuses on one central family, and especially symbolic is a young protagonist in the family, a boy, maybe around twelve. This work then also acts as an educational novel. Ultimately, the viewer's sense of identification is generated by the protagonist's experiences, subjectivity and struggles. Poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (sunstroke and gestation death), discrimination, absenteeism (the boy's escapism from bullying discrimination is spent lying in a beautiful, peaceful graveyard) is not yet known symbolically as well. Worse still, the problematic conflict between the adolescent and his mother goes beyond socio-economic and political conflicts into deeper areas of psychology and metaphysics. In a desperate but artistically fought struggle, the boy fights with his mother, an archetypal Mexican-American traditionalist, a representative of the will of God, content with prayer, resignation, comfort, and acceptance. Insurgent youth can not believe in a God who allows such evil and suffering to visit them. How can God be so cruel, he asks, since his little sister is certainly innocent enough to suffer a serious illness in the fields? At this point, the boy must overcome obstacles even worse than poverty and discrimination. Topics now include death, doubt and despair and insignificance. And he has only a few resources at his disposal: strength of character, his own willpower, intelligence and a strong survival instinct. In this desperate but artistically fought struggle, the unnamed boy, the central figure, the need for its existence, the heightened sense of purpose, and the audience hopes to have a renewed and intensified life force that can serve as a source of inspiration for Chicanos and others , <br /> <br /> This martial battle uses a plotter that has just been touched by the original work to connect the episodic work: missing Mexican immigrants who leave no mark after their death, but this DVD is about not with Mexican, but Mexican-American migrant workers. A highly existential work: fear and despair; a task; a focus on a project; and salvation - all under the patronage of free will, despite the deterministic socio-economic and religious circumstances. Perez has a long list of credits, mainly as a documentary filmmaker. His many awards are affirmative. The producer Paul Espinosa is also known and was also awarded for his work. The film from 1994 won and received a number of awards: First Place, a crowd pleaser at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; first place at the Cairo Film Festival; and a number of other deserved prizes. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie and this DVD, Earth, by Perez is the best Chicano movie that was made.
