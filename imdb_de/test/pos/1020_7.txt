School-age high school student Kathleen Beller is beaten and raped in the opening scenes of this film produced for TV. The movie <br /> <br /> then fades back to the few days before the rape, as Beller <br /> <br /> is molested by a stranger. Beller and Scott Colomby and her best friend Robin Mattson and <br /> <br /> Dennis Quaid are early double dating. Beller's anxious parents returned Tony Bill and the shrill Blythe Danner, waiting at home with their hands and so on. Immediately, the 70s make their dated entry, while the young couples discuss romance and love in "Three Days of the Condor". <br /> <br /> Beller, an amateur photographer, gets threatening notes stuffed in her locker at school. The filmmakers wisely give us a whole host of suspects: Beller's new friend, Mattson's friend, Beller's father, Beller's ex-boyfriend, and what about it? > <br /> Very friendly photography teacher who wants to make Beller a little sexier in her self-portraits? I knew who the rapist was <br /> <br /> because Worldvision Video's video box has a picture of the attack on the back cover, destroying any tension in that area. <br /> <br /> Without revealing who the attacker is, Beller begins to harass phone calls and is eventually raped. The film then heads south while making it like Nancy Drew, and secretly sets up a time-lapse camera to catch the guy tracking another student. <br /> <br /> Finally, the filmmakers tackle a hokey-ending story by Beller about the lack of understanding of the victims of rape at that age and age. <br /> <br /> The tension here is very real, without going into the creepy <br /> <br /> movie stuff. Beller is very good and takes care of her and Mattson's scene in an abandoned theater - both doing great jobs. The <br /> <br /> movie is full of familiar faces, including Ellen Travolta in a small role, <br /> <br /> and everyone is professional. <br /> <br /> This was done in 1978 and it shows. I'm sure no one had the idea that this would be overhauled in 2001 by a supercritical horror movie lover who needs to go to bed early and get up early in the morning, but some of the Settings here are embarrassing. The teacher who asks Beller to be sexy never has to explain exactly what he was thinking. If a high school teacher said <br /> <br /> these days, it would be a TV movie of its own. <br /> <br /> After being raped, the rapist is still part of her life as arrest warrants are issued, blah, blah, blah. There may not be a case because Beller is not a virgin and can not prove that she was raped by whom she said. Many of these issues were addressed with modern technology and police activities, but this film obviously knew he would have a chance to supplement the reform debate. Rape is an act of violence that has not disappeared, but efforts to capture the attackers today are well past twenty-four years. The <br /> <br /> problem is that the anti-rape angle feels tacked, like an afterthought. Before that we have a tight, small suspension that is truly honest with God. After the rape, everything changes <br /> <br />, cinematic and not for the better. <br /> <br /> I remember Beller from the 70s and 80s (and who could forget <br /> her revealing role in "The Betsy"), but she has not done anything for almost ten years. That's a shame, since she was very good at the time <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I'll be "Are you in the House Alone ?!" acting on the <br /> <br /> alone, with a hesitant nod to at least the first two-thirds of the <br /> <br /> movie. If you want to relive the 1970s for the TV high school life, this is your cup of tab. <br /> <br /> This is not rated but contains physical violence, some sexual <br /> <br / > Violence and some adult situations.
