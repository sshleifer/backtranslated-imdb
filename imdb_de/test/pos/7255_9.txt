When I went to the video stores, when DVD was almost unknown to me, I had seen all the films in the shop I was interested in. The man behind the counter told me he had something for me that I definitely wanted. He gave me "Plunkett and MacLeane". At first I doubted that it was good, but I trusted his advice and ... man, I'm sure I took this gem! This is one of the best adventure movies in years, if you ask me! How bad can a movie be with Robert Carlyle of course? Surely Liv Tyler will do once more what she can do and not much more: be pretty. Nevertheless, one can feel very clearly that the cast apparently made a lot of fun to make this film.
