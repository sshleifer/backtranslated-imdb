After my personal research on the upcoming "End Cycle" time 2012 of the Mayan calendar system, I believe that this film should be seen as "What The Bleep Do We Know". While some believe that top science affairs should only be taught in doctoral studies, "talking", "The Elegant Universe" breaks through such barriers. The visuals and the selection dialog make it easy for you to understand this passage through the history of physics. There are numerous messages in this film, the least of which is that science must always be prepared to revise what it has learned. Of course, the science of discovery is beautiful because there is always something new and exciting when we have the courage to seek it in the face of "established" science.
