With 2.6 million viewers, you have to wonder what everyone is saying to the story / story. <br /> <br /> If I live the whole run, I came to believe it would be an advantage. Her thriller about a single mother who is being persecuted and eventually becomes the stalker. Unfortunately, I was wrong. While the main plot is interesting enough - a single mother runs off the street one night, then is chased by the same guy, the background of the stalking left nothing but a really bad taste in my mouth. Laura Leighton plays the victim, and she is doing well. Whether it's been Melrose Place all these years or not, she's doing well in this movie, playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son from harm, and she looks pretty good these days as well. <br /> <br /> Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. I think many people will identify with the main character, after finding out why the stalker is stalking, it will be a kind of film that can only be seen once.
