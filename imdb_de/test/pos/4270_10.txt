As an English teacher, I appreciate movies that tell more than just a story. Good films, such as good literature, make one think, think and predict. This movie made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses forebodings, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also like the fact that despite the choices made by the characters in the film, their decisions are not as youthful or criminal as other films I have seen. The drama is pretty good and the actors seem to have good chemistry with each other. Excellent soundtrack, with songs you do not hear on the radio. It is a reconciling movie of life and spontaneous road trip that deserves more than just a second look.
