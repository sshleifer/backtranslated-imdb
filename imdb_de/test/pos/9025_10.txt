Okay, it starts unimaginably with a tale from the main character (Justine, played by Laura Fraser - an amazing actress in her own right) - but it will be something wonderful. It has stupid little things that you really should not find funny but should do every time. There's a particularly memorable moment when your jaw drops to the floor when you first see it, when the male body of Jake, containing Justine's female mind, tries to get used to her new anatomy. I do not spoil it for you, but the second time I saw it was with friends; Seeing their faces was brilliant. It makes you wince, but laughs at the same time. I am also a big fan of the music used. There is a beautiful little band that occasionally appears randomly on the street or on a path, but also beautiful but unknown (often the best) pop songs. It feels like being written by an American writer for an English cast, which annoys me only a few times. Overall, this movie is hilarious. I am now a big fan of Laura Fraser after receiving his film for my birthday, and I expect that even if some of the performers are most unknown to you, you will enjoy every bit of it.
