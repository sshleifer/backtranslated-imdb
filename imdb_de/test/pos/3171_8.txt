The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways, from more or less traditional views on the use of art to postmodern approaches that break the game down into postcolonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version made me pretty cold is that I had no idea what it was about. What is the underlying vision / idea / concept behind this Shakespearean representation? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but there's certainly more to it, right? This does not mean that there is no vision here, only that I find it hard to discover it. However, there are still things to enjoy. The punk taste is refreshing and funny. Toyah Wilcox as Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are wonderful. Williams was not important to me as Prospero ... not enough magic, I think. Switching between the old monastery / castle and the (very English) world outside can be a little bit disturbing, but I think that's intentional. All in all interesting, but not quite the success I had hoped for (especially after seeing Jarmans Caravaggio).
