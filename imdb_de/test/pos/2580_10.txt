If ever a potential movie sounded like it was not based on paper, it would be that. Here's what seems like a scary and rundown soft porn movie, complete with the huge in-theater poster depicting an almost naked Christina Ricci with no one other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson, is chained. But let me tell you, if ever a movie about Celluloid Big Big Time is brought to life with soulful power, Craig Brewer's redeeming successor to Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan. <br /> <br /> In the past, the film sucks you into the opening scenes from the beginning and digs deeper and deeper with each additional image. It is your basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in themselves the strength and the courage to move more positively in their lives. Of course, this story has been made before, but as I've always said, it's the way a story is narrated that gives its heart, depth, meaning and power. Ricci is over - children abuse the wild-child character Rae and Jackson's soul-stricken musician character Lazarus find themselves in desperate circumstances, and Laz tries to help Rae. This is relatively unique in itself: the idea of ​​a man trying to really help a woman in serious pain rather than continuing to exploit it, and we know from the beginning that the heart of Laz and the heart of the film are the right ones Space. The core of the film is about the redeeming, healing power of love (with music as the next second), and the film resonates deeply with this truth - soulful, artful and brilliant. One main reason The film succeeds so profoundly because Ricci and Jackson appear hard and engaged. Scenes that would seem ridiculous and pathetic in the hands of a few artists are powerful like all the others instead. In particular, the film's bow scene, in which Jackson alone and Ricci sing and play the title of the title alone, amidst a serious thunderstorm and the abusive demons of Rae's past running amok in their heads and leading them toward Lazarus crawling and clinging to his leg is not ridiculous, as it should technically, but rather as unpleasantly cathartic. <br /> <br /> All support services are fantastic here as well. Justin Timberlake is absolutely believable as Rae's fearful friend Ronnie, and the always wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also perfect as a character who obviously has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is also outstanding as Lazer's awesome friend R. L. (undoubtedly a reference to blues musician R. L. Burnside). Everything is working on this movie, let's face it, including the music / soundtrack that includes Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House, and especially Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I'm listening to while writing this review , There is also a really nice and moving version of "This Little Light of Mine" sung by Ricci with heartbreaking, timid and gentle singing. Samuel Jackson has recently said in interviews that he believes the performance in this film is the best of his career so far. I could not agree with him anymore. This is a work that he can be monumentally proud of, along with all the others involved in this bold, exceedingly wise and deeply-filled heart of a project.
