Craig Brewer is now officially an author / director, for whom I'll see every movie, no matter how bad it looks. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites this year, with an emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I was not quite sure what I would think after seeing this effort in the second year. The cast seemed to be great, the trailer used the music effectively, but it seemed like there was a good chance it would turn into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan meets all traces. The spectacle is amazing, the writing superb and the cutting style as well as the juxtaposed music that captivate all the way. Brewer seems to be a master in getting his characters to have the right mix of compassion and malice as they set off for salvation. <br /> <br /> The first moment that I knew I was looking forward to a treat was at the beginning of the shortened credit cycle. As with Hustle and Flow, Brewer puts the music perfectly on the widescreen recordings, with simply named fonts appear static. The 70s aesthetic was welcome and showed that this will be another great character piece that dates back to the decade of some of the best in cinema. From here, we continued with the short excerpts into the lives of Lazarus and Rae, each vignette reflecting the other as they travel into the fateful moment when their paths eventually intersect. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than cutting abruptly before the scene had served its purpose. Raes friend leaves duty on duty and Laz's wife leaves him for his brother. Everyone feels the loneliness and returns to what he knows in this situation? Rae for sex and Laz for the bottle. Only when Rae remains dead by the side of the road and her Savior comes from his farm to take her, the reasons for her actions finally become clear. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as an older Bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God and with the flesh and the pain it brought him. There are moments of stoic austerity and kindness in his prisoner / patient. The setup is never really funny or unrealistic because it sells what it does so well. The character of Rae is not long chained, despite the followers who would make you believe. The situation starts a bit awkwardly, until we see that the chaining was for their own good and is actually only used for a day or two. Christina Ricci really shines in relation to this chained girl. I've never really seen her as special, but this role is a true breakthrough for her. This girl is so worried that her previous sexual abuse has deeply shocked her. Each time she is away from her love, she sees flashes of the man who has taken away her innocence from childhood, and it itches that he could be touched by a man who can make the picture disappear. Her nymphomania is not for the enjoyment, but for the survival of the haunting nightmares that always hide behind her eyelids. Ricci inhabits the role fully and shows all emotional traumas with great impact and realism. It must also be mentioned Justin Timberlake, who in turn shows a real acting talent. Where this guy comes from, I have no idea, but hopefully he will record more movies and distance himself from the most crappy music he omits. I still think it's equal, because when it's on, it's spectacular. Towards the end there is a really exciting sequence featuring "This Little Light of Mine" being sung out, and earlier the interaction between prisoner and catcher will show first-class work when the chain is first introduced. The truly magical moment, however, is when Jackson sings the theme song (yes, he is everywhere, as Terrence Howard was in Hustle), while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker. If I do not see a nicer movie sequence all year round, I will not be surprised. What these two people do to each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of doing. I think I really enjoy Brewers work is the fact that he does not show that sinners become redeemed heroes. Instead, it shows us that no matter how bad you were or how bad life was, everyone can strive for salvation and be better people. We have no saints here, but fallible people who want to get their ship right. If the course stays true or falls back into darkness, no one really knows, but at least he can say that he made as much effort as he could.
