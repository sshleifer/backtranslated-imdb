My husband received a DVD from OBWAT for Christmas and it was the best present we got! We look at each other every time we have to laugh and so far we have looked at it 12 times! The scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is superb! We also bought the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home whenever we do. I need a pickup and that's daily too! If anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers, it is this movie! The characters are funny, charming and their facial expressions are too funny to describe as a fan of George Clooney, but now I'm also a fan of Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete) and look for them in other movies now! You have to watch this movie !!!
