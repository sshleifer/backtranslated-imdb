Once again there are insidious government agencies that do nothing to prevent the public from knowing about significant events. In this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that could endanger the ecology of the planet. Although the creature is not an E.T. he seems to befriending a young man who protects him at all costs, unaware that he is a child of that kind, and that he will become much bigger? and badder This 2005 series had a lot to offer. It's family drama, science fiction, thriller with more than a few weird moments. The characters are believable, well played and photographed. The show keeps the attention. As with any science fiction show, of course, the suspension of unbelief must be achieved. And I think it is here. Unfortunately, the series crashed after the first season, so we never get a resolution. Angry .. There is a general comment I want to make here. Many TV channels and / or film distribution companies cancel, seemingly arbitrarily, seemingly excellent television series? particularly intelligent sci-fi devices. Well, there may be some very good reasons for this, although the audience is treated with extreme contempt and rarely names the reasons. That's annoying. What my goat really gets is to have the series released on DVD as much as possible after having canceled the series in an obvious attempt to milk the Cash Cow as much as possible. For former viewers of the series that's OK, they know what they want, but ?? Many of these unfinished series end at a cliffhanger. Two people who come to mind are "Surface" and "Odyssey 5". If you've heard good things about the series and have not seen them, buy the troubled DVD and end up with an unsolved plot problem. it makes me very angry !! I really enjoyed "Surface" and did not know that the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally unsustainable? and we'll never know what happened next. I believe that there should be a clear indication in all these DVD editions that the story is not yet complete. Nowadays, when I buy TV series (IMDB is obviously an excellent place to start), I check to see if a "complete" series is really complete or not. Buyers beware
