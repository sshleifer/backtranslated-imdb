"One Dark Night" belongs to the horror genre of the 80s on a low budget. Filled with retro puns, clothing and scenery, "ODN" puts the viewer in a simpler time when horror movies were just that ... horror! The film tells a dark fable what happens when you deal with the dead. He's well prepared by his screaming queens and a great director job by Tom McLoughlin who enjoys the time and lets you believe what he's presenting. There is no "Who did it?" and certainly not a big turn in the end. It's straightforward and horrible in your face from start to finish, with plenty of '80s humor for extra spice. I give "8" because some of the special effects are missing out towards the end of the movie, but at least there is no CGI ... Perfect movie for new fans of the horror genre of the 1980s or for all those looking for a new life a fun one Night with classic horror luck.
