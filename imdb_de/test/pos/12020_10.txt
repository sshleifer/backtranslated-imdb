I think that just sums up this movie. Look at it and you will find out why. The main character of the main character John Keem is really very bad and he has no charisma on the screen. It's very funny because of this thought, as well as the end when Keem kidnaps the villain, even though he's unarmed and surrendered. Brilliant!
