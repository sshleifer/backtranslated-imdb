This is a perfect movie that you can see with a loved one on a cold and snowy night. If you like a few laughs with your horror, this is the movie for you. The stuff to a real cult classic. It has everything you want to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, a hero, the buffoon, a monster wagon and of course a family mutant satanic killer. This is full of blood, guts and blood. I strongly encourage you to watch them early in the morning, and watch out for whoever entertains you from the sounds of Monster Trucks, Bad {But Funny} One Liners and our hero eating Eye Ball Stew. Not as good as the bad dead, but a short second. Just think about WARNING ..... DO NOT EAT BEFORE YOU VIEW THIS FILM ...
