This documentation was my first introduction to the Peak Oil Theory. A fascinating concept that has many frightening consequences if it turns out to be right. I had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil degradation would come so soon, it literally took my breath away. This movie will probably open your eyes to how much the American way of life depends on the "abundance of cheap oil" - a term used throughout the movie. Many of the topics are self-explanatory, and they do not go deep into the depths. But you've probably never put all the pieces together, as is the case in this film. The interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting. I do not think this movie should scare people. It's just meant to let people know what to expect in the coming years, and maybe to encourage you to think twice about commuting 100 miles to work and turn on your lights all day I could not see more of the cars and buses that zoomed by the same gauge. Great documentation, everyone should see it.
