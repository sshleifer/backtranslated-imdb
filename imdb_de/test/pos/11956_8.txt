If I ever write or do movies, I want one of them to be like that. I enjoy the funny humor and the jokes it contains. This movie does stupid things without looking that way. The names of the places and characters are priceless, generic New York High School, Squid Calimari (Georges's sister), etc. genius. I've seen this movie so many times because it was a cable TV in my youth. Of course, I did not get all the jokes back, but he was still funny. This movie is a timeless classic.
