This movie reminded me of the live dramas of the fifties - not like the recent "Failsafe", which seemed more like a stunt than anything else, but a true moral drama that is both captivating and thought provoking. Anne Heche is more than credible because the army officer is having an affair with her supervisor, played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stoltz is wonderful when her lawyer defends her against the military. I was waiting for her cause to start, if only because they look so good. This movie is obviously based on a true story, and it's a relief to think about real issues for a change. <br /> <br /> Directed by Christopher Menaul, who also shot The Passion of Ayn Rand (with pride) and the Prime Suspect series, this is a movie with swing and style that is absolutely worth seeing.
