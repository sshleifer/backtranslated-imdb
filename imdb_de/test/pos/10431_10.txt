Eric Bogosian's ability to roll from role to figure in this one-man show shows his true reach as a character actor. Each person has their own message to convey about truth, society, teaching, drugs, and so on. This is an absolute must for anyone who is a serious fan of acting! His performance contains some of the funniest and most real moments that I have experienced as a spectator.
