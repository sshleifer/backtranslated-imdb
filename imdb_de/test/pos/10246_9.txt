A jewel from Japan, where today so many of the best films in the world are filmed. Stylistically, this is nothing special. It's just a simple drama (with some weird undertones) about recognizable people pursuing their lives. Yuko Tanaka, known for defending the character Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays a 50-year-old spinster. She is proud of her health and spends a vigorous workout every morning as she supplies milk to the steep hills of Nagasaki. After completing this part-time job, she regularly works as a grocer in a grocery store (called S-Mart, making this Army of Darkness fan giggling). On her Milky Way lives a 50-year-old man whose wife dies. It turns out that the Milkmaid and the man, a child welfare worker, were from high school, and everyone seems to have a crush on the others. The movie actually has some big storytelling problems. If the script writer really wants the two unfulfilled lovers to unite, he uses an incredible Deus ex Machina technique. The climatic sequence is really enforced. But most of the film is pretty small and attentive to the two main characters as well as many minor characters. The film also has several deals that seem like they will eventually put a strain on the movie, but will never end. I think the best part of this movie is Tanaka's heartbreaking performance as a lonely milkmaid who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life. Whatever the problems, the movie mostly transcends.
