Wow, here's another great golf movie. That's at least three in the last few years that I've really enjoyed. They were well done, beautifully filmed and inspiring. The other two were "Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius" and "The Legend Of Bagger Vance". <br /> <br /> This is a true underdog story, if there ever was one. Having an amateur who defeats all pros and wins the United States Open Golf Tournament is an unattainable achievement. I think that's the only time in the 100 years it's ever been achieved. How much of this film is a fiction that is embellished for dramatic effects, I do not know. I know that I intend to read the book, and I know that Francis Ouimet had a three-voiced lead in the playoff and only two holes left in front of the target, in contrast to what we saw in the film. Whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over the golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is a fact. It's an amazing story and the filmmakers have presented their work here in an excellent way. It's not just for golf fans. this is a funny movie. Kudso to the actor who made director Bill Paxton a great job. <br /> <br /> Yes, many of them are just golf, but there are subplots like Ouimet's relationship with his dad and a pretty young woman is obviously interested in him. It is also a touching story of someone giving a chance to a small child. The film also looks at Vardon's demons to get off the wrong side of the tracks and try to make it into elitist sport, as was the case for both Europeans and Americans at the time. Shia LaBeouf is winning as well as Ouimet and Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who do not, Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day, maybe even more unbeatable. In the film, Vardon is portrayed as a hearty, nice guy; a real person. The other big competitor Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as a brutal, vicious guy. <br /> <br /> The fourth main character in the history of golf could be the coolest person in the film: a fifth-grade boy who is Ouimet's Caddy in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie. <br /> <br /> If all of that - a giant underdog play-off against two mighty pros - and had come to the last hole - would not have been you'd think, "Oh man, that's so hokey, who could do that believe?" That's what makes this true story fun when it's finally recorded in the movie. As with another 2005 sports film - "Cinderella Man" - there's another great movie that was unjustly ignored at the awards. I think beautiful movies do not win prizes ... just the hearts of their viewers.
