I played this for the first time at 98 'or 99' when I was with my friends. I really liked the game and thought it was great. <br /> <br /> The game is easy. In a player mode, act as James Bond and complete missions in various locations such as an arctic wasteland or city. My favorite was one with a tank. In two-player mode, you and a friend select any character and fight a battle. In the area you are in, you will find ammo and weapons that can help you. From hand guns to laser rifles to your fists. <br /> <br /> Again, with Player 2 mode, there are many options, and some unlock. I think this game is really funny, but also very exciting. Because you never really know where your opponent is, and it's surprising to see her behind a door that you go to. <br /> <br /> This game gets **** (1/2) stars or **************************** **********************************
