This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and never get tired. It's by far one of the best comic adaptations ever. I liked this even more than X-Men. In fact, this movie is a kind of cross between X-Men and the Matrix, and it either occurred. Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade. He's just not an emotionless superhero. Also, this movie is not sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Sure, comic books are mainly for kids, but I like a bit more in my movies. Let's face it, if we were in these situations, we would muster a storm to make it more realistic. This comic adaptation also has something that many do not. A good fight at the end between the evil and the good. Let's face it, none of the Batman movies had a very good end fight.
