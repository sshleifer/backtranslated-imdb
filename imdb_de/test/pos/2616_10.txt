This episode is not incoherent, as another person has said. The source agreed to help, because he would not keep his word if you are careful ... he says after she (Phoebe) agreed to stay down there in hell, "GET RID OF YOU AND BALTHAZOR, I did not have to worry about them in the future "... and also, he did not let COLE WARN HATE AS PHOEBE ASKED IN EXCHANGE OF ACCEPTANCE OF THE OFFER, THUS PRED DIED, because she's stronger than PIPER and was hit on the head and there was no PHOEBE calling for LEO this time, and in the past, LEO said she was almost killed herself. be more careful next time! and after this episode there is no "FOR CONTINUED ...". It's the end of Season 3, and in Season 4, they can not show PRUE because they own the rights to "PRUE" so the producers have to pay them for what they show. This is the last episode she's in!
