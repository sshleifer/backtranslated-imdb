At 2:37, a high school student commits suicide. Not shown who took their lives or known reasons, the time jumps back to the beginning of the day. From here we follow six different students. Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Every student struggles with his own moral dilemmas, all of which reach a boiling point and come to an end. <br /> <br /> Having lost a friend through suicide and survived his own attempted suicide, writer / director Murali K. Thalluri has written a dramatic drama that focuses on the lives of teenagers and the terrible Concentrated act of suicide. Suicide was a topic kept in the shadows, 2:37 is Thalluri's attempt to bring it to light. If you've been hit by suicide or if someone has done that, 2:37 will be even harder to see. <br /> <br /> Thalluri also deals with the everyday teenage crisis with heavy and hard topics. Sex, Pregnancy, Sexual Identity, Mobbing, Friendship - Thalluri manages and displays them in a very realistic way. The reason for Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. He respects his topic and the problems everyone has been through. It sometimes borders on documentary films, it has such a painful realism; The interviews with every figure that was spliced ​​through the film only reinforce this. <br /> <br /> 2:37 has a distinctive resemblance to Gus Van Sants' movie Elephant. While the core of each film is different, both deal with the teen's life. Like Sant, Thalluri uses long tracking shots, with time jumping back and forth to show each character's interaction from different perspectives. A key point for Elephant was its ethereal ambience. With few conversations, little character development, and long tracking shots, Sant created a haunting and intriguing atmosphere for an upcoming fear. While this fear lives in 2:37, the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level that Sant could not reach. Over time, the fragility of each character sneaks out and pulls you along its emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The real hit in this movie comes with the inevitable suicide predicted at the very beginning. The difficult part of this scene is the full penetration and discomfort we have as viewers when they end a person's life in a cruel way. Although many films that have shown suicide gloss over the act or romanticize the act. Thalluri shows the pain and torment associated with this act and that it is not the best solution. With unknowns in the leads and their first big roles; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris all display untold talents and promising acting careers. <br /> <br /> Exciting and reserved, 2:37 is an absolute must-have movie.
