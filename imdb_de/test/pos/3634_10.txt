I rented this movie, but I was not sure what to expect. I was very happy that this is the best Brazilian movie I have ever seen. The story is rather strange and simple and above all extremely original. We have Antonio, a young man who lives in Northestina, a city in the middle of nowhere in northeastern Brazil, and who falls deeply in love with Karina. The main conflict between the two is that while Antonio loves his little town and has no desire to leave, Karina wants to see the world and annoy the place. As proof of his love for her, he decides to go out and bring the world to her. He will put Nordestina on the map, as he says. And how he does that is incredible. That's a good movie. For some people this may be a bit uncomfortable due to the different editing tasks, but I think that will also improve the story. It's just fun and you feel good.
