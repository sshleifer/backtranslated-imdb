True stories make the best stories, right? There is always something pleasant about a story, be it a novel or a movie or whatever, just because it is real makes the story all the more fascinating. This film is based on a true story of two young American men, a government employee and a hawk enthusiast - Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) - and the other - Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn) - is a drug dealer. These two sell 1975 secrets of the government, mainly the CIA, to the Soviet Union. The film focuses on the human aspect of the two men, as well as their growing personal problems (especially the character of Penn with eternity) worsening drug addiction) rather than glorifying their status as traitors in America, which undoubtedly enhances the credibility of the film in the US would affect. Boyce is gradually becoming more cautious and ultimately frustrated and paranoid, as their business continues to expand, pushing deeper and deeper into treacherous areas. Daulton becomes more dependent and dependent on cocaine and heroin, the more anxious and desperate the control over a situation over which he has no control. He also has problems with the law. The torments of Boyce and Daulton's families because of their way of life are also well-presented and contribute to the fact that espionage against their own country, even if it is right, only leads to great problems and the destruction of life. including the deterioration of friendship and trust between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> --Hutton and Penn has worked extensively with the characters to capture their individual appearance so that they are portrayed with great depth and realism. <br /> <br /> - The spectacle is outstanding. <br /> <br /> - The atmosphere of paranoia is building up pretty well. <br /> <br /> - The story is intriguing, and of course it has an extra kick based on actual events. <br /> <br /> - Nice Sets. <br /> <br /> - The Soviets working with Boyce and Daulton are very well represented and are not only given stereotypical or guilty conscience just to make them look bad. <br /> <br /> Not done It hurts, did not help: <br /> <br /> - The music is fine, but not perfect. <br /> <br /> - Sound effects are occasionally a bit questionable. That's how it was with many films from the seventies to the eighties. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) has a relationship with a woman we barely know. Because of Boyce's difficulties in joining with the US and Soviet governments, her life may be in danger. But this is not as comprehensive as it feels. Minor problems, though. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The apparent simplicity required to sell state secrets is a bit disconcerting. Nothing is like a permanent state of immaturity to make the masses feel as insecure as possible. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - See the first CIA report that was accidentally sent to the wrong place The reason is "rough night". <br /> <br /> This was another movie that suffered massive delays due to the controversial content of the story. Studios and producers did not see a movie about two American traitors ever accepted by the American public. Fortunately, it is filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality. Of course it helps that the treacherous anti-heroes are not portrayed heroically - more like a few young men who have made gross wrong decisions in their lives. As such, it becomes a very human drama and one is portrayed very well and very believably. <br /> <br /> Acting: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Camera: 8/10 Character development: 9/10 Special effects / make-up: 8/10 (low quantity, high quality) Nude / Sexuality: 2/10 (a scene in a strip club) Violence / Gore: 7/10 (no Gore, just a bit of violence) Music: 7/10 Director: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness : 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 8/10 <br /> <br /> If you like movies about espionage and spies, then you can not go wrong here. If you like dramatic movies with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters, this may work for you as well. We recommend. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
