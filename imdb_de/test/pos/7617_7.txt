Very sad, I can refer to this movie, since I am 17 years old and still has to be kissed, so I really feel for Josie. It has been a while since I saw this movie, but to review this post I have looked at it again and remembered everything I loved about this movie. Drew Barrymore is a great actress, and that role suited her really well back then. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good, and Michael Vartan was a great actor in that regard. <br /> <br /> I also loved the story - as I said above, I could tell, and seldom do you find a movie that you can fully relate to. <br /> <br /> Everywhere - I loved it. 10.7
