For those of you who wondered what an art house monster movie might look like, do not be surprised. The DAIMAJIN trilogy, circa 1966, was one such series. These three films are more than any other epic of the Samurai epics, and they happen to be one of the (literally) most monstrous Deux et Machinas of all time. There is not a single facet of these gems that is not polished, from the scenarios to the performances to the manual work of the filmmaker. Even the special effects are treated with far above-average skill and (in most cases) almost seamlessly integrated into the film or films. If you're a GOJIRA fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who likes a good movie regardless of genre, I highly recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.
