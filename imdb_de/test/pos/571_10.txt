I do not have to say much about how good this documentary is - it really is an amazing piece of true narrative. The story is simple enough: a white senior tourist is murdered in Florida by a young black man, and the boy who is arrested is abused and brought to justice, with only the public defender and his family at his side. It is very exciting and the public defender is a joy that he can observe in all his human ways - you just have to fight for the victory of justice, and the end does more than you would expect from a true story. <Br /> <br /> It's a shame that more people have not seen this documentary, but hopefully you'll find a way to look at it. For those interested in race relations in the United States, as well as the actual workings of law enforcement and the legal process, it is worth the time and effort to find this documentary. I give a 10.
