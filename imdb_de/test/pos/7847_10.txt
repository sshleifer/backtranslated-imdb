During the Civil War, a wounded union soldier hides in an isolated Confederate women's school; Where the headmistress and the school's teacher choose to look after him and keep him alone until problems arise between lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but in the end all this comes at a price. <br /> <br /> "Dirty Harry (1971)" (written around the same time as "The Beguiled") is perhaps my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but after seeing this, I tend to be that most beautiful work of the couple. A very atypical, clever and stylish vehicle for Eastwood is always a must, with Don Siegel-controlled directing and a rousing, rousing music score by Lalo Schifrin. Strongly stand out is its melancholy and gloomy nature, which is implanted in the psychological equipment and the manipulative influence of the film in sexual depravity. It is conscientiously played through and makes it more the brooding and coagulating of the blood, when these random shocks and daring intentions grab with enthralling tension. The manner in which Seal seduces John B Sherry and Grimes Grice's seductive, courageous screenplay (from the novel of Thomas Cullinan) is effectively realized through strong emotions and the tight, lyrical context of the script. Siegel's strong focus captures the idyllic southern Victorian environment with such a garnished photograph and creates strangely pervasive images with great clarity and restraint. <br /> <br /> The performances are truly commendable and of high quality. Clint Eastwood as the meek, amiable, talking chameleon union soldier is very impressive and enjoyably assured. A profoundly significant Geraldine Page steals the picture as hard-hitting chief mistress, and the elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds a tender sincerity to her innocent character. Mae Mercer is very much geared to the black maid, and Jo Ann Harris is the choice of young girls with their seductive smart personality. <br /> <br /> Frankly, while Eastwood's charismatic character plays the field for his selfish needs, there are still mixed intentions that the one who is played (where the rivalry between women creeps in) is no better than his guest is at the end. Everywhere there is a perverted, dark sense of humor and an ironic note that is fixed in the material. What is demonstrated here is simply more than your basic, short-hearted shocker, but one that is full of intrigue and a sense of realism that is hard to shake. This also applies to the extremely eerie title and final song. <br /> <br /> An effective cooling, restrained product that can hardly be seduced by swinging hospitality.
