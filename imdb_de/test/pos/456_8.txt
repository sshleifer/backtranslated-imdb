Yul Brynner is Major Surov, a singing, dancing and vodka-drinking Russian officer stationed in Anatole Litvak's The Journey near the Austro-Hungarian border during the 1956 Hungarian uprising. Although the film has not yet been released on video or DVD, it remains one of Brynner's most convincing performances. Due to political unrest, a group of travelers can not fly out of Budapest, but will be taken to Vienna by bus. However, before they can reach the border, their passports are removed and interrogated by Russians led by Major Surov. <br /> <br /> The major has reason to believe that there is a Hungarian freedom fighter group smuggled out of the country. In fact, Lady Ashmore hides a mysterious passenger, Paul Fleming (Jason Robards Jr.), who pretends to be an American but not a fool. It mainly helps Fleming to repay a debt that she owes because of the difficulties her former association has caused him. Among the other passengers is a British journalist, played by Robert Morley, an American family, played by E.G. Marshall, his wife Anne Jackson and their two children, one of which is screen debut of little Ron Howard. Major Surov is romantically interested in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr) and a romance kind develops between them. She offers only contempt and a stiff upper lip, though we suspect that her heart is still beating. The intrigues of the Cold War and the powerful acting carry the story, but the romance is never quite convincing. However, it remains one of my favorite films by Yul Brynner and deserves to be seen only for his passionate performance.
