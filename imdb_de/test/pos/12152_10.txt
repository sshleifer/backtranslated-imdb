I've become a big fan of Barbet Schroeder's work, so maybe I'm a bit biased, but I think this movie is great, even if there are some lengths. It's a romantic, unromantic view of the Great Liberation in the late sixties, stylistically amazingly polished (great set design!) And in my opinion still very worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is an ironic retelling of the story of Adam and Eve being expelled from Paradise after trying the "forbidden fruit" that has grown from one apple to another Heroine has turned filled hypodermic syringe. The woman seduces a man to use her, thus speeding up his fate The guy seems to be determined by the big title sequence for an intense life and an early grave. There is no room for hope. <br /> <br /> Although the story is rather sad, I was captured The beauty of both the beautiful town of Ibiza and Mimsy Farmer. I found her character flat, puzzling, lovable, annoying, interesting and boring. Somehow it illustrates what men see in women in a simple, unobtrusive way. Architecture and Artifacts In general, are very go od use? This seems to be a kind of Schr√∂der trademark. <br /> <br /> There is even some humor, mainly from Stefan, the German main character and his accent. His main nemesis is not a snake, but an older German with a dubious reputation? and provider of the heroine - called Wolf. Although it's a German name and Stefan is German, he says that it's very English, and in jealousy spits it out on a regular basis with his girlfriend? to become a boy who cries ... Sometimes Stefan has to work to earn a "Cellery". Once the guy snorkels and climbs awkwardly with his rubber fins up a rock. Never before has male male nudity been funnier in movie history.
