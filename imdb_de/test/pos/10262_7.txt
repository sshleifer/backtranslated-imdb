Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British (I think) DVD label that specializes in smutty and overly violent cult movies. Mostly Italian - from the glorious times when everything was possible, from the late 60s to the mid-80s. The label's selection feels like a crossover between the works of "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" (they may have borrowed the name of the latter) and they already have some very rare sick Italian puppies like "Ratman", "My Dear Killer," "Killer Nun," "Phantom of Death," and "Torso." "The Frightened Woman" was completely unknown to me, but as I liked it from other critics in the area whose opinions I greatly appreciated, As one of the biggest and most intriguing psychedelic euro sex sex movies of his time, I did not hesitate to lift it up, this is a very funny movie and probably not suitable for about 99% of the average cinema-loving audience The style, atmosphere and content are similar to Jess Franco's "Succubus" and Massimo Dallamano's "Venus in Furs", but both are weithi n as a classic, while "The Frightened Woman" is virtually unknown. I think it's all a question of profiling and good marketing. The story revolves around a literally dirty, wealthy doctor (he lives in a huge secluded mansion, owns several vintage cars and has a very impressive collection of ornate relics, including a life-size doll of a man in a doll shape) with a bizarre and somewhat unusual effect Attitude to women. He sees them as a threat to the survival of the male race and therefore spends his days abducting, humiliating and sexually abusing. Dr. Sayer abducts the ambitious journalist Maria with the intention of completely destroying her female spirit, but he falls in love with her. Only he begins to believe in true love, she recovers with all her might. This is not for everyone, but if you appreciate an atmospheric and eerie sexy ambience, bizarre scenery toys, and psychedelic touches that seem extremely implausible and unreal, you may consider this a top recommendation. It's slow, stylish and totally crazy. Shameless entertainment, all right!
