This film plunges headlong into the realm of the surreal Ã  la Lynch and Jodorowsky - with an atmosphere that is strangely captivating and lulls the viewer into the dreamlike intensity of his pictures - the narrator is caught behind a painting (next to the bed) often speaks for and expresses his wishes and arguments. Yes, Beardsley would sound like that. <br /> <br /> There are some shortcomings, but its strengths overcome its weaknesses. The sequence with the woman tearing out of bed and crawling across the floor to escape will make you breathless. <br /> <br /> The film has a hint of Fin de Siecle; and should be read as a disarming cry from the entrails of the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and bathe in it.
