Much more sinister than Flatliner. This deep, dark movie brought my heart through and through. The lighting is dark and you will literally get involved in a death-defying experience. Keifer is in top form today in 24. He is a great actor and plays a very convincing and shocking role that you will not forget in the years to come. And what can you say for the rest of the cast? As an all-star team, Julia is hotter than ever. Will, Oliver and Kevin illuminate the stage in this thriller through which you'll pack your seats. It's a refreshing sight to see a real thriller with top-notch professional actors. You will not regret seeing this 2 hour seat bender. -J L
