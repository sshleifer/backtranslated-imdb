This movie is not intended for those who expect a martial arts extravaganza. As for historical accuracy, I will leave this question to those who are better informed on this subject. I thought the performances were wonderful. Gong Li never disappoints as a resourceful and (initially) faithful wife of the King of Qin. Fengyi Zhang showed a lot of flexibility when he represented a madman falling into madness. He chose the "Hannibal Lector" route instead of complaining. For me, Zhiwen Wang's best performance was as supersmooth marquis. The character was very oily, but in a subtle "Sir Humphrey Appleby" style of the minister. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the outstanding feature of this film. The scene when the Marquis and his men stormed the palace was breathtaking. There are also some wonderful fight scenes. Therefore, this movie on the big screen is highly recommended.
