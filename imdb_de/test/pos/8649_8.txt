At first, with the cautious, secluded location and pervasive metal sound, I thought of the opening scene in Once Upon a Time in the West. When it comes to town, it feels like "Kitchen Stories" or "Drifting Clouds", possibly even "Grimm". <br /> <br /> Then it turns out that this is more akin to "Joe" Versus the volcano "in the theme (not style) and the film performs the same inconspicuous style from start to finish Take on the steely, blue-gray hue of the suites, dresses, wall paint, furniture, bed sheets, mirrors, cars, music, background sounds, and even people's expressions, and at the end there is a setting of a completely different tone - warm orange-yellow with soft music and babbling sea, children and laughter, but maybe the observation is too long for me. Rather, you see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the final shot.
