There is an interesting split in the voting for this movie (at least for the moment). Anyone expecting a documentary is impressed or at least not disappointed. I assume those who give the movie 1 in 10 were the ones expecting a war movie or a reenactment of the invasion of Gallipoli. <br /> <br /> So - if you want to see actors, shots and blood you will not like this movie. If you want to see an independent documentary about Gallipoli that does not focus on one side (the only enemy in these events was the war itself), you'll be impressed and sober. I thought it was a very moving movie, and even Captain Guy Nightingale really liked him in the end.
