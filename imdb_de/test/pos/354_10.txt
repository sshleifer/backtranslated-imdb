* THIS COMMENT WILL probably SPOILER !! I only checked the spoiler box in one case, but it might not have any spoilers, but you should definitely be aware when I say something that you could consider a spoiler and I do not ... the best game since Super Mario 64. I have this game The game on the first day it came out, and before I got it, I went to some game sites to look at the reviews (yes, they've already checked it before it came out) and I was shocked. I had expected something like Sunshine, because lately all Mario games were getting worse and worse. But this has totally defeated the other games. The results of this game have even surpassed Halo 3! It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> STORY: Not the best, Mario games are never known for their actions, and this one is not really a difference. Bowser kidnaps Peach again, but this time the Mushroom Kingdom invades a festival that's celebrated every hundred years. He gets a flying saucer and shoots lasers on the ground. Then they anchor in the ground and tear the castle and its foundation into space. <br /> <br /> GRAPHICS: Absolutely great, the best graphics on Wii so far. The water effects are also really nice, if you ever see the water, it looks so real, because the effects that they put into it, MUSIC: Simply unbelievable, the music in this game is orchestrated. Not everything, but even those who are not orchestrated still sound very nice. <br /> <br /> GAMEPLAY: Very entertaining, so you always want to play more, and for me, as I tend to be very frustrated, when I die a lot, I'm definitely not the only one, but this game was for not me much. It was still like that, but not as much as Mario 64, where I totally went crazy and ended the game because it drove me crazy, it never did. <br /> <br /> DIFFICULTY: There are two types of difficulty, as you can only beat the game with 60 stars, which in my opinion is pretty easy, but to beat the game 100%, you have to as always, 120, and this search is much more difficult, but at the same time still very funny. <br /> <br /> LENGTH: Good length, definitely not too short. It took about 15-16 hours to beat it with only 60 stars, but 120 would take 45-50 hours. Now I did not play it all the time, I played a lot first one day, then only a few hours a day for the next few days, then the whole day for the next two days. I think the search for 60 stars was a tad bit short. So if you want a long game, I suggest you get everyone. <br /> <br /> PRESENTATION: Well, the movie scenes in this movie are great. The way they are, it looks like something I would see in the cinemas. They are undoubtedly the best movie scenes in any Mario game. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: This game is definitely a great game, and I advise you not to wait until Christmas, but to get it as soon as possible. This game is also a good mix of old and new. They have some levels where you can move back and forth as they will change due to gravity, but even the music contains some old classics. So this game seems to be a masterpiece. For me it's my favorite Mario game ever, but others may disagree. But it is still a great game. I recommend anyone who wants to enjoy a game to get it.
