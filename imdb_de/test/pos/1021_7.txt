Undoubtedly a delightful film that shows both the epoch and the particular phase in each boy's Passion rites. But I have to say, after reading the very positive comments here, I was a bit disappointed. The period was trapped, but the action was desperately thin. The whole thing revolves around the most monstrous mistake in the history of school games. The idea that Quack Quack would ever be chosen to play not just one of just three starwheels but a Philanderer is realistic. And without the nada. The negotiations had no relation I could see to the main plot - all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story - which certainly suggests a fundamental error. If all your negotiations look like upholstery, you know that a central idea goes beyond its limits. Still, it's a good-hearted movie with its heart in the right place, there are some good performances, and you just feel like everyone's at the last 'cut!' This good feeling permeates the film. And that has to count for something. A flawed, really pretty good movie. 7 out of 10.
