Motorama viewers should already be excited about other unusual b-grade movies in the desert like Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which are more or less in the desert). It also models the bizarre humor (and especially the eccentric trace of the characters) of Joseph Minion's comedy "After Hours." In a kind of desert road trip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and salvation, Gus kisses (well played by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10-year-old boy, his piggy bank, steals a Mustang and runs in front of his roughly neglected parents. It begins as a journey through salvation (seen in the scenes with John Diehl), but as soon as he's thrilled with a scratch game called Motorama, he's easily tormented by temptations and loses his childlike innocence. He travels from one crazy fictional state to another to find ways to get Motorama tickets from the participating gas stations, just enough to spell out the award-winning word MOTORAMA and win the $ 500 million prize to qualify. <br /> <br /> On the way, he faces dozens of weird characters like Flea playing a pulled-up busboy, Meatloaf playing a crazy biker, and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron (a Seinfeld tribe) as two violent kidnappers , <br /> <br /> The DVD reissue can be very deceptive as previous attempts have been made to sell the film to the non-iconic market first, comparing the headlines with Home Alone and Thelma & Louise. The latest title calls it a love story with the slogan stating that the movie is about Jordan Michael Christopher to make an adventure with the girl of his dreams ... which, despite the size of her image on the DVD cover, is actually just about One thing goes 1-second cameo by Drew Barrymore as the fantasy girl Gus dreams of. Why did not they just market it the way it was? Although it may seem bizarre at first glance, it is actually a well-designed narrative. <br /> <br /> Motorama is a great material for fans of comic comedy. This was a pretty interesting story, and above all because of the strength of its lead actor - Jordan Michael Christopher (who unfortunately has few other screen credits) and the skilful metaphor inherent in the story. The re-release on DVD hopefully makes it easier for cult fans.
