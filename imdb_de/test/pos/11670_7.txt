First of all, it is known that I did not come into this film for the music; Actually, I find it repugnant. Really, I was interested in the psychology of punk subculture. At this point, the documentary was pretty good. An unpleasant aspect was the numerous scenes in which songs are played and the highly played band and the warlike crowd run amok. If you saw the first such scene, you saw them all. This redundancy is made good by printing lyrics for some of the songs. With these, the audience can mentally connect with the band. The lyrics are far more interesting than the clutter of sounds projected from the speakers. I do not know why not all the texts were printed. Scenes without lyrics are slow (ironically, given the many references to the speed of the music) the flow of the film. Also revealing were the interviews with fans and bands, but it is a flop if the interviews of the last band are not nearly as exciting or humorous as the first two. All in all a good movie that I have seen gladly. I will check the follow-up if I ever have a chance. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: He tried to hide the fact that he could not play by rubbing peanut butter and breaking glass. <br /> <br /> Broad punk generalization: Although their shame, lack of vocabulary and sanitation, and drug-induced carelessness are often hilarious, in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic teenagers who rebellious rebels only from the perspective of sophomoric texts and na√Øve attempts to philosophize and politicize (ignoring Black Flag, who are slightly less misguided than their peers).
