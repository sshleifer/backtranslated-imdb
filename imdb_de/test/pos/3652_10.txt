I just saw it at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It was the most beautiful movie - the best I've seen in a long time. The seductive figure of Isa is an open, exploratory and (as noted in the film) person filled with love portrayed innocently by beautiful Camille Natta. The accompanying music is soothing and transporting, a balm for the soul. <br /> <br /> Each character seems to somehow clash with one another - and their interactions (with conflicts) make for a great story. The story of A.K. Hangal like the old man was the most magical finished - I wanted it to go on and on. <br /> <br /> That Hari seemed to remember his "place" added more power to the story - a refreshing change to the bubble plot of many modern writers. <br /> <br /> All in all an excellent movie. Go see.
