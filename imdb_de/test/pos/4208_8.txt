The young John Garfield performed well in 1939: "They made me a criminal." Boxer Johnnie Bradfield celebrates a ring win in a jammed locker room and speaks to fans about his love of mother, refusing alcohol and a clean lifestyle to fans, including cops who devour him. Later in the evening he splashes and rumbles around with his fool, while his manager in the evening shares the evening. And the whiskey. <br /> <br /> A problem arises when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and says he's going to reveal Bradfield's fake life on the front page. The manager kills the reporter and he and the Floozy move away. The murder discovers police are looking for the now somnolent boxer whose car is driven by the manager with his new girlfriend - Johnny's now Instant Ex. A chase ends with a burning car accident. Managers and girls are dead and unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> Johnny discovers he should be a murderer. But he's probably dead. He seeks the advice of a lawyer and assigns the adviser with the key of a banknote box containing his only savings of $ 10,000. The lawyer later grants Johnny $ 250 and tells him that the remainder is his fee for his professional advice: escape from the city, fast and far away. (I would never charge a customer more than $ 5,000 for such a succinct, concise, and smart direction.) Johnny, now a freight train hopping Hobo, conveniently ends up at an Arizona ranch where he is being cared back to health by Annie Sheridan, the beautiful Goldie West, a good actress whose career was on the rise. The musician takes Jack Dorney as his nickname and loses some of his rough edges as he falls in love with Goldie. He becomes mentor and friend of - The Dead End Kids. Familiar screen characters for prewar cinemagoers. <br /> <br /> An opportunity to earn money arises when an exhibition boxer shows up, asking all the fools to pass several rounds in the ring with him. It's a natural temptation for Bradfield / Dorney, but there's a fly in the ointment. Who should turn up, but the New York detective Monty Phelan, the laughing part of the department? He'd been in the morgue forever, having made a small mistake at the beginning of his career when he sent an innocent man to Old Sparky (we all make mistakes, right?) And pinch. Claude Rains is the policeman who for years had light beats and barbs from his colleagues. What follows is predictable, but it is well-handled. I hope this was a key feature when it was released - it's too good to qualify as a "B" on a marquee. <br /> <br/> Busby Berkeley, known as an outstanding choreographer, performed "They Made Me" a Criminal "and Max Steiner, one of Hollywood's most successful film music composers, wrote nice but not exceptional music for the movie. <br /> <br /> Now available on DVD from Alpha Video, the movie just made me back $ 4.99 and I really enjoyed it. I'll take a look at it again. <br /> <br /> 8 / 10
