OK, I'm Italian, but there are not that many Italian films. I think the plot is very good for 3/4 of the movie, but the finale is too easy and too predictable. But it is the only little mistake. The consequences of love in my opinion, especially at the beginning of great sequences and a great soundtrack. I would love to work the lighting on it. The best part is a great actor. You know, if you were called Al Pacino now, everyone would still have talked about this achievement. But it's just a great Italian actor named Toni Servillo. Yes, somebody is telling me this movie and this kind of performance is too slow, it's so boring, so many stills, but I think these components are fantastic, it's the right way to tell the love story between a very talented young girl , the granddaughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani, Olivia and the old mysterious man Toni. One of my favorite movies in Italy.
