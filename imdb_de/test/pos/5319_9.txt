I remember watching the trailer for this movie, and I absolutely knew that I had to watch this movie. It looked like something that would be right in my alley. <br /> <br /> "The United States of Leland" is a terrific movie. It is not one that will leave a nice, pleasant conclusion, but a sad, empty feeling. And when I say that you will have an "empty" feeling, I do not mean that as bad. I believe that you should fulfill this empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and the general motives of human beings and how they work as parts of society. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as Leland. He is intelligent and yet stoic. I like the way he tells the movie with his diary. The side occupation is great as well. Kevin Spacey is very good, as always, and Don Cheadle is incredible as a teacher and mentor to Leland. <br /> <br /> This was a great story and is very smart and thought-provoking. I highly recommend it.
