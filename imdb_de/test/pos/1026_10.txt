To commemorate those who have just read the commentaries on this outstanding BBC miniseries released in 1981, they were only available on DVD in recent years. Since then it's available, but initially only in the UK format (for which I bought an "international" DVD player that you have to hack - illegally, I think, to see it), but the series is now available via Amazon. com - 3 discs - for between 19 and 21 US dollars, in US format on DVD, no hacking. There were 41 reviews, on average 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the best on Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, or virtually anything produced by the BBC.
