Accepted ... let's see. The only reason I had seen this movie was the hot dog that was shown in commercials when Shrader (sp?) Said: "ASK ME ABOUT MY WEINER". After that I had to watch this movie and I saw it with some friends ... and WOW unbelievable. One of the best films of the year. The whole movie, I laughed like crazy! The plot in this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) is not being enrolled in any of the schools he has applied, so he's doing another wrong college for him and his friends so he can fool his parents into putting him in College has done. So he makes the finishing touches and makes a fool of his parents ... until more students visit the site and see the clicker (ACCEPTANCE IS A CLICK), and all these denials come to this school. They face many problems and they just do not seem to get it right. 10/10 LOVED IT NOW WATCH IT
