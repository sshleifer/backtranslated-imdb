Forget all the people who tell you it's not as good as the book. So what? That's a movie. It is a pure pleasure to see Cephallonia on location, beautiful photography, but also dark, disturbing moments. The only problem I have is the obvious abuse of Nicolas Cage as Captain Corelli. Otherwise, the movie was a very pleasant surprise.
