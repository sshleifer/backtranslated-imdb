I do not think I'll add spoilers, but if I do, I can cover my butt. "The Last American Virgin" came at a time when teenage adolescence and high school sex romps were the rave. Films like "Prepies" (1984), "Hot Times" (1974) and the popular "Porky's" (1981) made a lot of money. But it is the "Last American Virgin" who actually has a more serious storyline in the midst of nudity and sexual situations. It's the often told story of three high school friends who want to lose their virginity. They go to the wrong places (prostitutes), the dangerous ones (older woman with jealous friend) and the practical ones (which attract her female colleagues in high school). The movie has many fun moments, and though the cast did not produce a single major movie star, it's a fantastic 80s soundtrack that includes: Devo, The Cars, Journey and others, a reminder. By today's standards, it is slippery and may have received an NC-17 rating, but it's a well-narrated story that personal fixations can sometimes only cause pain, while love is right in front of us. It's a little bit of the 80's Americana and worth it in your movie collection.
