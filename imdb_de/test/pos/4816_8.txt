This eloquent, simple movie makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his dad. Although it is a theatrical release, it has made the quality "for television". We can credit that to director John Frankenheimer, who learned his craft in the early days of live television in New York City. In fact, he directed the TV play on which the film is based, "Deal a Blow," on the CBS drama series "Climax." "Young Stranger" stands for his Hollywood debut. After a break of four years in which he would do more television, he returned to Burt Lancaster, "The Young Savages," and a year later "All Fall Down" with Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury. <br /> <br /> The casting is competent when James Daly and Kim Hunter play (especially well) the title character's parents, who is played by James MacArthur (his first feature film), who played the same role in the TV version in the first time he appeared on the small screen. Look for James Gregory and Whit Bissell in supporting roles.
