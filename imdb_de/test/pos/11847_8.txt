I was very impressed with this movie, though for the comedy. It's not always the sharpest, funniest humor, but I found it fitting for every scene. <br /> <br /> The flow of the movie is certainly a bit confused, sometimes confusing, but that's how the characters feel. Sometimes we see a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a crucial discourse about relationships. This may be a bit frustrating for some viewers, but it brings me closer to the dilemma of characters with irregular chaos. <br /> <br /> The acting is great of all. I'm a big Andy Richter fan, but I did not go crazy, as everyone else does. He did very well, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show for me, both in their own way. Jay Mohr plays as expected, if you have seen him in other films. I always liked him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very funny and provides some good foundations for some types of relationships. For relationship questions and problems some films try to surprise. The conclusions given here are not surprising, but it is entertaining to see them revealed throughout the film.
