I read the comments on this movie before I went to see it and did not expect much, but as a B-movie, that's curiosity. I think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these kinds of things, but I seriously thought it was great. People should only see it for the experience because it is absolutely unique. Do not expect much of it. The acting is bad, transitions were obviously made on a PC etc. Definitely a B-movie, but still worth a look. Very funny. Light blood and some questionable subjects, so probably not something to show your Gran, but for the more adventurous viewer, I would say it's a must.
