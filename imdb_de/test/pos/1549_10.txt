In the 60s, this cruel study of Joy, a young proletarian woman, was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach, who became one of the most respected and respected British filmmakers of all time. At the time, I knew little about Brecht, the politics or the reality of the underprivileged, and I was pretty impressed with the film's aesthetics, its free style, its strict color cinematography, and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also very surprised that Terence Stamp (who had become a celebrity thanks to "Billy Budd", "The Collector" and "Modesty Blaise") had so little time on screen. Although 20th Century Fox distributed "Poor Cow" in Panama, Loach did not stay in mainstream cinema (which is hardly the movie) and I lost contact with his films. I have just heard of his successes "Kes", "Family Life", "Black Jack". until I caught up in the 80s. By the way, the beautiful title song by Donovan is available in his anthology "Troubadour".
