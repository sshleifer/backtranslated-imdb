A teenage girl gets the horse of her dreams and is trained by a former jockey to take part in London's Grand National Steeplechase. A fine adaptation of the classic children's book, with an outstanding, initial performance by Taylor as an energetic yet polite boy. Rooney is fine as a coach, although he has some melodramatic moments. Crisp and Revere are pretty good as Taylor's loving parents. Filmed in Technicolor, it looks beautiful. The problems are that there are crazy elements, nothing interesting happens and it gets a little too long. The race is exciting, but could have been much more.
