What makes "Fire" even more attractive, in addition to its magical art, is the touch of feminism and rebellion. In my opinion, the character of Shabana Azmi is a symbol of Indian women's protest against Indian society. The name of the movie and the scene in which Radha goes through flames in her kitchen is a symbol of Lord Rama's wife, Sita of Hindu Mythology, who went through the fire to prove her impartiality, as she did in the movie is. The film could be a great inspiration for women, especially for those in the subcontinent, seeking freedom and taking control of their lives.
