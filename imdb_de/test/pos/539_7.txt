It's a movie that can be seen on TV and only once. I mean, it's good, but it's a bit too long and the plot is so well-known that it's not very original, but it's not boring. The best thing about the film is the performances. Natalia Portman and Susan Sarandon are great actresses and in this movie they did a great job. I give a 7.
