I can understand that Barney can be annoying for some, but the hate he gets is very ridiculous. Barney was made easy from the beginning and the simplicity is not bad, especially for the young people he entertains. Personally, I find this show very undervalued. Barney & Friends is a very instructive show in my opinion, and even 17 years after his debut (and almost 21 years after the character's debut on home video) he proves again and again that he still appeals to young children. Maybe less so than in the early 90's, when Barney was the Hannah Montana back then, but he's still a classic. As a fan of Barney, I feel I should defend him in a way that does not look like spam. The way the purple teaches may be very simple and unrealistic, but would you prefer to hear about war? Be grateful that someone (a costumed dinosaur, but still) is there to comfort children and just let them be kids. Nowadays, I feel like we're getting our kids to grow up, and Barney is here to say that you can still be a kid in your heart. In addition, many of Barney's lessons on current episodes about plagiarism, honesty and yes ... even death could appeal to everyone, not just his target audience. In addition, our children need to learn to be kind and to respect others who they are, and help them with it. In short, Barney may be annoying for some people and I fully understand why, but cut him down a bit. All he and his friends (along with HIT Entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is help kids not only learn the skills they need, but also have fun and look at the positive aspects of life. If more people would listen to their children's favorite character and look at it with their eyes, we might not be so negative about it and possibly about life itself.
