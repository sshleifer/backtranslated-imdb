The funniest movie from the UK I've ever seen, "The Supergrass", tells of sex, drugs, cream teas and sea killing. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmonson), an average idiot, wants to impress his so-called girlfriend Andrea (Dawn French) because she thinks he is too law-abiding. In order for her to come along for a romantic getaway, he develops a program that may impress her and make her spend some time with him. The problem is, Dennis's lie is that he was somehow involved in an international drug ring, and when she tells her about it, a couple of police overhear his boast and puke him. And so begins this funny movie, full of smooth comedy and rough jokes. Dennis is beaten in the local pub, and to the delight of the arrested officers there seems to be no way out (Andrea's previous attempts to explain that everything was a lie were rejected by a witty tune from "Stand by Your Man". from the two officers). Then comes Commander Robertson (Ronald Allen), Chief Intelligence, Scotland Yard. He makes a deal with Dennis. If he helps him catch the drug smugglers, he will be released and allowed to do what he wants. Dennis agrees and collaborates with Harvey Duncan and Lesley Reynolds. The rest is an unforgettable rib tickling experience. Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Troy adds humorous colors to the film. His walk along the drydock against "Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Two Tribes" is superb and probably the best scene in film history. The two officers who snapped Dennis are wonderfully played by Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin, and Alexei Sayle as a motorcycle cop is a laugh! If you want to see something good on a Saturday night, I recommend that you rent it. You will not forget it!
