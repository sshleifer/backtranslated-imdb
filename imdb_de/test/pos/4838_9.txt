This was a very strong view of prejudice and group mentality. The cast consists of outstanding actors who do a remarkable job. The sets are beautiful and just a bit stylized. The art direction is first class, along with great cinematography. The story is curious and shows how prejudice and bigotry can easily thrive. It is disturbing because of its realistic violence and the representation of a rather typical community. I was very impressed.
