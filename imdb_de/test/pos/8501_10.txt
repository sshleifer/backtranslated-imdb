Denis Leary can sometimes be funny and smart and is always sympathetic, but that costs the cake! This show showed Leary's genius. <br /> <br /> The job is located in New York. Leary plays Mike McNeil, a hardened detective who is married, occasionally has drug problems, and has a girlfriend. McNeil has a serious attitude. So much does he drip in it. The area is filled next to McNeil with funny, interesting and sympathetic characters. An excellent cast too. All the episodes in this show are really funny and addictive. The one-liners in this show are everywhere. After hearing them you will be in stitches and a few minutes later you will laugh about it. The cases the area deals with are something else for stripping nuns, taking a hostage in the bathroom and much more are over the top. This show was too good. Could have grown legs to survive many more seasons. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: A great, fantastic show. I miss this show very much. All episodes of this show are great. You even get a belly laugh ... a lot. ABC made a big mistake when he gave the ax. Too bad that Leary did not revive the show for cable TV. Nevertheless, I give this show one of my highest recommendations. Truly a unique show.
