This film shows that the free enterprise system and the search for the almighty goat overcome all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately, the marketplace determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes this point. A conservative giveaway employee is being taken over by a group of street-wear African-Americans whose chairman is a black no-nonsense man who wants to make money and believes he can sell products by telling the truth. The film shows, however, that the market and the political system, no matter how much he tries to do otherwise, demands conformity, which does not make him any different from his predecessors. Interesting, unusual film.
