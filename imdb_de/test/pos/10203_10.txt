Here's another 1940s western I always look at when it comes to TCM or FMC, because although it's historically flawed, it's extremely entertaining and well-played, and it just left behind Randolph Scott, my favorite actor Gary Cooper. OK, fourth behind COOP, Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. But the movie itself is reasonably historical for me anyway and as I said, plays well and "flows" very well - I bet I've seen it 50 or 60 times and enjoy every spectator more than the previous one. I have it on tape from TCM, but I would buy it if it ever would appear on DVD. See it if you do not - I guarantee you will like it!
