I really like the show !! As part of Greek Life, I can say that some things are over the top, but overall it's still pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Rusty is a sympathetic main character, his roommate is HILARIOUS and the entire cast is entertaining in their own right. I like it to focus on individual situations as well as on the interpersonal relationships with the organizations. <br /> <br /> This show deals with everything, and they do it without cursing or anything so bad (how could it be with ABC?) family?). <br /> <br /> My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and pretty much everything from Kappa Tau. This show is a great starting place for her and I'm curious which doors will open. <br /> <br /> Please renew this show next summer, ABC Family. As I said, love, love, LOVE !!
