This movie is not about the lemonade or the French Connection. The Seven Ups are a group of elite police who use tactics that are not in line with the NYPD protocol. Scheider leads the group with his group or regular-looking boy. They monitor a local Costra Nostra cartel and things go awry when a police officer is found. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Richard Lynch is the meanest man in the movie (Invasion: America, Little Nikita). and his partner accidentally kill the policeman and run away from Scheider in the coolest chase scene I've ever seen. Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as the West Side up to George Washington and the Palisades Parkway in New Jersey. <br /> <br /> The stunt riders are fantastic and Lynch sets them free even though he looks scared of the dangerous journey. Roy Scheider is almost dead when his car rammed into the back of Mack Truck and tears down the roof of his vehicle. <br /> <br /> Things are coming to a head and you have to keep watching to follow such a sequence. Fast and intense, fresh for thirty years.
