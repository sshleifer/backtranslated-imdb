There are some movies that are loved by almost anyone you meet, and yet are a failure at the box office. Andaz Apna Apna, a smart and funny comedy, falls into this category. For once, an Indian director has kept the audience's sensitivity in mind and has not worked out a kader-khan type of petting style. The film is about two men who dream of wealth and try to achieve this by advertising a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds, while in the story many complexities emerge. The complexity contributes to the mere comedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the Street Smart, while Salman Khan performs an unexpectedly good fool. The villager, played by Paresh Rawal, and his henchmen Junior Ajit and "Kaliaa" make you laugh in your sleep. Although the film is borrowed from many other films, in spite of inferior camera works, and although it is sometimes "noisy", it remains one of the rare "funny" movies Bombay has found on films like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar films. It is sad that things did not go well at the box office because the producers return to their formulas and creativity is given up.
