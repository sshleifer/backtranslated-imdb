There are many, many older films that deserve to be transferred to DVD format. This is certainly one of them. An Anthony Quinn triumph! Numerous films show the victims of Nazi atrocities before and during the war, but I do not think any of them have gotten involved in the victim's and predator's psyche and this. Anthony Quinn was really a man for all seasons. He had the ability to portray the most humble creatures that had no human eyes, extreme animalism to a creature, and to make them credible to the public, watching without thinking what they had just experienced. Really one of our greatest artists. He is missing.
