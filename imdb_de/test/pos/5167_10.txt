My wife and I once saw this movie in 1989 and we liked it so much. We wanted to see him again. It was so moving that I called it a tear guard. The riddle Billings shared is really not a puzzle. Corner !! It seems he turns around every time something happens to him, all right, and I think it scared George a bit, considering he did not know what he was getting into. It just shows that even cold-hearted people can change with the right attitude. If only we could all treat each other the same, the world would be a better place. So far, we've searched the internet for a copy, now I finally have a connection with it, once I've found a copy I'll grab it.
