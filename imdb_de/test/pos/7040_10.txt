Meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it's impossible to count. <br /> <br /> In what was just a forerunner of the coming thing, Murray rules the screen in a way that can only be called a comic book championship. Tripper Harrison is one of the biggest comedy characters of the last 50 years. Being sarcastic all the time, smart when it has to be strict, when it has to be, and when worried when it suits him, Murray lays out snappers with this SNL glitter. The CITs are just awesome as they cower under the comical genius of Mr. Murray. The summer is not summer without a look at meatballs. One of the best comedies ever shown on screen.
