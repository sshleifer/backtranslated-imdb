"Let me ask you another question" Ha! What a great soon .. this movie was fantastic fantastic, great script. The only reason nobody noticed was the low budget. Everyone will agree that it's a cult, just like Donnie Brasco. It shows a young Joe Pesci again as a gangster, this movie is one of the cults. It had a couple of sopranos and some good chases had his idea for the sopranos when he saw this and found Scorsese Joe Pesci while watching it, proving it must be a great thing. I have to admit that they showed a brilliant scene in which they threw peanuts to a camp pianist, "Stop with the friggen peanuts".
