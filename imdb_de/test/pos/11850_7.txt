Content: Ed and Alice are engaged. They live together and live the dull life. He slept before he met Alice. She has much less experience. She decides that she has to sleep before the wedding. He agrees very reluctantly that both should see other people for a while. <br /> <br /> At first he is not feeling well. His wild days are behind him and he is just satisfied. Until one day Alice comes back and tells him she messed around with a random guy; who, of course, starts falling into her. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a bad idea that puts a heavy strain on the relationship. <br /> <br /> Good movie. You can see that the train crash is coming, but still good. <br /> <br /> Worth a rental.
