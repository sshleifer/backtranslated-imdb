Another fantastic offer from the Monkey Island team, and although it took a long time to survive the farewell to Ron Gilbert, it was another worthy rate. My only criticism is that it looked a bit too short compared to the two predecessors, even if this could be the case due to a glorious lack of floppy disk. Roll on MI4.
