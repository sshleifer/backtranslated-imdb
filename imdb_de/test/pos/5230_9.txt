Best Cinematography I've Ever Seen? Given the year the film was filmed, I was absolutely amazed and absolutely impressed by how much attention was given to the scenes and what seems to be authentic. Although I'm not a special western movie fan? Every scene is extremely detailed and it is insistent. There is a sincere connection to nature. Sometimes I'm overwhelmed with the amount of action that goes through the scenes, but I never get bored. I feel like I'm really looking into a time machine and looking back to the old west. I can recommend this film to anyone who deals with stage design, location planning and photography in general. It can be a humiliating film to experience in terms of the visual experience of this time of digital overhaul that we are now experiencing.
