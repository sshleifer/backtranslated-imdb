Externally, this film is better because of Vincent D'Onofrio (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this movie is as good as the 1982 version. In a sense, the 1999 version is better because it's more up-to-date (a decade in comparison to the 27 years). The actors in the film were great, as were Terry Kinney (McManus of HBO's Oz) as James Daly and Tony Shalhoub (USA Monk) and Gary Sinise (CSI: NY). Although the dialogue was changed for the contemporary audience, most of the writing remained unchanged. There were things that were not included in the 1982 version, which gives the drama a boost and comedy, but in the end, this movie was just as great in the 1982 movie: In Character: Vincent D'onofrio, who plays Phil Romano , was excellent, better than Paul Sorvino in terms of Stacy Keach and Terry Kinney from George, I would praise Shalhoub, and between Martin Sheen and Sinsise as Tom I would say that Sinise wins.
