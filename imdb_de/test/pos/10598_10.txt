"Haggard: The Movie" is well written, well directed and well played. There are lots of loud laughs and some great skateboarding scenes with Margera. The scenes from West Chester, PA, are beautifully filmed and the script is just funny. What I like about the movie is that it's not just a sweet love story or another version of "Jackass," but a bleak-funny look at separations from a different perspective. Most dissolution films show a naive woman being thrown off by a fraudulent man. Then she goes to Mr. Right and tells her cheating ex that he should get lost. In this film, the emotional roller coaster ride of a cranky man is illuminated ... without taking yourself too seriously. Ryan Dunn does a great job as a cranky man and with Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo as your best friends trying to help you through this hard time. How can you take everything too seriously? It's obvious that Margera and Co. are incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera. I'm looking forward to her future films and aspirations.
