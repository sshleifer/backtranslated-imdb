This is the only Pauly Shore movie you should ever see. OK, it's the only one I've ever seen, and I think I've made good decisions. I usually find Shores Shtick tired, but he is very funny in this movie. Actually, the script is pretty funny and Shore does not overwhelm the other actors with his ... what do you call it? Tomfoolery? Anyway, this is a funny, if ultimately memorable film. --Frink-3
