This is from the same creative team behind "Better Off Dead," but is not quite as good as this amazing teen comedy. It's a lot of fun, but it's all over the place and not that funny. Curtis Armstrong is used to less action (he was hilarious in "Better Off Dead", Bobcat Goldthwaite is weird, Cusack is good, Demi Moore is Demi Moore (only with better hair here.) Overall, it's fun, and as a person From Cape Cod, the feeling of an 80's summer in Cape Cod is very effective, and for some reason this movie feels more "mainstream" than "better off dead." There are not so many absurdities in the left field here You are a fan of John Cusack and Savage Steve Holland, it is definitely recommended.
