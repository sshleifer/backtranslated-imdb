Peter Segal's 1995 commercial hit and now cult classic "Tommy Boy" is a funny movie, an evergreen entertainer. Chris Farley is a talent we will never forget !!! <br /> <br /> 'Tommy Boy' is a simple story told in the funniest and craziest way. Farley & Spade are on a journey filled with relentless laughter, even the part of Rob Lowe is damn funny. I remember that when I was a child I saw Tommy Boy again and again. It was one of my favorites from my childhood, and it will always stay that way. Even today, when it comes to TV, I remain a diehard fan. I'm pretty obsessed with this movie. <br /> <br /> The direction of Segal is great. Chris Farley may have died in 1997, but remains alive for me. What an actor! Look at his work in "Tommy Boy", he is so relaxed. He later provided fantastic performances in films such as "Berverly Hills Ninja" and "Almost Heroes," but his work here is his best performance to date! I love you, Farley! Spades, on the other hand, are better than ever. He is an outstanding actor in every way! <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" rules .... 100 thumbs up from this author!
