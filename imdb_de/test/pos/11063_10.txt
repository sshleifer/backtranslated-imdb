I grew up in New York City and every afternoon ABC showed the 4:30 movie - Saratoga Trunk was one of the first films I remembered as a kid. I loved this movie and it stayed with me for years. I looked at it recently and still thought it was great - maybe I'm just a romantic - but I thought it was well done. I do not want to say that this movie was good just because of the lead actor - I really did not know who they were when I saw this movie for the first time - I guess I just knew what quality means as a kid. Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I especially loved to see old New Orleans in the time of this movie. If you ever have the opportunity to visit New Orleans, you should watch films showing the city at this time. If you see some of the old houses in the French Quarter (not just Bourbon Street) or the Uptown, you really can imagine life as it was 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I love old movies - this movie is a good movie for me !!
