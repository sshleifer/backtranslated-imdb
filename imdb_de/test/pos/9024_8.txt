This is a great movie for pure entertainment, nothing more, nothing less. It's enjoyable and a vague emotional film. <br /> <br /> A minor but irritating thing about the movie is that we do not know why Justine and Chas split up. Okay, most of the first relationships do not work for some reason, but they seemed more or less like a nice couple. <br /> <br /> In short, it's worth it to escape reality.
