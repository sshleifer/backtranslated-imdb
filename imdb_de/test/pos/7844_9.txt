This is a wonderful movie that plays in the romantic time of the Civil War. This movie is a must for Eastwood fans and Eastwood claims that this is one of his favorite movies he has made. I could not agree anymore. Attention! This is a spoiler - Eastwood dies in the end. Eastwood and director Don Siegel rightly argued that the end should be unexpected and, for some reasons, dissatisfied. They wanted to stick to the book, for one thing. Second, there can not always be a happy ending. Third, this was written during the Vietnam War - they wanted a negative statement about this terrible war of war, in which people died unnecessarily. I agree with all this. It's a wonderfully shot movie and I love most movies that involve civil war. It is more of a portrait of how fraudulent women can assume that they are more dangerous than men, so the title has much to do with the BEGUILED statement - to be betrayed. The song sung by Eastwood at the beginning and end of the film is yet another statement against not only the Civil War, but also the Vietnam War and, indirectly, the women who confront it during the film. Wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes NOTE: This movie is rated R for no reason. There is hardly any language, these are probably sex issues - but there is really no nudity. Excellent movie 9/10.
