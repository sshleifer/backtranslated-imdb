It seems that, no matter how many films are made on this subject, there will be no lack of stories from the Second World War. It is obvious that a conflict on such a scale as global warfare could enthrall filmmakers everywhere and provide them with ample material on which to base a story. The way in a different direction than in most mainstream films about the war is Dark Blue World, a film that does not deal with the traditional big battles of war, does not tell the story of many of its main characters, and does not even focus on soldiers one of the great Allied or Axis powers. Instead, Dark Blue World ventures into the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied nations. <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful piece of work to present the challenges that Czech pilots flying under the British Royal Air Force find it expressing their frustration with both the language barrier between them The other airmen felt, as well as the fact that they were forced not to take revenge on the Germans until they were retrained. <br /> <br /> Dark Blue World Works Quite Well Outside The war movie arena is a story about human relationships. Between the two main characters and an Englishwoman develops a love triangle that complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers. This relationship is consistently well implemented and in many places develops almost to a father-son relationship. <br /> <br /> The aerial combat in the film is among the best and is also very interesting in exploring the cultural challenges mentioned above, as men have difficulty in flying their machines, fighting the enemy and giving orders and answers to pass on a foreign language. The tension and struggle of these scenes continue the tension between the men on the ground, as well as the tension on the ground, which is noticeable in the air. <br /> <br /> This can not be a movie for everyone. The hardcore war fanatic may find his study of relationships a bit daunting, but on the whole he is an excellent movie, regardless of whether he is warlike or not.
