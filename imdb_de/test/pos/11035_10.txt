If it was possible to award a 10+, this would be the movie I would choose. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie on TV many, many years ago - and luckily enough video was ready for it. Now my video copy is old, the video technology is outdated and I'm starting to worry that I might not enjoy the pleasures of this movie for much longer. As a film about the relationship between man and nature, he surpasses anything that has been shown before or since. How can the film industry unnoticed and forgotten such a classic? If there is such a thing as a lobbying / pressure group pushing for the re-release of this movie, count me and send me the details Anyone can release this in the market today.
