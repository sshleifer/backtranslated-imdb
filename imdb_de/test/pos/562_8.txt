Anyone looking for a series of "Law and Order" or "CSI" would have to look elsewhere, since the most basic elements of police or forensic work in this case were completely ignored. <br /> <br /> A murder took And all the police did was get a 15-year-old boy off the street and bring him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is that the guy who did it? Sure, the old man believed that the boy had to be guilty in the police car. it does not matter that he did not really look like the real killer and was dressed completely differently. He must have shrunk, changed his age by 5-10 years and changed his clothes. <br /> <br /> The police made no effort - and they admitted it! They did not search for evidence, did not interview other witnesses, and confessed to a 15-year-old. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this compelling view of the criminal justice system is that it happened right in Jacksonville, Florida, across the street. Now let everyone talk about "southern justice".
