As another poster mentions, Ch. 56 (a local Boston television station) repeatedly showed this over the years on Saturday afternoon. They have paired it with the first installment, Return of the Ginat Majin. Now I have not seen it since ... but it never left me. Apart from the cruel synchronization and faded colors, this was a pretty good fantasy. Technically, it's not a horror ... until the statue comes to life in the end. It's just a village ruled by a bad man. There is a huge stone statue that the villagers pray to help them ... to no avail. But things go too far, the statute comes alive and destroys the bad guys ... but then it's the same for the good guys! Well done with some cool special effects in the end (LOVED getting rid of the main villain). It was also an enchanted forest processed, which was also interesting somehow. <br /> <br /> No masterpiece, but an unusual combo fantasy / horror movie. Catching - but not when it comes to synchronized printing.
