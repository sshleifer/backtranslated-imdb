My sister, dad, and I are really excited about D & D, and one night we rummaged in Netflix for a movie that we saw when this movie appeared. We thought we would give it a try, and in the end I almost died laughing. The writing and acting in this film is incredible! Funny characters, great interaction and funny moments have kept us in stitches all the time. I love this movie! For those who are unfamiliar with Dungeons & Dragons, this may not be so useful, but it's still a good movie. This just shows that movies do not need astronomical budget and big actors / actresses to be successful. Check it out if you want a good, clean comedy.
