This is a great documentary and the comments above give a brief overview of how great it was, so I do not want to repeat the same compliments. But Faith resembles that a Turkish-oriented man, who probably knows more about this country than an ordinary European, falls into the trap of Orientalism, which is usually the case of other Western artists. But come on, you're Turkish blood and your movie could go deeper and describe what's beyond "Beyoglu's Old Town". It is a missed opportunity for Akinfor for this reason. The performances of Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are a small glimpse of the movie and Ceza (a very talented Turkish rapper) doing some tricks on American gangsta rappers. I will recommend this movie to my American friends.
