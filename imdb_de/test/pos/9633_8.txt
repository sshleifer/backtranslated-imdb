Basically, this is a very good movie. However, it is very different from Seagal's other films, which some of his fans can unfortunately switch off. Unlike some other films, this does not seem like a Seagal vehicle. You can also see many other characters and all of Mr. Seagal's actions are not the same as we saw before. The idea that he is an "intellectual" in anything other than bombs and other weapons is a nice change. Although there are some unrealistic parts of the movie (some are more obvious than others), you can generally let them slide because the movie is fun. <br /> <br /> It boils down to this: if you're sorry for a classic Seagal action movie, but you'll be disappointed. Look at it anyway, to have fun. If you're open to seeing Seagal without action, it's worth taking a look. I personally believe that this is one of the best works he has done for some time. <br /> <br />
