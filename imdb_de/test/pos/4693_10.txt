This HTV series is beautiful. I strongly recommend to watch the movie. It has everything it should: remarkable script, strong characters, beautiful scenery and extraordinary atmosphere. Add some environmental notes from Clannad and you'll get an unforgettable picture. I love every HTV adventure movie I've seen: Return to Treasure Island, Smuggler, Adventurer, but Robin of Sherwood beats them all. I would like to thank the entire HTV production team and especially Richard Carpenter for giving me a lot of adventure and excitement. I have the DVD release in my small movie collection. I am very sorry that such films are not made anymore.
