Imagine "24", completely uncensored, with a free license to explain the situation in detail and show how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill / prevent them, and you have one Presentation of how good this TV series is. People in the US have long known that Showtime is the new HBO. They offer much better, most modern and powerful shows, and this is no exception. The show takes viewers through building a sleeper cell to an attack attempt, taking into account important aspects such as faith, religion, funding, resources and needs. For the uninitiated, there is much to learn about the Muslim faith here. Unlike the mainstream shows like "24," where the terrorists are just nutcraps that the good guys shoot at, their purpose and considerations are scrutinized. What gives the show more credibility is the latest technology used by the Cell / FBI and the authentic settings in Europe, the US and the Middle East. No expense is spared to tell the story accurately. The cast is relatively unknown, but the drama is superb with the help of a tightly written script that keeps the viewer up to date with many unexpected twists and turns. This show does not deserve the merit it deserves, and ironically, she herself is a bit drowsy, anyone who is interested in the genre needs to see
