Renowned Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský, best known in North America for his starring role as Jacob in the original Estonian / Czech production of Jacob the Liar, gives us a final brilliant performance as an 80-year-old rogue, who refuses to admit that he is about to die. <br /> <br /> Jirí Hubac's script is exquisite. Funny, moving and well developed. It explores both the topic of advanced age and the motivations of characters who are precariously strong and fragile, happy and unsettled. Frantisek (Vlastimil Brodský) and his best friend Eda (Stanislav Zindulka) stand up to all kinds of shenanigans and make sure they make the most of their last days. Meanwhile, Frantisek's wife prepares for her death, saves for burial funds and chastises Frantisek for his infinite childhood and irresponsible attitude. Her son is taking over her apartment and taking her to a retirement home, but Frantisek does not want to hear about that. He wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh. He wants to help and love and give ... but at what price? <br /> <br /> This beautiful play by the talented director Vladimír Michálek is certainly fascinating and funny at the same time. It makes you think about how we live our lives and why we live our lives. It brings to the foreground the simple story of a charming, unruly old man, allowing us to think about and feel what life is all about. After an active career of more than 40 years, it is a bit bleak I know that Vlastimil Brodsk died in April 2002 and was no longer suffering from terminal cancer. However, it is uplifting to think that he had the chance to be part of such a moving script and to be the catalyst of this ode for a happy age that has not even hit the waves it creates in the North American repertoire. <br /> <br /> After the international success of Jan Hrebejk's "Divided We Fall (2000)", it becomes clear that Czech cinema has indeed something to offer the world. This movie is at least a must.
