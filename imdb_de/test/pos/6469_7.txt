John Cassavetes is on the run from the law. He is at the bottom of the pile. He sees Negro Sidney Poitier as equal and they quickly become friends and form a sort of alliance against a bully from a foreman played by Jack Warden. As someone who has worked in a warehouse himself when I was younger, I can tell you that the warehouse struggles, along with tumbling panniers and hanging hooks, are as realistic as they can get. I was involved in such fights even though nobody was killed. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Sidney Poitier's widow is a variation of Shakespeare's Shylock "Do not bleed me?" This is an anti-racist film that was much needed back then. <br /> <br /> All three main characters - Warden, Cassavetes and Poitier - are outstanding, with Warden being the most outstanding of the three.
