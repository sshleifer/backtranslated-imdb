A serious movie about troubled teenagers in Singapore, a country I do not know much about, but I have the mistaken impression that all the children there are disciplined and controlled by their family and their government. Well, I guess I was wrong, just like in other cities / countries, they also have their troubled teenager, who also has the not so startling rebellious lifestyle of drugs, fighting, bad language and ... many other obvious signs of Being a Bad Boy The surprising part of this movie is not really about how these kids walk around, about themselves and other problems, but rather about the subtle gays that hide behind their so-called loyalty between them. The connection between these "brothers" could very well stem from an unconscious gay tendency in this boy. Although it's not uncommon for str8 guys to have a very close friendship with each other, but watch this movie carefully if you visit all sorts of gay film festivals, and I would not be surprised if it gets more awards this direction !
