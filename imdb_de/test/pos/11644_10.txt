I've seen this movie many years ago and it never left my list of all the best movies ever made. When I saw it for the first time, I just started what has become a lifelong passion for justice. There was an interesting perspective on the death penalty and it also gave me some thought. <br /> <br /> If you have a cast like this, you rightly have the presumption that this will all be fabulous. This is by far the best role I've ever seen as Sean Penn was played (along with I on Sam). He nails the role, does not glorify his actions. He manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the film that I think was very important. Until the end, he does not try to be understood as something other than what he is. He is a sick man who regrets his past but still apologizes. In the end, he is able to redeem his self-esteem as much as a convicted (and guilty) killer with the help of Susan Sarandon's character, Sister Helen Prejean. Your character taught me about the goodwill of others without letting me forget how awful the actions of a person can be and without finding excuses for it. I was surprised to see a little cameo by Jack Black in this movie, given the weird man he's become today! I loved this movie for personal reasons as well as film art reasons. And in my opinion, this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie has left the book far behind.
