This is NOT your usual police work, in which the characters were only subordinated to gun battles and chases. The previous episodes are more realistic and intelligent. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something that says a lot of Rambo-style police, you will not find it here. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 9. I wish this series lives for a long time. Morse is excellent!
