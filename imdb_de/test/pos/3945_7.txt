Another round with the Monkey King to the west .... somehow. <br /> <br /> In the middle of an action, the film only starts from the first image. <br /> <br /> A monk and his three disciples go to a city to receive the holy surahs who will bring peace to the world as soon as they are translated and spoken to the world. But a wicked force has incarcerated and kidnapped all the children of the city. The evil force wants the monk, because if you eat it, you will live forever. The battles fight against the forces of darkness before they forcibly bring the monk to safety (the monk believes he can easily win by arguing with the bad guys). The monk ends up with a bunch of lizard goblins who want to eat it sometime ... but the bad guys arrive and he sets out on an odyssey with the ugliest of the crowd. Can a movie start from the rails going off the rails? Do not get me wrong. I really liked this movie, but the movie is very scattered and everywhere plot and logic disappear, as some scenes just pop up in the middle of the action without knowing how we got there. Rescuing the disciples is completely out of the left field. This is one of the most chaotic movies I've seen in a long time, but I had to laugh and smile as if I could not get out. The movie starts and you have no idea where things are, and what appears on the screen is either interesting or funny and you just go along. How do we get from thing to thing? It is full of strange clues and strange clues as we go from heaven over the ocean into space, where the chest of a mythical beast knows where God is. This movie floats around everywhere, which makes it fun because you do not know where it's going to end (and the reason is "to keep the details to a minimum") and it's funny, sometimes very funny. <br /> <br /> And the action is very good, although a good deal of it is an unencumbered CGI animation (which provides some cool images, the golden staff, the spider attack formation, the angel in flight .. .) And it's very, apart from action and comedy, this is actually a wonderful love story: it's the story of an ugly goblin and a monk who eventually falls in love (and has other complications.) It's an interesting look at the nature of Love and that which is true love .You'll be moved. <br /> <br /> Although I liked it a lot, I was still upset about its scatter-shot construction every time we got to a bump Come on the road, enjoyment is a pleasure: the uneven You lead out of the film and make it realizable How much is begged from other sources? <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth seeing, as there are many moments to choose from. Just be prepared for some bumps and you have a good time.
