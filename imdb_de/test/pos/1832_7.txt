By that I mean that I've always been a fan of Bonnie Hunt ... She adds life to every character she plays, and she did a wonderful job making her directorial debut. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, this is a chick movie ... But in the back of my mind, it's a wonderful story, it touches a lot of emotions and triggers all kinds of reactions. <br /> <br /> This film shows the real life like people with the right life like situations. (I have to rule out the coincidence that makes up the bulk of the movie.) <br /> <br /> It's a love story ... not just of a man and a woman, but of love for family, friends and lover ones over (even pets). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. Is it worth the rent or the purchase.
