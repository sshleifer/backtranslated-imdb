I am surprised that this well above-average '80s comedy reaches only 5.2 from all IMDB voters. Dan Ackroyd makes his usual satirical turn as a scammer who uses a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prison doctor. He moves back to California to start his work by giving advice on a radio show purporting to be the infamous Dr Lawrence Baird. The only person who knows he is a cheater is the drunken priest (Walter Matthau), who is spoiled by Ackroyd's new wealth after beating him. Charles Grodin also provides a good fringe benefit. I think this film deserves the same credibility for its genre as 'Ferris Bueller' or 'Trading Places'. 7.5 / 10
