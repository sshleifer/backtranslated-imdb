I stopped watching "The West Wing" after Aaron Sorkin stopped writing and producing. It just was not the same. Imagine my thrill watching a movie he has written again. It's been a long time - the American president A Few Good Men. His screenplay was a nice mix of humor and tragedy. He made a compelling story believable and made me cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was unbelievable as a small congressman in Texas whose voters just wanted lower taxes and wanted to keep their guns. It was not a hard job, so he had plenty of time to fool around - and he did. His office staff looked like he was in the Playboy Mansion. As he allegedly said, "You can teach them to write, but they can not teach you to grow your tits." Despite his sexist stance, which fits in well with a Texas congressman, they were extremely loyal, especially his colleague, Amy Adams (Junebug & former Hooters wife) made something in Afghanistan, perfectly played by Julia Roberts; and a terrible CIA agent honored by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you've got a movie worth telling. What do you want more in the cinema?
