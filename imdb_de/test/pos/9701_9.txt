I've long been a big fan of the Cky videos, Jackass and Viva La Bam. They had a great run and I expected that my laugh would eventually come to an end. But not yet. This movie kept my mouth open all the time. I still laugh by accident. I went to the theater with low expectations and thought it would not be better than the first one. Oh, how incredibly wrong I was. <br /> <br /> There were many great moments in the movie. If you're squeamish, you do not like random, raw humor, or if you did not like the first movie, you probably will not like it. But with that said, I almost moistened my pants because I laughed so hard. There were various pranks, masochistic humor, toilet humor, puke, laughter, some big falls and massive damage inflicted on all cast members. Ryan Dunn has even branded Bam's back with an image that's stuck there for a long time. I'm sure you can only imagine how raw this movie is. <br /> <br /> No pain, no gain? Law? This movie has already worked well so theaters all over America are laughing so much that they wish it could last longer. I know that I did it. This movie did not feel short at all, especially as the credits continued to film. But I still wish it could have gone on forever. Let's just wait and see when you release Jackass number 3! Overall, a great movie, if you can overcome the male nudity and a few morbid pictures. Keep your children away from this movie. You do not have to see that, at least until you're older. Support the crew and BUY THIS when it appears on DVD! I know that I will.
