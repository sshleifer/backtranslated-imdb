This film is all about people. This movie was for years my favorite cartoon of all time. <br /> <br /> Are not the simplest things that make life more interesting ?! We humans are so meek, compassionate, funny and caring for a moment - we invent the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with the least amount of effort in the next moment. In our short lives, we destroy our world, each other and often our own lives, as if we spend the rest of our lives repairing what we have destroyed. Sometimes there is nothing to fix! <br /> <br /> This film can entertain, educate and even help us to recognize what is wrong in our lives! Life is short and can be even shorter! The end is far too optimistic, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> I love Richard Condie's spirit and what he does with it! <br /> <br /> Enjoy <br /> <br /> H.K.
