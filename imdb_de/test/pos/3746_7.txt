Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) have just celebrated their engagement announcement in France with family and friends when he receives a letter inviting him to visit an ancestral castle in Scotland. Gerald's uncle has reportedly gone ill and has asked Gerald, the only heir, to attend. Gerald goes to Scotland and leaves his future bride behind. A few weeks pass and he does not come back. Concerned, Kitty sends out telegrams, but does not hear from her fiance. Four more weeks pass, and Kitty finally receives a strange response from Gerald, who breaks off the engagement and asks her to continue her life. Kitty is unwilling to give up her relationship and seek answers. She jumps on a plane and decides to pay Gerald a visit. She is accompanied by her sober aunt Edith (Katherine Emery, known for her starring role in the classic chiller ISLE OF THE DEAD). When Kitty and Edith arrive at the MacTeam estate, they immediately suspect that something strange is in progress. For beginners, Gerald seems to be twenty years old within weeks. Secondly, the once so nice and charming man has developed into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands that he leave the castle and never come back. When Edith suffers a mild cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to get to the bottom of things. Why is Gerald so cold and cruel to the woman he was? marry? Why is Gerald against a society? Why is the house rules saying that guests must be locked in their bedrooms at night? Why are guests not allowed to enter certain areas of the property, such as: B. Gerald's bedroom and a large tail labyrinth? And what does this strange dragging noise do every night? These are just some of the questions THE MAZE poses. The film actually does a good job of building up mysteries and intrigues. They are really interested in what's going on and are patiently waiting for the solution to explain the strange events that are taking place. And then it happens ... I definitely do not want to ruin the finale of this movie because you know better, if you do not know, but it requires one of the most incredible and breathtaking, funniest twists I've ever seen in any movie. It's wonderfully ridiculous in some ways, but it also requires a pretty solid little b / w puzzle and sends it straight into the Z-grade lock territory. And yet, this end seems so out of place that you probably will not forget it as soon as you see it. <br /> <br /> Despite the end (or maybe only partially because of the end) I really liked the strange bird It is extremely talkative and moves slowly for the duration of the run but I managed to keep my interest in it to keep. Director William Cameron Menzies (who in the same year made the well-known INVADERS FROM MARS famous) is best known as a double Oscar winner, and his stage sets are also really interesting. It's almost a silent movie feeling, with model works for some outdoor spaces, painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As with any good castle, there are also secret passages and long stairs. This one also has a few rubber skins for a good measure. <br /> <br /> Some actors are a bit stiff and awkward, but I liked most of the cast. Hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who, despite her beauty and talent, unfortunately did not seem to let it through. Emery, who can also play in framing shots narrators at the beginning and end of the film, is decent enough as a superior and cautious aunt. My favorite, however, was Michael's godfather as the silver-haired, sinister servant who does that weird upright zombie walk every time he steps up the stairs. In smaller roles on board are also Hillary Brooke (who played the title role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery THE WOMAN IN GREEN) and Lilian Bond (WALES THE OLD DARK HOUSE). Of course, Carlson also starred in IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, and several other horror movie films, so you have a pretty good cast for genre fans. I tell you!
