The influences of other science fiction and thriller films and stories are evident in this film. The movies I can think of are Alien, Aliens and Starship Troopers. The story itself is fairly straightforward and not all the original, hibernating space travel, crash landing on a planet without apparent life and an "abandoned" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, different types of people force them to approach each other's survival, while the body is counting. This kind of movie is always fun as long as it is done well. I think Pitch Black was well done. The characters are interesting and you want to know more about them the longer the movie goes, and I think people will be surprised who creates it and does not make it. Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the stereotypically convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physical strength, a high tolerance to pain, and can comfortably see in the dark. You know he'll do the right thing in the movie someday because it's hinted in the entire movie that he could have a conscience about things. Cole House is a drug addict bounty hunter, who is likely to be a real villain in many ways compared to Riddick, as his character reveals throughout the movie. It is very likely that he is bravest when the odds and firepower are in his favor. A very self-serving character who gets what he deserves in the end. <br /> <br /> Radha Mitchell plays the copilot on the convicted ship, who is torn from deep sleep because the ship has run through a meteor swarm or the end of a commentary. She finds the pilot dead in his sleeping chamber and tries to land the ship, which leads us to discover the potentially lethal mistake of this character - fear of responsibility, accountability and leadership. Her character in the short span of the story is likely to grow the most by actually gaining a conviction, taking responsibility and not standing around, waiting to be stolen by aliens eating at night. In some strange way, she connects to the more and more distant human side of Riddick, who in the end respects her, because she makes her decisions and sticks to them. You would expect it, but I think you will be slightly surprised at what characters survive this shattering experience. This movie is an entertaining train wreck that is currently running. Look at it! <br /> <br />
