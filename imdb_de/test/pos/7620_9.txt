I loved this movie. Not as great as "50 First Dates", but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends. Yes, the plot was "sweet" and maybe even unbelievable, but what's so bad about a good movie? Drew as Josie and her romance with the teacher is so cute and brother baseball wannabe adds to the good feeling of the movie. What's so bad about a good movie that the whole family can enjoy? Without being embarrassed while watching with your kids! Drew is a great actress who, for the most part, is not appreciated at all. This is definitely one of her best roles!
