The author / director Gilles Mimouni, who created this curvy tale of betrayal and betrayal, is honored. While keeping the utmost in control, he keeps the audience at a distance and never allows them to fully inform themselves about the event. Even his clever solution lets you guess. <br /> <br /> The three central performances are also first class. Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci do everything they can to complete the puzzle. Jean-Philippe Ecoffey reinforces his supporting role. To give away action details or character traits would not be fair. <br /> <br /> Thierry Arbogast uses the camera effectively to guide us through this mystery, and working with Cardine Biggerstaff keeps the story one step ahead. The theme of Peter Chase is sublime in his marriage to the ideal of the screenplay. <br /> <br /> Many say Gilles Mimouni is trying to put some deeper issues on love. For me, this is simply a haunting, elusive puzzle that weaves a fascinating web. Only the French are capable of such a temptation. Hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon <br /> <br /> Nobody likes the thriller much like the French. If they got it right, they got it right. <br /> <br /> Vincent Cassell is intriguing, as deceitful Max, Romane Bohringer as the new Lisa, and Monica Bellucci is the first Lisa. The act of Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and deadly crossed wires. <br /> <br /> All the best must be due to his manipulation of the skillful action and the achievements of the three main lines. Jean-Philippe Ecoffey, like Lucien, is strong and emotional. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video
