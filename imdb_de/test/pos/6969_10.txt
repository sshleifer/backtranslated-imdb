Ghoulies IV might not be the best of the series, but it's not so bad if you do not take it seriously, you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see Peter Liapis returning Johnathan Graves, who has stopped using magic and become a detective, is still thinking about what happened in Ghoulies. The plot is about a woman named Alexandra, who is Johnathan's ex-girlfriend breaking into a museum. He takes a red gemstone and uses her friend, Faust, who is a dark side of Johnathan, but he needs the gemstone for it into the real world, and John is sent to hell. <br /> <br /> Something goes wrong and Alex loses the gem, so she has to find a new one as she leaves the gate open and two little ghoulies called Lite and Drak appear. They are not the true ghoulies because they look like men in a troll costume wearing a mask, but that does not matter, as they are sometimes humorous. <br /> <br /> Lite and Dark need to find Johnathan as he can Bring them home so they run around causing havoc while trying to find Johnathan. Another difference is that the two ghoulies are the good guys, unlike those in previous films. <br /> <br /> I found Ghoulies IV good, but this movie might not be for everyone budget movies like Troll 2.
