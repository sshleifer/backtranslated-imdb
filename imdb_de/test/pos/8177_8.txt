This movie is excellent (I have seen the French version). There are many subplots (which usually distract from the whole), but they unfold well and are in line with the main theme, "Discovery of Your Own Self." In fact, the entire film (apart from its background) is the journey to the discovery of one's self (or that of another). Is the king really a "good peacenik monarch" trying to "wage war to end all wars" or is he just a disturbed, bloodthirsty hijacker? Is he a true king? Is the Queen Mother's companion just a lusty, career-oriented sock puppet or rather an ingenious, courageous person? Will the lady / concubine know who the king really is? What is between the king and the old chancellor? What is the secret everyone knows but does not say? What is the real reason why the assassin quit his "job"? Subplots (something I do not like very much) are handled well and watch until the end. The scenes are well made and CGI fits in well without going overboard. The tension is well maintained and the actors are up to the task. There are many brain-damaged smiles, but that's the way to behave at the king's court (as the lady / concubine complains). Realistic movie without superhero moments. This Chinese movie shames Hollywood cardboard potatoes (Gladiator, etc.).
