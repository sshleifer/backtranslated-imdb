This movie is not the scariest of times, but it's a great example of a 1980s horror movie - low budget, no stars, many imaginative death scenes, and enough nudity to keep teenagers in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun, and the three bad kids play their role well. A nice starting point for Just Say, where Julie Brown reveals her talents early in her career. This movie is not seen by many, but for fans of the 80s horror, it is a must.
