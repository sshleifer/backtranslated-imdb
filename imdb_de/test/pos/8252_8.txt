I remember that I saw this movie in the mid-80s, he thought it was a well-played and well-functioning piece. I now work at Berkeley Square quite a lot and had to get a DVD to remind me how little the area has changed, even though my office is only 30 seconds away from "the bank". Even Jack Barclay's dealership still sells Bentleys and Rolls Royces. <br /> <br /> It looks like the DVD will soon be released for Region 2. The region 1 copy I is of very poor quality. Let's hope they cleaned it up. <br /> <br /> Only the slightly seedy escape sequence from the court spoils an otherwise good movie, but I think he agrees with the capern tag the movie goes with.
