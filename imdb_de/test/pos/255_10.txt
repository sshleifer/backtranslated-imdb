The 08th MS team consists of two hopeful romantics from different conflict situations. Aina, the Zeon officer, and Shiro, the new Federal Forces pilot, meet in a battle in space. During the 12-episode series (and a "movie"), the two discuss their love for each other as they try to deal with it, the war that surrounds them. It has a Romeo-Juliet romance and an unbeatable animation. By far one of the best American hitting shots. Dress up!
