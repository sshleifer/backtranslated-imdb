"Apocalypse Now Redux", Francis Ford Coppola's War Prison, is probably the most beautiful war movie I've ever seen. Capt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnamese soldier leading a very dangerous and highly classified mission in Cambodia to end the position of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a high-ranking and highly respected army man. Apparently he has become completely insane and has separated from the army, he founded his own small company and helped by a cultic successor to soldiers. Accompanying him on the river to Cambodia is a handful of naval men. Along the way, they meet several interesting people (especially Robert Duvalls Kilgore, a lieutenant colonel with a few screws) and some formidable situations. <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse" is less a historical war movie than a philosophical and psychological study. It's more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The running time of 'Apocalypse' is more than three hours, but the movie is so wonderfully thrilling and captivating that at the end of the movie I was really surprised at how much time had passed. The beautiful cinematography, however, is certainly what I noticed most. After seeing this movie, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The "Godfather" films were all sepia toned, and shadows created the feel of a baroque composition. In 'Apocalypse', the natural light is used in incredible ways, and the shadows, especially in the scenes with Brando and Sheen, almost become a living character, they are so penetrating and effective. Another beautiful scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes and came across a tiger. The sheer size of the surrounding foliage (leaves as tall as a house) made the characters almost lilliputian, but the colorization of the scene was unbelievable. While everything else was almost a muted gray, the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green, an effect that was particularly noticeable. Another really small positive moment in the movie was the great scene in which the helicopters escorting Duvall and their company attack the little village while playing Wagner. This could have been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack for the scene, but instead Coppola makes the song a real part of the scene. Duvall mentioned that he likes to play them as they approach them to scare hell out of them. <br /> <br /> The performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. Much of the money Brando had earned for the movie and the amount of trouble he caused. Regardless, he has shown strong performance for relatively short screen times. Sheen is absolutely outstanding - is this the first time I've seen him unleashed in a movie? and Duvall is a lot of fun when you see the crazy Kilgore. "Apocalypse Now" is a movie that has become so prevalent in pop culture (most of you know several select lines from the movie, "I love the smell of napalm in the morning" and so on), but little was known about it Surprises still to be experienced. I have not seen the original excerpt from 'Apocalypse Now', so I can not compare it to this newer cut, but this is a movie that should certainly be experienced. 8/10 <br /> <br /> - Shelly
