Visconti's "Death in Venice", located in Venice, mainly on the Lido, is a triumph of filmmaking that combines the outstanding qualities of Dirk Bogarde and the expert photography of the resort in all its different everyday moods. For those who love Venice, this is a movie that you appreciate. Mahler's music, which is heard throughout the film, adds to the drama. The mood it creates is not always happy. But what else would you expect from such a title? <br /> <br /> There are not many dialogues in the movie. Actually rather sparse. There are mainly background noise and chatter among the hotel guests. The fascinating part is to interpret the change of perspective between Gustav von Aschenbach, a well-known composer, and a slender teenager Tadzio, who now and then looks around the tables of the hotel, on the beach and in unusual places around Venice. They seem to look shyly at the other's presence, with something more than a smile, but later with a strong, intriguing and penetrating look. <br /> <br /> Every viewer will have his own interpretation. The composer has lost his own child. Is this behavior an expression of the yearning for the beloved child? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction to this fragile young man with his dazed, somewhat girlish look? Could he discover new inspirations for an unwritten musical masterpiece? Who knows? <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, this film shows the true spirit of the 19th century in Venice. The elegance of the ladies, the loungers on the sand, the children in their knee-costumes, the glow of sunsets and a general sense of contentment with the world. While some think that the tempo is sometimes quite slow, the film has a generally gentle quality, but with a smoldering indecision between two oppressed people. Be prepared for a sad and happy ending.
