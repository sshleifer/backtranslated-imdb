It's been almost 50 years since I saw "Jennifer" for the first and only time. I did not know the name of this movie until I looked it up on this website, but I've told many people (especially my grandchildren) that movies do not have to contain graphic details to scare you and make a big impact. The story cleverly introduces you to concepts that put Ida Lupino in a very dangerous situation. Each time Miss Lupino discovers a new "fact", she draws the viewer into her confusion and fear. <br /> <br /> This film has had such an impact on me that nearly 50 years later I have still listed it as one of the most frightening films I have ever seen. However, this film does not contain the blood and blood that became popular shortly after the film was made. It's amazing what effects a good story and great actors can have.
