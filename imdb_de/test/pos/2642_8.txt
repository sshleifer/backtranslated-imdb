There are a lot of people who do without these 80s movies, but these people may not have come of age at this time. I just started college when this movie was released so I really appreciated it then and my friends and I will occasionally joke about certain lines in the movie. As much as I liked Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli character in "Fast Times," I like Chris Penn's character "Tommy" more, because he's the main character with a more talkative role, as opposed to just a series of liners like Spicoli's Chris Penn probably put this movie in his VCR and use it to motivation to lose weight. Yes, Randy Quaid's subcontracting veterinarian, Vietnam, seems a bit out of place, but he convinces in the role. If there is someone who has not seen this movie yet, but liked the similar movies like "Fast Times" etc., I highly recommend it.
