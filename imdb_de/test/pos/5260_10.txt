People who do not like this movie seem to have an academic vendetta against it - those of us who do not own the original can really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> My husband, who has never seen the original, said "I do not want to watch a girl's movie." I assured him that "the women" is just a great movie, not a girl's movie. He had a great time. He was very happy to have left and enjoyed it more than the "boys" movie we saw the day before, "Burn After Reading." <br /> <br /> SPOILER: I even think that the new end is better. Maybe not so funny, but it was beautiful. At first I could not understand why they had made some changes to the plot. <br /> <br /> But when I got the end and Debra Messing was born and the first man in the movie, I cried. That's one thing you can love about men? They are our sons.
