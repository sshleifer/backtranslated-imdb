For me, a ten-star film is a film that never dies in my memory and yet can be viewed again and again with the same pleasure as the first time. This could be a technically flawed movie; The pleasure has nothing to do with spitting and polishing (my personal top ten are idiosyncratic, to say the least!). John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the few films that meets this criterion. <br /> <br /> I've been a sci-fi fan since I was a kid in the sixties and I read the short version of John W. Campbell's story on which the movie is based ("Who Goes There" ) before I saw the original, black-and-white Howard Hawks movie (as many people had that reputation was illegal on TV when I should have) in bed!). This film seemed to be near perfect, as so many see as a child in such circumstances: the tension, the inexplicable nature of the stranger, the photography; everything seemed to work. I have seen it many times in the years after that (and still do it when shown on TV). That's why I avoided the Carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of a favorite movie is, I think, always a mistake. When I watched it sometime in 1988/9, back on TV, because nothing else was going on, I realized that I had to change "always one mistake" to "usually one mistake"! Carpenter had produced something other than the original film, closer to the original story and really wonderful. From the opening scene of the helicopter and the husky, by the visceral disturbing scene in the dog fight to this end (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was addicted. The soundtrack alone lives with me - all I have to hear is very similar to this bass over snare drum beat, and I'm * in * the last scene again ... <br /> <br /> Up When I saw "The Thing", I had Carpenter as just another Monkey Ape, based solely on comments and reviews in the mainstream press. Since I've seen "The Thing," I think I've seen most of his films. I did not opt ​​for it, but if one shows up, it's enough just to see his name as a director. He is thoughtful and knows how to build a movie that reaches a point where something will be remembered. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen "The Thing" and science enjoys fiction, do yourself a favor - sit in a dark room, wrap yourself warm and get ready for it To improve memory!
