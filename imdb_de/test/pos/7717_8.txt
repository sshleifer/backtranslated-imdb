How do gay Asians manage in a culture that generally does not even recognize the concept of homosexuality? For millions of gay Hindus and Muslims, there seems to be little hope of ever living and being accepted and supported by their otherwise very close relatives. This is the most important point in Chicken Tikka Masala - probably after the western spicy dish with tender pieces of chicken! Jimmy is a typical young Asian who grew up in the UK from traditional parents with the narrow-minded and selfish views on marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of others, he is led into an arranged marriage that seems inevitable, even though he seems to be completely gay and deeply attached to a very handsome young man he lives with. He knows that the truth must be said, but he dreads the consequences, especially as his father seems terminally ill. And so he becomes involved in a network of deception that grows wider and wider with the development of the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully sensitive and in no way appreciative or patronizing for any group depicted. Acting is generally excellent, though in some places it seems a little bashful, as the director seeks humor rather than letting it blossom naturally. There are no prizes for photography or screenplays, but the film becomes a whole with the wonderful mood that comes at the very end - a feeling that all fathers around the world would learn from.
