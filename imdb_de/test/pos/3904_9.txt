I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) over 25 years ago when I was very young. A passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a kid, I liked everything Elizabeth Montgomery had in the lead role. This movie was (and is still) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as a rape victim in a case of rape and as a suspected murderer in the legend of Lizzie Borden. Her performance in The Victim as Kate, a frightened woman locked up in an isolated house during a storm and with a murderer behind her, is brilliant. If you like thrilling thrillers, this is a movie that keeps you up to the end on the edge of the seat. Another great achievement worth mentioning is that of Eileen Heckhart, who plays the sinister and suspicious housekeeper. Unfortunately, like most of Miss Montgomery's films, The Victim is not available on DVD. I believe that although it was released on VHS a few years ago, it is a rarity nowadays. I was fortunate to have recorded it when it aired on television about ten years ago. So I have a nice copy of this very good movie. Something you must have seen!
