Traffik is a really well done 6-hour drama about drugs (circa 1987). It tells three stories in parallel with how opium is grown in northeastern Pakistan, how drugs are smuggled out of Pakistan to Europe, and finally how people who are addicted to drugs get out of control. All three stories are told realistically and compassionately. They see enough lives of the characters to understand how normal people can be drawn into a truly immoral life. <br /> <br /> These are not cutouts of cardboard, the opium grower is trying to feed his family a dry area that is filled with pistols and other opium breeders. The drug smuggler is a wealthy German without a heart, but his wife (one of the three main characters) is just an ordinary woman who has to decide whether to lead or give up her life "the old way". The main character, the minister of administration, has the hardest role as he has to deal with the emotional devastation of his own daughter. She slips into the world of drug addiction and begins to steal, suffers from illness, and emotionally attacks her parents so that she can continue to satisfy her craving for the drug (heroin) that is destroying her life. <br /> <br Traffic is one of the best dramas I've ever seen on TV. The scenes in this show will stay with you for a long time. Highly recommended. - Colin Glassey
