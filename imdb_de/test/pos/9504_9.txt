"Icky Flix" is an excellent starting point for those who have only a vague interest in the inhabitants themselves. Most of their classic videos are there (though "Earth vs. Flying Saucers" and "Do not Be Cruel" are strangely absent), and the "concentrates" of their various CD-ROM projects give tantalizing insights into what they do orbed You've spent their time since they've realized that MTV does not put them into strong rotation (or even show videos). <br /> <br /> All videos in this compilation contain eye-catching images and idiosyncratic music (with a selection of original tracks and newly recorded ones). And two of them - "The Third Reich 'n' Roll" and "One Minute Movies" - are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Watch this DVD and find out why.
