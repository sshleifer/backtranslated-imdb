This is a movie that you either love or hate. I loved it. If you're looking for excitement, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc., you will not find anything in this movie. It is a movie to feel good, sentimental, positive and uplifting. The heroes of the film are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a man of strength and integrity, and Radio (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world. I think I did not find this movie as "sentimental hogwash" as many others, because it felt very real. I know people like this. I've seen jocks that think it's fun to pick the weak ones. I have seen men of integrity working for the weak. I have seen people who believe that football is a serious business at school. I've seen people who know what's really important in life. Each of these people could have been people I knew. I laughed; I cried. I left the film with a good feeling and remembered that in my world there are people like Coach Jones and Radio. If there are no people in yours, you may not like the movie. If you do not like a movie that shows the better side of human nature, you will hate it.
