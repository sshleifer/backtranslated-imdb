This movie was very funny and had only a bit of gore. It's about two grave robbers who work as usual when they find out there is another clientele they can serve. This changes the direction of the corpses they collect. The film is narrated by the younger of the two as he explains the deal to a priest before being sent to behead. His partner had already been beheaded. The priest has to make the final confession and takes the form of a story. There are some animations in which there is a feeling from the tomb. In the story, we encounter another group of grave robbers, all of whom are afraid, but eventually the younger of the two who are due to be executed is offered a job, so that calms the animosity between the groups. When a woman joins the two men, she oversteps her limits and gets into trouble with the dreaded grave robbers. The story leads to the meeting of the two groups, which led to the arrest of the confessor and the man who has already lost his head.
