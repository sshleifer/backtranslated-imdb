Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp or Little Man character wins the First World War, the Great War of that time, alone, even capturing the Emperor, which the entire Allied forces could not do. Too bad that everything is a dream, who is a cop and the weakest part of this hypnotizing silent movie (almost a feature film in 46 minutes). <br /> <br /> There are plenty of inventive jokes Charlie, the Limburger cheese that had been shipped from home, had to put on a gas mask to use it as a weapon against the Germans. Charlie sleeps underwater in a flooded ditch next to a soldier whom he continues to annoy; Charlie disguises himself as a tree - one of his best sketches of all time - and Charlie pretends to beat up his friend, who has become a prisoner of war, and then embrace him when the enemy is out of sight. <br /> <br /> One amazing thing is how much Charlie, when dressed as a German behind the enemy lines, resembles Hitler for over ten years before Hitler and his Nazi thugs dominate German politics. Obviously, Hitler has taken his appearance after Charlie from this movie.
