I saw this very painful presentation and was fascinating. The conflict between the public and private faces of Williams and the pressure he has been under, is illuminated in such a way that even those who know something about him are surprised. The cast was excellent, but Michael Sheen was outstanding. I first realized that it was him when I saw the previous comment. He looks completely different in this role than in any other role I have seen in or as himself. Williams' autobiography differs significantly from his diaries, as depicted in this film. The film is sometimes painful because of the emotional distress. It is, however, a rewarding experience and a film that is highly recommended.
