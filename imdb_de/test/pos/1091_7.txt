Nana Patekar proves once again that he is undoubtedly the best actor working in Bombay. His latest films included the screaming of his lines, which is not good for the theater that has trained theaters. One wonders why he is not always awarded in the awards season. <br /> <br /> "Shakti-The Power" was one of his tricks, which together with Kohram (a missed counterpart to creating on-screen magic) was an absolute disappointment Amitabh Bachchan). <br /> <br /> But in this movie, Patekar radiates a cool calm by playing a policeman on a kind of social justice journey. The Patekars character frees the streets of Bombay from underworld dons in fake encounters and takes control of the screen (and the viewer's attention) and never lets go of it. The cut is tight and there are no annoying songs that distract from the story. <br /> <br /> In the same line as the modern cult classic "Company", the movie is well played, directed and should have a long shelf life on DVD. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of Nana and the main villain talking in his offshore port will definitely be part of the Hindi cinema classics. Will not be disappointed with this police and robber strip.
