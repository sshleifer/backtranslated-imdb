As much as I like Walter Matthau, I felt that the majority of his roles were tailored to his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. This role requires much more action than most other roles. I liked the fact that the movie was honest, how a professional can be dishonest to avoid engaging in a relationship. His whole goal was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but by no means be obliged. The alibi - with his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) pretend to be his wife. At some point in the movie, the fake Mr. and Mrs. are actually deceived because they believe they were really married. The end was good, because a middle-aged man found it more rewarding to persecute someone in his own age group. The movie was funny, entertaining and did not sell itself as a preacher.
