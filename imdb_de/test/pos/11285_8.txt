The magic. The horrors. The easy boredom. <br /> <br /> That "juror" is for acquired tastes, goes without saying. You do not just happen to see it, unless your friends are real art-house movies buffs.You must have the weird, the macabre, dig the bizarre. You have to dig cool strips. And you have to dig to find diamonds. <br /> <br /> "Begotten" is one of the most dazzling and enigmatic films ever. The visual part is something to see, something nobody can prepare for. But since the film contains no dialogue, the visual part is pretty much the only part .... "Native" is a visual movie. The soundscapes that were created for the film are magical and groundbreaking, but still .... the sight of it .... <br /> <br /> God commits suicide in a particularly bloody scene, and then rises Mother Earth from his corpse impregnated with God's seed and giving birth to Flesh on Bone, a backward child. Then she leaves him and is tortured by pagan beings. Mother comes back (to sa ve him?), But she and her son are murdered by the terrible creatures. The film is about the futility of life and the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and die, and that when something dies, something else is born, etc. nihilism. <br /> <br /> The # 1 quality of the film are of course the visuals, the scenery, the haunting images, this extra-worldly quality .... After you are done watching, you feel like an alien , It is so fascinating. <br /> <br /> If people say it should take 30 'instead of 70', they are right. No, that's not true "It's just that everything happens at such a slow pace." In fact, the plot summary I've provided is all that's going on in the movie like no joke. It's still ... I do not know ... Glorious ... <br /> <br /> ... As a flame burns the darkness ...
