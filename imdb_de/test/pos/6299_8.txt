Someone on these boards predicted that the whole thing would be dreamed by the protagonist's best friend, even though he has a friend he has not seen in 20 years. I hesitate to refuse, but it raises some viable questions. Why would a telephone engineer - or a shoe salesman or a butcher - WANT to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend who populates it with a series of equally mythical supportive characters. He should not dream with the idea that the friend should write well. Dream or not, SOMEONE, and the obvious candidate is director Paolo Sorrentino, who has created a world where Tony Servillo makes of silence a beautiful art. We are asked to believe that Titta La Girolomo (Servillo) messed up the Mafia a few years before our encounter. As a penance he is a virtual prisoner in a small Swiss hotel, from which he drives every week to a local bank with a suitcase of nine mills in used notes. Apart from this weekly trip, he is free to choose what he wants, and he likes to smoke, play cards with a man who cheats, and a wife who reminds the husband of how far they have fallen socially and ignores the friendly ideas by Olivia Magnani, who for two years tried to get a smile and / or a good evening out of him. For reasons best known to him and contrary to a man who has no interest in anything or anyone, Servillo spends some time each day putting a stethoscope on the wall of his bedroom and listening to the private conversations of his card , Partner to play. At some point he answers Magnani - he has to do that, otherwise they would not be a movie. This is the plot 6f: the one about Destry, who never wears a gun, or Sean (Duke Wayne), the "Quiet Man," who refuses to provoke himself and fight until the compulsory scene in which the gun is strapped and his fists are tense - instead of settling for a polite Come Stai Oggi, he takes 100,000 out of his suitcase and buys her a car. The final contradiction is when Magnani tells him that she will pick him up at 4:00 pm the next day in their car and drive them to the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We found out she lives in the area. One can only guess why she is seen from far away when she is driven from far away, ignoring a police roadblock to drive off the road and turn the car over. Apart from these inconsistencies, this remains a good deal of film that offers excellent lead performance and very good support.
