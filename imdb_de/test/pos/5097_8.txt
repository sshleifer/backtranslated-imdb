"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is an excellently written and photographed musical version of the 1939 classic film. Apart from Peter O'Toole's wonderfully controlled, discreet performance as a pedantic schoolmaster who finds love and is changed by it, the film contains hundreds more stunning Images, from Greek ruins over London side streets to an extensive landscape montage. The music and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse have been criticized as boring or inappropriate for film musicals, but they are used to enhance the story rather than to tell it. Many songs are used to emphasize montages or scenes. The few who do not do so are referred to in "Show Biz" numbers. In this way, the songs do not engage in this delicate story, but reinforce what the characters think or feel. "Where has my childhood gone?", "Go with me through the world," and "you and me" are particularly effective. A gripping, brilliant acting, directing and written film.
