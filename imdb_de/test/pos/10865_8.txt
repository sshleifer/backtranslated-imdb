I started to look at the worst. I was glad that the film turned out to be enjoyable, sometimes confusing, as if everyone was just starting to sing. It gave me a chance to see Daniel Wu in action for the first time, he's a better actor than I thought, sometimes he seemed a bit out of place. I thought Purple Storm deserved its release in Hong Kong because it's different from most other HK movies. It is a man's emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss. He may sound hackneyed, but when he finally finds out what and who he is, that really makes the movie more interesting. Once you study the movie, you'll find it captivates you. If you miss a bit, a lot of the movie will be useful. For example, I missed something at the beginning and I recommend anyone who looks at it. You do not miss it. So I can say that this movie was worth seeing and a grateful surprise for me that I enjoyed it.
