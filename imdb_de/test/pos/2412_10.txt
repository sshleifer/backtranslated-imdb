NEXT KARATE KID is an excellent martial arts movie in my opinion. I thought that Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) look good in their prom clothes. For me Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real tyrant. That was because he got Julie in trouble with director Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure A ******! That was because he was a very tough man who did not tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between Julie and the Alpha Elite. Finally, I recommend this smash hit to anyone who likes martial arts films or fans of Hilary Swank.
