I do not think I really have spoilers here, but since I'm describing some funny scenes, I'll mark the box labeled "Can contain spoilers" just to be on the safe side. Now ... I hardly know where to start. By now you know the basics of the story - the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) take on the task of leading a Mormon waggon train westwards into their "Promised Land", encountering a multitude of trials and interesting ones Characters, especially the Outlaw Clegg family. <br /> <br /> Everyone can enjoy this movie. You do not have to be a fan of Western to like it. Johnson and Carey are two of the fastest sympathetic characters you'll see in every movie. Carey in particular is animated and open-minded, almost like a big kid - while Johnson is a bit calmer and wiser, like a figure of an older brother. I get a kick from the scene where the sheriff of one of his 'gentle horses' is sold for ten dollars. Inform him then that the horse has "some peculiarities - you may say weaknesses" ... Travis nudges Sandy, who lets go with a shrill whistle and sends the new horse of the sheriff into wild saddle position with him in the saddle. His expression, as the horse finally throws it off and gallops, is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Watch out for the music ... even if you never thought you were a fan of the Sons of the Pioneers, listen to "Shadows in the Dust" while the train is moving with some of the people walking between the wagons. It's a really beautiful song - too bad that only half a minute of it is in the movie. I want to hear it all at some point. <br /> <br /> One thing that impressed me a lot about this film is that much of it must have been almost as heavy as the actual situation it represents. Teams of six horses pulling wagons on steep mountain trails and trying to reach the summit - this was not an easy and simple movie. It must also have been a risk for the actors, the stuntmen and the animals. For rivers, too, there are many authentic-looking actions in this film in which the movement of the freight train is included. It should be noted that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent drivers, both of whom have years of experience in riding, abseiling and all sorts of cowboy stuff. Carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many Navaho Indians. In fact, he learned Navaho before learning English. No rhinestone cowboys in this movie - "Travis" and "Sandy" were the real thing through and through. <br /> <br /> Watch out for the scene where Miss Denver throws the water pot from her car and hits Travis' horse's face ... the horse starts to jerk and eventually throws it off. Look at the look on Sandy's face as Denver says to Travis, "I'm sorry you fell off your horse." Another favorite scene of mine is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) gets into some sort of dud with one of the Mormons. They keep working on getting their gear ready, and after Sandy disgusts with the other guy, they end up in a rear thrusting match that quickly turns into a fistfighting fist fight. Even after the eldest (Ward Bond) gets up and separates them, the two fighters try to keep on clawing each other. The Mormon (also called "Jackson" in the movie) gets one last kick from Sandy so high he hits his shoulder. It's a really funny scene from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else I can say about this movie, except that it has a good story, very responsive characters, beautiful scenery and lots of action with humor and a bit of drama. Oh, it has been dyed, at least in the version I saw; It's not the most beautiful color film you'll ever see, but I think I prefer black and white. I give this one ten and I do not spend many tens. Without doubt one of my favorite films. Judging by the other comments, I have a lot of company in this assessment.
