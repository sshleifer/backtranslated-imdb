I saw this movie alone when I was an early teenager in my hometown in India, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me besides girls was tigers. After looking at it, I came home with a glassy look and wanted to be the guy in the movie who was friends with the Tigers. What a movie and what a moment it was! The theater in which I saw it does not exist and has given way to a mall. I do not know how I would feel after so many years now and I do not want to ruin a childhood memory by finding this movie on DVD or something similar and not finding it interesting anymore. I've learned from past experience that a childhood memory is often tarnished as you tour the beaten highways of life, occasionally trying to rediscover their unadulterated past in movies just to keep their bubbly innocence alive and unwelcome. And I do not want to throw the memories of this movie into the wind. I do not have children, so I'm probably selfish if I leave this movie in a sepia-colored area of ​​my brain and do not want it on DVD. However, if you are at an early age and want to remember the memories of a loveable childhood in later years, try watching this movie (if possible). It will be really worthwhile.
