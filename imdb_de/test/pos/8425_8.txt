Although this production has received a number of bad reviews, she is actually doing quite well for her age. Also note that this is not a BBC program, it was only licensed by Granada Ventures when the Jane Austen Collection was released on DVD. <br /> <br /> So what about other edits of the same novel? The most famous version of these days is the 1995 film starring Amanda Root as Anne Elliott and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth. The movie was shorter, of course, but a good snapshot of the story - the previous version with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall in the same roles had four hours to tell the story, and moved in more leisurely steps. <br /> <br Firbank is a good ten years old for her role but she is very good - Marshall is excellent as Wentworth, a man who is disappointed in love and bitter about interference. And in the cast are people hiding, which also contribute - Michael Culver, later seen in Cadfael as Harvill; Richard Vernon, later seen in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as Admiral Croft; Noel Dyson, formerly on Coronation Street, as Mrs. Musgrove. <br /> <br /> One of my criticisms is that the hairstyles are a bit distracting and the costumes are awful! However, this should not detract from a very pleasing Austen adjustment.
