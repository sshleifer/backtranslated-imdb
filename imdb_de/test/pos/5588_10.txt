This can not be seen as a review of any movie, but only as a commentary to a movie I saw as a teenager. I remember coming home one evening, amazed at what I had seen. I tried to tell a part of the story to my parents, but they listened without understanding what was so strange that two children stranded on an island fall in love and grow together and have a son. As you've probably guessed, I'm referring to The Blue Lagoon (1949), which has kept me bewildered and confused over the years (nearly 50) and is now amazed with fear and disgust as to who or what did not make the film available in Cassette or DVD or whatever. I've spent a lifetime looking for the opportunity to someday get hold of her, and nobody knows anything about it. What a waste! Sorry if my english is not technical or scientific, but my native language is spanish. I do my best to make myself understood. Many Thanks. My name is Juan and I am from Uruguay in South America.
