Bluff I think the movie is really good. <br /> <br /> Is just another kind of Colombian movie. It's weird and the actors use local expressions that make so much money to listen. <br /> <br /> It shows a different face of Bogot√° and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diversified country and we have to show it the world This is the first film by director Felipe Martinez, and I am really convinced that this film will be the beginning of a great career as a film director. <br /> <br /> We need to continue to support the Colombian film industry because this is the case Film and other good films are the beginning of something big.
