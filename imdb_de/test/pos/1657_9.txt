What a gas from a movie! "Film Noir" has always been one of my favorite genres, but this one is different from the others. Only "The Big Sleep", "The Past", "Murder My Sweet" and "The Killers" can come close to this caper classic. I know that these four American movies that I mentioned are not capillary films per se, but detective stories with intricate storylines that still emit a "noirean," much like "Rififi." <br /> <br /> What's different here is the way Jules Dassin sets the whole atmosphere of the film in motion, not only in the pompous realism of its clients, but also in the use of the streets of Paris as subliminal Character and co-conspirator! The film revolves around "Le Stephanois", a dark, moody and complicated ex-cheater who gets pulled into a final shot at the hefty payout. Although he is a laid-back and hard-hitting tough guy, he still feels the yearning for salvation by freeing himself from the demons of his past (hey, he saved little Toni!). Dassin has chosen the right man (Jean Servais) for this role. Apart from that, the rest of the story development comes to mind as we travel through the famous "silent" capers scene to the event's sinking of the main "culprits". Only her wives survive except Ida, Mario's darling. They seemed to understand the underlying futility of everything!
