Yes, 1939 / Robert Donat-Greer Garson's version was the best ... Perfection..Donat won the Oscar in a very tough year. were 2 of his competitors. That was a tough year. Most critics in New York hated this version. so.didnt see in the theater! Finally, this A.M. on TCM & enjoyed. Peter O'Toole was excellent and glad that he was nominated for this Oscar. I feel like I'm not written well. You & I ... sung by Ms. Clark and later recorded by many others, including T. Bennett / S. Bassey & Carmen MacRae ... the b / w version was more authentic. However, this is a good movie, beautifully photographed in color and panavision.
