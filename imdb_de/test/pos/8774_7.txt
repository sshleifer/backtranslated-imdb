Overall, this is a fun and strange movie. Do not try to understand it. There are more holes in the story than a computer could match, but Robert Cummings and a number of minor characters make the most of this "elusive" story. <br /> <br /> Unlike the popular television show and then the 1993 movie, this fugitive is not looking for a one-armed man, but for a two-armed Nazi saboteur named "Frank Fry." Cummings ("Barry Kane") is being accused of blowing up a defensive fort in Los Angeles and searching for the man who did it (Fry) to clear his name or who is very tense and interesting. Then Priscilla Lane ("Pat Martin") enters the story, and it begins to slow down a little with a juicy dialogue. The director Alfred Hitchcock has often done this with his female characters. I wonder if he had any idea how the woman spoke. Lane was a bit lame here. <br /> <br /> Actually, the villains of Otto Kruger ("Charles Tobin") and Norman Lloyd ("Frank Fry") in my opinion were the best ... .. just fascinating. Kruger's acting and dialogue were especially good. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie but have seen Hitchcock's famous "North By Northwest", you will end up chuckling and really enjoying it. Instead of a climate scene on Mount Rushmore, we have a memorable last 10 minutes here in the State of Liberty. As always, Hitchcock camera angles are great and fun.
