Even people who dislike the movie, usually because they find the end confused, should appreciate the strong presence of Elijah Wood & Joseph Mazello, who played the two young leads in this film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler ATTENTION: In the literal sense, the end makes no sense. People who think that the end makes sense on other levels are divided between those who 1) believe that the younger brother was killed by the stepfather. Either Mike (the older boy) was out with the neighborhood gang or flew off of the wishing place in his car to escape death from the situation, and those who thought the younger brother was conceited and his plane flying away in the car Transformed into a flying machine, signals his overcoming of the abusive situation. <br /> <br /> I prefer 2). It makes a lot of sense how many children deal with abusive situations. It is not uncommon for an abused child to split his psyche and project the abused self into something else. a stuffed animal, even an imaginary friend. In this way it makes much more sense that always the younger boy is abused and never Mike. In reality, it is unlikely that one in two brothers will get the abuse, although this is indeed the case. It is also Bobby, the younger brother, who is also encouraging, insisting that they can overcome the situation. Also, the death of a real sibling by abuse would have been too shattering for an adult to turn this into an optimistic fantasy end result in its history.
