Kingdom County, Vermont, 1927. Noel Lord (Rip Torn) lives with his Indian buddy Bangor (Tantoo Cardinal) in the area where a large dam is to be built; However, Noel is unwilling to give up his land, and he must fight the dam company to save the county from possible destruction. <br /> <br /> "Where the Rivers Flow to the North" is an enthralling, contemplative story inspired by the memorable performances of Rip Torn (recently underestimated in the small but juicy role of Louis XV in Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette ") and Tantoo Cardinal (" Dances with Wolves "," Smoke Signals "). , Director Jay Craven (who also wrote the screenplay with Don Bredes based on Howard Frank Moshers novel) and cinematographer Paul Ryan created this stunning story with unique contemplative tempo / visuals that remind me of the best moments of Terrence Malick and John Huston. It is an underrated independent piece of the first (electric) half of the 90s, which is usually disturbed as the rise of Quentin Tarantino's burlesque ("Pulp Fiction" is indeed a masterpiece, but the man suffering from Orson-Welles Syndrome) Suburbia, Danny Boyle's dark vision of Britain (not to mention that "Beach" is filmed with DiCaprio) ... Jay Craven should also get more attention on the lists of great indie filmmakers. He leads a respectful, discreet career, and it's always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his. <br /> <br /> My vote: 8/10.
