This movie gives you more of an idea of ​​how Australians behave. Although The Castle is a great Australian movie, it's a bit out there. This movie is by far the best Aussie movie I've ever seen (Dirty Deeds not seen yet) and would probably be my favorite movie. The point is, if you have not seen it, look at it. If a crime, an action or a comedy is your thing.
