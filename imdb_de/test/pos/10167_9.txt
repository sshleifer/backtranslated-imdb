A movie that tends to be buried under prejudice and prejudice - a remake! Doris Day is in! She sings! - Hitchcock's second bang on "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is his most undervalued movie and probably a full-fledged masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Doris Tagesfilm In more than one way Doris Tagesfilm is not only the best performance of her career, she can not only stand up to James Stewart, but the whole movie is subtle about her character and not his Character structured. After all, this is a film in which music is both a motive and an instrument of action. What better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? Remember: Days Jo McKenna has given up her career on stage to settle down with her husband and raise her son. This seems to be a mutual decision, and it does not seem to be unhappy. But look how Stewart annoys her in her horse-drawn carriage because of her concerns about Louis Bernard, which means she's jealous that Bernard did not ask her about her career. This is clearly a recurrent joke between them - she answers with a "har-de-har-har" indicating the familiarity of this gag, suggesting that she has some latent resentment about her imprisonment and that both recognize it Stewart insists she should be doped before she tells her the news. This is a cruel scene brilliantly portrayed by both actors, illustrating the imbalance of power in their marriage - he tries to control and suppress their reactions by essentially using his expertise to voice their voice in marriage just as his medical career suppressed her singing career. <br /> <br /> The power of this voice is evident in the Ambrose Chapel sequence, in which she must reign in her highly educated clarity and volume in order to fit into the gathering of feminine labors - she almost as a warning against the, what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent. At Albert Hall, they need to scream, train those impressive lungs that save a man's life, and in the final of the message, it's their talent and reputation for finding their son. By contrast, all Stewart's male activities are counterproductive - his visit to the taxidermists is a dead end, he is left behind in the church while everyone else moves to Albert Hall, and his efforts there only manage to kill the killer. so the police rob potentially useful information. Only when his action is linked to the voice of his wife, does he succeed in saving Hank from the message, in fact, to do something useful. <br /> <br /> Far from being forced into the film to give Day a movie The opportunity to sing, 'Que Sera Sera' acts as the film's first musical instrument and foreshadows the nightmare that the McKennas flood. 'The future does not belong to us to see'. It also prepares the way for the final, in which Doris can save the day through the close connection between mother and son through the music. <br /> <br /> The most famous sequence of the film makes music a central part - the construction of the assassination in the Albert Hall. This long, wordless sequence is perhaps the most extraordinary thing Hitchcock has dedicated to film, the ultimate expression of his conviction that movies should be visually narrated stories. We see people talking in that order, but they never hear a word they say. We do not need - the pictures say everything. It is also his most exquisite tension sequence. The pieces move slowly into position while the music is composed. The cut is incredibly tight and perfectly tuned to the music. There is no inappropriate frame - anything that is not directly related to the assassination gives the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which it all takes place. It builds up slowly, but in the end the tension is almost unbearable. When Jo screams, it's not just a relief for her, it's for the audience. <br /> <br /> The Ambrose Chapel sequence is witty and especially effective for those who have had to prevail especially in a church non-conformist church. The message sequence seems to be a bit flat after the Albert Hall, one that lay before him at first sight, but the second time seems to be actually more effective, with the final gait in front of Weapon really of the splendid use of Day vocals in the background benefits from the music-as-ambient noise in 'rear window'. The overall score is subtle, so the music can be effectively brought to the fore by the screen sources. Bernard Miles is a reserved villain, a bit banal, but with a dry joke. He is overshadowed by Brenda de Banzie as his wife, who leads a narrow line between sinister and sympathetic. Just look at her smoking a cigarette while her husband prepares the assassin. Her attitude is pure gangster minor, affecting the outer middle of England, but she clearly has a soft side and possibly maternal feelings towards Hank. Stewart is excellent, even though Hitchcock has always cast him as "Everyman," as the director's daughter seems to think, this confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who fought for the fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who abused his girlfriend in Rear Window and an obsessive necrophile in Vertigo. The day is phenomenal. Just look at her reaction to the news that her son was kidnapped - she never exaggerates anything, but she does not sell her too short. This is one of Hitchcock's most emotional films. He never lets us forget what the McKennas are at stake. they feel most perfectly human of all the central characters.
