I envisage many students enrolling in student exchanges in Barcelona and being disappointed if they do not have such an exciting time. <br /> <br /> The movie was fun. Of course it is always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou. <br /> <br /> However, I have a very strong problem with a part of the movie. The lesbian roommate tells Xavier that women like to be physically dominated (which I'm going to do with it) and show him some kind of butt-grip that's guaranteed to get a woman. Xavier then tries his butt on a timid married boyfriend - who starts saying, "No, no," "I'm married, I'm married," but then somehow succumbs to the butt? Suddenly she moans "Yes, yes" and they go to the benches in Park GÃ¼ell. I found that really very offensive. Besides, it is very stereotypical. How many times have we seen scenes in which the woman says "no," but obviously does not mean that? No means no. Butt / physical control will not do it right. It fully supported the stereotypical rape myths. <br /> <br /> I was not even sure how to read the next scene in which he complains to the lesbian about how it works and what it will be like when it comes next time. suck it, bitch "(or something like that.) Did he really think it would be the way to force a woman out of respect for her feelings? <br /> <br /> This section really ruined the movie for me.
