I discovered this movie as a teenager in the mid-1980s and it immediately became one of my favorite vacation and non-vacation movies. As you can see from the other reviews, this movie has a very good story and great actors. <br /> <br/> Stanwyck is great as a bride who has second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's acting is strong too. In most movies he goes unnoticed, but he was a very capable actor, watch KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays the visiting sailor who throws Stanwyck away from his husband. <br /> <br /> This is a Christmas classic. The settings and the story make for a great Christmas romance
