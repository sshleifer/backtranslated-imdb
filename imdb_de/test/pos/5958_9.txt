Seems like M.Hazanavicius is back! The man behind "la classe américaine" comes back with a really fun and sly sequel to the old-fashioned OSS-117 ... While the directors tend to be the sequels to old classics ("Remember the Avengers (urk), Hazanavicius decided to working on a really cheap hero, OSS-117, a kind of low-budget French 007, and decides to do this on an old school ... The photography, the posture, the fights, the choreography and the FX, It's all a tribute to the way movies were made in the '50s, and it works because the sound and jokes of the movie are really good! Jean Dujardin perfectly embodies this stupid arrogant macho-egotistical French spy, lost in a country that he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority, yes, that's it, just like the Occident did its colonies back then (and oh no, I'm not going to say that it has anything to do with what today utage happens in the same area ... ah ah) ... He just looks like an unfrozen Lino Ventura, with about 40 pounds less, which is perfect the role. The other members of the cast also fit perfectly, with everything you can dream of Russian spies, Egyptian independents and former Nazis. And of course the women, as there must be in every good spy "Femmes Fatales". Movies ... The plot is good (maybe not brilliant, but really good enough ...), it takes place between the actual historical facts and recalls in a funny way how France (and the others) treated their colonies back then , It all starts in 1955 when a British spy disappeared while tracking down a Russian load of weapons in Suez. Then France sends its best friend, the OSS-117 agent, to find out what happened to both the delivery and the agent. The fact is that this agent is really as stupid as he can be, and he slips through the story without understanding it and solves it in a very simple way. I have to say, I had a bad feeling about the movie because the advertising around it was pretty scary and because the French humor is rather populist and flat (forget Les Bronzés 3 or Camping ...), but me was really very surprised and in the good way! I highly recommend if you want a good spoof of Bond esquire movies (much more fun than in DEBS, but less skirts) or you're a fan of the sincere and honest style of filming you've had in the 5Os , Yes, that's smart and (really!) Funny, you have the point again, Mr. Hazanavicius!
