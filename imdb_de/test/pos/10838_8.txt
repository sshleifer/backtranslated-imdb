This drama apparently caused a stir six years ago when it debuted on television. I myself did not record much on the television news and it went under the radar. But after seeing it, I'm not surprised that it caused a stir. Not because of the content (though it's a bit more "offbeat" than the usual TV feed) - it has more to do with the reactionary media in this country. However, this three-part series is based on a book by Sarah Waters and focuses primarily on lesbians - although the plot also provides space to explore other "dark" sides of sexuality. Our main character is an oyster girl named Nan (short for Nancy) from Winchester. Kitty Butler is enchanted by a female to a male drag performer after seeing her in a theater show. Soon she starts attending all her shows - eventually she catches the performer's eye and becomes her dresser. It does not take long for Kitty to be given the chance to play on major London venues and make friends with Nan, inviting her on the ride. The action gets bigger as Nan goes on stage and the couple becomes a stage duo ... but Kitty breaks Nans heart and leads her into an odyssey in London's shabby abdomen The DVD collection contains no shortage of filthy and filthy films. Therefore, there was nothing in this movie that shocked me. I'm quite abrupt about it, but I'm still surprised when someone says this movie went too far. Of course, there is lesbian sex and other stuff, but it's never exploited or overused and the movie really could not have been done without it. The main focus is always on the story; and the story is really well done. The movie is almost three hours long, but if that's enough, that's not enough to convey everything. Sarah Waters is obviously an original writer, and the movie remains interesting for the duration. Acting is solid, as you would expect, but I have to admit that I found the lead actress Rachael Stirling awkward and heavy, with whom I could cope first; Although she grows into her role as the movie progresses. The execution is a bit of a problem and director Geoffrey Sax is a bit too tricky for my taste. The story also gets a bit juicy in the end, which is a shame as this movie is strongest in the dark moments (Episode 2 is the highest point of three for me). There is not really one point in the movie - or at least none that I could see. That's not important to me; However, when Tipping the Velvet told a good story and far exceeded my expectations. It's worth checking, for people who like it.
