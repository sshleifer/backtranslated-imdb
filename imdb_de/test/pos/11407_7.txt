If you have been babysitting in a house that you did not know, or if you have seen and enjoyed the original, this is a good choice. I ignored the reviews and what was posted here. I rented this movie because as a teenager I was scared of the original. This movie has (of course) changed some of the original story to refer to today's teens, such as the babysitter having trouble getting through her cell phone minutes, and having to take on a babysitter job to pay her bill , However, it stays pretty good on the original story. If you can relate to the babysitter not knowing the house and the usual kinks and tears, it's pretty exciting. When the killer is shown, he is very scary and you yell at the girl, "Get out of the house". If you've never been babysitter or in a situation like this, you probably will not be able to tell and will not like it. It's about understanding their fear.
