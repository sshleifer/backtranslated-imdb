Yes, I'm an FF7 fan, but how many people watching this movie will NOT be? And so I rate this film from the perspective of a FF7 fan and do not regret it. (I would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who did not play the FF7 game.) <br /> <br /> Visuals - 10/10 I loved Advent kids. It's a sensual pleasure - a full audio-video overload. The visuals were breathtaking: some tricks were done, which I would not have thought possible with an animated feature. When the action scenes arose, they were a rollercoaster ride for lack of specific words. With dramatic camera shifts from range to range, seamlessly integrated bullet-time effects in the crucial moments to the details, everything is difficult to fault. The animation looks great, the style and imagery are fantastic, and the effects sometimes made me forget that I was watching animations, not live action movies. I could spend hours focusing on the fantastic quality of the visuals, but it just would not do it justice. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 The sound was fabulous. The voices of all characters did not disappoint (no one sounded stupid) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. The music - from the game, which (in my opinion) had the best soundtrack of all time, was wonderfully transferred to the film. Most of the catchy themes of the game are present in the film, but often use other tools to better fit the process. From time to time there was some heavier rock and light Thrash Metal music over the really intense action scenes, but everything went well with the movie's situation at the appropriate time. <br /> <br /> Story - 7/10 The story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie. Both aspects were simply not comparable to the game - but the game could spend more than 40 hours developing these points - the movie has only about 90 minutes. As far as the story goes, the plot was not bad or anything, but just not as ambitious as expected by someone who played the game through. In fact, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with the complicated twists of plot and story development / development that the movie never had a chance to compete in the same league. Instead, the film pursued the more rational approach - to expand the action and try to put as many insider jokes and topics in it as possible instead of imposing the massive story factor that was originally a driving force in the game. The lack of materia use has also been a controversial topic for me - the story of the film chose little materia (though not for ZERO), and instead a lot of supernatural martial arts and skill. I would hope that if a sequel is made, Materia will be incorporated into the film much more extravagant and important. There have also been many film storylines - all of which can be forgiven if you consider Adventist kids a random anime, but they seem ridiculous if you find that it's based on a game that did the job tremendously well. Characters - 7/10 The characters, though all in one form or another, are not necessarily shining with their true potential. There just is not enough movie time to spend with everyone. As a result, all their background stories and abilities are not fully presented, and in some cases barely (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no lasting impressions). Even Cloud, which is the focus of the film, in my opinion, does not use enough of its familiar gameplay abilities. The materia question is a strong reason for this. With these words, it is a pleasure to see the cast back in action, even if it plays a role that it does not take full advantage of. However, the new characters were the ones that battled me the most - the bad guy trio and the boy Denzel - none of them had a huge lack of explanation. Anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in and fill in the gaps with something reasonable, but objectively the subject is still to comment and therefore somewhat disappointing. 10/10 The replay value for this film is excellent - personally I would like to review it in an even bigger and louder way - bigger screen, louder volume. <br /> <br /> Enjoyment - 10/10 Whatever the Deficiencies In the movie, they just were not big enough to stop me, and I honestly believe that will be the same for most people. I really enjoyed Advent Children and encourage FF7 fans to see it.
