I think this movie was made for the not so princely sum of Â£ 8,000, but that did not really show. There was nothing capricious about production or acting, the characters were bleak and real, and the place could have been some desert area in the world instead of a not too hot beach north of Aberdeen. The performers were perfectly acceptable as mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, abandoned and unknown planet. Neither of them seemed to be particularly friendly, but she was ready to fight to keep her and her comrades alive. There were no great explanations for the events that can really be invented, leaving much of the conspiracy to your imagination, much like The Big Empty, a movie I also enjoyed. I've found that I've warmed up for most of the characters, there may have been some unintentionally amusing moments, the men were so common that you felt like you could empathize with them, and the climax and end of the movie were pretty moving. I think Mr. Stirton and his crew should be pretty proud of themselves. I've seen worse movies with a budget of millions.
