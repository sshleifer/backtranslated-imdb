I stumbled on this page when I was looking for a video or DVD of the 1959 version Porgy and Bess with Sammy Davis as Sportin Life. If anyone finds this in a home movie format, please let me know. I keep talking to my daughters about things they think are new and have already been made. We saw a live theater a few years ago that I could only talk about about this movie. Unfortunately my daughters can not remember seeing Sammy Davis Jr. in any production, even though they've heard of him. Needless to say, they do not know the other great actors of the movie. It is a big mistake not to have this classic film (because of the cast) in a home movie format for collectors and future generations. In my opinion, this version was the best!
