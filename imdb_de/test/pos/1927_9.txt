Note: This should probably be read after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It's very rare to find a documentary or a movie that focuses on the loser. Deep Water does just that and makes it one of the most thought provoking films in a very long time. It does not give us a hero to look up to, but rather an anti-hero who forces us to look within ourselves. The film is about a group of men trying to sail the globe alone and without stopping. Only one manages to die, one chooses not to return home, each on a psychological journey that is so intriguing that entire films deserve to be earned. Most interesting, however, is Donald Crowhurst, or rather the way he is portrayed by the filmmakers and our reactions to him as a spectator. <br /> <br /> This man should be considered despicable by all standards as he portrayed so heroically? Why are we so sympathetic to him? From the beginning he made all wrong decisions. He risked his family financially to get the boat, went out at a more dangerous time to get more publicity, he ignored all warnings, even though he had no experience. He decided to lie rather than admit defeat last: suicide. Everything for what? A place in history? A sense of accomplishment? Perhaps. It is important to check if this man's situation was unavoidable. Everybody has to wonder if his natural human urge for fame and achievement would lead him to such recklessness, and I believe he's investigating your own reaction. Crowhurst's story will at least provide an answer to that question.
