Shelley. <br /> <br /> Based on John Jake's successful paperback novels "North and South", "Love and War" and "Heaven and Hell", this was a miniseries on television from 1985 to 1987. His success was more due to the success of "Roots" A similar Civil War / slavery soap opera was broadcast about a decade earlier in the 1970s. Patrick Swayze, at the beginning of his career, and at that time, made many films like Dirty Dancing that would make him famous, stars Orry Main, a plantation-born young man from South Carolina setting out to West Point. Here he meets George Hazard (James Read), who is said to be the hated enemy, Yankee North, but with whom he is intimately connected. Soon, the Mains from the south and the dangers from the north will become friends despite the turbulent era that led to the civil war. The theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing, even if the nation broke apart, is at the heart of this otherwise soap-busting opera full of action and romance. Clariss and Ashton (Jean Simmons and Teri Garber) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard (John Stockwell). Garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and vicious Ashton is fun to see on screen. To cover everything in Jakes' novels, we see a condensed version of it and they've changed a few things to make it a kind of historical romance with history lessons: the characters can be found in all the major scenes of the Civil War - Harper's Ferry where Abolitionist and feminist Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses the love of her life, the ex-slaves Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox and we are inaugurated into the White House, where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook). When we direct the war in our conscience, we meet all the prominent players, including Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis, as well as several Hollywood actors from the Golden Age - Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Ha Villand have cameos and it is interesting to see her. This is not a historical fact, it is historical FICTION and purely dramatized entertainment. But there are cliffhanger finishes and beautiful cinematography, costumes and places. It's like watching an epic movie that runs longer than Gone With The Wind with war scenes! The script can sometimes be bad and the acting may not be the best, despite the good casting. Swayze plays the same as Terri Garber, but some performances like Kirstie Alley, James Read (as George Hazard) and Leslie Anne Downes as a beautiful and strong Madeline are really good performances. They shot in sets and in southern venues. The music is enchanting and this is a feel-good movie in which we look for the good guys, track down the bad guys and finally get their talent. All fans of Civil War movies and the Jakes novels should watch this. It is available on DVD and VHS.
