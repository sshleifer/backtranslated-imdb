I love the other reviews of this film. They reflect my attitude. I'm a 70s guy with no disco and "Star Wars" kidnapping. There was nothing out of the ordinary except for a chase scene. That's why it was good because it was hard, easy and economical. Roy Scheider wore the film based on the crew, the 7 Ups, who supported Gene Hackman in the French Connection. The people in it were believable and average, who burned themselves while pouring coffee, were scared in the chase scene and almost lost after a short crash. <br /> <br /> Maybe it would be easier to tell you what's wrong with it. There were no fancy weapons, just plain revolvers and sawed shotguns. There was no hard man to philosophize, even Tarantino. There was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy tricks. There was no wise man who made a complicated scheme in which hundreds of things went exactly as he planned, including the reactions of everyone else. The criminals were bad guys, but they did not shoot people to hell. In fact, there were only three body numbers. something the average movie would insist on today in the opening balance. It could be a G-movie today! No busloads of orphans were abducted, nor did terrorists threaten to kill half of the city. There were no high-tech hijinks, and the crimes themselves were not very moving or ingenious. The highest technical thing I saw was an ATT wall phone. There were no negotiations or amusing character developments. Also, no sex or women except the wife of a gangster who screamed something while the buddy whom our hero had threatened threatened them kidnapping local gangsters for a few simple wins. The Undertaker Vito was played by Tony Lo Bianco, who did an excellent job, as well as Roy Schneider, Buddy, the boss of the 7 Ups cop, whom he informed and exploited. What happened to Tony Lo Bianco? He looked like a Pacino shoe, good-looking and talented. What was there was a great backdrop for a simple crime story in NYC. Places that were dark and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. There was a simple conspiracy involving this kidnapping scheme, in which one of Buddy's policemen was accidentally involved, literally accidentally involved and accidentally shot. With Buddy and his 7 Ups being a hot dog unit, both the NYPD brass and the gangsters believed he was involved as the kidnappers disguised themselves as plainclothes officers to lure the gangsters into compliance. Obviously, the gangsters believed that they had lawyers and rights to protect them from ordinary police. Even the gangsters were simple, old and ugly, there was no Godfather royalty or soprano hips. <br /> <br /> It's a good baseline movie with an outstanding scene of persecution between two '70s d Pontiacs. Even the cars were simple and economical, not even a GTO or a Trans Am, as the acting and the story. In the days of Batman over-hype or "24" intensity level scenarios, this movie reminds us that less is better. It should be used as a pretext for film writers and directors not to dazzle, amuse, and eventually offend us with stunts, gadgets, and clowns psychotic behavior galore.
