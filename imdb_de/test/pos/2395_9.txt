Eddie Monroe is hooooot. He is a great actor and I could be his girl anytime. He is so good. I was so sad in the end. I will not ruin the end, but wow. Girls are so vicious. His girl was wrong. If Eddie was my husband, I would never be disrespectful. These gangsters were scary. The moral of the story is trust nobody. Your friends will hurt you if they can. Oh and Eddie tells your girlfriend that she's mine, she should move the eggs! I would suggest watching the movie. Why? Becasur, I said so. It kept my eyes on the screen. My sister loved it too, so I'll see it again, because now my friends want to see it and it's worth to see it twice. Peace, happy new year!
