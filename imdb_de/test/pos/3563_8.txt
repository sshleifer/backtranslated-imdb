A gang of bandits, led by the crafty, ruthless Monetero (an absolutely imposing performance by Gilbert Roland), steals gold coins worth $ 300,000 on a daring move. But untrustworthy member Bahunda (an amusing twist on Jose Torres) takes off the coins and hides them. Unfortunately, Bahunda is killed before he can tell Monetero where he has hidden the loot. So Monetero has to come together with the cunning, cocky, enigmatic bounty hunter The Stranger (smoothly played by the pretty George Hilton) and the neglected, corrupt banker Clayton (a wonderfully funny depiction of 50-year-old teenage idol Eddie "Kookie" Burns) to find the coins. Cleverly directed by Enzo G. Castellari, with a skillful, intricate and curvaceous script by Castellari, Tito Carpi and Giovanni Simonelli, a playful amoral and nihilistic tone (each holds twice and thrice with happy greedy devotion) Twangy, flavourous, spirited score of Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesco De Masi, many rousing shootings and rousing punches, a wickedly clever sense of self-deprecating humor, a regular pace and a real surprise In the end, this dizzying and often witty feature makes an inspiring show of Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the ugly ". Delightful Stefanie Careddu appears in chic secondary parts as Monetero's fiery friend Marisol, Ivano Staccioli as die-hard army captain and Gerard Herter as lawyer Lawrence Blackman. A very amusing and funny game.
