Having repeatedly said how brilliant so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to honor an episode with maximum points. "Etude In Black" is not 100 percent perfect, but certainly more than 90 percent ... maybe 96 or 97! <br /> <br /> Last week, I checked Just Married and compared it to Meet The Parents. Well, here is one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much earlier role as the wife of the famous orchestral conductor Alex Benedict, played by the legend of John Cassavetes. Alex had an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl in the orchestra (not his first affair, suppose). She blackmails Alex to leave his wife, but with his wife's mother holding the purse for the orchestra, Alex does not think it would be a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight. Instead, he resorts to a plan to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while looking like a suicide. <br /> <br /> Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes about two seconds to realize that murder is more than suicide. It will not be long before Columbo joins Alex with the victim, and soon he'll follow him wherever he goes. Although Columbo is sure that Alex is his man, it actually takes a while and a few false clues (of which Columbo does not really swallow) before he has the crucial proof. <br /> <br /> On the way there are some first-rate additional characters, from the precocious young neighbor of Jennifer Wells and the English mechanic, who looks like he is more at home in Coronation Street, to the rotten-looking brass who is almost ready for the murder (He had also seen Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!). There is even a short cameo by Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy films. Like Leslie Nielsen in "Lady In Waiting," it's impossible to take him seriously (I bet you think of the speech he made on the podium, right?). <br /> <br /> But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs. Benedict. From the moment she calls Alex the number of Jennifer Wells from memory, she feels deeply worried about what her relationship was. It's a masterful feat as she struggles to trust Alex, though her intuition says something is very wrong. Columbo does not help by interrupting her tennis match to ask her outrageous questions about Alex's relationships with members of his orchestra. <br /> <br /> As for John Cassavetes, it is a pity he does not repeat himself as Columbo villains because he may have been one of the greats of the show with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan. But this achievement is outstanding! He is another who falls into the category of "very irritated", who loses all patience with Columbo instead of beingfriended and pampered. Nevertheless, when the game is finally over, he reluctantly recognizes Columbo's genius. <br /> <br /> Well, it's a really fantastic show. It loses a few very small points for its more sledgehammer-related view of classical music, as highlighted on many posters here, but none of these have any impact on the logic of the story or the characterizations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting! <br /> <br /> If you have not found it yet, there is an absolutely amazing clip by John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show in the early 70s. I am absolutely convinced that Steve Coogan saw this clip and Alan Partridge is based on it. Everything about this clip is similar to the knowledge that I know you, from the kringeligen introduction to the absolute humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra plays and plays circus music, while Falk, Cassavetes and her friend Ben Gazzara ridicule the host. <br /> <br /> It may not be relevant to this review, but for the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. The quality of "Etude In Black" shows how well the couple worked together!
