Hoot is a nice movie about a group of middle school kids trying to stop a pancake house chain from destroying a property where some endangered owls live. The acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see. Many well-known comedians are in this movie and keep the humor almost uninterrupted. It's a movie for the young audience, maybe 5 to 11 years old. I thought it would be a nice break from the adult movies that are pervading the screen today. There is neither realism nor accuracy in general for adults or children. It's just a lot of fun with the constant message of saving the beautiful places in this country from overdevelopment. If you can remember the day you did not fight for a dollar, you might remember that money is not everything. Not many people over 12 will enjoy it, unless they really have a thing for the old special series after school.
