Although I saw this movie about four years ago, before commenting on IMDb, I decided to repeat it now. This is unusual for me because I often read something right after watching the movie. What can I say? Well, the best performance is that of the late Peter Boyle as the title character, who, after finding out that a man has killed his daughter 's friend' s drug trafficking, wants to connect with him, even though he is an executive on Madison Avenue, the nothing has to offer in common with the very low conservative Joe. In fact, there are a lot of funny scenes from Joe at this guy's party making clever, awkward comments. Oh, and it should be noted that the actress who plays the daughter she is looking for, having disappeared after overdosing some drugs from the hospital, is none other than Susan Sarandon making her movie debut! This was a pretty tough movie for the time it was made (end of the 60s to early 70s) and was a compelling work by Norman Wexler (later Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen (later Save the. ) Tiger, Rocky and The Karate Kid). Of course, the end is still a real eye-catcher after all these years! Highly recommended for those who are interested in the counterculture of the time. P.S. Among the cultural artifacts on display here are a Raggedy Ann doll, a box of Ritz crackers, a bottle of Heinz ketchup, and a Nixon poster unique to the era, asking, "Would you like a second-hand from this man? Buy car?"
