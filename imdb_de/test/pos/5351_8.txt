That was very good, except for two things that I would like to mention in the end. The animation is great, highlighted by Nick Park and the company's trademark for exaggerated teeth and mouth of characters that make you laugh almost every time you see someone. The color was great too. <br /> <br /> But the best thing about the movie is the well thought-out comedy. This is another of those animated films where each picture is so much to see and hear that many observations are needed to capture all the jokes. It's just a funny, exaggerated look at the weird "Wallace" and his quiet and clever dog "Gromit". Along the way, it pokes fun at people who get carried away with their vegetable garden, something that looks like the obsessive dog lovers depicted in "Best Of Show" Today's movies, animated or not: 1 - Leave the cleric in the movie to look like a total idiot; 2 - Let's exaggerate the final action scene with the predictable outcome, but far over the top. Apart from that, this is still a very amusing movie that should cause a lot of laughter for a lot of people and a movie that can be enjoyed more than once.
