It must be said that this movie is definitely one of the better "bargain market" movies - I would feel a bit cheated if I had paid £ 15 for it, but at around £ 1.50 I felt I was definitely more got worth as my money. <br /> <br /> The film can not quite decide whether it wants to be "Mad Max" or one of the Clint Eastwood men of no name "spaghetti westerns" and is therefore stacked with clichés of both. Even the crazy guy who hangs out with the bad guys in "Mad Max" is here. <br /> <br /> The guy from "Blade Runner" also does a good billing, though he only appears at the beginning and at the table end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Favorite piece - for me the punch-up at the oil refinery - if you look closely, you can see the "post-apocalyptic" rush hour thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists seven bells from the Beat the game. <br /> <br /> Get several warehouses, a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately light but entertaining.
