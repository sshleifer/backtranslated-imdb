Short and to the point. This movie was great! I loved it! I recorded this in a Hollywood video for $ 3 on the VHS and looked at it about five times in the last few weeks. I'm a big fan of Bogart and just got into this movie. I found the song funny and now have it as a ringtone on my phone. Robert Sacchi is great and pulls off a good bogart. His nose is a bit big, his voice is a Bogart-Columbo mix, and he does a few things that are uncomfortable, but otherwise he was fantastic and this movie was wonderful. Nobody can be a perfect Bogart, but he was great. Remember, Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogart and will not do anything he has done. He mentions many other films and does some things that were never part of the real Bogart character. But it's so funny and funny and has a great cast, including some beautiful women. Look at it and have fun!
