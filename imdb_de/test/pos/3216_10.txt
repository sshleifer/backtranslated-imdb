Honestly .. this show warms my heart, I watch it every day with the Fox family and now that the new season has started, I'm even more addicted than before .. The characters are so well developed and their relationships are so real .. I would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter. The Lorelei's are super-fast witty girls who will really inspire you, and the show is sometimes hysterical and never too serious, but serious enough to make them addictive. It's an hour long, which is a big PLUS because you can never get enough Gilmore! even in an hour .. Emily and Richard Gilmore are KICKS (Loralie's parents, Rory's grandparents). They are average rich parents. Rily follows in her grandparents' footsteps, and this could not make them happier, of course, Rory's mother is very proud of her, but her entire life has ultimately helped Rory, who went to Yale, helped her on this trip but do not believe me, every episode comes closer to her;)
