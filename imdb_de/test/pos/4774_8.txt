There is no doubt about that. This is the animated short film that Uncle Walt puts on the hit card. When Walt's older brother Roy suggested that the next Mickey Mouse short should contain a sound, Walt took the chance. The result: Steamboat Willie 1928 was a crazy hit. After all, it was the first animated short with a synchronized soundtrack (mostly music and sound effects, as the dialogue was minimal). Do not sound like a wet blanket, but the shorts are far from perfect. The pre-1935 animation was creaky and intrusive (but as the equipment improved and the artistic techniques were better, the rest went smoothly), and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use the then-known RCA sound system, or the Western Electric Noiseless). The sound system, however, was rejected by both companies, prompting Disney to use the photophonic system that PA Powers experimented with at the time. (The plot has an actual storyline here?) Mickey (like the previously mentioned Willie) Pilot a steamboat that is being terrorized by Black Pete (Captain Pete to you) and decides to hold a jam session on the ship carrying the various animals aboard as musical instruments (ASPCA, note) .If you do not care too much about the technical Thinking about flaws, Steamboat Willie can be eight minutes fun (and a bit of history).
