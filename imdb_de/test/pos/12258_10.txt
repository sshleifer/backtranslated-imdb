Broadcast News {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} <br /> <br /> **** / **** <br /> <br /> Even though it's the emotional impact of Brooks' debut feature "Broadcast News" (Terms of Endearment) is a film of superlatives with extraordinary performances from each of the three main features and a script that sounds as authentic and researched as a tough news report. It is well known that this is primarily a character film and then a satire. In my opinion, it succeeds on both levels on its own terms. The characters of the film get a surprising depth and dimension, while the satire remains smart and never bitter. Comparisons with Network are not required because the films have two completely different goals and settings. Network is a great movie, but cynical and tired. In other words, it's crazy about the state of television. The network's satire style feels more extreme and guerrilla. By contrast, the characters who populate the newsrooms of Broadcast News love and live their work (sometimes to the detriment of their love life) and live it. They enjoy the burdens and satisfactions of the coverage, just as the audience enjoys seeing this sweet and romantic realistic masterpiece.
