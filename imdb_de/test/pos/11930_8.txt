Imagine that. Someone is making a movie about the Columbine or Virginia massacre, only the movie is being directed by the man who worked alone at home (I know that's not naked with me) and Sean Astin from Goonies! Imagine that the terrorists are overwhelmed by water buckets on laid doors and marbles, and therefore you have to watch the movie. Unfortunately, it does not go all the way, as the skateboard is actually on the floor for the bad Mexicans, but halfway you have to give it over 7, but not a 9 because it did not get crazy enough. Too bad, it seemed to be weird cheese dairy, which is worth a cult status
