I liked that the mood was light and airy. I loved that the main character wanted guarantees about his future and that his roommate puts him "directly" by all people. I thought it was great that they tackled the dynamics of dealing with the members of the men's group, considering that this was a lesbian woman. What makes a man? What makes you straight, gay or bisexual? You are not really sure if our main character has decided who he really wants. He lives in the moment and threw wind in the wind. These and other reasons make me love this movie.
