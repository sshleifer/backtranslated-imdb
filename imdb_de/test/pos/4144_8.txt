I've always enjoyed listening to Buddy Holly and felt really lost when he died in a plane crash at a young age. He was not in the old Rock'n'Roll class of Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he was not far behind. Who knows how great his heritage would have been if he had sung for decades? Almost everyone he brought out was a hit. <br /> <br /> So I was very pleasantly surprised at how well Gary Busey was able to play him and to imitate his singing voice. He made Buddy proud, as did the actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) playing Holly's backup group The Crickets. Musically, there are some of Holly's best-known songs in the beginning of the film and it's really good with a strong ending at the end when Holly and the guys in Iowa are shown in their final concert. Busey does not just sing like Holly, he's a dead alarm clock in the Looks department. Something was the actor's best performance I've ever seen, and you do not get any arguments from me. <br /> <br /> I am also glad that they ended the movie with this concert in Iowa to a positive conclusion, rather than continuing to linger on his tragic accident. The end could have been a downer, but they did not allow it.
