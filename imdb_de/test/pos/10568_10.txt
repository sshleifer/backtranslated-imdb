The chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy was incredible. They were absolutely convincing and really sympathetic in their roles. Imelda Staunton played the fascinating Mrs. Sucksby brilliantly. Despite the fact that she was a deceitful opportunist, she somehow managed to make you sympathize with her in the end. Rupert Evans played the slime-ball gentleman with pure charm and snark. He was a scene robber. The story itself was very unique and also the way it was narrated. Victorian England with two main lesbian characters was mesmerizing and delightful. There were some fantastic and unexpected twists that really got the audience involved in the story. A wonderful cast and an excellent story made this movie outstanding.
