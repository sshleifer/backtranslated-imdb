A very good film about anti-Semitism towards the end of the Second World War. The scene that really speaks of the ignorance of these people is the meeting in the church when the priest delivers his speech against the "international money diggers and communists". It sounds amazing how the speeches with which Adolph Hitler pressed down the throat of his people, but none of the meeting participants seems to make this comparison.
