Slausen's lost oasis. , , a place to eat, fun. , , and MURDER! After a man disappears on his way to a gas station, a group of their friends set out to look for him. They come across a wax museum in which they believe that their friend ended up in the end. Unfortunately for friends, the owner of the street attraction has the power to control his wax figures and use them for evil. One by one, the tourists are followed by slausen and his legion of wax dummies and killed. Can the friends flee, or will they fall victim to the same fate as their lost friend? Following in the footsteps of the great classical wax films (House of Wax, Mystery of the Wax Museum), Tourist Trap follows the Slasher genre with its bizarre history and unique style. As far as character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., this seems to be just a basic Slasher movie. But it goes far beyond that as the director takes over the action and relocates to a supernatural thriller. Acting ranges from acceptable (from lead actor) to very good (from backwood actor Mr. Slausen (played by western legend Chuck Connors)). The writing is moving well and the dialogue is well structured, but there are some flaws in the logic as the film moves deeper into the story. Some scenes are also a bit silly, like the groaning mannequin attack on Becky. However, it is nothing that would affect the effect of the film. As one would expect from a movie about wax figures, it is full of the infinite horror of mannequins. It is strange that a (mostly) inanimate object can simply sit still and be somehow so disturbing. , , Maybe it's the human similarity or the blank look or the fact that you know it's about an attack. , , Whatever it is, the dolls are extremely scary and this effect is used very well throughout the movie. As for Slashers, it's one of the best and it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Obligatory Slasher Elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: The movie is full of cool deaths. The Gore is not over the top, but it's well done and makes it seem realistic. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There's an extended skinny dipping scene with the very attractive head women (though 'very attractive') 'barely describing Tanya Roberts's gorgeous future angel), but it does everything is curious, because the girls mostly stay under water. However, they remain only slightly clothed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Creepy is just the beginning of Slausen and his mannequins. One of the best killers in the Slasher subgenre. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: From the opening scene onwards, the movie retains a great mix of melee scary, fear of the attacks and a strong suspense in the stranded situation. , , It's all very well done to make a really scary movie. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: Well, Mystery was not really the movie's purpose. , , Only the meaning behind all this is what matters. <br /> <br /> - awkward dance scene: all these sweet girls and not a single dance. Shame. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 8/10. See this scary slasher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
