A humorous journey into the normally gloomy funeral business. It's easy to look at and even features Blethyn & Molina stealing a scene from an old Fred & Ginger movie.

The plot thickens when Pugh has a relationship with Watts, suggesting she do Blethyn. Meanwhile, Molina has rekindled his boring, romantic feeling for Blethyn and made her fake her death so she can flee to the South Seas. and dance their days together. During the "wrong" funeral, Blethyn learns about the infidelity of her husbands and plans their revenge. Look at what burials are likely to be - a celebration of life!
