I read reviews of this movie that found him "disappointing" and "confused". I can not understand why that should be so. From the beginning I found it a remarkable experience and a great pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The opening headlines overlay a beautiful picture of the development process, and this introduces the story in a laid-back and sweeping style. However, the film is not about the process itself, but about Charles Darwin's struggle with his conscience, his love for his wife, his deceased daughter, and his quest for truth. <br /> <br /> His daughter's apparitions are the manifestations of a tormented mind who knows he has "killed God." The daughter is an adult woman who comments on his work and torments Darwin with personal doubts. Was he somehow responsible for her death? Husband and wife in real life, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly truly make wonderful appearances as Charles and Emma Darwin, as does Martha West as Annie. Bettany's size and awkward gait give Darwin's character a real sense of reality, while Connelly feels very comfortable with her English accent and occasionally somewhat austere personalities. <br /> <br /> It's easy to misunderstand the times in which this film lives. The influence of religion on society and the internal struggles that a man like Darwin had to endure to seek the truth in what he saw. Science and religion have always been uncomfortable bedfellows, and although it did not cost him his life, as with so many former men and women, science posed a barrier between husband and wife, fact and belief. This film portrays this barrier perfectly. <br /> <br /> I give Creation ten stars, because I think it's beautiful, profound, excellently presented and a true, alien look at one of the worlds true geniuses. <br /> <br /> What seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone ... see Bill Maher's wonderful "Religulous") was hidden for millennia. After the truth was discovered, it was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines this pain and the realization that we are all we have. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cinematic experience.
