To discover something makes the journey so much more fun, much more surreal and emotional than when you finally arrive at your destination. Falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world. You feel strengthened, strengthened and alive. You just want to be with this person every second of the day, and the sound of her voice makes you excited and sometimes aroused. Love and all the associated physical and emotional side effects are pure bliss. Nobody can suspect what this is about, but when you start your trip together for the first time, there is nothing like it. Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and dr. Paul Flanner, two emotionally scarred middle aged people. In this film they will embark on a shared mystical journey where love and the discovery of emotions will help rescue them on the way. <br /> <br /> Lane looks at the typical jerk of a man's ex-husband who still loves her, but in her eyes, just because the woman he cheated on no longer wants him. As much as she was of him, as much as she really does not like him, there is a part of her who is considering taking him back. Why are you maybe asking? Because in life and in love sometimes comfort replaces intelligence. Yes, this man has cheated on her, but she has children with her, she has built a life with him and there is obviously still a connection to him. Richard Gere plays a recently divorced husband and father. He was also losing a patient when she responded negatively to the anesthetic. He is now sued by her family and he is guilty, but stubborn in the matter. That brings him to Rodanthe at all. Although his lawyer refused, he felt compelled to visit the wife's husband in Rodanthe. He stays at the inn, which Adrienne cares about. Soon they find comfort in their arms and discover that they too can have a second chance in life. <br /> <br /> Now that sounds like a simple idea for a movie, and even if it's something you might have 'I've seen or read, Gere and Lane just own the movie. Diane Lane lights up the screen with her smile. Her eyes sparkle in the dark and the life she brings to the character is one to watch. Gere's character is a bit different. He is more hardened and bitter. It takes Adrienne's pain and passion to get him out of his shell. He blames himself quietly for his tense relationship with his son, and she secretly blames herself for the patient's death. Externally, he says to anyone who will listen that it is not his fault and that she was a 1: 50,000 victim. But deep inside it eats it. You find yourself at a time when both need someone to listen to. <br /> <br /> Gere and Lane have been to the movie before, but this is the first time they've been playing lovers. They were married in Unfaithful, but here they play lovers who find themselves when people have left them in their lives. They have a spark and a real chemistry. I would like to see more movies with them. In fact, I would like to see more movies with Diane Lane, but that's another story. <br /> <br /> Nights in Rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls saving each other. Both become better people, both become stronger people. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone, not just couples. This is a movie about salvation, absolution and second chances. <br /> <br /> He will also ask you to bring some handkerchiefs. <br /> <br /> 8/10
