That's a gem. As a Film Four production, the expected quality was actually delivered. Filmed in a great style that reminded me of some Errol Morris films, concise and easy to grasp. It is long, but terrible, to the point where it is agonizing. We know that something bad has happened (one may suspect a person's lack of involvement in the interviews), but we have to see it, a bit like a car crash in slow motion. The story covers the most conceivable aspects and unlike some documentary films, it did not attempt to show the sharper sides of the stories, nor did it try to deal with the guilt of the people Don left behind, wondering why they did not stop him in time , It took me a few hours to overcome the melancholy that came after this very well done documentary.
