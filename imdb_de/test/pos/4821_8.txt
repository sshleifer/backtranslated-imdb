Rarely is a film sequence seen that surpasses or even exceeds the size of its original predecessor. One such movie is Virtual Encounters 2. <br /> <br /> There are a few guys in the school who sell virtual sex across the campus. If you like to see naked chicks, deliver them here. Chrissy Styler is a great, eight-foot-tall body, and you'll dream of her for days if you're ever lucky enough to get the unrated version. She wears just the right amount of body glitter in her numerous nude scenes and her huge cans seem to be real. (= Giddyup !!) With the exception of James Cameron's "Aliens", Francis For Coppola's "The Godfather II" and - of course - the "Airplane 2" by Zuckers, this is the only sequel to the Film story that picks up and enhances a classic movie. <br /> <br /> It's criminal how this film was ignored by the academy: Nikki Fritz and the broad band that gets tied up in the beginning (as well as the brunette, the near end gets attrition, all earned Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed, Hollywood !!!
