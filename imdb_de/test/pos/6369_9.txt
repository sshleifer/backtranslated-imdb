As a fan of Dan Aykroyd I saw this movie when he was recently shown on television in the middle of the night. I did not expect much, so it was a big surprise that I loved it so much. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie Dan Aykroyd likes to do. A chance for him to cut it and not take things too seriously. If you loved him in The Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters, you'll know what I mean, and you should check out The Couch Trip. <br /> <br /> Avid fans of Aykroyd will also have fun discovering all that tiny links to his other films in the script! <br /> <br /> I can not describe this movie without spoiling it for you, so all I can say is that you should check it. I can not over-praise this movie, and it certainly has to be time for a DVD release !!
