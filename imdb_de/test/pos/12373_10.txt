Much without words. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It was made in color, not like in today's films, but in a special mono-color use (with shades) that represented meaning, mood, meaning, and time. It should be seen in color as it becomes a completely different movie. The story of Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerl√∂f is effectively presented. You never have a clear sense of real, memory or phantom. The then changes in Swedish society are subtly superimposed. We recommend. Try to rent or find it online. I saw it in a Swedish movie class and I want to add it to my movie library.
