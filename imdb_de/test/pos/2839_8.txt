Sister Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies released lately. It was funny, but there were also many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear and the rest of the cast made their incredibly funny characters look real. The story was so curvy that it was incredibly fun to see. If you're tired of the latest formula movies, you'll find something else under Nurse Betty. Watch this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!
