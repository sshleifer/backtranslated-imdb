Typically, a movie may have factors such as arouse, feel good, sense of purpose, plot, and so on. There is always something that can be taken out of films. It is only a question of how convincing the reason is for me to own it in my collection. "The story of two sisters," as they call it when it was published in my country, has a tremendous feeling and (mostly) self-explanatory storyline. I love horror movies that revolve around a house. The titles I can think of are The Others, The Haunting, The Haunting of Hell House. This movie will be another great example that I will remember. The film had an extremely rich color in the way the house was decorated, in the dresses the characters wore in open daylight scenes, unlike most horror films that normally use desaturated tones and gloomy environments (think Honogurai mizu no soko kara, Dark Water, which is another show I like) this film is a sense of aesthetics and joy when it is not in its captivating moments. The characters are extremely credible, partly because of the familiar environment of this film. maybe home problems are easier for me than the actors with whom you identify, and the actors use extra finesse on your characters. The director plays with timelines in order to convey the story to the audience in pieces, so that he can come to his own interpretation conditions, instead of presenting everything in a linear manner. This, in my opinion, is a positive aspect of this film, and perhaps it is my interpretation of this film that allows me to find it pleasurable. I would definitely watch out for DVD.
