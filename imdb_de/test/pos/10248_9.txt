You want a movie that can bring you? Well, that's a good choice. If you were a teenager in the epoch depicted in this movie - Motown Time Day - or if you want to go back to see what your parents made so much noise, then I suggest you take this movie and watch him a clock. At the risk of playing a clich√© you will laugh, you will cry, you will remember and remember. They go back to a time when school violence was a fistfight. They like to remember their best friends from school. It's a feel-good movie with a touch of fear and pain and realism - misconceptions about losing friends and deciding what to do with your life. I think that everyone, regardless of race, age and socioeconomic status, can draw something from this film and really enjoy it. So take a few hours off a lazy day and watch this movie. There are much worse ways you can spend your time.
