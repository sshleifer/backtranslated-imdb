Many people give this movie a lot of shit and everything is really undeserved. People find this film difficult, either because it's such a nasty topic, or because they get involved in a technical aspect of the movie that nobody else watches when they watch it. If you just look at the cover, you think that this movie will make you uncomfortable ... DO NOT LOOK AT IT! However, they would miss one of the better cinematic experiences of the late 1990s, regardless of what others say. Dee Snider is wonderful as Captain Howdy here, the depths of madness he explores Play this character must be indescribable and is much further than any of us would be willing to leave. Acting here is wonderful. The movie itself was beautifully shot. The topic may be a bit too much for many, but it's still worth it. If you have not seen this movie yet, give it a try.
