This is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more than any other work coming from the province of La Belle to any other Quebec culture. It leads everyone into a first-person experience of culture, to the point where you wish you to stick your hair in place and live, breathe and eat everything, Maurice Richard. The book does that as well as the short book, and I'm glad I learned French all through my time in high school. I had to read in both languages. I found it brilliant to let Roch Carrier tell this story. His melassed accent brought a lot of realism into the story. The animation was also good and very surrealistic, which draws attention to a whimsical daydream about better days. <br /> <br /> This is again a symbol of culture unsurpassed. One can almost smell how the tour animal is cooked slowly over a wood stove. This entire film deserves endless praise for people's pride in being Canadians, and encourages us all to appreciate the finer points of the family and our roots. I'm from Ontario and this movie made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs.
