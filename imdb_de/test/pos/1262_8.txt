This was a great movie since it was only 67 minutes long. There was an aspect of film noir in this film, and I'm glad Nolan decided to film it in black and white. The plot is simple but entertaining, so you are always busy. Even the dialogue was good with acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento because it was not in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb had taught him. He said, for example, "Everyone has a box" in which he puts his personal belongings. The writer's door also featured the Batman logo, which seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan later directed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two other great films. There's a big turn in the end that I will not spoil for anyone who has not seen them, though I somehow knew what would happen if Cobb gave the credit card to D Lloyd's young man. I also liked how the author had a copy of The Republic of Plato, one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie that you have to watch more than once to see the whole aspect of the movie. Besides, he is only an hour long. There is also a circular aspect that ends where it started, which I thought was pretty brilliant.
