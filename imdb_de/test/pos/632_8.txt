I do not know how this movie went unnoticed for so long. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on TV, leafing through the canals and encountering this unexpectedly well-made movie. I missed the first, probably 10 minutes, but that does not matter. This movie literally grabbed me, it's a real Sleeping Beauty cooler. <br /> <br /> The absence of well-known actors in the film contributes to the effect, you do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. They never know when they will be killed or what they intend to do. The more it is tense. Although there are many new faces, their accomplishments were first rate. The filmmakers play with your mind and only show enough thrill to imagine the rest. The shock, the fear, the horror and the helplessness are also well expressed by the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Well written phrases, fast camera shots, smooth editing and great directing make him an excellent suspense thriller. This movie actually switches between genres - horror and suspense thrillers, and the viewer remains clueless and tense. No doubt comparable to Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I could not even get away from the TV during the commercial breaks. I was the helpless MUTE WITNESS for this great movie.
