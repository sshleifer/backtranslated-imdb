This is a movie about the music currently being played in Istanbul. Istanbul was the center of the two superpowers of the Old World, the Byzantine and the Ottoman Empire. Today it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million. No wonder that a lot of music is played in Istanbul, with a great variety of voices, styles and influences from all over the world. It's of course Turkish music, and I was fascinated with Turkish music since I bought my first record a long time ago. The film shows various singers, instrumentalists and bands. Spoken comments from the musicians illustrate the music played and the social context in modern Turkey. In my view, the most interesting comments from Orhan Gencebay. In addition, the films show an urban scene, especially from Istanbul, which is very pleasant to watch. "Crossing the Bridge" is a documentary and includes music by minorities, such as Kurds and Roma. Other important topics such as Turkish jazz music or music of the Armenians and Greeks are omitted. <br /> <br /> This film is strongly recommended for lovers of the music and culture of Turkey, the Balkans, the Eastern Mediterranean and Turkey Middle East. It may also be worthwhile for those who have a keen interest in the global effects of musical styles such as rock and roll or hip-hop.
