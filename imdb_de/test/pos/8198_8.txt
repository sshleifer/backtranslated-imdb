This is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of China in the third century BC. What makes it interesting is the tragic downfall of the king and all the intrigue of the palace around him. It reminded me a bit of "King Lear" and some of the other Shakespeare plays. The king begins with noble ambitions to unite the kingdoms under a ruler and to stop all quarrels with them. People can thrive and lead a better life. He and his childhood sweetheart, played beautifully by Li Gong, devise a program in which she claims to go into exile in a rival kingdom to recruit a killer for the king, who gives him the pretext to go to war. But while she is gone, the king, in his lust for power, becomes sadistic and trusts in a murderer. <br /> <br /> There are numerous subplots that keep the action going. There's the Marquis pretending to be stupid and stupid, but really clever and wanting to become king himself. He has fathered two children with the king's mother and manages to keep it secret for years. Then there is the Prime Minister, a political rival of the king who turns out to be his father. <br /> <br /> The assassin is itself a complex character. A skilful swordsman and murderer, he is currently undergoing reform when the king's lover recruits him. He does not want to kill any more, but he is finally won by Li Gong (who would not?) When he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become. <br /> <br /> Some spectacular cinematographs, especially the battle scenes, which are performed on a grand scale - as they used to say, a cast of thousands, literally. Acting is fine, nothing special. It is the story that is interesting, even though it crosses the border for more than two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look.
