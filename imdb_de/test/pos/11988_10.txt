The only conceivable mistake of this film is the title !! Please stop comparing it to the first! I only did it in my previous review to separate it from the first one. If you have not seen the movie yet and are curious, forget TOTALLY the first movie and invent another name for it. Nothing is the same and has its own mood. This is a great exponent of the snowy comedy of the 80s. I seriously doubt that big names in this lineup made the film because they were broke or even wanted to rebuild the first one. Anyone who ever wanted to kick the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. I claim that the only reason for the IMDB 100 is the title. I usually hate movies like these (Adam Sandler, Farrell, Farrelly Bros ...), but this movie just makes me hysterical. I do not know, maybe it's a bad relationship that I can not get out of, or just a ridiculous guilt. In any case, this is the most underrated movie of the 80s behind "The Stunt Man". <br /> <br /> Robert Stack- WE LOVE YOU !!! (1919-2003)
