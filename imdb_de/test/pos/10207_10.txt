I saw this movie for the first time in the theater in the 1940s when I was a kid and it always reminded me of the end. There is nothing better than the first impression, but some movies are a treat every time they are viewed. Something just resonates with them. This is one of those films, and I agree with another reviewer who said Fritz Lang should have directed more westerns. I've always liked Randolph Scott and Robert Young. In fact, Robert Young plays in my favorite movie, if I just have to name one, not a simple thing. This movie is Northwest Passage. It led me to the outstanding historical novels of Kenneth Roberts. Western Union also led me to read Zane Gray's novel, which turned out to be one of those rare cases in which I like the movie better than the novel. Not that Gray's novel is bad; I like the movie story better. The film is in no way similar to the novel. It's a completely different story, one of the biggest deviations from a book I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can not add much to the other reviews except to say that I agree with many of them. I also wish it was released on DVD. "Whatever happened to Randolph Scott has happened to the best of me."
