"Doppleganger" (or "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun", as it is more commonly known) was written (with input from the late Donald James) and was produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their Supermarionation television Shows like "Thunderbirds". <br /> <br /> The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and suggests sending a manned flight there. The committee scolds for the exorbitant costs and puts the project back. When the agency detects a security leak for fear that the Russians will be able to get there first, the project gets the go-ahead. American astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) collaborates with British scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry). After weeks of exhausting training, the Phoenix sets off and sets off for the unknown. Three weeks later, her ship crashes in a seemingly pristine, mountainous landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is badly injured. You see a light coming towards them ... I'll leave the overview here. Until then, the film was packed with outstanding special effects (by Derek Meddings) and music by Anderson's composer Barry Gray (the reason why he was not released on C.D.). But when Ross and Kane crash the land and we discover the secret of the alien world, this is a duplicate of our own. Everyone is the same. The only big difference is that things are the other way around - it gets less interesting and ends with a shattering anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place to make that idea, in fact Gerry & Sylvia did something similar later in their show "Space: 1999". Ross risks (and eventually loses) his life to return to Earth - his earth. But why? The new earth is so similar that he might not have bothered. Roy Thinnes had recently shot "The Invaders" TV series and offers a competent performance (too bad that there were not more scenes like this one.) Where he rows with his wife). Ian Hendry is good as a "Kane", but disappears too early in the story. Several actors subsequently joined Anderson's U.F.O. like Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you'll miss Nicholas Courtney ('The Brigadier' ​​from 'Dr.Who' in a tiny role). The award goes to the late Patrick Wymark as "Jason Webb", boss of Eurosec. The character is not far from "Sir John Wilder," whom he portrays in "The Power Game" by A.T.V. played. Webb is such a devious character that he can watch wonderfully. Herbert Lom's contribution (as a spy with a camera hidden in the wrong eye) is a little more than a cameo. <br /> <br /> As I said, the special effects are wonderful, just like the sets. The movie is worth seeing, but does not expect much when the action moves on the mirror planet. With a stronger script, this could have been another "Planet Of The Apes" or, dare I say, "2001: A Space Odyssey." In Anderson's productions, he made the future like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no hint that anything was seriously wrong with the world. We are in the future and people are still watching every second evening on Coronation Street. How disappointing. If there really is a mirror somewhere in the earth, you hope that this is a better place than this one. If all the women there look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I'm on the next flight!
