Brilliant work. Wonderful actors break up as courageous and courageous characters. All the unforgettable parts in a more than fascinating and thrilling action thriller. The casting is perfect. Both from the side of the stars like: Armand Asante, Bernhardt, Kier, Denier. But also for new faces. I was very impressed by the young actor who plays the young gang member Mustafa. They trust everyone from the Turkish gang. Very convincing are Michael Barral and all White Power supporters. I admire the music rhythm of the main theme "Children of Wax". This soundtrack is a charming mix of Turkish, Hard Rock and Udo Kier's buzz. And at the same time Children of Wax, a story that focuses on racial conflict, the intolerance and brutality between the skinheads and the Turks.
