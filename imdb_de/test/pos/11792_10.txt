Another brilliant depiction of Kiefer Sutherland playing Mickey Hayden, a police officer who deals with psychic visions of murdered victims. I love movies that deal with the mental realm, and I was not disappointed with "Eye of the Killer" (AKA After Alice). I just wish the movie had appeared theatrical at first.
