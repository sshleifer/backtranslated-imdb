Why do people have to follow the opinion of the mass herds and critics? RANDOM HEARTS, directed by the brilliant Sydney Pollack (who also plays a minor role in the movie), is another Harrison Ford vehicle. As such, it's pretty good and entertaining. Anyone who wants to see it has it in mind or reads the book, which is not better. Even the fans of Kristin Scott Thomas, including myself, knew that it would be a variation of her that again played the love interest of her eldest uncle. As such, the film is satisfactory. What's so bad about this movie, which is much better in the other (much higher rated) Harrison Ford vehicles? This movie is not a masterpiece, but it's not as bad as the masses would have the potential audience believe.
