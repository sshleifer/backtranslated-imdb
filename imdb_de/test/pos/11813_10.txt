The Cure is a fantastic movie about an AIDS boy. I cried about four times when I saw this movie, and it's just so sad. I can not promise that everyone will cry when I see that, but it will make you want to. The Cure is a very emotional and sad movie that you have to see. It shows you the meaning of friendship and love and is an extremely great movie. <br /> <br /> At first I did not think it would be so great and wondered why my mother always cried when I saw her. But now I know it's a stunning movie that is so original and so close to real situations, unlike most other films that do not make sense. Words can not describe the size of The Cure, you just have to see it.
