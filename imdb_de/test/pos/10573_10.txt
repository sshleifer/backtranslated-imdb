This movie was incredible !!!! I did not know the backstory, so I had to unfold it on DVD in front of me. It had many twists and turns, but kept the story always fresh and exciting. The acting of Elaine Cassidy was in a word Brilliant as well as Sally Hawkins. The plot is rich in plausible events as well as fresh ideas from the present. <br /> <br /> There's really something about Ms. Cassidy's eyes that "leaves a mark". This film is a refreshing look at the way we look at the "Victorian times" and how we see this society. A very rewarding watch.
