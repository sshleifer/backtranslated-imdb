This is an outstanding crime thriller that also has a great cast. Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, the best and most popular actors of Spanish cinema of the last decades, frolic in one of the better Spanish-language thrillers of 2004-5. The film begins with the focus at thirty some Ernesto (Ernesto Alterio), an elegant, attractive and sleek thief who has learned from his childhood friend Gitano and more recently from Manco, a seasoned swindler. Manco introduces Ernesto Federico (Federico Luppi), an equally elegant but skilful and experienced methodical thief - the best in his class. <br /> <br /> Federico's only weakness is Pilar (Victoria Abril), his former lover and partner Suddenly she appears and suggests to her former lover a fabulous rip-off system, a crime on a grand scale that includes help by Ernesto, Manco and Gitano. <br /> <br /> The script is full of twists and turns, especially towards the end of the movie. One criticism of the film, which I have heard many times, is that there are too many plotter changes in the end, but I disagree. The film captivates the audience so much that all unexpected events do not follow too much. That really makes the movie outstanding. I highly recommend it.
