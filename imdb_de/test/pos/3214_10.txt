This is a really great show. I love the show and I'm glad it has not been canceled yet. It has really good humor and shows the realistic connection between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very great. You are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. They do everything together like my mother and me. ya for gilmore girls. Um, I run out of lines. but I love how the relationship between Luke and Lorelei is finally formulated. So they had to be together. and I just love Sookie St. James! She is so great. and the show would not be anywhere without Michel. The whole show is dry humor, sarcasm and life in a very small town everybody knows each other.
