The movie was good. The only reason I saw it was Alan Rickman. What he did not do with the southern accent, but he did pretty well. I do not like the whole character in my opinion not one of them did badly, another thing I noticed. I have read all these comments and no one has commented on Alan 5 0'clock shadow. That made him look even better and he had a pretty good impression throughout the movie. I would give the movie a 9 out of 10 points. Another opinion is that the movie would be better if there was no sex. Still, it was good. I love the scene where he says "Aw sh * t" as he sits in his car and sees her in his mirror.
