I saw this movie the night it premiered on MTV. Normally for me, MTV movies are somehow stupid, but this one was so good. Summer Phoenix is ​​a fantastic actress and I thought that Nick Steel is good as well. If MTV started showing more films like this, I would probably enjoy the channel much more.
