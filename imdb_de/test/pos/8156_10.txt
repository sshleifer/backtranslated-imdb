This is an all around excellent movie. A moving experience full of real emotions. Here are lessons to learn about love, sex, work, religion, and American culture, regardless of sexual preference. <br /> <br /> Even though this film is a devastating charge against the Mormon beliefs, any conservative faith could easily take its place. However, it is a bit ironic that homosexuality is currently being indefinitely condemned by Mormons. Here is a belief that has required generations of believers to practice polygamy! And these true believers gave up this practice only because they were forced by the federal government to join Utah in the Union. Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> The sex scenes shown in the unrated version are tasty and surprisingly short. There is nothing that could offend someone with open-mindedness. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so obvious is that homosexuality is completely natural for gays because heterosexuality is for people who are straight! While love and sex obviously have very different needs, it is absolutely beautiful, indescribable, when both occur simultaneously between two adults! A deep erotic love is one of life's most precious gifts! I congratulate the filmmakers for a successful work!
