I probably would not have bothered to comment on this film if the constant clues that were made here in North America as pornography did not bother me. Our obsession with what should or should be considered pornographic remains a remnant of the "guidance" that the Hayes committee gave to the filmmakers many, many years ago, and now is the time for us to do it banish into the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now call "soft" and "hard" pornography, both bearing the same pornography label. It's about time we all realized that neither the R-rated (Softporno?) Release version of this movie nor the version available in DVD (Unrated) was pornographic in any way. Legal Terms Pornography is defined by its ability to spoil or corrupt. Many classic books such as Lady Chatterley's lover, Fanny Hill, Women in Love, The Story of 'O' or Moll Flanders were prosecuted for pornographic content, brought to trial by a panel of judges and clarified on the basis of that definition, but in practice for most ordinary citizens They are not interested in what they consider to be legal indifference, and they use a simpler test that is rather too strict for books and films that are very close to the line, but it does serve the purpose to quickly rid most others of any contamination of pornography. Although the Hayes code would have rated AIW as unacceptable for both nudity and sexual activity, most people today accept that the basic message of a book or film should clearly promote the development of stable family relationships where the participants find true fulfillment, this can not be considered pornographic (this does not mean that works that represent unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be considered pornographic, only that they require a more sophisticated assessment). In AIW, we have a movie about a young librarian who has a secure education and keeps her guardian at a distance because she believes that morality forces her to do so. After becoming too frustrated and threatened to leave her, she falls asleep dreaming that she will be transported to a Wonderland (closely based on Lewis Carrol) where everyone she encounters is completely uninhibited about her sexual needs , She is shocked, but she is a friendly person who takes things the way she finds them so that she can soon resolve her own prejudices. She wakes up when her friend returns to break off her affair, but her attitude toward him has changed so completely that her relationship is fully restored and the film ends up being with her children in a house with a white house. " Happy Ever After "live a picket fence and a family dog ​​- an end that is clearly aimed at those romantics who are very young at heart. <br /> <br /> Pornographic? - Barely!! <br /> <br /> Suitable viewing for children? - Well, probably not quite, unless they have very progressive parents. <br /> <br /> R rating? - PG would be more appropriate today. <br /> <br /> Entertaining to viewers in most age groups? - Yes, but the film has its faults - these are discussed in many commentaries here on IMDb, but most commentators have clearly appreciated and enjoyed this. <br /> <br /> I believe the only pornography associated with this film was that reported by an anti-pornography activist of "scientific proof" that a magazine photograph by Kristin deBell was a photographic montage of images of a ten-year-old child different body parts of adult models was. These and other comments have severely damaged the career of a promising young actress, but today the film seems to be on the way to becoming a cult classic. Several home video productions have been released in both VHS and DVD formats; The last one was a DVD that contained both the R-rated and unrated versions of the film and was released in 2007 by Subversive Cinema. Copies of them were available until a few months ago, and now they are almost exhausted, and the mail-order merchants who still have copies in stock often sell them at their original price - a situation that usually leads quickly to the release of a new DVD release. This continuing interest, almost 35 years after the release of the original film, indicates a near-classic status. <br /> <br /> Commentators in this database are expected to provide viewers with useful hints as to whether a movie is worth to be seen or even collected. My comments here should emphasize the ongoing damage to the industry, which is still caused by the pressure of the big studios to respect the recommendations of self-censorship emanating from the Hayes Committee. In this database, such general comments are quickly labeled as "not helpful" by the readers, and I rarely do them; Luckily, I still have room to add that in my opinion this movie is quite unusual and worth seeing or even buying. It's flawed, but Kristine DeBell delivers a great performance and the movie offers a pretty unique and rewarding viewing experience. Overall, I would rate it with 7 stars and will buy a copy of the next DVD edition when it appears. If Ms. deBell is still alive today, I would be very happy to receive her comments, both on the attempts to suppress this film and the late realization that he has gradually reached.
