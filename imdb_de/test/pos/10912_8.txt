A beautifully constructed and brilliantly performed comedy. There is no person in the cast who does not confess with funny distinction. The real star of the film, however, is the invisible director Frank Oz, who brings all the crazy sensibility and wit to this farce that he brought to Miss Piggy's encounters with the frog Kermit. This is a movie not to be missed.
