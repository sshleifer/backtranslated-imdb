Great comic comedy of the 1980s in southwest England. It's a story of sex, drugs, cream tea and sea killing. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (weird on the train) and Robbie Coltrane play a role. Dennis (Edmondson) tries to impress his girlfriend by claiming to be involved in a multi-million pound drug deal. This leads to complications with funny results. I'm trying to figure out the original aspect ratio for this movie, but it does not appear under "Technical Aspects" of the IMDb site. I have discovered the DVD in the shop and seems to be in 1.33: 1 format (full screen). Was the film shot in this ratio or was it originally a widescreen movie with a Pan & Scan DVD? It would be useful to know how I hate and scan pan films. So come on IMDb. Could you find out for us?
