Sometimes I really wonder? Looking at the comments here, it seems most people have seen a completely different film than me. I just saw it ... and I liked it. Not that it made me happy, but to have seen a good movie! <br /> <br /> The film needs a little patience, yes. And yes, the main character is really annoying, but I'm sure it's intended. <br /> <br /> Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this movie in the cinema or at home. Most people watch films at home as if they were listening to elevator music. This movie definitely does not fit as background noise. <br /> <br /> And no. Good governance does not mean having five laughs or explosions per second. Good governance means following your topic and keeping the story and actors together. And although that does not work out perfectly, at least I think it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> I liked the photography and the sets, even if they are sometimes surreal. The opening scene is really special. <br /> <br /> I also liked acting? Guillaume Depardieu does NOT play Pierre. He plays the role of a Pierre, who plays a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero he tries to be so much, he is a presumptuous and self-righteous idiot, a veritable weakling, who gradually damages all the people he claims to protect. The fact that his love for the truth is only a pose is wonderful in that he constantly lies and does not even ask questions or explain himself. <br /> <br /> People are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff: No Character that is seen for more than two scenes remains unexplained, there is enough information about the entire movie. <br /> <br /> And even the strange building makes sense as soon as the target training is seen: Remember that Isabelle has fled a war zone - and this is obviously a sanctuary for fighters in a civil war, most likely Bosnia ( that was still running before the production of the film). At least that's the story told by Isabelle Pierre when she met him for the first time, and the later scene in which Pierre Isabelle shows the book with his father on the cover, which is surrounded by books on Bosnia.
