I have read all of Jane Austen's novels once a year since I was nine years old and received the Modern Library edition of her collected works as a birthday present. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie because of its romance and because of the music that has remained unbearable in my mind. It was, of course, an interpretation, not an Emma or Sense and Sensibility, but something completely different and something that Catherine herself would have loved. And oh, to be loved by that passionate Henry! This was the fantasy of Henry of Catherine, and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels, and who had promised us the practical Jane Austen, who tells us right from the beginning that the unlikely Catherine will actually be one. I wonder if Jane was completely satirical in her novel. Maybe she could imagine such a Henry too. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie in the last ten years. Since then, I long for it.
