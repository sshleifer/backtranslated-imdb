The beautifully appealing song of the same name as the film won the best song Oscar in 1955. <br /> <br /> Love is a great thing. <br /> <br /> It's the April rose that only grows early spring. <br /> <br /> Love is nature's way of giving a reason to live. <br /> <br /> This golden crown that makes a man king. <br /> <br /> Once on a high and windy hill <br /> <br /> In the morning mist, two lovers kissed and the world stood still. <br /> <br /> Then your fingers touched my quiet heart and taught him to sing. <br /> <br /> Yes, true love, a cherished thing. <br /> <br /> How can we forget such a beautiful song? Henry King, the director, has had the privilege of collaborating twice a year with Jennifer Jones on this film and the heavily undervalued movie "Good Morning, Miss Dove." Jones was nominated for "Splendored Thing," but she could easily have been nominated for Miss Dove. William Holden is just great, because the war correspondent in 1949 had reported on the communist revolution in China. His love for Jones, an oriental doctor, was lovable and so memorable. <br /> <br /> Even though the end is not pleasing, this is still one of the greatest romances ever to be screened.
