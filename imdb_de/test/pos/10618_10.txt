This movie is absolutely amazing. From the performances of Huppert, Girardot and Magimel to Hanekes screenplay and direction, there is not a single misstep. The film may scare off some people with tough sexual themes and slower pace, but it's really a masterful piece of cinema Powerful and worthy of every award won at Cannes!
