Although at first glance the movie looks like your parents' high school story (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is out of date) ... and I admit that this was MY first impression .. but honest The "teachings" learned by the heroes / heroines are def. NOT outdated Who does not want to be famous? And who does not want him to be accepted by his colleagues? And the homosexual guy - is not there a whole controversy over gay marriages today, blah, blah? The movie, released in the 1980s, addresses some of the biggest problems in the world today. This film has a bit too much obscenity and nudity for my taste. (ie the 8/10 rating)
