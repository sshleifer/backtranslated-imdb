Harrowing series about life in Oz - an experimental prison in which they try to rehabilitate the prisoners. There is gay sex, rape, torture, mutilation, murders, humiliation, tons of male nudity ... everything in your face and with full force. <br /> <br /> It's also one of the best written dramas ever written on TV and almost all actors are just great. Because they were cables, there was no limit to what they could say or show. There are many racist comments flying here, but for all races. In fact, the white characters are pretty bad (especially the Aryans) and the black characters are better (the peace-loving Muslims). Hispanics do not have a strong role and there are NO Asian prisoners. All prisoners seem to stand back and be willing to kill somebody at any moment - but you still feel sorry for some of them. Even the guards, counselors and doctors in prison have serious problems. I definitely recommend this house, but do not rent it - do not buy it. I have the whole collection and to be honest, I do not think I would ever want to see her again. It's an incredible television, but so dark, dark and depressing. I think I have to sell everything online. <br /> <br /> I give him a 10.
