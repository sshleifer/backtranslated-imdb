An interesting and engaging film about a "living" who is just trying to live his days peacefully. Elements of the main character appear in Michael Mann's later films such as Thief (1981), Heat (1995) and so on. You can see it at the UCLA Instructional Media Laboratory - one of the few places in the country where copies are available to the public. It's a great thing!
