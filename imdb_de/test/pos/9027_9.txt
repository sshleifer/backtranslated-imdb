I really can not understand why people do not like this movie. I found it very entertaining (of course the fact that it's the great Laura Fraser is a bonus!) When I first heard about it, I thought it was going to be in the direction of an upside-down "Weird Science" and a Das true, but there is a twist that I really did not see coming. After seeing the trailer on the DVD (which I had not seen before the movie), I saw that the "shoot" is actually being shown in the trailer! Very strange. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the Weird Science comparison becomes less and less, and I think that's the better of the two films. Sure, there are some scenes that do not work well, but these are compensated by the enthusiasm of the young cast. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is a good example of a sci -fi chick movie, and I do not think I've seen many of them!
