I have always loved this movie. The music, the story and the action. I especially love opening and closing the film. The music stayed with me over the years. The World War I plane fights were great and the comedy is typically Blake Edwards. Slapstick is after all his strength. Julie's singing is incredible and keeps me on the screen. The sets and the scenes are wonderful. The characters are appealing. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie's singing. I wish she had sung to me in Vietnam. I also enjoyed the old cars from that time and the music of the First World War. Now I can whistle in the dark and watch it again and again.
