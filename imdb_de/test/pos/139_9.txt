They say that in horror films it is always better to leave things to the imagination of the beholder - to hide certain details from the audience, to tickle their imagination, to plunge themselves into their fears and to give birth to their darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> That was not the case when I saw Bakjwi under the American title Thirst. Play in selected theaters near you now. Apparently the filmmakers did not want to give you any details. There will be blood in this movie and you will try to look away. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the review, please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi Thank you and I hope you have read above.
