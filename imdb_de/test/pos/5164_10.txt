The latest film by Swedish film maker Roy Andersson, You, the Living, is not easy to review. One of the reasons is that in his own words he broke the Anglo-Saxon tradition of storytelling, essentially the pattern of most western film productions. Another reason could be that, although Roy Andersson has something to do with symbols, his, unlike those of Andrei Tarkovsky, are rather elusive. It took him three years to finish this 86-minute film, and not because he was forced to take long breaks between filming due to financial problems or problems with the actors. The film consists of 57 vignettes, which were mainly taken with a camera. The careful design of each of these scenes was time consuming. The imagery of this film, which is closely related to the director's previous film "Songs from the Second Floor," is of paramount importance to the story. Therefore, this story is largely told by the environment and the environment in which the characters of the Andersson universe live and interact. Before each scene was finally shot, there would have been no fewer than 10 different test shots with different actors, colors, dialogues, and so on. The result is a dreamlike version of the surrounding world that most of us would recognize and whether the scenery is like a dream scene, why not dream a little bit? Just as in Bunuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie: When someone says "I had a dream last night," you can see it. On the other hand, what is perceived as reality here is not very different from the dreams. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film lacks an action in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main characters, so the different characters that appear and reappear in different scenes still meet and their stories meet inevitably connected. What most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness, even though it is surrounded by other people. The trailer trash chain smokes and drinks a drinking woman who dreams of having a motorbike so she is "all that crap", her corpulent and mostly dumb friend and his frail and seemingly gentle but somewhat absent mother, member a marching band whose home improvement efforts have been well received by their families and their neighbors, the depressed Middle East hairdresser and his arrogant customer on the way to "a very important business meeting," an older man, one Nightmare has over bombers in the sky, a young girl who dreams of marrying the young rock star she's so in love with. It's about dreams and nightmares compared to reality, but it works as well as a statement in support of the claim of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that "all human communication is miscommunication". People talk to each other, but it's like they pass each other. They try to reach out to the others, but exclude others as they try to reach them. You, the living are a poetic film that, while physically playing in Stockholm, is universally applicable. The society she portrays is Sweden, her artistic language and the people shown are generally Nordic. The subject of concern, namely the misery of humanity in a selfish world, extends far beyond this hemisphere. Despite the serious theme, the movie itself looks much happier and full of humor than one might expect. But in the words of the director, "life is so complicated for each one of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor." Therefore, this movie is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on your sensitivities, and not a depressing tour of human nature. It's unusual in its language and structure, but if you think outside the box and enjoy it, you'll certainly find this movie entertaining and meaningful at the same time. It was featured at this year's Cannes Festival as part of the Un Certain Regard program, which features "original and other works" outside the competition. After the film was shown in the Salle Debussy, the 1,000-member audience gave standing ovations for several minutes. Do I have to say more?
