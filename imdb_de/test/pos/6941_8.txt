As a Canadian, I did not know much about the dismissal of Whitlam. I had read the Wikipedia page about these events, but that's about it. Earlier this year, as Canada underwent a potential constitutional crisis (it was gratefully delivered), possibly leading to intervention by our Governor-General, Whitlam's dismissal was mentioned in the press. To find out more, I ordered the DVD of this mini series on EBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed by how interesting the account was. As dramatic as the events may have been, it could have been a very boring political drama. However, it was a pretty exciting miniseries. I was also impressed with how understandable it was, although I did not know anything about Australian politics. It did not take long to find out who everyone was and what role they played. <br /> <br /> However, it is not completely impartial. Malcolm Fraser is undoubtedly portrayed as a rather Machiavellian figure who can not hinder a person or anything in his search for a prime minister. Gough Whitlam is depicted in a nobler, almost holy light. The actor portraying Whitlam, however, channeled the nobility so that he acts rather as pomposity. I thought that Sir John Kerr was pretty sympathetic. I have to warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality. I understand that it was made for television in the early 1980s, but it seems that no effort has been made to restore image quality or sound quality. It was very disappointing that no extras were added. A documentary or even some interviews with historical figures would have improved the experience, but there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this mini series to anyone interested in real events.
