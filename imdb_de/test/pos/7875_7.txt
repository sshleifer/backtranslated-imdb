Imagine that "Dragnet" is an episode in which Freitag and Gannon embark on a typical 1970s hippie inequality, but instead of giving everyone a talk, they get "some of it." That's "Joe" in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> This movie of a working-class bigot and a rich guy who just killed his friend's drug dealer friend has been terrible, and most supporting plays are stilted, but it's still interesting to see , The then about 35-year-old Peter Boyle plays Joe (the bigots) and looks like James Gandolfini. In her film debut, Susan Sarandon plays the daughter with the eye-chins, and although she does not necessarily indicate her future size, one can not take her eyes off her.
