Tipping the Velvet was released in the UK just three weeks ago and I'm already watching countless letters pouring out to national newspapers and TV guides, claiming they have a thin storyline, poor performances, and even weaker screenplay finds me angry. This is heresy. <br /> <br /> I really want to dispel all doubts by first congratulating Andrew Davies, who has enabled Geoffrey Sax to create this wonderful dramatization of Sarah Waters' novel by cushioning him with such a fantastic script. Kudos But I'm afraid I have to change now. <br /> <br /> I saw one of the leading TV guides here in the UK (to be nameless), who inexorably refers to Tipping the Velvet as a "lesbian love story". If this is the case, and I suppose they are trying to arouse interest in the film, this is the totally wrong way to think about it (apart from the fact that the term is a disappointingly inaccurate description). By saying this, they are either a) rejecting those who would instinctively be repelled by "this" object, or b) attracting a group of people who are just watching to "serious girl-on-girl actions" see. By buying this demonstration of serious considerations, these and other magazines reduce the costly adaptation of one of the greatest works of recent literature. Tipping the Velvet is a story of love, passion, going on, loss and heartbreak. It is not a lesbian love story. No siree. <br /> <br /> The end result is a stylish affair with outstanding performances (especially from Stirling, Hawes, Chancellor and May). In terms of direction, it is intoxicating and insistent - sometimes fast, sometimes not - but it never stops being less than compelling. All in all, it is polished and well supplied, the sex is done with tenderness and delicacy - and although many do not classify it as a real "movie", it will remain among my favorites for some time.
