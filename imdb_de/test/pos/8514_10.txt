Like most people who watched James Bond 007 movies. Most people NEVER knew that Thunderball was originally the FIRST 007 movie that was released, but after Ian Fleming he wrote the story with Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham. The two other authors sued Ian Fleming in court and WON THE CASE, proving that Ian Fleming had adopted SPECTER (Special Executive In Counterintelligence Terrorism Revenge Extortion) ideas. Instead of making Thunderball, they (Flamen, Broccoli, Saltzman) then made Dr NO. <br /> <br /> This movie had the best of the best. From Sean Connery he came back again over 5,000,000 paid for NSNA. Irvin Kershner and Sean Connery had problems on the set, that's right. But overall, that movie was up there, I think, with (Thunderball, License To Kill, Dr. No). These are my favorites from the Bond series. David Dryer was hired for Special Photographic Effects and was working on Bladerunner at the time, before he never says anything again. The $ 100 million yacht makes the disco volante like a canoe. In this movie, the best Villian in a Bond movie was behind dr. Klaus Maria Brandeau quietly held this neurotic business together with some humor for his authority over attachment. Barbara Carrera was excellent as Fatima Rouge. <br /> <br /> The music was better than any score in which John Barry did not include the backing soundtrack in most Bond films. Michel Legrand is not big in the US compared to Europe, he has played with Miles Davis and many other great jazz musicians over the years. It's a bit bland at times, but the 007 theme, which is about 3 or 4 times in the movie, NEVER AGAIN AGAIN, is so cool that I like it more than the original. <br /> <br /> 007 is again <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton has explained it correctly. I thought YOU CAN NOT CONNECT WITH A SUPERMAN OR A SUPERHERO, he or she has to be human and have feelings. He was by far the best serious version of Bond. But Sean Connery proves that he can still play the role that led him and others to follow him. I bet at 75, he could still play a villian role in a MCCLORY 007 movie if anyone ever shows up. <br /> <br />
