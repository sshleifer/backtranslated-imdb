Pepe Le Pew can either really crawl you out or sweep you off your feet. Either way, you can not help but feel a little awe when you see this classic WB character. This commentator personally believes that Pepe was the inspiration for others animated today by Cartoon Network "Johnny Bravo" to Disney's Lumiere of "Beauty and the Beast". <br /> <br /> His unique way of lovemaking is surprising in today's world, where his antics are usually slapped with a sexual harassment order and at least 50 yards from all his victims. <br /> <br /> In this particular cartoon, a World Tired decides to make an ultimate makeover and earns respect for a change when posing as a Skunk. Everything is going well until Pepe arrives and pursues the unhappy cat with his overwhelming love for love. <br /> <br /> In this animated cartoon, Pepes's foundations are set many hallmarks. From his adorable "frenchified" love calls to his shattering, quiet chase. <br /> <br /> This cartoon only shows that in the world of animated fantasy, the most passionate recruiter can go the distance ... and leave behind his beloved "pig-Eon", the dust leaves you.
