This movie is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the breathtaking photography and the drama, the colossal battles (no computer graphics here, just thousands of people). Someone said that history has something to do with the Sheakespeare tragedies. I also find some links with the Greek tragedy tradition. <br /> <br /> The emperor who has done extraordinary fights between power and love, but he is compelled to coercion (for the benefit of the ancestors) choose the power (and loneliness, hatred of his subjects and relatives) as his destiny. He was like Creon in Antigone a good guy before he became emperor. Once he comes to power, he must be merciless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. Captured by power, he becomes a monster. Overall, the Qin Emperor is a majestic Greek tragedy. The assassin develops in a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. Even this character is forced to his fate by love and his new ethics. This character is really unforgettable. Lady Zhao, a wonderful Gong Li, is the unadulterated morality, neither through power nor through love or hate. It is morality against power, somehow like Antigone. Their conspiracies (for and against the emperor) always have a moral justification. <br /> <br /> In summary, a wonderful movie. If you love cinema and want to try Chinese movies, you can start here.
