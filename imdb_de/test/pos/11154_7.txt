Like many stars of the big screen, as their careers abated, many turned to television, where they likely secured their reputation for posterity. Donna Reed is a typical example. I do not think Donna Reed ever thought that Donna Stone was a challenge, not for a woman who won an Oscar because she played a very different type from From Here to eternity. She was certainly better prepared to play wife, mother and housewife Donna Stone after she played Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Donna was always beautiful and wise and always helpful with the problems of her children and her husband. Carl Betz was no idiot, he was a pediatrician and had his office connected to the house. Talk about the man ever being ready in a crisis. <br /> <br /> Although this was the Donna Reed Show because Donna's husband was then, Tony Owen produced it. However, it took as long as it was because of the popularity of the two children Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had the best-selling album Johnny Angel, which she presented on the show. She made the transition to an adult star, who was best known for her role as coach of Craig T. Nelson. <br /> <br /> But Petersen was a bubblegum teen idol back then. The Donna Reed Show dares, I say, most viewers because of him. It's forgotten now, but Petersen also had a bestselling record, My Dad. Not half as good as Johnny Angel. <br /> <br /> Now Paul Petersen runs a support group for former child stars like him. So many of them end so tragically that they do a good job. <br /> <br /> The Stone family was the quintessence of Central America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago and led a healthy life. Mom and Dad were always there for the kids. Of course, the problems they normally had were nothing but blocking the curfew. <br /> <br /> It is this series that I believe was the model for the television city of Pleasantville, which attracts Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon. <br /> <br /> I have nice memories of the Donna Reed Show. Easy to take, but not too serious.
