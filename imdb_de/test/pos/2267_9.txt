2005 was one of the best years for movies. We had so many wonderful movies like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, A History of Violence ..... Soon we got Brokeback Mountain, King Kong Everything was lit up, then we did not miss the whole year. The first film directed by the talented Liev Schreiber is a delightful, heartwarming, touching drama that also features one of Elijah Wood's finest roles. He is perfect as Jonathan, a curious man who goes to Ukraine to find the woman who rescued his grandfather in World War II. Liev Schreiber, who also writes the film, conducts a masterpiece with memorable scenes and (many) funny quotes. This is a real mix of comedy and drama that brings a movie that will be commented on in a few years. As a serious Oscar contender, Everything Illuminated is a powerful, original and, why not, lit film. But there is one thing you should keep in mind when getting into the movie: Leave the normal state behind. This is especially ------- 9/10
