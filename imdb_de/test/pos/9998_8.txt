I was extremely impressed by this movie. It's one of the best sports movies I've ever seen. The visuals in this movie are outstanding. I love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup. The movie moves well and offers both excitement and drama. The cinematography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> The acting performances are great. I was surprised by the young Shia LaBeouf. He is good in this role. Stephen Dillane is also good as the brooding Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth and Elias Koteas provide support. The movie is enthralling and entertaining and for the first time in my life I really felt like a golf tournament.
