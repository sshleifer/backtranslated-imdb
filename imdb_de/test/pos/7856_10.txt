This movie was a surprise. The action summary sounds kinky and stars Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine Page. I did not know what to expect. There is the opening scene in which the wounded soldier says that the age of 12 is old enough to kiss, and gives a boring and very adult mouth-to-mouth kiss to a child. The child brings it to the girls boarding school where it lives. He takes advantage of the situation by trying to seduce the headmistress who is being played by Page, her assistant, and another student. Jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue and macabre merge in this wonderfully original story. <br /> <br /> I have read the other comments here and find little that she can not agree with. However, I wanted to clarify a point that there are no sympathetic characters in the film. I think there is one. The attractive slave successfully defies the soldier's progress in a scene that works well because she touches on the common history of black slaves exploited by white men. Although her strength and her lack of illusions are the sum of her experience, in my opinion she is a sympathetic figure. She has more than any other women and girls at the school a legitimate reason to participate in what happens in the end.
