The film is a remake of a 1956 BBC series called "My Friend Charles," and so the material gallops in a relatively short time. I found it fast moving, enjoyable and unpretentious. Did anyone else notice the scenes toward the end where John Mills was gassed - the producers obviously opted to skip the scenes - maybe censorship? - but notice, as he sat at the window of the apartment and breathed deeply, followed by similar scenes with the car window open. The series of Francis Durbridge all seemed to inhabit the same universe, of inexplicable events, where humans were not what they seem and the villain is someone close to the hero / victim.
