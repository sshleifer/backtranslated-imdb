Yes ... I read David Lee Roth's autobiography "Crazy From the Heat" (which is an amazing read, by the way) and the DLR says it was his favorite blacksploitation movie as a kid. He says he always imagined himself a black man in Southern California. Mr. Roth is quoted as saying: <br /> <br /> "We've seen every blacksploitation image, and these films had a HUGE impact on me." Trouble Man, Superfly, Foxy Brown, Shaft, Cleopatra Jones, Blacula, Rudy Ray Moore His Dolemite vibe - I've seen all these ... "<br /> <br /> He continues to say: <br /> <br />" Dolemite - Rudy Ray Moore - was one of the originals He was a blue comic and had a blue sense of humor, like Redd Foxx on early party albums, he was the perfect player to play a new secret agent, his answer was not "bonds." James Bond. "His answer was" Dolemite "motherf *****!" We would wait for this line in all of his films. "Get Whitey" would appear at least once in every movie and we would wait for that too. They had the cars, they had the shoes, they had the guns, the haircuts, the slang and the scams. And we all knew that all those strange decisions at the end of the movie were white bulls. * He tries to feed hungry kids, but he's actually a pimp ... bull ****. This was designed to make it palatable to our mothers and fathers so they could let us see the picture. "<br /> <br /> Like a true genius talked about After reading about Mr. Roth's book about Dolemite, I instantly bought a DVD and I like it a lot." Yes, it's a super-low budget and yes ... I hate rap ... but as a fan of Tarantino films, I see a lot of similarities, especially some of the 70s fusion / funk ala jaco pastorius music, and I also love the scene in which the two policemen "destroy" him for coke, and then one of them snorts a lot of it as if he's done it a thousand times and says something like "Aww yeah ... that's the real mccoy! "... and then he goes on talking and has a little coke on his lip." CLASSIC! Part of the violence is a little over the top, but shocking, which I think would be a positive quality, not as predictable as I assumed. Definitely buy "The Human Tornado" soon 10 of 10.
