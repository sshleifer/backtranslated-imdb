Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra films have never been disappointed. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To Pagal Hai was fresh and perfect to look at. Mohabbatein remains one of my favorite movies of all time. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the above-mentioned films, but definitely worth a meditation. And SRK, who blew me away with a great performance in Baazigar, repeats a rogue act. And this time he gets an experienced Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol to support him. Before I comment on acting, it's not just acting but the wonderful script that's worth watching. It is the writing that complements the great spectacle. The story is gripping, but the characterization is out. The comedy track is progressing well. But the film tends to shift too much in romanticism. The spectator loses interest and you will make a few yawns. But the movie is still good. <br /> <br /> Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in his author-supported role. Shah Rukh Khan is sympathetic and cruel again. You will have cried in the end. Juhi Chawla is decent. Her screams become unpleasant after some time. But in the expression she is excellent. But her final scene is brilliant (though she was overshadowed by SRK). She has a role supported by the author, which makes her very sympathetic. Sunny Deol is sufficient. His character was very nice, but too perfect. And after a while, it gets boring. He does a good job. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role felt a bit out of place. Tanvi Azmi supports well. <br /> <br /> The songs are pleasant and come at the right time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song, and the presentation is like the 90s. Tu Mere Saamne (They are in front of me) and Likha Hai (written here) are beautiful love songs. Darwaza's band Kar Lo (Close the Door) is also a decent love song. The instrumental song is danced perfectly as well as the naughty wedding song Solah Button. The movie may not be perfect, but it's well worth your time, especially if your favorite actor is around.
