Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky are dismantling the American hospital system with this nasty comedy / drama / whodunit. The hospital pictured here is fraught with problems ... from neighbors' protests to irritating patients to a potential serial killer at large. George C. Scott is the head physician on the verge of his nervous breakdown interfering with the free-spirited Diana Rigg and her crazy dad Barnard Hughes. THE HOSPITAL is alternately depressing and seditious, offering some of the most acidic dialogue imaginable (note how Scott describes his love session with Rigg). It also has many great vignettes: Scott scolds nurse Nancy Marchand after one of the subordinates accidentally killed a doctor here; Daffy Administrator Frances Sternhagen is desperately trying to collect insurance information from a waiting room full of sick people; Scott received a sobering advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him about his sad home. All action is first class. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The film is a masterpiece with Chayefsky's script deserving a well-deserved Oscar (over such fierce competition as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening speech is priceless.
