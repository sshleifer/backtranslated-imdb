For all viewers who have watched "The Cure", I agree with the comment that this is an excellent movie that is very heartwarming. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro prove their star quality in this movie, along with Dexter (Mazzello) mother Annabella Sciorra. <br /> <br /> When I saw The Cure on TV for the first time, I did not know what to expect When I saw this masterpiece, I quickly realized what it was all about. Dexter, an 11-year-old boy plagued by AIDS, sits around his backyard playing with his toys when he meets his neighbor Eric, a neighbor, who is a bit awkward for the two boys, but they soon became good friends. <br /> <br /> During the film, I kept wondering what would happen to the two guys because they kept asking me questions. I wondered how the hell they would get to New Orleans if they had a door with a sea biscuit underneath and pulled an inflatable crocodile behind them. There were other great scenes throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> But the part that turned to me was the part that worsened Dexter's health. They just could not help but wonder if he could do it, but in the end you'll find out. The first time they played, I thought Dexter was really dead, obviously not, stupid. But when they play the third, something is very wrong. Dexter does not laugh and does not laugh. At this point, the victim of her prank soon announces that poor Dexter had died. I lost it on this part. I clenched my eyes and from that scene I cried. You only have to. As the end approaches, you begin to understand Eric's loss, and then the film ends with a nice touch, with Dexter's shoe slowly drifting down the river. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was excellent. It has laughter, adventure, emotions and sadness, etc. If you put that in a blender, you get a great, must watch movie. Peter Horton has done a great job of directing this movie, and I think he's certainly one of his best. But for the moment I will try to search for this movie on DVD if it exists. Once again a great movie that puts you on an emotional rollcaster.
