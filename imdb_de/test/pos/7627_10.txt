The Last Dinosaur is a movie that should be fun and exciting. Both succeed. Maston is a big game hunter hunting big game (go figure). He owns a company and plans an expedition with a group of people, including a photographer named Frankie, a Japanese scientist, a man who works for his company called Chuck, and an African who helped him on many safaris called Bun Ta. It's about studying what's probably Tyrannosaurus Rex, a dinosaur that killed the last expedition to the area. You will drive into this prehistoric area and take a drilling rig called Polar Borer, which floats underwater. Once in the area, they soon find the Tyrannosaurus that Maston tries to shoot, but his weapon is jammed. Chuck immediately realizes that Maston wanted to hunt the dinosaur all the time to include him in his "Stuffed Animals" collection. While they were gone, Tyrannosaurus invades their camp and takes the Polar Borer from their camp. On returning, the group realizes that she may be in the area longer than she expected, and Maston claims he will kill the Tyrannosaurus. The story is great for a science fiction movie. Drilling in a prehistoric area seems to be really possible. The landscape is beautiful and looks like a place where dinosaurs could still be. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this movie. Maston is the typical big hunter who wants to get everything a trophy kill could be. Also great was Bun Ta, played by Luther Rackley, formerly of the NBA, who really looks like an African tracker. Jackie is the typical woman who causes trouble for the group and apparently does not belong in the wild. Chuck is the former Maston employee who changes his view of his boss when he's in the wild with him. The Tyrannosaurus in this movie is one of the best in a movie. It stands a little too high like Godzilla and pulls his cock so that it is a man in a suit. But the suit looks good, especially the head and tail, and the tyrannosaur looks good and very scary. I have seen many other films in which dinosaur suits look a lot worse. Tyrannosaurus in this movie sometimes sounds like Godzilla's, other times like King Kong from "King Kong Escapes" and "King Kong vs Godzilla". Such a great Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> The Last Dinosaur is full of action. Particularly noteworthy is a great fight between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. Also a great scene where Bun Ta tries to spew the Tyrannosaurus. There are other great parts that I will not reveal. You have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. Take a look and you will not be disappointed.
