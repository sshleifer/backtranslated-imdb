This movie is wonderful! I can see it again and again. Robin Hood is perfectly cast and Marian is beautiful. Personally, I think the German of Marian together with Latrine and the sheriff is the funniest character! While space balls have become boring and stupid after a while, this one always upholds your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great movie and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles and she is perfectly fake, makes so much sense and can be viewed again and again! You'll love this movie if you only watch it, unless you hate comedy or do not believe that Robin Hood should be manipulated. But this old story gets boring and this movie gives it a great new atmosphere!
