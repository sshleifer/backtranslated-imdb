The "cessation" can also be about leaving a given identity as the withdrawal of drugs. As a rural type who comes to Beijing, class and success must have met this young artist's face with an appeal to break away from his roots and surpass the success of his farmer's parents by far. However, problems arise when the new man is too new and demands too much deviation from family, history, nature and personal identity. The subsequent divisions and confusions between the imaginary and the real, and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic, on the one hand are the material of a bowel control or, on the other hand, a complete escape from the self. Hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely way back to himself can be grim. But what brings an exceptionally compelling peculiarity, honesty and sensuality to director Zhang Yang and his actors on this journey. No clich√©s, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no required sex, romance or violence scenes, no street language and no money to drive character effects and whims. <br /> <br /> Hongshen Jia is in her mid-twenties. He is a talented actor, impressive, vain, idealistic and perhaps emotionally starved. The perfect recipe for his Enabler. Soon he is the "cool" actor who is adored by the youth. "He was hot in the early nineties." "He always had to be the most fashionable." He needs extremes and goes for heavy metal, takes on earrings and a scarf. His acting means the arts, friends - and roles, but not the kind that offers a personal challenge or input. And his self-criticism, clouded by the immediacy of success, opens the door to an irrational self-doubt, self-loathing - "I did not know how to behave" "I felt like a dizziness" - and readily available medicines to counteract them. He says, "I had to go up to do what the director wanted." Thus, his flat identity as an actor about drugs becomes an escape from identity. <br /> <br /> Hongzhen's detachment from drugs and his wrong life is very gradual, intermittent - and stubborn his own. Loneliness, space, meditative thinking, language rejection replace the therapy. The summary is out. Much of his change takes place outdoors - not in idealized locations, but mainly in green spots under Beijing's highways, bridges, and skyscrapers. The physicality is almost romantic, but it is not. The bike rides to Ritan Park, the long spontaneous walks, the soaked sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and dragons that soak up his senses are very specific. He drifts to arrive, at the same time drawing hints to a more realistic and realistic identity. "I started to open up," he says retrospectively about this time. And the contact seems to start with his lanky body projecting a dancer's position (awkward, graceful, humorous, narrative) in a current situation. If the mind or spirit is missing, his legs can force him to go all night. <br /> <br /> The focus of his comeback is the rejection of defined roles. To emphasize his end of acting and his determination for a new identity, he smashes his videos and the television and bangs his head against his "John Lennon Forever" poster. He has fired his iconic anti-establishment artist - but he's the only viable leader he knows. He even introduces himself as John's son (Yoko Ono) and accepts his "Mother Mary" as advocate in his "Hour of Darkness" and "Time of Trouble". (the trembling, trembling pain in the park - hallucinatory and skitzoid passions) "Music is so much more real than acting," he says. And speaks of Lennon's influence as "to show me a new way". In the psychiatric institute, the lifesaving apples (resistance, food) reflect Lennon's presence, as does Hongzhen's need to hang his hero's poster in his renovated room. <br /> <br /> If Lennon's influence wanes, Hongshen's father's influence is the reason. Although father and son are both actors and consumers (drugs and drinks), it is Fegsen's differences with his son that signify his change. Because the father is safer in himself: he accepts that he is Chinese, a farmer in a number of peasants, a theater director in the countryside. And he exercises control over his habit and his feelings. It is this identifiable identity that makes Hongshen treat him like a soundboard, sometimes with rage and anger, sometimes with humor (blue jeans, beatles) and passivity. In his most insane and violent exchange with his father, in which he accuses him of being a liar and a counterfeiter, he exposes more of himself than of his father: "All the deeds I have done before were bullshit ... life is bullshit. "And to Hongshens stressed" you are NOT my father, "he answers softly," Why can not a peasant be your father? " <br /> <br /> Under these two teachers, and with much help from his mother, sister, friends and prison inmates, he creates a concrete connection to a real (not whole) self. With the long-term effect of the drugs also decreases its old identity. Debt replaces pride, distrust. Integrity banishes its black cloud. All its edges become softer. "You're just a human being," he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down that has arisen for refusing medication. Back at home, the lard farmer's soap is now fine with him. And his once "rare and true friendships" begin again, as evidenced by the moving fence scene with his musician friend. Hongshen says about this movie, "It's a good opportunity to think about my life." And I could add, become a new actor bound to art and life. Like Lennon, he succeeds without loss of identity.
