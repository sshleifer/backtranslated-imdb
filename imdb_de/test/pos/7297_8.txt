I saw this movie for the first time after I completed the book last week. What is the problem here? People admit that the performances are great - I mean, Lange is great! - and the movie looks good, but it has less than a '6'! I do not understand it Come on! The writing is not so bad! <br /> <br /> After reading many Pulitzer novels and seeing many of the films based on them, I think it was a good work script together. I found that the dialogue with all the novels was almost perfect. This story had quite a tremendous amount of dialogue, and the story was really shown on screen, though only part of it was used. <br /> <br /> Slightly disappointed that the Ginny attempt to destroy the rose was left out. I thought that was one of the most emotional aspects of the book, but it was probably a good choice to leave out. Eager moviegoers, more than enthusiastic readers, are less prone to forgive protagonists who pull antagonistic things. It is suitable to confuse Johnny Lunchpail and Joe Sixpack. <br /> <br /> If you loved the book, you will like the movie. If you hated the book, you'll probably hate the movie. <br /> <br /> ******** <br /> <br /> Rog
