This is a superbly designed, first-rate thriller from Washington directed by talented Wolfgang Petersen with hotshot scriptwriter Jeff Maguire (who seems to have done very little over the years and may therefore love his roses). The film shows that Clint Eastwood, an aging intelligence agent, and John Malkovich, a vindictive assassin, face each other in a massive test of will and ingenuity where the president's life is at stake. Unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost bring the president to a standstill, which is an authentic touch. This film was made when Eastwood and Malkovich reached their peak. Probably Eastwood has never done a better job than here and it's so effortless for the old pro. There are some wonderful sounds when he snorts and blows as he walks along beside the President's car as a bodyguard, which he's too old for. I wonder if anyone else noticed that the sounds were added. My "Guardian Angel," whose name is Vigil, has enjoyed this movie even more than me, but then Bodyguard movies are his thing. Rene Russo was a perfect choice for the agent who falls in love with Eastwood because she's so unremarkable but so talented and she shines. The tension in this story is tense every inch, and Eastwood's psychological struggles to free himself from a previous failure to protect are miraculously portrayed by his typical, inconspicuous spectacle. If he pulls an eyebrow up one millimeter with Eastwood, watch out! Of course, he is the master of the supercool. Malkovich has the opportunity to enjoy all the horror he can desire from the paranoid character that he portrays, and he captures the man's central vanity to perfection. What a good 'un.
