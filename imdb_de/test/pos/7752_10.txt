I tend to fall in love with anime, because the more you see, the more you realize that many shows are just bad copies of the few gems or warm-ups of old formulas. But now and then one of the true gems comes by and its originality lets you blow away. Haruhi is really one of those shows. Many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation into an animated show is performed rather poorly and does not take advantage of animations over static drawings. Haruhi is based on a series of light novels and fires on all cylinders, beautiful animations, great language games, great music and a complete and well-made story. Look at you, you will not be disappointed, and I suggest seeing it in the order of the show that it works so much better.
