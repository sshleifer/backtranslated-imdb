Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest from the famous director Chan-wook Park is the story of a good religious priest who becomes a vampire. Add a temptress that leads him astray, and a bunch of eccentrics, and you have a wonderful recipe. <br /> <br /> Partly conducted in a style similar to the "sympathy" trilogy, it is as lush as it is dark. Measuring the clich√©, it offers some new tricks in the exaggerated vampire genre. It is an existential film that seeks to capture the moral riddle of how exactly a person must choose to live with their conditions instead of enjoying the bloodlust. However, the movie does not take itself too seriously and there is boundless humor everywhere. <br /> <br /> Our leads play their roles to perfection, playing with our emotions and indulging in dark humor. There are moments of reflection on the entire moral riddles involved in the film, but it's never preaching. Some may find it over the top and it can earn points, but it's worth giving a shot to the end. <br /> <br /> If you like left-wing movies, there are fewer better ones these days. Dark and captivating, it will attract a crowd. I would recommend that you try it.
