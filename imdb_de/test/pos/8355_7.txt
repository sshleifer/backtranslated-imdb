Well, it's not a bad movie, anyway. It's good and I like the introduced characters. I also like the voices of Lady and Tramp more. <br /> <br /> But I would like to see Lady And Tramp more. I know it's called "Scamp's Adventure," and I love Scamp And Angel to pieces, but it's a sequel to the original, where I think they should be released as "Scamp's Adventure," not "Lady And The Tramp." II ": Scamp's Adventure". <br /> <br /> Tramp had a pretty big role, but he did not have much time with Lady. <br /> <br /> But still the songs are pretty good and Scamp and Angel are cute. I've seen better sequels, but hey, that's not a failure. <br /> <br /> I give 7/10. Very good, but still flaws.
