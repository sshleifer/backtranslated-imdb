Impressive. This film is the voice of a climbing generation. Director Sam Keith takes us to the darkest depths of the human soul, where we find love, life and abseiling. World-weary Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) follows his heart and his anchors on a cerebral journey to find reason in a post-apocalyptic Colorado. Instead, Telly encounters the confrontation in Don (Jason Bortz), the embodiment of machismo and a zeitgeist of the humanities. The epic film is experiencing a climax in an exciting race, in which even the most stubborn spectators in giddy heights squeamish. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all: top roping out, gym topping, cut-off shorts and sleeveless flannels, great climbing gear (some are good, see it two or three times!) , Bear and snake attacks. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie 8 out of 10 because I wanted the romance to develop a bit further. It seemed like the movie was leading to a hot sex scene between Telly and his new lover, but unfortunately he did not fit in the already packed hour and half excitement. <br /> Fans of Cliffhanger and Mission Impossible II will make this film for one Find diamonds in the rough. If you are ready to challenge your world view on humanity and climbing, this is the movie for you !!! 1
