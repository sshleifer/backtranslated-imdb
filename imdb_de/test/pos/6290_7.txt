Despite me, I like this movie. Pauley Shore is without exception funny, and here is no exception. He's just great at playing the spinner with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> His performance, though nothing out of the ordinary for him, is so good that it raises the performance of other performers. Maybe it's because he's the guy he can easily bounce off. <br /> <br /> The clich√©s about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way Shore's "city boy" is way of life is fun too, but not only is he a fish out of the water; Comedy also comes from the fact that crawling is a crazy nightmare for any "ordinary" person or person. That's why this movie works so well: We love crawl, it's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathize with the Warners. He is a true culture shock. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is a classic Pauley Shore, it does not require much brainpower to enjoy the movie, enjoy it, and even has a "never judge" book through its cover "Type of morality somewhere here. Not bad, not bad at all.
