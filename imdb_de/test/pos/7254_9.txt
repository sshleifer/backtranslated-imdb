I love this movie. The chemistry between the two main roles of Miller and Carlisle is amazing, they beat each other so well and thus create an unusual duo comedy. Alan Cumming is hilarious, his enthusiasm for the role is clear as he gathers it. The show is great and it's a really amusing and touching movie. Not the greatest movie I've ever done, I admit, but it's a lot of fun and I would recommend it to those who like other British Brit films. Contains some of the best British actors, including Michael Gambon, so you can not go wrong. Watch for Cameos by David Walliams and Matt Lucas from Little Britain and Rock: Profile Fame.
