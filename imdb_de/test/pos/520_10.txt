Linda Blair has been an actress for forty years, and while she's never been able to pull off Regan MacNeil's role in "The Exorcist," few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status as magnificently as "Witchery." She plays Jane Brooks, a pregnant single woman traveling with her family to an abandoned island hotel that their parents want to buy. They are accompanied by some estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth). When they arrive on the island, they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his girlfriend (Leslie Cumming) who are crouching illegally in the hotel while they investigate the legend of a local witch (Hildegard Knef). It seems like a witch hunt led to her suicide long ago, and she had a child at the time. Unaware of the danger, Jane recently dreamed of the witch's dramatic death, and Janes little brother Tommy (Michael Manchester) was visited more directly by her spooky, black-clad spirit, whom he calls "the woman in black." The group's time at the Inselgasthof starts quiet enough; However, unknown to them, the Lady in Black has already sent the captain of her rented boat (George Stevens). It does not take long for the isolation and the cold to affect everyone, and in this phase of moodiness and tension Lady in Black begins her reign of terror. She plans to avenge her own fate by owning Jane and sacrificing her companions and unborn child. Each of her other victims fulfills one aspect of her vengeful curse - greed, lust, and the blood of a virgin. As the sun goes down and the sea goes wild, she follows them in a cruel, gruesome way one after the other. The island location is scary and the inn is very scary and bustling. It's such a colorful movie that reminds me of Dario Argento's work. The lighting is superb and the decoration is perfectly scary. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The horror effects are extreme, frightening and unforgettable. The cinematography is great, and that brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star to be shot: lots of dramatic push-ins, lingering close-ups subtly describing Jane's incremental possessions, and moments reminiscent of other great horror movies. There are hidden tributes to Rosemary's Baby, Jacob's Ladder, The Shining, Black Sunday and of course The Exorcist. She does a great job and steals the show with her moody and unobtrusive performance. That does not mean that the rest of the cast is disappointed; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and experienced performer Annie Ross is memorable as Jane's bitchy mom Rose. Hasselhoff does his best, but he's not necessarily a movie star, and his TV personality is in the way of his performance. Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. The movie is otherwise so violent and scary (in a good way) that it desperately needs its warmth (Blair also played a mother of "Monster Makers" in 2003 and her motherly scenes in this film have the same tender feeling). After all, Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch, and she has the most amazing voice and accent. Together with Blair, she was also perfectly occupied. But it's Blair's movie. Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability, and this aspect of film highs goes back to "Exorcist II: The Heretic." I think "Witchery" is up there with "The Exorcist", "Exorcist II", "Hell Night" and "Summer of Fear" as Blair's best genre work so far.
