"Everything is illuminated" is a simplified interpretation of just over half of the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. This version is more about the changes in Eastern Europe from the Second World War to the Cold War and the younger generation's reference to this story as a family memory. <br /> <br /> Debut Director / Adapter Liev Schreiber retains some of the humorous and linguistic arguments in the novel, mainly by the wonderful Eugene Hutz as a US-mad Ukrainian tour guide. He is so conspicuous that the film becomes more of an odyssey into his country and his family as he moves from his comfortable milieu in sophisticated Odessa to a cynical, isolated country devastated by conquerors by the Communists and now the capitalists with both Jews and non-Jews as detritus. As funny as his opening scenes are, once he realizes his naughty bravado, we later feel he's out of control in his own country as he tries to ask for directions from local Yokels. <br /> <br /> Shreiber uses Elijah Wood as an American tourist as a tight tooth in a visual variety, as his character is less verbal than any of the speakers in the book. He and Hutz play each other well, to the conclusion that becomes more sentimental in this rational act. After the grandfather's story in the last quarter of the film, played in a miraculous and unpredictable manner by Boris Leskin, plays a role, the younger generation does not seem to suffer any catharsis as it only clears up the closure. Schreiber does a wonderful job of documenting the human urge to document the story. One of his consultants in the credits is Professor Yaffa Eliach and her way of remembering artifacts before Holocaust shtetl has clearly inspired the look and is very powerful and effective. <br /> <br /> The Czech Republic stands for The Ukraine and the production design team have been able to find memorable symbols of change in cities, towns and rural areas, as this is primarily a road movie and the long driving scenes give way , Schreiber retains some of the symbolism of the book, especially the moon and the river, but after he has cut out the parts of the book that explain it, they just look pretty or threatening to the atmosphere and no longer stand for time and fate. <br /> <br /> As W.C. Fields would have predicted that the dog steals most scenes for easy laughter. In general, Scribe goes for more sharpness than the book. It is irresistibly touching, especially for those who have not read the book, but less morally and emotionally messy. <br /> <br /> The film is greatly enhanced by its wonderful soundtrack, ranging from songs and instrumentals by Hutz 'Gypsy Band to traditional sounds to contemporary tracks to Paul Cantelon's Klezmer Fusion Score. <br /> <br /> This is not a Holocaust film itself, it is a kind of reflection of "The Train of Life (Train de vie)" as a reminder of a time that is now burdened with meaning, but will resonate more with those who have an emotional connection to this story.
