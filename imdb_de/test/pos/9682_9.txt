"Family Guy" is probably the most bullish sitcom ever produced. He ceaselessly spits up everything he can imagine, from TV shows to family dramas. Best of all, it's one of the few TV shows today that's actually funny. <br /> <br /> The series revolves around the Griffins: Peter, the obese father whose plans are limited by his lack of intelligence. Lois, the mother who is more or less the head of the family, although Peter considers himself to be. Chris, the fat teenage son who has as much brain as his father. Meg, the black sheep of the family, that's the joke of all. Stewie, the baby who has plans to kill his mother and take over the world. And Brian, the family dog, who is often the voice of reason, but often corrupts. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" uses many tactics to make the audience laugh. Most notable are the frequent snippets that deceive what has just been said. They are effective because of the proper timing and the way they evolve. "Family Guy" uses parodies to get humor too, mostly from 80s TV series. What really makes the show so great is that a person does not have to be familiar with what falsifies them. I'm sure it would help, but the material is funny enough. But the show does not stop there. It not only mocks almost everything, but spits on its own parodies! The show is filled with off-color humor. The only reason people are not excited about the show is probably because it makes fun of every race, every sex, and every other community. There is nothing sacred here, and nobody and nothing is immune to satirical jabs of "Family Guy's". <br /> <br /> Setting music numbers in a movie takes a lot of time and effort, and it's a huge risk. But "Family Guy" contains some great songs. All well written and performed, and of course they are hilarious (maybe the most famous, "The Freakin 'FCC", is both catchy and hysterical because it hits the rating list where it hurts). <br /> <br /> The language characterizations are right on the money. Seth McFarlane is enormously talented. He delivers the voices for Peter, Brian (which is his natural voice) and Stewie. The voices are not only coherent and creative, they can change the pitch arbitrarily, so it seems they are being talked about by three different actors. Alex Borstein brings a nasalistic lean to Lois, who is perfect for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable as Chris (if I had not looked at IMDb, I would never have known it was him). Lacey Chabert produced the character of Meg, and while she was good, Mila Kunis raised the figure with her sharp voice. Kunis gives Meg a new, sharper advantage she did not have with Chabert. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" has been compared to "The Simpsons" and that's understandable (and not just because they're produced) by FOX). Both are worker's satire and while "The Simpsons" is good, "Family Guy" is sharper. The show is absolutely fearless. There is no real holy cow. The Show Lampoons disabilities (physical and mental), ethnic groups, television programs and movies, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially Catholicism), drug use and addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including S & M) and some that are indescribable. Not everything that "Family Guy" throws at the audience affects the audience, but overall, the show is always amusing and often funny. <br /> <br /> If there is a mistake with "Family Guy", the jokes sometimes go way too long. Especially in the jokes with the "uncomfortable moment", the sequences are stretched so long that they not only become funny, but also so irritating (and long) that a fast-forward button is required. These can be effective in about 10 to 15 seconds, but the show sometimes goes beyond two minutes. It could be argued that the show rewrites its rules to the plot, which is often the case (for example, Brian often behaves like a person, but he still acts like a dog if history requires it). But that's not a problem because the show is still working. <br /> <br /> Some people have argued that the show is not funny anymore. I agree that it is not as nervous as it used to be, but I think the blame lies with FOX, not with McFarlane and his crew. The show was originally created with FOX, but was canceled after some lackluster ratings and attendance. However, DVD sales were big enough to be picked up by Adult Swim. The show became an instant hit and was again bought by FOX. However, with the show so big now, FOX is afraid to let the authors experiment and try new things. Although it is still funny, the humor is not so fresh and nervous. <br /> <br /> Look at this show in any case. It is great.
