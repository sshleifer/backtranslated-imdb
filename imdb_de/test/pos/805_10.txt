This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'The Hollow'. It could be argued that the real mystery here is not the best of Christie, but what distinguishes "The Hollow" is the characterization, and I found that the actors here were more or less perfect without exception. With such a good cast, it's hard to choose outstanding performances, but I have to say that Sarah Miles is just perfect as Lucy Angkatell. The extraordinary thing is that not only does she convey Lucy's weakness, tactlessness, and her endearing qualities, but she also manages to understand the underlying truth that Lucy is actually not so pretty! Megan Dodds is also very good as Henrietta and Claire Price as Gerda. John Christow is a pretty unlikely character, but Jonathan Cake still manages to show us what his wives see in him. <br /> <br /> As I said, the script follows the story very faithfully. The only thing that worried me was that Midge and Edward's relationship really came from nowhere, and I think part of it must have landed on the floor of the cutting room! However, it is a secondary story and the primary story is very well done. The whole thing looks nice and really starts a perfect English autumn. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie in every way, worth seeing.
