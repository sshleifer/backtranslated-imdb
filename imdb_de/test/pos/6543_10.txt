The movie has started, the wheels are spinning, your car has gone against the fox ... They are behind you, you can not lie in front, you think, "If I go out, I'll take you ..." They beat in the cars parked on the side of the road and turn Fox off, but your destination is bad ... Bang, you got into the back of a VW and you landed in a reservoir. Your car lights up. You could come out if you wanted, but the shame of losing has taken you ... BANG! Their car blows up, everyone is looking desperately, some are crying ... The sound of a siren tells you that the cops are coming. Everyone gets into his cars and bolts and gets burned. The charred remains of the wagon frame sit there and track the spectators ... they're dead. <br /> <br /> This is one of the scenes; Actually, it's the first scene in the movie. There are many more. As you enter the cockpit of the Fox in his souped-up V8 ford, Terry Serio in his crazy GTHO and many more in this blast from the past ... JOHN CLARK's masterpiece "RUNNING ON EMPTY" - He'll win at any price- "
