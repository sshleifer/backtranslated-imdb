Susie Q. is one of those rare and sweet films that will give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet but healthy, and the characters are fun and mesmerizing. At first, I thought the movie was the clich√© cuddly film that would bore me after five minutes, but I was wrong. It has sometimes torn me to pieces, and the conspiracy was tempting, which made me a root for the good guys. I loved the movie and remember it today, 9 years later !! I highly recommend ANYONE, and the film is family-oriented, so you do not have to worry about inappropriate content. If Disney showed more films comparable to Susie Q, it would be the most popular family-oriented channel in the world. If now only Disney would show only one more time! ^ _ ^ Go Susie Q. !!
