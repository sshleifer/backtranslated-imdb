This film is excellent The passion between Jade and Billy is memorable and the acting was great. That's why you do not leave a 16-year-old and a young man like this alone! It shows why a single mother should not meet a younger man with a teenage daughter in the house because he looked young enough to be Jessy's son. I give ten out of ten, the acting was wonderful and the movements between the actors were correct. <br /> <br /> The age gap between Jenny and Rob was also good because they were similar in old age. Overall, it's a fun movie, but I think no one under 13 should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes.
