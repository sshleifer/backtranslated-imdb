These critics have to find a new job !!! This film is based on a TRUE STORY that has made history. It miraculously shows how love can overcome everything in the fog of war and tragedy. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece conquered my heart and soul, as if I were there too. The Blue Eyed Cage and the adorable Cruz were amazing! Together, they perfectly portray how a Mediterranean couple can only come closer in wartime. This movie will touch your heart as it did mine, you have to see it !!!!
