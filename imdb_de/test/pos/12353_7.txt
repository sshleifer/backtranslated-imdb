If anything, William Girdler was an opportunist who wanted a piece of action in relation to what was popular at the time. I mean, a blaxploitation movie in Louisville, Kentucky. Who would have thought that?!?! I can only imagine how delighted he was to get Pam Grier, a pretty hot item, to stand in his picture. If you are quite familiar with the genre of Girdler's Sheba, baby does not necessarily go too far from the formula. Despite a change of location, the film is still an unscrupulous businessman nicknamed Shark, who engages loan companies and threatens threats to obtain his signatures. <br /> <br /> Grier is Sheba Shayne, a former Louisville police officer who works in Chicago and returns home at the request of his partner Brick (Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13). Sheba's dad, despite Shark's bullying tactics (his husband in town is a pilot, a would-be gangster, outfitted with dumbbells who are not as threatening, rather buffoonish in nature, so thin-skinned that they are thugs outside the city set to shoot her The Shayne Loan Building) does not give up his company, and this ultimately costs him his life when a brutal force warning causes him to be killed. Sheba will take revenge on all those responsible for his father's death. In other words, Hai's ass is grass ... can you dig it? <br /> <br /> It's enough to see Grier with a magnum to sell this movie. The novelty of the scenery in Louisville is part of the package. You can even see a speedboat hunt, Grier shootouts with gangsters (not necessarily the most polished kind you've seen in Blaxploitation during this time in Chicago or New York), lots of blood spurting from spherical balls, bodies shot by Gunfires were torn to pieces, and colorful characters (like a pennant-raised loan shark in pimp dress called Walker and Pilot, who is one of the scariest gangsters you'll likely see) that had the most disaster during the movie, to get in touch with a very angry Sheba. The plot itself is nothing special, but Grier is always worth a look, and Girdler arranges many action sequences to entertain his audience. A modest success for Girdler and one of his more accomplished films.
