I love this movie, especially because Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the purpose justifies the means. There's something about this movie that lets you absorb and allow you to feel all the emotions the characters feel. Jen Aniston is great as a friend in this movie. You have to look at the rock star lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers used to live (maybe they are a little smarter these days). It goes through a rainbow of emotions and has many subtle facets that let the light through. Like a diamond, this film shines. You will not waste your popcorn with this. Semi-chick movie, but my husband enjoyed it too. There are also a few laughs.
