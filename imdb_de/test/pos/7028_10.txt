I saw this movie for the first time with my fianc√©e, many years after it came out. I thought I hated it, but to my surprise, it's so cheesy that it's great. We've spent many hours re-enacting parts of the movie ("Sylvia ?! Yes Mickey?") Or "I'm sorry you must have seen this baby, sometimes we see things in this world that we do not want." , Every time I emulate Neil, my financial advisor is crazy. The music is classic and fun, especially on road trips to sing. Of course I do not admit anything to my male friends. It's like a guilty pleasure. I seriously look at Dirty Dancing once a month or more and it's just as good every time. Jennifer Gray is also cute in this movie. It's too bad she never really made a career.
