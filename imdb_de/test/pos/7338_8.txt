"The Gymnast" unfolds in short shots and short scenes, revealing his character and message over time. The free editing is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. This intimate approach is wonderful for the feeling of being on a journey of discovery, as well as the characters. <br /> <br /> The frugal approach is also a disadvantage. There are some scenes that are confusing because they do not have enough context. There are some decisions made by the characters who seemed to be upside down until I looked at the interviews that were in the bonus material. I'm glad that I did that, because the motivational description of the actors helped me to understand the film better. <br /> <br /> Apart from the story itself, it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies. The shooting was done very tastefully; very factual. You get the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story, not a voyeuristic sleaze movie. The physicality of the athletes - their reality - is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> No movie I'll have to see again soon as the storyline is simple but its delivery is strong enough to stay with me for a long time.
