It is hard to imagine "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch" by the legendary D.W. Griffith was manufactured in 1914. It's a showcase for Griffith's up-and-coming style. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a group of settlers called Cameron Brothers and their families, including a young Waif (Mae Marsh), sent from the East to their uncles and a young woman (Lillian Gish), who has just given birth. A group of Indians tries to catch the lap dogs of the Waif and is driven out by the men. During the confrontation, the son of the Indian Chief (Henry B. Wathall) is killed. The Indian chief plans his revenge and starts an attack on the small community of Elderbush Gulch. <br /> <br /> It's this attack that is pretty brutal and graphic at this or any other time and the very core of the picture. The Indians slaughter the villagers, women and children alike and drive them out of town towards Cameron's homestead. The newborn is separated from his mother and hell breaks loose. Someone goes for help and returns in no time with the Calvary. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes contain some graphic violence. For example, we see a woman being scalped alive, and there is also a sequence in which a horse is shot down. I've never seen an animal killed so convincingly on screen. Mr. Griffith became a master at staging large-scale battle scenes, a talent he would use extensively in his epic Civil War drama "The Birth of a Nation," which was released the following year. <br /> <br /> Although it takes just under 29 minutes, "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch" is an exciting and historic piece of filmmaking. See if you can see Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey in small parts.
