I think the movie was really good. Subject, Acting and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's music were wonderful. Although the director has managed to show the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer from a male-dominated culture, he has somewhat neglected Phoolan's character and focused more on the violence she faces.
