I have not seen a Van Damme strip for a while, pleasantly surprised, he still has it and looks older, but harder, somehow like Sly, gets rougher with age. This is a good movie and made me watch all the Van Damme films I've missed in the last decade. I want a good director to put Van Damme on the big screen with a good plot. Van Damme still bothers to astonish the audience, the last movie starring Van Damme was Legionnaire, that was a good movie as well. I also looked at Van Damme's early battle story, and I was also amazed that he was the true deal and was a very experienced martial artist in his younger years.
