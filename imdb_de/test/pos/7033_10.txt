It was talked about the E! Hollywood Special on the Making of Dirty Dancing, which is still regarded by many women, including a fifties girlfriend, as one of her favorite films. Maybe the music, the dancing or the melodrama about the conspiracy of Baby Frances, which becomes a dance sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this film established Jennifer Gray, whose biggest role so far was the annoying sister in Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Patrick Swayze is perfect as a heartbeat maker who literally sweeps the baby away. Dirty Dancing has everything to become a Broadway or West End hit. It has the love story, the music and above all a lot of dance. Jennifer and Patrick were able to easily revive their roles. It's nice to see Jerry Orbach play a doctor instead of a policeman and Kelly Bishop as mother. It all took place in the Catskills in the sixties, where many Jewish families spent their summer holidays in the area. At the end of the movie, it's sad to see hotel owner Kellerman startled by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer to spend cruises and travel through Europe as the summer in the Catskills. These old grand hotels are becoming Indian gambling casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing to life. After all, they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, this should be a breeze! I know that this movie is one of the favorites that you do not tire after 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this movie a thousand times already. Seeing the watching and the story behind Dirty Dancing somehow made me feel thirteen when I was a kid. Dirty Dancing may not be the best movie ever made in history, but its universal appeal continues to attract viewers and repeat audiences like the 800 Club whose members have seen it so often. I am now lovingly watching it with all the awkwardness of Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as heartbeat, Johnny Castle. Nobody could have imagined this little movie with the music of the sixties, two soundtracks and even a tour in the late eighties as a big hit. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. It would work for the audience to be part of a movie. No wonder it still attracts kids and even adults, especially women of all ages, to watch it over and over again. Australia and London both produced Dirty Dancing. Just in time for its 20th anniversary, 2007 will see Broadway.
