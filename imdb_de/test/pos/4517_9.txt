Amazing, amazing, brilliant, great. These are the four adjectives that rest in my head when I start describing "The Kite Runner". Khaled Hosseini's book adaptation had already taken many heads, in fact, it is believed that he himself had burst into tears after he had seen the premiere. I have to say that I had read the book before I saw the advanced showing of "The Kite Runner". My judgment and my views may therefore be somewhat biased. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that although the book was better in my opinion than the end product of the movie, it is by no means a bad fit adaptation. I mean, for a two-hour movie, it got the deserved response. In the last twenty minutes, things seem a bit quick, but apart from that, the book has succeeded. It has captured the thoughts and imagination of millions around the world. The magic woven by Khaled Hosseini to give us a feeling of repentance of joy, sadness, pain and fidelity is ingenious in this adaptation. Especially in the very first scene, when young Hassan says, "If you tell me to eat dirt, I'll do that, but I know you will not ask me for it." Such a touching line will conquer the hearts of many. The two young actors were brilliant, absolutely great. Especially the boy who played the innocent but loyal Hassan, a boy who refuses to give up a dragon he had captured because he had promised his best friend to bring him to him, only to be abused by big thugs who beat him up and use him sexually, and then be reprimanded by his best friend as a coward. The whole act is so touching that he can only wet his eyes. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is well placed except the last piece. The point when Amir learns of his true relationship with Hassan and does not read Hassan's first and last before him when he breaks down in tears and feels helpless, lonely and remorseful, which seemed a bit rushed and the feeling that Amir was behind a facade stands. In the book, Khaled Hosseini dedicated 10-12 pages to describe Amir's state of mind in this position. But that makes up for it in the penultimate section of the film, when Amir works for Hassan's boy, his nephew Sohrab, before his commanding father-in-law. The end was deserved and I am sure it will be appreciated. It felt like witnessing the torch passing from generation to generation. <br /> <br /> Let's get to the technical aspects. Especially the acting. Just a word - Superb. From beginning to end, young Hassan and Amir, her father, his friend Rahim Khan. Everyone was great, especially the young Hassan. Second, the direction was amazing, coupled with brilliant camera work. The background note was also impressive. Right from the beginning to the end of the loan, and I was particularly impressed by one when Amir made the Western and Islamic merger in the mosque in Pakistan, which is what makes it special. All in all, this is definitely one of the better movies, and it's a welcome break from all the Iranian-inspired films we're floating around the country this year. 9/10 !!!
