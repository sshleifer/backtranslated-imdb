Frankie Darro was a wonderful children's actor who excelled in playing contentious little heroes with huge chips on their shoulders. He appeared in some top movies of the early 1930s - "The Public Enemy" (1931), a seminal Crimean drama, and "Wild Boys of the Road" (1933), a recent depression film about children riding the rails. He was essentially a younger version of James Cagney. Although he was not that big, he kept his willingness to do his own stunts for a number of programmers, even though the bigger studios no longer had any use for him. <br /> <br /> "Crime School" was supposed to be a remake of "The Mayor of Hell", however, had far more humor and introduced The Dead End Kids and Humphrey Bogart as a very relaxed Deputy Commissioner. "The Mayor of Hell" is really a combination of "Hell's House" / "Crime School" / "Boy's Town". Although Cagney appeared only in the 25th minute, his impact was (as usual) immediately. He plays a hot gangster who is on the payroll of a political faction led by the mob. Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and his gang (including "Farina" from "Our Gang") run a car wash racket, but bite off more than they can chew when they steal a grocery store and push the owner through a glass window. They appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to a state reform. It is brightly painted - a model school where boys get the chance to learn a profession. In fact, it is a hellish place run by a sadistic guard, Mr. Thompson (excellently played by Dudley Digges). The only compassionate person is Dorothy Griffith, the living nurse (played by Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> "Patsy" Gargan (James Cagney) has been appointed as the new Deputy Commissioner. When he arrives at school, he experiences a failed attempt to escape and after a conversation with Dorothy it becomes clear that the school needs comprehensive reforms. Soon, he leads the school and introduces a system of "self-government" - more like the model of "Boy's Town". Although Cagney does not have much to do, the image of Darro is taken to its thrilling climax. After "Patsy" is temporarily out of the picture (he inadvertently shoots a gangster and has to leave the state), Thompson returns and his brutal treatment leading to the death of a boy ("skinny") makes the rest of the boys a retinue An angry mob They burn down a barn and Thompson falls to his death - "Patsy" comes back just in time to soothe the mob with sobering conversations. Of course, the boys were apparently a tough conversation about their crimes, but I disagree with one of the reviewers - Thompson was more than just a "bad guy." His sadistic treatment led to the death of a boy. At the beginning there is a scene where the guys are served some inedible food - Thompson orders ham and eggs and trudges the butter on his bread while talking to Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Allan Jenkins plays "Uncle" Mike and Sheila Terry, although she is only billed as "blonde," has one of the most memorable lines when she pouts and says, "I thought it would be here to be young boys. " , where are they? "!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
