"Beyond Rangoon" is just wonderful. You will be amazed at how good the film is from the traumatic opening to the uplifting end. Patricia Arquette amazingly portrays Laura Bowman, whom we meet as a closed and desperate young woman doctor who is unable to cope with her grief over the loss of her husband and son. During the film in which she is imprisoned in Burma, witness the democratic uprisings and massacres in the capital of Rangoon. They flee for their lives and save the life of their tour guide (U Aung Ko). She regains her will life. This can be considered complicated or cumbersome: this is not the case. John Boorman, a master in spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film with broad strokes and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state and physical distress. As usual Patricia Arquette shows a wonderfully convincing and credible performance as emotionally wounded Laura. What Arquette does amazingly in every role she plays gives us a window into the heart of her character without words. Every time it is experienced in the film up close, the audience gets an insight into their character. She does not have to speak to convey emotions or be over the top. Some critics were harsh with Arquette's performance in the film when it opened on August 25, 1995. He felt she was "flat" or "dull" in the role. I completely avoided her trait of staying away from the melodrama that is usually part of an actor's performance when a personal tragedy takes place. She is shocked and reserved about her feelings: it is just as normal as the cries of people around you. I hope Warner Brothers releases this title very soon on DVD. With Arquette's hugely successful NBC drama "Medium," which has made her a name-by-name, not to mention an Emmy win and nomination for 2007, it would be in the studio's best interest to do so. Hopefully there will be extras, with the alternative end. Do not miss this movie. You certainly will not forget it after you have seen it.
