I read the book before I saw the movie, and the movie is one of the best adaptations there is. Very true and faithful to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are incredible. Robbins is a talented filmmaker and I wish he would add more to his repertoire. He made the film very insistent and deliberately slow to lend depth. A particularly brilliant piece of film was the reflection of the victims who appeared at the very end in the glass of the execution room.
