As a longtime admirer of the 2001 film "Moulin Rouge" and as the new admirer of Jean Renoir's filmmaking, I knew that sooner or later I would inevitably have seen his "French Cancan". The film tells a fictional story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. The impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to make the Montmartre washerwoman Nini (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) a Canadian star, without arousing the wrath of his stormy mistress, the bellydance Lola (Maria Felix). This is just one of several love triangles in "French Cancan". This French showbiz people faithfully falls in love with the stereotype. Renoir realizes with his typical gentle sense of humor and support of supportive characters. and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song, which is featured prominently in the film. Gabin perfectly embodies the aging French Playboy hero. Arnoul is a cute redhead who does well in dance numbers, except for some tricks that obviously use a double. <br /> <br /> "French Cancan" is billed as a musical comedy and there are many of musical numbers that take place on the stage of the nightclub, etc., only one person, Casimir, breaks in the middle of the conversation a song. The actor who plays him, Philippe Clay, is fun to watch - a really tall, slender young man who sings, dances and distorts. <br /> <br /> The movie ends like all with a long cancan sequence The characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together. The dance is much brighter and more coherent than in "Moulin Rouge"; In fact, if I have a complaint about "French Cancan", the whole thing is something to Technicolor. Even if Nini experiences a heartache or someone sings a melancholy song, the lighting is bright and flat without shadows. Yes, the result is a happy and warm musical comedy; It's just that I can not help thinking that things were not so colorful and innocent in real life.
