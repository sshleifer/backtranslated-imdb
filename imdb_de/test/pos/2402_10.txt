The internet is a miraculous thing, right? I see a recorded episode of one of my ever-popular documentaries "Vietnam: The Ten Thousand-Day War" from my DVR in Florida (USA) to my laptop in Kuwait; I am writing a review of this series and have just read another report from someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I just want to say that for Minh Nguyen, the statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one-sided. I know that America was the main player in the West, but it takes two sides to go to war. The Soviets and the Chinese were the largest arms supplier to the north. Therefore, Mr. Nguyen shows that he does not label her as partially culpable, an ignorance (well, I think we all know why he does not mention her in a communist system and his political dogma, or because he's afraid of telling the truth) Mr Nguyen, I think the parts where the North is the biggest attacker have not been shown in your country, so the blame for America shows ignorance again, but it's still interesting to have a review reading from Vietnam (of course you could catch up with that, but I take that as real), at least the Communist East is a bit open to the miniseries, why do I love it? It's not just about American involvement It was a war that started 15 years before America's involvement, and the series covers all facets of the story, which is a real plus - the material used is top notch - for all the Vietnam War programs you j The same material is used now, so you will not miss anything if you are viewing this older series. The date of this series is another plus. All major players are interviewed, which you can not do now because they are dead by age. This is an important historical reference. Third, Richard Basehart adds a very characteristic narrative voice. His voice sounds as different as the voice of James Earl Jones, and I think that's a very high praise. I do not think you could ever find a better war documentary. It's like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 and transplanting it to 1950 and interviewing all generals and politicians on both sides of World War II. The Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> OK, I see some prejudices, their subtle, a subtle prejudices of the 70s-80s like NPR's "All Things Considered", where everything seems so straightforward, but if you blink at your end Shake your head. In this case, the later episodes do not shed much light on the role of the media and propaganda in general. All useful tools to influence the outcome of a war, DO NOT YOU DENINK ????? <br /> <br /> From an OIF war veteran who went through the same thing 30 years later.
