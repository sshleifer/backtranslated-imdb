Quite different, with a lot of understatement and black comedy, this is a movie that few see, but those who do will remember it. This film creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way. Why is? Estrangement, I think. It's probably the viewer, but I've found this movie trying to say something about the cold and emptiness behind the designer furniture and the perfect facades. I do not know if I'm right. But this movie really appealed to me. See it I really hope that the team behind this film will produce more films and that they will do so in their own, somewhat strange style. And I forgot: The casting here is great, and Trond Fausa Aurv√•g is perfect in the role of Bothersome Man. The realization that he does not understand the meaning of life (in the city) disturbs him. Everyone else does what they are told to do, pretending to be happy. This movie is a good and humorous commentary on life in 2006.
