This is fantastic! Everything from the score - to the final credits role. This movie is a masterpiece. It's really scary and its hysterical setting is enough to give everyone the goose bumps. It is obvious that the film was NOT rushed and David Schmoeller (who would later work with Fullmoon on the Puppet Master Series) had a clear and precise picture of what he was trying to control. The professional aspect of the film is amazing, considering that the budget is relatively low. It is based on fear of no impact (mainly due to budget constraints), but still creates a tense atmosphere. Stephen King explained that this is one of his favorite movies and I can not really blame him! It's one of my favorite horror movies and always will be. This is my favorite fullmoon movie and has been around since my first purchase a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Money spent well! I own both VHS and DVD versions. <br /> <br /> 10/10
