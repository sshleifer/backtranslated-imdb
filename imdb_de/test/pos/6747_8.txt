From 1950 comes a great thriller about a few diamonds from abroad and the infectious disease smallpox. Evelyn Keyes turns off all the stops as an essential victim of this film noir. Back in the United States, she does not know that she can transfer the disease to anyone and everything she comes in contact with. After all, it is tracked and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. Apart from Keyes impressive performance, there is good support from Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The finale is a Humdinger with Miss Keyes on the edge of a building with headlights and hundreds of spectators. A good B-strip!
