I saw this movie because of Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly. I worshiped them together on Picket Fences, so it was a pleasure to see them together again. This was not the best movie ever made, but it was cute. Very predictable, but sometimes thoughtless funny movies are exactly what I need. <br /> <br /> The desserts were beautiful and I wanted to eat them all. I loved it when it fell apart. I bet it still tasted good. <br /> <br /> Costas and Lauren still had the great chemistry they had on Picket Fences, and I dropped into the movie as they kissed. <br /> <br /> I would not look at it again, but it was a great filler for one night.
