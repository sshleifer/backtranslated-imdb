There is a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. For these three films, which did not have box office names, Ford did not have to adapt the movie to the personality of a star, be it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. No wonder Ford saw all of this as favorites of one kind or another. <br /> <br /> Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, jr. Sign a few sympathetic cowpokes to lead a Mormon wagon train into a valley in Arizona. Along the way, they are first accompanied by a group of stranded players in a medical show and then by a family of outlaws on the run called Clegg. Their stories merge, and what happens is the basis of the story's plot. If Wagonmaster had been made ten years earlier due to the two appearances by Johnson and Carey, both would likely have had considerable successes as B-picture cowboys. In the case of Johnson, it would have been life-like. Johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a series of horses that John Ford used at Fort Apache. Ford was impressed by his presence and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> But the day of the B Western came to an end and Johnson and Carey had great careers as two good character actors. Ward Bond plays Elder Wigg's Mormon leader. However, Bond has recently converted and is having difficulty remembering not to use some four-letter words. But he is the leader because of his strength of character, not because of his impeccable LDS theology. He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader. In the presentation of the Cleggs Ford had only four years back to his My Darling Clementine. They are the reincarnation of the Clanton gang and pure evil. If Walter Brennan, who refused to work for Ford again after My Darling Clementine, was willing to see him as Shiloh Clegg, the head of the family. Since Charles Kemper has done a good job, this is probably the role for which he is most known. Shortly after this movie was finished, Kemper was killed in a car accident. He could very well have worked for Ford in the future. Ford makes the Mormon pacifists here, and I do not remember that pacifism was part of the LDS doctrine. Nevertheless, it works here, with the whole idea that these people who do not carry weapons are innocent when dealing with evil people like the Cleggs. To dispose of them correctly, it takes some weapon that flings cowboys. I think this film after World War II tries to say that pacifism is not always the best policy. <br /> <br /> Another kidnapping of My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray, who plays the same role as head of the medical show troupe there. Part of this troupe is Joanne Dru, who makes another turn as a woman of elastic virtue, just like in Red River. Dru used to do so many westerns that she yearned to get out of the gingham and some modern fashions. Wagonmaster is a great conversation and I'm ready to bet in the state of Utah, it's a pretty popular movie.
