"Crossfire" is supposedly a murder mystery, but what sets it apart from other similar films of that time is the murderer's motive, which is anti-Semitism. The story shows examples of the kind of ignorance fueling bigotry, with references to a "hillbilly" and an Irish immigrant who has also been abused because of his ethnicity. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is based on Richard Brook's novel "The Brick Foxhole", which is about a hate crime in which the victim was gay. It is ironic that this story about a form of intolerance from the censors, who should change the screen version of the kind of bigotry in anti-Semitism, should encounter intolerance. Another irony is the behavior of a soldier who is very proud to have served in the war against the Nazis, yet embracing his hatred of Jews. The director and producer of this film suffered a different kind of intolerance when he was blacklisted after being called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. All these points seem to underline the deep-seated and stubborn nature of the whole problem of bigotry, as shown in this film. <br /> <br /> When police captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), he discovers that Samuels was sociable with a group of soldiers and one of them the night he was killed Corporal Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper) is quickly identified as the prime suspect. Other information also comes from Montgomery (Robert Ryan), another soldier who was present that night, and Sergeant Keeley (Mitchell's friend), a Mitchell friend. Keeley then goes to Mitchell with the help of some other soldiers and when he finds him, he hears his account of what he did on the night of the murder, including his meeting with a dance hall host named Ginny Tremaine (Gloria Grahame). <Keeley helps Michell escaping arrest and tries to identify the killer. Ginny Tremaine is being questioned, but her information is insufficient to prove Mitchell's innocence, but Finlay's investigation leads him to recognize the motive for the crime. He then sets up a thoughtful trap that causes the culprit to expose his own fault. "Crossfire" is a movie with a message and the identity of the killer is revealed at a very early stage in the story. The "message" is conveyed in a manner that was undoubtedly appropriate for the period in which it was made, but rather cumbersome by today's standards. The cinematography by J Roy Hunt is just wonderful. The subtle lighting and the creative use of numerous strategically placed table lamps create a look that perfectly matches the drama that is played on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, as a low-budget production, "Crossfire" was a big box-office hit and benefited from a gripping and highly relevant story with a wonderful cast, two of which won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan) and nominated as supporting actor (Gloria Grahame). The additional nominations for Edward Dmytryk (Best Director), Producer Adrian Scott (Best Picture) and John Paxton (Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay) are just another testament to the positive recognition this film rightly received.
