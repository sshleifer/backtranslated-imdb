If you love Drive-In-Cheeze from the early 70's, you'll just love it. How could you do anything wrong with a low-budget movie about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum? You can not! Crazy people and sharp objects are always a fun combination. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like it was shot in a house for about $ 320.65. For me, this just promotes the fun of seeing that kind of stuff. The Gore is a bit mild compared to others of this kind, but there are enough to keep us bloodthirsty sick (like me) happy. Let yourself wait until something happens. That is not the case here. The characters are so entertaining that every frame is very comfortable. There is never a boring moment from beginning to end. I liked it so much that I saw it a second time after the credits. It's a must for any self-confident drive-in horror nut. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 Freak-o-meter ... required viewing <br /> <br /> Yes, I love you ... I love you ... now take your Thorazine and put your clothes back on ... please .... 8)
