One of MGM's constant classics came out in the last years of World War II. The film has made the young Elizabeth Taylor a star. She had made a few films before National Velvet as a child actress, but when she came out, her place in the movies was secured. Ironically, she had grown up fast enough after National Velvet retired and her next fight as an actress was to get significant roles for adults, as the casting directors saw her as just an innocent little Velvet Brown who loved her bouncing horse /> I am not sure how this would work because obstacle horses must have confirmed bloodlines and the Pi are an issue not covered in National Velvet. All we know is that he is a reckless and untraditional horse in the hands of Reginald Owen. After tearing himself down and causing considerable damage, Owen loses him for a nominal price to local butcher Donald Crisp. <br /> <br /> While these things are happening, Mickey Rooney wanders into the life of the Brown family, which consists of Crisp, Mrs Anne Revere and her daughters Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley and Elizabeth Taylor and her little brother Butch Jenkins. Rooney is a former jockey who is now out in the open, heading for the Brown family, where his father used to be a horse trainer for Anne Reveres family. He's the one who sees the potential of the Pi (short for pirate) as an obstacle hunter, and it's Elizabeth who convinces Crisp not to miss this opportunity. Elizabeth Taylor was so cute and innocent in National Velvet. The Good Book says you must have faith like a child and she has to spare it. It gives Rooney confidence in the Pi's heart and ability to leave it for herself. Anne Revere won the award for Best Supporting Actress for National Velvet. She is a very wise mother who hides depths that the audience does not suspect. It turned out that she already had a touch of glory and honor in her youth, when she swam the English Channel and her prize money, and has saved all these years, she gives to her daughter. This scene probably won the Oscar. National Velvet also won another Oscar for film editing. <br /> <br /> More than 60 years after its premiere, National Velvet has lost nothing as a family classic. The portrayal of life between the world wars in Britain is still remarkable. And National Velvet has created a movie legend. Can not do much better than that for high esteem.
