Why could not the end of the film have been the men of Sean Connery fighting against the French instead of the Germans? Since the French occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes of Morocco and Algeria have invaded French military and civilian settlements. This film could have been a continuation of this historic aspect of the French capturing the Rasuadli so its followers would not invade Algeria, and then its supporters attacked the French to free it. The film is still stereotypical of the shootings between the Germans and the Americans. When the Americans shoot at the Germans, their rifles (even the guns) make loud noises, cause big bloody gunshot wounds and their enemies scream after being shot. When Germans shoot at the Americans, their rifles do not make big noises, no bloody wounds, and their enemies make little or no sound after the shot. <br /> <br /> In real life the American Krag rifle was the worst rifle America had ever produced until the early version of the M-16 came out. The collar was hard to maintain, not reliable and the rifle pin was always stuck. The German Mauser was one of the most beautiful rifles in the world. We were so impressed that we made a copy of it in the Spanish-American War and call it the Springfield rifle. <br /> <br /> Finally, the people of Morocco have had a word for artillery since the use of the French in their raids against Morocco. I did not like it when the Rasuldai felt stupid that there was no word for artillery in the Moorish vocabulary. Instead, the Rasuadli explained that the Europeans had weapons on wheels that made the ground wobble.
