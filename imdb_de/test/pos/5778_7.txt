Someone who enjoys driving at 120 km / h on the highway, eating McDonalds and running the air conditioning 24 hours a day, watching Fox News without interruption, found this documentary interesting. One thing I've heard when talking about North America, I suppose, was that documentation was Fabrique Au Canadie. For the Canadian beatings, I'll leave that to Bill O'Reilly. <br /> <br /> The result of the oil shortage will hit anyone, especially those living in large countries of Australia, Canada and the United States. I'm sure Green Peace will stop fueling gas, not SUVs, without realizing that people living in sub-zero temperatures may starve to death. <br /> <br /> As someone who has studied economics, I actually know that we live in a world of finite resources. I will provide the documentary props for trying to present a balanced view of oil consumption. Nevertheless, I study journalism. This documentation is full of messages - Republicans as warmongers. What the Democrats have not sent troops to Vietnam? <br /> <br /> When you present a documentary about economics and resources, you should keep the political blows on one side, as this can lead to a potential audience being completely shut down. Focus on the problem of limited resources. At the end of the day, it is best to open the mind of the mainstream, as it is not good to preach to the tiny choir. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy watching documentaries like Fahrenheit 911 and End of Suburbia, not because of their political prejudices, because they remind us that the world is not so sure. Sure, I like to go shopping, and there's no tomorrow for consumer junk food, but if the world ends tomorrow, I'd rather die rich and consume the living beep of it. <br /> <br /> Share facts with potential documentaries around the world and let viewers decide for themselves. If you try to wrap your political views as a balanced documentary, people will smell a rat a mile away.
