If people were really that stupid, I could be the SRW Supreme ruler of the world. Here Knotts plays a small bean counter for a small water town led by a group of crazy Simpletons who are only a little brighter than him. If things are a bit shaky for the crooks, take a picture of the Patsy Figg. Much laugh as Knotts does his usual bumblebeing, stumbling act. I especially appreciate the extension cable scene; asininity at the highest level.
