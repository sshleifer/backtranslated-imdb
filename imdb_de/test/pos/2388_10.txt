I watched the movie a second time on September 30, 2006 and thought it was even better than the first time. I really enjoyed the acting, especially "Uncle Benny". I thought Fred Carpenter wrote and directed this movie excellently. The story definitely caught your interest and I hope this movie makes it to the very top. I had the feeling that it moved very quietly between the scenes and the surprising turn at the end. Well, let's say I did not see it coming. I also thought that Craig, the actor who played "Eddie Monroe", did a great job, and I hope this movie will help him move forward in his acting career. I really enjoyed it from start to finish.
