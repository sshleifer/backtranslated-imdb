BONJOUR, MONSIEUR SHLOMI is just a wonderful movie! Writer and director Shemi Zarhin has written a story that is different from all others, and has cast them with such consistently good actors that it remains a mystery to me that this film has not become a crowd pleaser all over the world. It is intelligent, emotional, uplifting and warmhearted, entertaining and a winner in all categories. Slomi (Oshri Cohen, a brilliant, inconspicuous performer) is a 16-year-old boy who cares about his highly dysfunctional family: his mother (Esti Zakheim) is about as disgusting as ever, and she is constantly ill because of her husband cheated on her and because she's bogged down to back her sickly father-in-law (Ariek) in two shifts Elias, who as Shlomi's grandfather is a smart, witty, wise, loving old man who cares deeply for Shlomi); a married sister, Ziva (Red Abuhab), who regularly returns to the house with her husband, who does not help her look after her twin sons; his brother Sasi (Assi Cohen), whose life is according to electric guitars, braggadocio about female conquests and his mother's favorite son. Stir this mixture and the result is the penultimate dysfunctional family unit. Shlomi cooks gourmet dishes for her, shops, cleans the house, runs errands, bathes and cares for this grandfather, and generally leads the life of subjugating a family who sees him as a "retard". Longing is a friend who has virtually no desire to school because of lack of time for the care of his family and lack of concentration. By chance, his mathematics teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) notices his natural mathematical genius in a dropped test, and with the help of the headmaster (Yigal Nair), the two encourage him to be tested and discover that he is a genius (with dyslexia?). and arranging for a special school in Haifa. Shlomi's mother will not hear about it, but between the struggles with Shlomi's absent father (Albert Iluz) and the confrontations with the teacher and the headmaster, they finally agree that he will be tested for school. Meanwhile, Shlomi discovers a girl of her age Rona (Aya Koren), who has moved to the next door and gradually merge into a physical and intellectual relationship. Always in the background is the support of Shlomi's grandfather, and when the grandfather dies, Shlomi embarks on a journey to live his life for himself, to realize his gifts and to find his happiness. The way the family deals with it is the culmination of the film and does not have to be revealed to lose the power of the message. The film is beautifully photographed, the music score is creative and the end result is an enhancement of the human mind. Highly recommended on every level. In Hebrew with English subtitles.
