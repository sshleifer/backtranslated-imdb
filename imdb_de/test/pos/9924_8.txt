Dario Argento is a filmmaker, whom I follow slowly after I have engaged Deep Red and Suspiria in their iconoclastic efforts. He is not a filmmaker and always looks after silly things like "Plot". This may be his lesser (but obvious) liability: he does not allow common sense to thwart his plan for his elaborate killing episodes, since his murderers can go through any kind of murder invisibility until the psychopathic killer's POV shots beyond of the POV. However, it's exciting to see a filmmaker taking such a risk anyway by penetrating a purely Italian aesthetic into the soul of a Hitchcock warp (actually, as a hint, if you've recently seen the Scorsese short film he took with him) has three pages of an unplayed Hitchcock movie, which also played in an opera, Argento let him beat for almost twenty years, probably without knowledge of the text). It's also uncorrupted 80's (CD player and heavy metal and hair, oh my!) And with an absurdity that makes swallowing all the more palatable. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: An opera by Macbeth is being produced, featuring highly stylized pyrotechnics and trained ravens. There is even a talented rising star that was replaced at the last minute, Betty, played by Marsillach. But a murder happens during the premiere - not interrupted by it, but by a falling light - and now the killer is after Betty! She can not go to the police (how can she let out the fact that the opera is really cursed?), But will that matter in the face of a killer who does not give up? You've probably seen rooms like this in other Argento movies - a girl being chased by a killer - but like Argento, like De Palma, constructing and executing his sequences, he adds his own character and adds bizarre humor to it (The ravens' outbreak to attack the killer, and the subsequent version of the clues in the lineup), a kind of over-styling ala Leone (the bullet through the door spy through the door has probably led to a similar take in Kill Bill 1) and even sado-masochistic inspiration with the pens glued into Bettys eyes more than once! <br /> <br /> Argento lets his actress go through the Wringer, and she's all in favor, even though things seem to go in "what the hell" region (I almost threw my hands over that I give as she is led down the secret passage of the little girl as if we were suddenly in aliens) And through such dark genre material Argento keeps the violence fresh and fresh, the tension between opera music and speakers of a stereo system and a cameraman who may have had a few drinks has (and rightly so!). ) during some scenes as they were turned and vibrate to the heartbeat. It should be considered garbage, but it has overcome all the limitations of the genre through the director's spherical attitude, despite a stupid ending - a little darker than anything that preceded it (thanks to the little lizard) - and a try to break it The Macbeth Curse, which apparently did not seem to happen in real life on the set of Opera. 8.5 / 10
