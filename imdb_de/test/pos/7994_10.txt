I always thought that Batman Returns is a great sequel to Batman. The story was interesting and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton did a great job. And let's face it, Tim Burton was a genius and brought more justice to the cartoon character than Joel Screwmacher ever did. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Oswald Cobblepot is also known as The Penguin (played by Danny Devito) as a child due to deformity. He uses this as an excuse to mask a sinister plan to kidnap the firstborn children of Gotham with the help of his thugs (Red Triangle Gang) and a very dodgy tycoon Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later turns Penguin into mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by Max Shreck and revived by cats. Later she develops feline traits and tries to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. Their reasons for destroying the Dark Knight are not explained. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. In terms of the atmosphere it looks darker. Tim Burton has always had a talent for making dark backgrounds appealing. Micheal Keaton is still as keen as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin. If you think about it, he would have made a better violator for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Hall Berry could ever have. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason why I like Batman Returns is the fun. It's not only creative, it's fun too. Something that many big budget films are painfully missing these days. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided to stop doing anything. You do not believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thankfully, Christopher Nolan revived the series with Batman Begins.
