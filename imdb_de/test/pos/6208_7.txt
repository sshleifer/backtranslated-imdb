A forerunner of "Citizen Kane" in his analysis of the life of a recently deceased tycoon, who is checked here by his loyal secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks. In Spencer Tracy, his 15th film, he already looks in middle age in the scenes where he is supposed to be young! well written drama.
