I regard this loving and sensitively written story as one of the true masterpieces of the canvas. After watching this movie with my mother on screen when he first came out, in Los Angeles, California, many years passed before I had a chance to relive it. The beauty, the quiet, simple elegance and the calmness of the film bothered me for many others of its kind. Yes, tears still come into my eyes when I see them and hear the chorus of this unique song. perhaps still the most beloved film of all time. I hope this classic love story is appreciated and appreciated by our future generations.
