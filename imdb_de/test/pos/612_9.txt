Sadness and nostalgia permeate Late Chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by Japanese author Mikio Naruse, which, thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation, undergoes a retrospective of his long, unavailable films. Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi, Late Chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired middle-aged geishas whose lives have become full of disappointment and remorse. The performance is consistently outstanding, especially that of Haruko Sugimura, who has starred in films such as Ozu's Late Spring, Floating Weeds and Tokyo Story. Sugimura portrays Kin, a former geisha who has no children and lives only with her young girl who can not speak. <br /> <br /> She has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money, especially real estate speculation and loans to her friends Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki), all former geishas. Kins friends live in meager conditions and complain that Kin has become greedy and Tomi spends a lot of time gambling to try to make ends meet. Both Tomi and Tamae are losing their children. Tamae's son is moving out to work in the coal mines in Hokkaido, and Tomi's daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an elderly man. Both resist the changed circumstances, but accept this as inevitable. Two male friends visit Kin, Seki, a former lover with whom she once had thought about double suicide, and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover whom she looks forward to seeing again after many years. Her mood is optimistic, but she soon turns into rancor when she finds out that the two men are only interested in borrowing. Naruse seamlessly switches between two extended sequences, while Kin confronts Tabe, Tomi, and Tamae only to be victims of the loss of their children. Late chrysanthemums have the simplicity, humor and stoic acceptance of life in Ozu's films and are a bittersweet reminder of the slow pace of time and the comfort that memory and society bring.
