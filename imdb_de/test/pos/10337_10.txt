When I was in seventh grade (1977), I was asked to read the novel on which he is based as part of my English lessons. I can remember how touched and excited he was when a TV version came out a year later. Kristy McNichol was a popular television actress when this film was produced and already played a daughter in a dysfunctional family in the hit TV series Family. It was clear she had the reach and the ability to reach that part. I remember that she was sometimes a bit "stiff", but she does everything well. She wears the movie well. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle is fantastic because she seems to be the only one in the household who really seems interested in her. Barbara Barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good, as well as the young Robin Lively (who would eventually appear as Black Widow Lana Milford in "Twin Peaks") as the sweet younger sister who is at the center of the parent's affection. Bruce Davidson is also appropriately appealing as a German soldier of the title. <br /> <br /> However, the best performance is Michael Constantine. It is really powerful and deserves more recognition than it did then. The bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he seems hard to see, but makes it much easier to understand the quiet despair of the rejected daughter. Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to understand the underlying psychological motivations well. <br /> <br /> The film is only slightly different from the book. It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope it will be released again on video or DVD. <br /> <br />
