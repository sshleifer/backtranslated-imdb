Where the Rivers Flow North is a well-narrated story about the struggle of two people for their own lives in the face of "progress" and development. Not only did I enjoy the movie as entertainment, but I also learned about life in rural New England in the late 1920s. Cinematography has captured the rugged beauty of Northern Vermont and set the stage during the music has brought the film to life. Very well made for a locally produced low budget movie. I found the character of Michael J. Fox the weakest in the film, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are in two of the best performances I've seen in a long time. I was sad that she is not nodding as Best Actress this year (I assume the movie was too "small" to be considered).
