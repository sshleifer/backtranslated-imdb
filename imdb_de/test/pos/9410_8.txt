Having seen this, without knowing all the ties surrounding the main character without knowing that it was based on real events, I have to say I'm impressed. "Murder in Greenwich" is an above-average production for a TV movie - acting is always great, especially Christopher Meloni is an outstanding achievement and the youthful actors are characterized by difficult roles. The idea of ​​the dead girl telling the movie is a stroke of genius that raises the movie from good to excellent. The script is an example of what is essentially a movie of the week, and the cinematography is beautiful.
