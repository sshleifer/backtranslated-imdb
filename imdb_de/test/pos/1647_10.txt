Shtrafbat's punitive battalion is a moving and usually honest look at the lives and deaths of Soviet soldiers who were convicted of washing away their crimes during the Second World War. It can almost be called the Russian equivalent of the highly acclaimed miniseries "Band of Brothers". <br /> <br /> The penal battalions, formed in July 1942 on the eve of the Battle of Stalingrad, were thought to be wasteful units and suffered terrible losses (sometimes up to 90%). Prisoners from GULAG (political prisons / concentration camps), deserters, soldiers captured by Germans but able to escape, soldiers accused of violating the protocol had the opportunity to join the Shtrafbat and prove that there were no "traitors to the Those who suffered injuries and died in the battle were considered rehabilitated and reinstated in the eyes of the law. <br /> <br /> This miniseries shows such a Shtrafbat under the law The Tverdokhlebov Command - a Honorable Officer Who was captured by the Germans was shot and left dead, showing a colorful and diverse group of people forced into a situation of no escape - the authoritative but honorable one Criminal chief Antip "Kulak" (The Faust) and his small group of incorrigible criminals, a young Jewish Intellectual who has beaten his anti-Semitic officer, Father (Orthodox Priest) Mikhail, who after battling his parish bumps into the battalion encountering house-to-house struggles, political prisoners who hate the regime that condemns them to the GULAG But if you are ready to fight for your people and your country for the last time, you must all find your courage and reasons to live and fight. <br /> <br /> Although filmed during a war, not every episode is endowed with combat. In fact, the fighting scenes are often chaotic, sporadic and short - which was probably the intention of the director. In between, the miniseries focus on various relationships between the performers, their backgrounds, their thoughts and tragedies. The rape of a young woman by a soldier of Shtrafbat and then his execution, execution for alleged AWOL, boredom on the march, the celebration (and the subsequent consequences) of the search for a German bunker, which is stocked with food (and champagne), morality The dilemma of officers who are unable to save their husbands from their own superiors when they cheat on a spouse and other situations plays an important role. The camera is unflinching - it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature, nor from raw human emotions. The dialogue also does not censor the cursing. <br /> <br /> The drama is great and deep, and the script is also well written. Everything, from anger to tiredness to resignation and the search for a piece of joy to hold on to is almost flawless. One complaint could be that some of the linguistic and cultural characteristics of Russia may not always be understood by someone who is unfamiliar with language and culture. Since it is, in a sense, a historical drama, some terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, certain historical references) may be lost to some viewers. This understanding is not required to enjoy Shtrafbat to the fullest, but these references are a nice touch of authenticity. Another complaint that could be raised is an occasional anachronism and a twist of history to match the conspiracy, but frankly, this is such a fascinating miniseries that you'll likely forgive those slight glitches.
