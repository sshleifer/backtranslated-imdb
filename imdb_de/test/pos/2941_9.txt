Yes, I am ashamed to admit it, but this show is very DEVINE !!! It's so entertaining and I have the absolute best time to see it. Since Cycle 1 it has been great and I have not noticed a downfall in fame AT ALL.Tyra Banks, as you know, is the host, and as fabulous as she is, there are also other judges and co-hosts like J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker and Twiggy. The main point of the show for every girl invited to become America's Next Top Model has to work their way up to the top by completing and winning photo shooting contests. That sounds great, is not it, and I can tell you it's great !!!! It's amazing to see all the different types of photo shoots the girls pick up, and each one is different, cool and daring. Anyone who hates this show has no idea and I will tell you that this show is going to run for a long time, so DEAL WITH THEM !!!
