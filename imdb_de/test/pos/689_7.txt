<br /> <br /> *************************** MILD SPOILERS AHEAD ************ * ************** <br /> <br /> We Dive at Dawn is an English movie starring John Mills. The second time I saw the DVD version was on a big screen TV, and I have to say the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on screen. Maybe it was the big screen that helped. <br /> <br /> I still say that the first segments of the movie are mixed up, but as soon as the submarine leaves the dock and its mission begins, the movie starts too! The search for the German battleship "Brandenburg" and the accompanying adventures were fascinating and the details shown in the film are interesting! <br /> <br /> I raise my score to 7/10. If you like World War II films, you may be interested in a submarine. Some of the men in the submarine also have a sense of humor!
