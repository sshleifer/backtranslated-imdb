What a movie! I've always liked the Asian style of shooting, and this movie does not disappoint! The photography is breathtaking, ranging from amazing landscapes to color swirls. The leading actor is really realistic in the portrayal of the painter (whose pictures are amazing). The ending is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only comment is that they may have had to show the relationship between his inspiration and his alcohol abuse and women a little deeper. But overall this is a great movie!
