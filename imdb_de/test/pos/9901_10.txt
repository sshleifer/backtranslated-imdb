"Checking Out" is an extraordinary movie that surpasses most movie productions. His refreshing, funny humor is never an excuse to stay superficial. On the contrary, the film explores many facets of the human mind and relationships. His warm approach encourages tolerance and acceptance of diversity and the recognition of what unites all people. The characters are charming and amusing and reflect those idiosyncrasies we can laugh about within ourselves. Fast dialogue and funny banter keep you on your toes You will probably want to see it in the cinema and then (several times) on video, and each time you will discover something new. After every inspection, you will feel warm and sublime.
