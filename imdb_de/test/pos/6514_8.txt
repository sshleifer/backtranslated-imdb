I love this movie, one of my favorites of all time. Ann Blythe as Sally O'Moyne is sweet and trouble free. She believes that praying to Saint Anne will solve all her problems. Signing the wicked bad man to get her father's possessions is funny and clever. Her brothers are the kind of brothers a girl would like. Also look for "Auntie Bee" as a mother, a strong Irish woman who will not leave her house where she raised her family. They do not do it like that anymore, that's for sure.
