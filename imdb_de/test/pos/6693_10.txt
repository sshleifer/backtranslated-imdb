Life consists of infinite possibilities; some are known, others a mystery and it is certain that it stays that way. And what about the vast unknown, the areas over which knowledge has no limits or parameters? Who should say what exists or what is possible? Valid questions that are all raised and examined in the story of a particular person's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic, in "K-PAX" by Iain Softley with Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Following an incident in New York's Central Station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is taken to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he is placed in the care of Drs. Mark Powell (Bridges), who tries to expose the truth about his patient claiming to be from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. med. Powell, as Prot is quite convincing with his calm, direct, emerging nature and passion for products (he eats banana peel and everything, and Red Delicious Apples are his favorites). But it is Powell's job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. However, Prot's claims remain untouched and stand under even the most intense scrutiny and watchful eye of Dr. Powell, who is in a quandary - Prot even tells him the exact date and time he'll be leaving for K -PAX, a scheduled return trip that allows Powell, but only for a short time, to clarify everything. And Powell just does not seem to focus on the idea that it's a real alien. and it's something he'll have to solve quickly if he ever gets the truth. And he has to know. After all, the truth is the only thing that will make him free in his own mind. Softley has created a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by maintaining the mystery Prot surrounds and forces you to think about what your own ideas of what is actually possible. And since you never know for sure until the protein dissolves, you'll be able to identify with Powell, see the situation from his point of view, and try to solve the puzzle with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonderment and the feeling of being confronted with something that truly is unique as the story unfolds, and you begin to realize that Prot may be exactly what he says. And in the context of the reality the film is involved in, it's a captivating thing to try and think about. How do you react when all the evidence contradicts the physical limitations we have set for ourselves? While the core of the film is a profound depth of humanity, this is evident not only in Prot, but also in Dr. Powell. All this makes for a very compelling and gripping drama. As we expect, Kevin Spacey performs brilliantly as a prot, presenting his character from the inside out, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. This is a unique person and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly enlightening, adding to the credibility of the character and the credibility of the story itself. For this movie to work, it is important that we believe who and what Prot is. we do and it does. Spacey just makes it great. It is a memorable idea that evolves into a character that will stay with you for a long time. Jeff Bridges appears on the same level as Spacey and makes out of Dr Powell. It's a fairly uncomplicated role, and the challenge for Bridges was to take on this very ordinary and ordinary character and make him unique, which was not an easy task compared to Prot's character. And for this movie to work, Bridges had to face up to this opportunity. And with extraordinary skill and the accomplished professional who he is, he is without question successful. Bridges gives Powell a basic level of complexity and performance enough to make the interaction between Powell and Prot alive and sometimes intense. It's a demonstration of two of the best actors in the industry doing what they do best and creating a vibrant and inspiring dynamic. It's a great piece of work by Bridges, who never tries to steal a spotlight from Prot, raising the level of the movie to an even higher level. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel). Alfre Woodard (Dr Villers), Ajay Naidu, Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). "K-PAX" is an entertaining, emotionally charged film, a dissertation on possibilities and an exploration of the ever-evolving complexities of the human condition. It is a film that requires open-mindedness and rewards those who are able to approach and accept their own conditions. At the end you will realize how real K-PAX is. and it lets you appreciate Prot's journey and how much we all share with the people around us, whether humans or extraterrestrials. And it can only make you think about your own journey - where you have been and where you are going. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this as 10/10. <br /> <br />
