It is surprising that such production is nowadays produced especially for television. Considering the strong sexual issues and explicit scenes of lovemaking, not to mention lesbianism, this is an excellent treatment and guide. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes are immaculate, the direction is stylish and the characters are personable. There is a lot of humor, but surprisingly dark deposits. The protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not without luck. This production also avoids the mistake that most movies / shows make in dealing with homosexuality / lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems that most shows fill it with stereotypes and make the characters obsessed with being gay. Not so with this. In Tipping the Velvet, the protagonist is hardly aware of what lesbians mean! The BBC has produced some wonderful productions in the past, and this adventurous piece of time only confirms its standard of excellence on all fronts.
