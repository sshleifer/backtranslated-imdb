I saw Franklin's forgiveness during a Paramount show and was thrilled. I have to be honest. I really did not want to go and I was quite stunned by the movies being shot today, I laughed my ass off. It was a great story that I could not believe that two guys had shot this and put it together. I thought if these guys on this budget can make a movie like this, imagine what they could do with big money. And then I thought I was the jaded guy I probably would have in the studios ... it would be down anyway. Thanks guys, I got lost in your movie and that's why I go to the movies to forget the world for a few hours.
