I learned a lot from the reactions of the previous audience. Is there one that does not mention "propaganda"? To glitter "perception is concept-dependent". I love Fred Astaire musicals, the great great songs, and Fred's unparalleled grace. But comrades, if you see idle, mindless, rich parasites dancing on the oppressed and unemployed, this is a valid criticism of "capitalist propaganda." Every film is steeped in the values ​​of its time and place, not to mention those who finance it? the pipers who call the tune. Great art transcends everyone, as does "Nevsky" as well as "All Quiet on the Western Front". I admit. I saw it about 40 years ago. But the pictures are burned in my brain. It's the biggest fight scene ever made. And it horrifies you to be enthusiastic. Did someone say "plastic ice"? This is real death that you observe. Real extras have died here. "Real looking" is now seemingly defined as a special effect. Also "too long" - for an age of shrinking attention spans? Mozart had "too many notes"? Propaganda, Catholic Church defamed? The Vatican was still there when they demanded old favor to get the German Christian Democratic government. Recognize Croatia in the 1990s? Do you remember the chaos and the genocides? Forget the props, Nevsky lighting painted the medieval world? like a Breughel. Hampton Court Palace has one that shows a massacre. Raw Dutch nationalist propaganda, perhaps, but it tears the heart. Stylized Spectacle So, what is Henry V (Olivier Film)? Naturalism? Does anyone believe that English medieval knights killers have spoken like this? As I said, the music of Prokofiev is great. Only Ken Russell & Eisenstein had the balls and the genius to bring sound and image together at this 100-octane level. OK, you want the bridle & bit. I will risk the nervous Thorobrat every time. Eisenstein did not reproduce any Wehrmacht helmets; rather, this model seems to deal with the buckets worn by the Germans in Nazi festivals in the 1930s. Eisenstein was a genius, but unlike Hollywood directors, he had almost unlimited (non-commercial) time and money. Modern Russian directors are free from political shackles but have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make a late (great) movie in communist Russia. He was worshiped, but not covered in his own country (much like Russell). How much propaganda is in the eye of the beholder? Imagine healthy people from another, peace-loving world. How would you react to Nevsky? Would the struggle or mourning for the dead dominate their findings? If we did not know about the gas chambers and the SS, what about 'Triumph of the Will'? Where can I buy a Nevsky DVD cheap?
