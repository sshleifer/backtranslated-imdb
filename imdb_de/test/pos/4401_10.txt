I came out of a Coen movie before and did not really know how to feel. The two best examples are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so funny that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bullets that just did not fit the shape of the movie. Nevertheless, I liked the movie and now I have a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes I was not sure why I laughed so hard that it made me cry, but still it was me. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but after further investigation it was really only real people talking about real situations. So the man with the shovel (or broom) was so funny that he told the police officer how a funny man was sitting in the bar in the bar the other day. That's why the theater broke out when he said some strange-looking clouds were coming in. (I also own a copy of this movie) and maybe a bit off the wall. However, if you look closely at some of those characters who seem crazy, you will always find in a strange way that they all sound true. That's what's special about O Brother, where are you? This is a movie that's out there. I mean, it's not even in the same game as a traditional movie. I reviewed the movie Shaft last summer and said Shaft was okay, which I've seen a thousand times. But you can not say that about a coen brother's movie and you certainly can not say that. <br /> <br /> This film has everything from a prison break, crooked southern politicians, muses, clues to it All I can guess are historical figures, baptism by the riverside, bank robberies, violence against animals, singing swarms of religious fanatics, KKK , Lynchmobs and so on. Of course, there are many references to Homer's Odyssey here as well, but I would not know that because I had never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew anything about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and believes that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality make the movie much better. Well, from a man who knows nothing about it, I can tell you that it's still a fun movie. There were times when, as usual for a Coen movie, I was not sure why I was entertained or laughed, but it was me. This is a street scene where three men are on their way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he hid from his other cellmates. He has to take her with them because they were chained to him when they got the chance to escape. <br /> <br /> I like all the movie's main characters and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro, who seems to have a place in every Coen movie. It's a pity they did not find a place for Steve Buscemi, but that's another story. But back to Clooney. The man only has charisma. He is also a damn good actor and here he is not quite as crazy as the others, but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is really great and I really hope that shows that he is capable of playing any kind of character. <br /> <br /> Now that I have heaped all this praise on the movie, I would like to say so too. I did not really enjoy the movie at first. I found it rather boring and a bit boring. There were too many ideas, and not enough care was taken to use them for everything they were worth. But then the movie grew on me. It took a while, but it fell to me. I do not think this is her best movie, but it's still a good movie and I give it a 8.5. But the reason why I recommend this movie is for one reason only. <br /> <br /> Every day you can look in the newspaper and watch the movies that are playing, and yourself say, seen, seen, seen Oh, I saw it last year, that's the same as this movie and that is the same as this movie. Most of the films were recycled in some way. Not the films of Coen. They were not recycled and if they know it, I do not know about it. Reason enough to see something they bring out. Originality counts a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that's not common in today's cinema. Enjoy them while watching movies. Because you do not get such a vision in many movies, enjoy it when you do!
