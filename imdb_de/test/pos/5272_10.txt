The phenomenon Helge Schneider defies a simple description or a quick categorization. For the international audience that is not known to him, one could say that it is something like a rough mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman, who is committed to jazz music and outfits of the 70s. While his stage performances are already eccentric, his film work is just incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> "00 Schneider" is in my opinion the best film by Helge. He plays a major role in the two main roles - police detective "Kommissar 00 Schneider" and murderous villain "Nihil Baxter", and in a precious little role as a doctor "Dr. Hasenbein". In the opening scene we see how Baxter, who loves modern art, accidentally kills the circus clown Bratislav Metulskie, from whom he bought a defective used Jaguar, when a beloved sculpture from Baxter's hand slips and hits Metulskie fatally. After reading about the incident in the newspaper, 00 returns from retirement to discuss the case with the help of his loyal friend Lt. To examine coerces played by an older actor of the same name. They quickly pick up on Baxter's track and interrogate him in his strangely decorated mansion (one of the best scenes in the movie!), But at first they fail to produce evidence. The story winds through many twists, with several scenes that do not always really contribute to the plot's progress, but are humorous, such as a daydream at 00 (including the most unusual view of a running man's short step in the movie) story), a party department of the police, in which KÃ¶schgen gets into a dispute with the boss and has to be hospitalized, and a visit to the aforementioned Dr. Hasenbein's. Baxter is finally caught trying to escape to Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> Always worth mentioning is Andreas Kunze, who in this case plays the wife of 00, as he usually participates in women's roles in Helge's films. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for new laughs, I highly recommend this movie. The catch? You have to understand German (since I doubt that there is an English version) ...
