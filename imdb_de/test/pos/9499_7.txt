Gloria Swanson (as Leila Porter) is an understandably bored woman. Workaholic husband Elliott Dexter (as James Denby Porter) along with his waist "lost his romance"; He also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions and snores. He barely remembers his own jubilee - attended by Caddish Lew Cody (as Schuyler Van Sutphen); The younger man surveys Mrs. Swanson's voluptuous figure and flirts unabashedly. Swanson soon attracts Mr. Cody. Then Mr. Dexter decides to bring her back. Who will win? <br /> <br /> The three principals are alright, and Swanson impresses the most in the crucial role of the torn woman. Julia Faye gets supportive honors as "Toodles" by Cody; Off screen she seduced director Cecil B. DeMille. The DeMille touch is obvious. especially in an imaginary sequence where Cody Swanson promises ... "Joy, riches, love?" <br /> <br /> ******* Do not change your husband (1/26/19) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Gloria Swanson, Elliott Dexter, Lew Cody
