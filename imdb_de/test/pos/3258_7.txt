"Two Hands" is a funny Australian gangster movie playing in the really sultry Sydney. I bet tourists never imagine Sydney and Bondi as in this movie: all sweaty bodies, nightmare and gangsters in nylon shorts and jandals. Heath Ledger plays an amateur boxer with the goal of becoming part of the local King's Cross Boss gang. He looked pretty gorgeous in his green woman's club and the blue-eyed budgerigar smuggler. A sweaty tattooed body becomes him. I've always had him as a "Home & Away" boy, and he was in that soap, which is a bit more sweaty than the weetbix threadbare neighbors. The movie is really worth seeing for its combination of sardonic humor and evil power - the drowning scene will soon give me nightmares. Totty Awards: Country girls love city brother and tattooed street kids.
