The film follows a series of students at the NYC High School of the Performing Arts. There is Coco (Irene Cara), a black singer who will make it to the top despite everything. It was supported by Bruno (Lee Curren), a white musician. Then there's Doris (Maureen Teefy) who wants to become an actress - but she's shy and scared. She becomes friends with Motgomery (Paul McCrane) - allegedly the only gay student in the school, and is credited by Raul (Barry Miller). Then there's Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray - who unfortunately died in 2003) who is homeless and a great dancer - but can not read. Then there are several teachers (Albert Hague, Anne Meara stand out) trying to teach the children. <br /> <br /> The songs are great (the theme tune and "Out Here On My Own" were nominated for the best song.) "Fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast shows a lot of ambition and talent , BUT this movie misses the boat in the acting department. Many plotlines are opened until the end of the movie and left completely open. Why did Coco do a porno? Did Doris and Raul stay together afterwards? Did it either? How about Montgomery - what happened to him? And has Leroy ever graduated - and how? There are too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that simply do not work. I assume that the script was cut - I can not believe the movie left it open. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is worth seeing for the acting as well as for the music. There is not a single bad song at all and the dances are getting full (and eventually stopping the traffic - literally!). My favorites are "Fame", "Out Here ..." and "I Sing the Body Electric", a great ending song. I recommend it, but there can only be a 7 - the script really had to tie loose ends - and it did not. <br /> <br /> Trivia: You wanted to make this movie at the actual school for Performing Arts, but could not get permission. The dean of the school read the script and said that there had been too much cursing in the film. That's true - there's a lot of bad language, but that's the way high school kids talk. Avoid the TV version, which is extremely exaggerating.
