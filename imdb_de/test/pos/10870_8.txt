"N - io e Napoleone" was shown to the press at the Roma Film Festival this morning and is just to love. First, it can count on great production values, as there are few Italian films with wonderful scenery and costumes these days. The cast is great, too. Director Virzì is constantly talking about the young lead Elio Germano as "young De Niro". Now, of course, he goes much too far, but the boy can act safely. I loved his performance, and he did a great job with the (Tuscan) accent. Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and has done very well as Bonaparte. It's really great that he plays in Italian, I hope that he will be back in Italy soon. The understudy also worked well - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem unlikely, but they all performed well. Even Massimo Ceccherini, best known for his own stupid movies and trashy TV reality shows, was a good fit and funny. The low point of the cast was the "Diva" Monica Bellucci. Sure, she was a bit better than usual, but she managed to look (and sound) completely unnatural even in the Baroness Emilia, using her own umbro accent with a good portion of self-mockery. The screenplay by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì himself is smart, with many loud lines and some very emotional moments. Sure, the end confused me. The message is quite ambiguous: the whole movie says that political ideals can bring you to blind hatred, but as you get closer, you'll find that the goal of your hatred is after all a little human like any other, sometimes funny, sometimes funny sad, sometimes miserable, so that it is suddenly difficult to hate him; In the last few minutes it is said that it would have been better to shoot him in the head in the beginning. Personally, I do not like this idea very much. "Io e Napoleone" is still a pleasant movie that has been presented best at the festival (the other one is Fur and the Hoax). My rating is 8/10
