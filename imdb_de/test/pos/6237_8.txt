Some movies just fade, but Tourist Trap has outlasted time and has rightly become a cult favorite. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is not entirely original - but it has much to thank. It captivates with humor, real scary moments, a brilliant score by Pino Donaggio and the funny performances of Chuck Connors and the cast. Do not be deterred by the PG rating. This movie proves that every horror movie does not necessarily need nudity and nudity to make it entertaining. These elements are usually used to mask the lack of thrill in a movie. Here the fears are earned and effective. In addition, only Chuck Connors could carry a scene in which he has to share soup with a mannequin! A classic scene. This movie is now available on DVD in widescreen format and is a must for fans of the 70s horror fare.
