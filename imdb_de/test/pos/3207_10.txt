I'm not the type who can watch TV shows because acting is usually shitty or unrealistic or too dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act and you can relate to the characters and their situation. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for their sarcastic commentary, which makes every bad situation look odd. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She is proud to visit Harvard, and boys / friends always rank second in her book. She is a faithful friend and always the peacemaker. There is a subtle romance that I personally like. Not the mushy bubbly romance that not many people have in their lives, but a realistic kind of romance. Every character eventually gets it and they do not find their prince charming at first glance and they do not simply "fall in love" with any guy who gets in their way. It's a realistic show, but if you see it, you should update your movies, pop culture, and random facts because Lorelai Gilmore keeps making references. I fell in love with this show and if you give her a chance, you will too.
