"Nobi" or "Fires On the Plain" is a movie that is so outstanding on so many levels that not enough good can be said about it. My only regret is that I could not see this movie from 1959 earlier. <br /> <br /> Since I am something of a movie purist, I tend to view films as their artistic merit, based on dialogue, drama, photography, and even film, the effort, the period in relation to the To stay true to the traditional costume. Finally, I want to know if the film is "truthful" enough to show the human condition, to make me think, without suppressing what the director is asking me to do. <br /> <br /> "Fire on the Plains" A great movie because it is a portrait of realistic human responses to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is a condemnation of war on all levels - as any good war movie should be. War is terrible, bloody, destructive. It is also murderous for the psyche. Fundamental to "Fires on the Plain", however, is the unwilling look at the Japanese soldiers. It shows how they slowly collapsed under the weight of superior American firepower and their nation's inability to wage its own war. A fatalistic code that encourages death before surrender is at the heart of this madness. <br /> <br /> I was astonished to see such a sincere and brutal look at the bitter fruits of Japan's military failure, which was made only 14 years after the end of what the Japanese called the "Great Pacific War". call. Ichikawa reveals what the Germans called "war life," the plight of the ordinary soldier. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is interesting because even today Japan still finds it difficult to fully master its fanaticism, the conquest of conquered peoples, the racism of its war against the Chinese and war crimes, including cannibalism of soldiers and men Officers included, who were practiced not only against each other but also against the Allied prisoners of war, blatantly portrayed the victimization of soldiers through a mixture of poor political decisions and cultural pressure. <br /> <br /> This rigorous investigation is skillfully performed by portraying the condemned soldiers as people who fear at different times, brilliantly laconic humor, dialogue enriched by its sparse nature, and a conspiracy whose complexity derives from the gloomy wilderness environment is rejected. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's portrait is a ragged and painful tapestry of vanquished men. The tubercular Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, is a good soldier who can not give up his humanity even though he is as scared and lost as his comrades. Before leaving for a hospital that dismisses him as being too healthy, Tamura receives a hand grenade from a supervisor who advises Tamura, who acknowledges the hopelessness of her situation, to kill herself. Why Tamura is hopelessly ill-supplied and militarily incompetent unit was not asked to surrender at the beginning of the film. Ichikawa makes it clear that the war is over and everyone is just waiting to die. As Tamura leaves his unit to seek his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation, he sees that his comrades are meaningless digging an air-raid shelter. They look like corpses looking up from their own mass grave. <br /> <br /> Later, we observe the medical staff of the congested hospital transfer the dying patients to an all-consuming American artillery fire. The wretched patients, who are trying in vain to crawl out of their huts, seem like wretched, serpentine creatures that tear themselves out of an almighty power. They know that they will not survive. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa makes it clear that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by giving up its humanity and comrades. As Tamura stumbles through the jungle of Leyte, we encounter the noble, the dying and the exploiter. Cannibalism awakens its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat each other instead of surrendering to American corned beef. When the men speak of surrender, the propaganda of how Americans kill prisoners becomes a worldly adversary to soldiers, who reveal that the Americans are feeding and caring for prisoners of war because, unlike the Japanese, they respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up. <br /> <br /> It is the Japanese who want to die in battle because the Emperor lost all importance long after the resistance. Those who are willing to fight to the death are killed. It is the calculus of war. <br /> <br /> After shooting a murderous and cannibalistic comrade to whom he had previously offered his own body for food, the fatalistic Tamura's careless capitulation also seems to be a deliberate form of suicide. His death is a lonely picture. Did Ichikawa try to tell us about the inner conflict of an ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped by the suicidal cultures of his nation? <br /> <br /> If someone looks at this movie carefully, he or she will do that. See that absolutism and fanaticism is the enemy. The Americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people ready to use this technology in the form of unstoppable military power - a lesson that has changed Japanese post-war society. Ichikawa's film is not flat enough to display America. Ichikawa points to the sediment layers of Japan's destructive policies that caused the war, and then continues them when everything is lost. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons that fell on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He does not have to. The slow-motion destruction of the imperial Japanese army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of Japan's destruction.
