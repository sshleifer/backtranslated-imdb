Billy Wilder continues his powerful film series in the 1950s, with a biopic of Charles Lindbergh, the young American pilot who was the first man to fly across the Atlantic in 1927. For one thing, he still brings sincere warmth and the necessary self-confidence who make him a down to earth good guy that makes him an iconic movie star. Wild Director is solid and balances the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what Lindbergh had in mind when he decided to take on this challenge. It's certainly not his and Stewart's best work, but it's a gem of a movie. It lifts your mood by plane and makes you proud to be American. Overall, it's just good.
