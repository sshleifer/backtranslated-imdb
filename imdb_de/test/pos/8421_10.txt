This is a film about a six year old child from a village in Maharashtra (a state in India) and his grandfather who comes to Pune (a city in Maharashtra) to treat the child's eyes. Here, the grandfather learns that the child has cancer in both eyes and that it has to be removed to save the child's life. The film is all about the main characters and their feelings and actions until the surgery. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a typical clich√©d Indian movie, so expect to see songs or romance or melodrama. This is a very sensitive film that uses quiet expressions and not the upper dialog boxes to get through the point. Witness the scene in which the grandfather is told that the child's eyes must be removed. The spectacle is great, dialogues breaks the heart. Her heart goes to the grandfather, who has the enviable task of communicating the operation to the child and his mother. <br /> <br /> the handling of the theme was excellent. The film was shot with great effort by director Sandeep Sawant, who had to beat many doors to collect the Rs. a budget of six million. even then, the final product appears polished and has decent production values. Also experience the subtle contrast of the city villages that the director shows, incorporating arbitrary shots of the boy's life in the village. Sawant definitely seems to favor village life. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Amruta Subhash is competent as a social worker and adds the needed humane touch to her role. Sandeep Kulkarni as a Docter is great and shows perfect behavior of a doctor. Ashwin Chitale as a kid is natural. he does not seem to act. Everything about him is natural and does not seem to be forced. But outstanding is Arun Nalawade as a grandfather. He is amazing in his role. mere words can not describe his work. Shwaas is a sincere effort to make good movies. <br /> <br /> Shwaas It should not be ignored just because it shows that the results can be really surprising when things are kept simple. 10/10.
