I mention that maybe there is a spoiler here, just to be careful what I'm talking about, though I do not really think I'll give away something important. All "surprises" are really unimportant to the success of this film or the ability of an observer to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Although this is not without some minor flaws, this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship, time, uncertainty and the choices people make about their lives. At the same time it is also a very humorous film with small, mostly inconspicuous comedies. For most of the movie, the movie is going at a fairly leisurely pace, but it does not seem to be slow at all, as the movie draws you into it and into the lives of the characters. At first he is usually carefree. Some have commented that much of the film seems slow, but it's such a wonderful portrayal of the lives of such sympathetic characters that you could almost endlessly watch them. As the movie progresses, it becomes more emotional and moves to the end, and progress is handled beautifully. <br /> <br /> At some point, some of the characters decide to rob a bank, and though it may be hard to believe, that does not make sense. It's a wonderful addition to underscore the love these friends have for each other, while at the same time emphasizing the humor and adding a little more irony to the movie. And although it's hardly original that a bunch of old men have robbed a bank, the context and details are quite original and they make it wonderful, which makes it very funny, for example Ismet (if I remember correctly) his aggressiveness exaggerated to "disguise" the fact that he is old. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the other comedies are reserved, but still very humorous, so I kept laughing. <br /> <br /> The actors are probably the real key to this movie. They give the characters a deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth. There are some small transformations or tiny details of the characters that are subtly smoothed out. Of course, the film is about the personalities of these characters and how they groom and interact with each other. They succeed so well, and if fewer actors had the roles, the film might have failed. <br /> <br /> Gule Gule is not without sorrow, but that simply offers the full range of emotions and provides more strength experience. In fact, the film is so moving and full of love of such rich characters that in the end, despite its sadness, it is a very heartwarming, satisfying and even happy movie. I could watch it over and over again.
