I am looking forward to the release of this movie since hearing the concept for the first time two years ago, and I was not disappointed. I will not bother to summarize the story, as everyone else did, but I'll say it was just entertaining. The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were sympathetic. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is: (1) the story was definitely missing; The film was completed very abruptly - in fact writing in the second half became quite casual, as if the authors were not sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot was not nearly as important as the music and the action, it did not have much of an impact on the entertainment value of the movie. Therefore, this is not a big complaint, it seems. <br /> <br /> (2) This is really picky, but the music the characters heard in the movie was sometimes dated after 1985, when the movie was set. INXS 'Devil Inside was from 1987 and AC / DC' Are You Ready 'from 1990, among other bugs. This bothers me a bit, as they obviously did everything they could to make a good move, if they could have checked the copyright date of those songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier. Again no big deal. <br /> <br /> Oh, I thought of something else that was weird. The Steel Dragon band members were supposed to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played band members, and they both had a couple of lines of AMERICAN accents. It was also pretty lazy, but it was still cool to see real musicians playing musicians, so I'll forgive that too. <br /> <br /> I could probably do Nitpick all day, but I do not want to give the impression that this was not a super entertaining movie. I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I'm sure I'll just buy the soundtrack CD for the six Steel Dragon songs (some sung by the Steelheart singer if you remember them!). The highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake in which Mark Wahlberg is on stage for a rock song and suddenly someone plays "Good Vibrations" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. The surprised look on Mark's face is priceless. Classic Rock'n'Roll movie! Result: 8/10 for extreme entertainment
