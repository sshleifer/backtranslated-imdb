Police Squad (1982) was a fun show that ended too soon. But I think it was running before it became too repetitive and unsavory, like so many American TV shows. The geniuses behind this funny show were the team of sugar, Abrahams and sugar. Since his straight acting in the comedy AIRPLANE! Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short-lived t.v. In this series he once again had the chance to play the straight man in a crazy comedy. The bizarre titles of each episode betrayed the end. But Lt. Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) got into so many crazy cases that you have to see her to be believed. If a show should be re-released, it should be this one. A whole new generation is waiting for this show! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!
