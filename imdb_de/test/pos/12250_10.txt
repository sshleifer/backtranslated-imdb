Not only do I think this was the best movie of 1987, it's probably on my own amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best movies I've ever seen. For some reason, I've really connected with this film and it's one of the most personal films I've ever seen in my life (I was 26). For the better or worse, I have strongly identified with the Holly Hunter character (and I'm a guy!). She plays an extremely bright, loyal and intense woman who could not see any romantic relationships. There were so many things she said in this film, things that I would say to others in similar circumstances. And the end of the film is very, very sad. <br /> <br /> Obviously this role was the big breakthrough for Holly Hunter. Sure, I was not the only one who appreciated it so much.
