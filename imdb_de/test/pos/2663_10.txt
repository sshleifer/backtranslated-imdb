I am writing this review shortly after hearing about Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a big loss, and I'm writing about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I think it's the finished Kubrick movie he'll remember most. It's a picture like no other that not only revolutionizes science fiction, but also changes the way films are conceptualized. It was probably the first "art" movie in America, inspiring George Lucas and countless other writers and directors. Apart from its visual size, the reason why the film brings so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and his co-author Arthur C. Clarke had a vision, but we never really figured out what went through their minds. Of course, the skeleton is on its "message" as technology of the future will take over humanity and determine the course of our lives if we are not careful. The end of 2001 is a hope, a version of our rebirth through the star child's flight to Earth. It is meaningless to many, but sophisticated movie goers will understand. <br /> <br /> Although 2001 was not the evil, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE or strong, eccentric characters that have filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still believe that he is would have liked to have remembered. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous and artificial. It was half a decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was producing boring musicals and was just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was an outsider director, who made great films amazing on his own terms, at his own time, and for everyone else. He will be missed.
