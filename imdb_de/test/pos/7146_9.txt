This film was recommended to me by the same person who blessed me with a copy of the Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing screenplays ever written. It is well executed, traded and directed. Cinematography is a bit dark for my taste, but I'm sure it should. The script is like poetry in parts of the movie. Throughout the film, I paused to think about the comments on screen. This is a wonderful piece of cinema, and I can only hope that more people will come across and add ratings. Fair warning, although this was a 6-tissue movie for me. Very touching. Very warm services.
