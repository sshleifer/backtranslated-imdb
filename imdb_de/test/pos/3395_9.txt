Having just looked at it with my mother (who worried about Christmas), I was thrilled to find something different from the usual stuff I usually watch. All stories were detailed and from the beginning you can feel a strong emotion for each character. Every action is brilliantly tracked, and you feel completely different for each character. The cast is incredible, my personal favorites were James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, like George Hazard and Madeline Fabray / LaMotte / Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful and makes viewing very compelling, I recommend it to almost everyone.
