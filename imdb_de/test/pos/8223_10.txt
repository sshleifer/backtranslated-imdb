The Regard of Flight and the Clown Bagatelles by Bill Irwin are some of the funniest performances (both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags) I've ever seen. My dad recorded this special when it aired for the first time in the 80's and my family loves it ever since. We quote it pretty much back and forth. It is a shame that copies are not readily available. I have a bad VHS copy that I purchased from a specialist distributor a few years ago, but Mr. Irwin's performance deserves proper DVD editing with a restored version of the original and interviews with the artists / producers and other examples of modern clowning. <br /> <br /> The talent of Bill Irwin deserves more attention from the mainstream audience than was seen in his limited release releases. I often share "The Regard of Flight" with friends and although I'm always greeted with a bit of skepticism when I mention that this is a mixture of clowning and vaudeville, I still have no one who sees it without it love. If the powers that come with this IMDb listing ever come into consideration, you should share this and other work with Bill Irwin.
