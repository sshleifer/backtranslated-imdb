Perhaps many viewers who have been frustrated by this film are living their lives without ever having to think deeply about life. I would like to point out that "distant" is not just an art house movie, but one of the best art house films. Of all the Art House movies I've seen, "distant" is the one that truly stands out as a glittering gold coin. It can even be said that the film's cinematography and depiction of human emotions surpass Tarkovsky's nostalgia. A commentator has understood correctly that sex, a washed-out, common feature in foreign films, surprisingly "far away" and in a good way is missing. The most notable thing about "Fern" is that it captures the details of life that we normally ignore, and the rich essence of our existence, which is often buried under the noise and visual extravagance of our marketed world. Fortunately, "distant" does not have that much to spare the public, and what we see on screen is a naked portrait of people.
