First, they came for the Communists, and I said nothing because I was not a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I said nothing because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the Catholics, and I did not speak because I was Protestant. Then they came for me, and at that time there was no one left to speak for me. Martin Niemoller, attributed in 1945. When confronted with intolerance or injustice is the simplest thing to do - talk up and you risk becoming an object of contempt. But when is enough too much? Global anti-Semitic sentiment allowed Hitler's policy of genocide to flourish, and equal doses of panic and ignorance allowed the anti-communist purges of McCarthyism to destroy thousands of lives. Inaction makes you no less guilty. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman is a man's chameleon: calm and inconspicuous, he blends seamlessly into his surroundings. Lawrence does not like to get involved - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he does not tell anyone and does his thing. His world goes into chaos when he buys glasses and gets confused with one of them. Lawrence's view of the world and her view of him is forever changed. <br /> <br /> Although the theme of this film is not new, its presentation is definitely unique. It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice when placed in a particular context - Lawrence is more concerned with the assumption that he is a Jew than with the views of his attackers. He believes that if he corrects this "oversight", everything will be fine without realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand. <br /> <br /> Whether you're playing a schemer (the only thing I like about "Fargo") or a nice sheriff who's at home, the roles of William H. Macy are linked by a common thread Face that gives them substance. Macy nails Lawrence down to the smallest detail and says more with a furtive look or shiver in his voice than a dialogue page. Instead of telling, Lawrence shares his fear and confusion with the viewer. The understaffing brings the story together. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern captivates as Gerty, Lawrence Bombshell's wife with a past. Trailer Park rough, but also by other worldly wise men, she has felt the anger of prejudice as a result of a "mistake" and unwittingly aggravates Lawrence's situation. Michael Lee Aday (aka "Meatloaf") is scary when Fred, the prototypical redneck next door, collects in equal parts ignorance and venom, neighbors to his virulent cause. In the midst of chaos lies Finklestein (David Paymer), the focus of aggression and the voice of reason that raises important questions. Paymer's even hand-drawn portrait keeps Finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to create sympathy, which is one of the film's strongest performances, a clean image with few distractions, blending a hint of Claustrophobia with the small American town - at the same time it is soothing and disturbing. The deliberate use of rough two-tone lighting to accentuate the vicious aspects of the piece and the carefully played soundtrack is powerful, without being overwhelming. Finally, the sets and costumes reflect the feeling of the epoch, an integral part of the film message. <br /> <br /> The unconventional "Focus" approach to prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film. Just consider the excellent story, the solid drama and the look of the movie as an added bonus.
