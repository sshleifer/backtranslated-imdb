I read the other comments on this movie here before looking at it. If you have read them, you will know that they are almost all negative. I really do not understand that. I admit that it is way too long (it takes about half an hour to speed things up). The music is often unsuitable. But strong performances by Ford and Thomas are indeed enough to carry this. For all his fame as a movie star, I forgot that Harrison Ford can really act! This role as a man who has defined himself on the basis of a lie is remarkable. I find it absolutely believable that he wants all the details he can get, so he can see what was real and what was fraud. Thomas is always wonderful and that is no exception. Their initial rejection, which leads to confusion and then inner peace, is enormous. This movie will never be on anyone's list of the best movies, but it's not that bad. I'm glad I waited to see it on video, but it's worth the $ 3 or $ 4.
