"I'm afraid you're talking on the rack where the forced men talk anything." The Shakespeare line of The Merchant of Venice is repeated in the new movie Rendition, which familiarizes the viewer with the "improved methods of interrogation" that began in the Clinton administration and has become more general since the terrorist attacks of September 11 are. 2001. <br /> <br /> The film features an All-Star cast with Oscar winners Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal and Omar Metwally. Supporting roles cast by unidentified actors also bring audiences into the story and show how many people are affected by overseas terrorist attacks and how we investigate them. <br /> <br /> The performance follows a native Egyptian terrorism suspect (Metwally), who was taken by US officials after his flight from South Africa to Washington DC in an unknown prison overseas. His pregnant wife (Witherspoon) ventures to Washington DC to learn about his disappearance from his friend and relatives of the Senator (Sarsgaard). Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst in a foreign detention center who oversees the violent interrogation. This film follows the emotional distress of the torture victim (Metwally) and the persons involved in the alleged information of him. Some, such as the CIA analyst (Gyllenhaal), are visibly shaken and appalled by the methods used, while others, the strict senator (Streep) and the foreign interrogator (Yigal Naor), find this necessary and effective. <br /> <br /> The film is described by some as a political piece, but is ultimately an emotional piece. Metwally's performance as a tortured prisoner is Oscar-worthy. The film does not intend to preach, but to question and inform the audience about a topic that does not often have a human face. It is known that renditions work, but also provide false information from innocent prisoners. The film simply shows the emotional struggles of those involved in such heavy business, in a way that affects every viewer differently. The movie will sustain your interest, and you have dealt with the sufferings of the characters.
