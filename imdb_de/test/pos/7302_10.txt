This film shows how he depicts the reality of sexual abuse. The daughters perfectly express their contradictory feelings of affection and betrayal. The scenery on-site is intriguingly authentic and the soundtrack is unobtrusive yet moving. This film is a course for graduates in a reality that is under-recognized in American society. Personally, I freaked out of the characters' names - Long is Ginny Cook Smith - my name is Connie Cook Smith and my mother is Genny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, my sister's name, and the father is Larry Cook, my cousin's name. But sexual abuse was not in our immediate family.
