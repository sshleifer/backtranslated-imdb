I do not understand why this movie has such a low rating. It absolutely deserves more! Sure, it's completely ridiculous, but that's the way it should be. Do not expect cinematic transcendence from a movie about beauty contest candidates stranded on a Caribbean island! What you should expect is a huge parody of just about every relevant science fiction, fantasy and blockbuster movie in movie history and even references to other spoofers. Everything is completely exaggerated and sometimes completely unnecessary, but that's what characterizes this movie. If you like parodies and like to say Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers, you will love that. I really did!
