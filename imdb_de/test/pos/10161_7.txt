"The man who knew too much" falls into the middle ground of Hitchcock, who coined many of his films in the fifties: not a masterpiece of suspense, but still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day are playing a vacationing couple who have fallen into a conspiracy of foreign intrigue. The famous climate scene takes place at a concert of classical music, during which someone is murdered in the score during a certain pelvic clash. Of course, the mischievous Hitchcock lets us know what that point is, so the race for the assassin becomes a raging race against the cymbalist. So much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase / Goldie Hawn comedy "Foul Play," which I believe has inspired the movie. No movie is a big deal, but both are easy to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Note: B +
