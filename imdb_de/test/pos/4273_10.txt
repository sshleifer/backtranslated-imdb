I love the TV contest. I hate seeing it end. There are so many talented participants. It's a shame that only 2 are selected. I also like to look at the judges. Sometimes they are just as entertaining as the participants. I watched the show faithfully every Sunday night. Would not miss it for the world. It's the best reality show ever on TV. I wish all participants good luck, although I have already selected the two that I would like to play on Broadway. I'm curious if my decisions are right. I do not know how long the contest will take until Danny and Sandy are selected, but I'll watch until the end.
