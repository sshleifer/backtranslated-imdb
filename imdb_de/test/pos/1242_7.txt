Maybe I was just in a good mood when I saw this movie. But for some reason, I really liked this movie. Was it terribly original? Was it a bit predictable? Yes. Yes and? It was still a really nice movie. I've always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, there was Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic guy perfectly. Maybe this movie is not Oscar material, but it sure is good material. Lend it.
