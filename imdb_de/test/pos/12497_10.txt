Seeing this show gives me respect for MTV, though I can imagine that MTV sees this random, edgy material as its main selling point and is less concerned with the related truths that it expresses. <br /> <br /> I write and make music for my living, and this show really gets on my nerves emotionally. Wondsershowzen has for me a completely different function than most televisions. Instead of dulling or distracting the senses (which sometimes can be very beautiful), it awakens my mind of right and wrong. That makes me very uncomfortable, but in a very calming way. <br /> <br /> I do not think many viewers will absorb most of the content of this show, but if they do, the television viewers are praised everywhere.
