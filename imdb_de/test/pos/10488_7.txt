I was unfamiliar with this movie until I saw it in a list of the top 20 spaghetti westerns I've come across recently (after the marathon, I've made subgenre movies in recent weeks); So it was good that the movie had to be broadcast almost immediately on late Italian television (for the first time I'm pretty sure, in a good number of years)! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast has not been great lately: I recorded the movie on VHS, but that's why I decided not to keep it. The next day, when I saw the movie, I found out that he was available on a Region 2 DVD from Italy (with an interview with unsigned scriptwriter Ernesto Gastaldi) - and after I was sufficiently impressed, decided I order to order it there and there, even if I knew that I would not go to the DVD for quite a while, as I would like to spend some time between a movie and the next movie! A brief clause here: When I recently bought a bunch of spaghetti westerns on Italian DVD, I decided not to order Sergio Sollima's FACE TO FACE (1967), as I had the impression it was a sheer matter. However, I've just learned that the disc actually contains an interview with the director (like THE BIG GUNDOWN [1966] I bought). It seemed to me confusing that Sollima would not be making a similar contribution to the DVD release of this film when he actually considered FACE TO FACE as his favorite work (according to the director's talent biography on the Blue Underground Region 1 disc of another Sollima Spaghetti is included) Western - RUN, MAN, RUN [1968]); The problem is that I loved THE BIG GUNDOWN so much that I watched FACE TO FACE about my recordings on Italian TV. I have ordered the DVD of this movie now - mostly because it is still discounted - but as I said before for a second look at THE PRICE OF POWER (though I may still see Sollima's interview when the CD arrives ) ... <br /> <br /> OK, sing along: The film is a rather unusual spaghetti western and a very interesting, indeed ambitious movie, as it puts the JFK murder case in an old west! In fact, it is reminiscent of Anthony Mann's tight black-and-white thriller THE TALL TARGET (1951) - which dealt with an assassination attempt on the life of the then US. President Abraham Lincoln. It shows one of the most popular Italian stars of this subgroup, Giuliano Gemma, in perhaps his most impressive western role (many of his other films have tended to be lighthearted). The minor cast includes at least two other notable personalities: Van Johnson (in one of his few and mostly inconspicuous Italian films), when the American president was killed in the Dallas after the Civil War, and Fernando Rey as the head of a conspiracy of the Southerners - not just plundering Assassination, but also maneuvers the new incumbent US President, Vice President of Johnson, by blackmail! <br /> <br /> Benito Stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff, who pursues Gemma throughout the picture and with whom he is involved in a "duel in the dark" a few times - the guns are resting on the ground and not the respective holsters and the only light in the room provided by the cigar ends of the cowboys! Also involved is Ray Saunders as Gemma's black buddy, from which the story eventually turns into the damned "Lee Harvey Oswald" figure. Stelvio Massi - who later cut his teeth as director of a series of Poliziotteschi - stands behind the film's luminescent cinematography; Similarly, Luis Enrique Bacalov provides yet another great "Euro-Cult" score, which is so different from the style of Ennio Morricone that it is equally distinguishable. The direction of Valerii may be just as impressive here as it is in other spaghetti westerns, but he does the procedure efficiently enough (the last shooting match has been particularly well done); The film is certainly one of the more underrated entries in the subgenre, and for the curious, the novelty of the plot line should be on its own ...
