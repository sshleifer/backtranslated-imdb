"What Alice Found" was a pleasant discovery. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell, this is a combination of a road movie with a warning story and a voyage of discovery. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, you might want to do this Stop reading. <br /> <br /> Alice is a case study of a young woman who wants to solve her unfortunate life in a New Zealand town. Her excuse for leaving is her best friend, who is currently studying at a university in Miami. Alice is the product of a single mother struggling to make ends meet, in stark contrast to the life her friend feels comfortable with. In flashbacks, we see Alice's life before we take to the streets. <br /> <br /> Alice, as her namesake in "Alice in Wonderland", embarks on a journey into the unknown on which she has not prepared her life. The highways of America are full of predators in search of the weak and innocent. Alice meets a catastrophe as her car breaks down the road and a friendly couple from the South come to their aid as a strange man approaches in the dark with the apology that he wants to help her. Sandra and Bill persuade her, in their plush R.V. on her way south. <br /> <br /> Nothing has prepared Alice for what makes this couple. After all, in her sheltered life, she has not been concerned with what Sandra and Bill, their new benefactors, do during their nights at rest areas on the American highways. It is a shock to her to realize that the Sandra type is nothing more than a prostitute doing business under the truck drivers you meet there. Alice, brilliantly played by Emily Grace, is a study of how the young woman awakens in the new reality that she can not escape. In fact, Sandra makes it so easy that Alice tries her luck at the oldest profession in the world to collect some much-needed money. Judith Ivey gives an incredible performance as Sandra. Ms. Ivey is perfect as a seemingly normal woman. You would not know that she is uncomfortable with the customers she and Bill find on the route they are traveling. Ms. Ivey is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life to an accusing Alice. As a husband, Bill Raymond is good in his portrayal as a husband, which is actually a procurer. <br /> <br /> Under the excellent direction of Mr. Dean Bell, the movie is not afraid to go mainstream. Movies dare not go. Congratulations to this director who has written a plausible story and collected the perfect cast to play for us.
