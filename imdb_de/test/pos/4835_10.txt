I saw the premiere of "Path to Paradise" a long time ago and was stunned, dramatic license and everything. I lived and worked in NYC (Brooklyn) for a few years. Given the links with groups such as Al-Queda, Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, I see it today as a warning that is not recognized by our government. For that, I blame our bureaucracy and our leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic to behead two of our branches of government, and there is no excuse for our government to stop it, period. "Path to Paradise" was just a dramatic look at the '93 preview, and nobody cared. Well, nearly 3,000 deaths later, and years later, we find it difficult to find an answer that can be resolved for decades.
