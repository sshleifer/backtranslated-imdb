Goldie Hawn was best known for TV comedy shows in 1969, especially for ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN, where she was the young blonde boy. She has made films in front of CACTUS FLOWER, the most notable being a Walt Disney movie, the one and only true, original family ties. But CACTUS FLOWER picked up on LAUGH-IN's character and, thanks to a good script by IAL Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner based on an Abe Burrows piece - she was able to develop the television character in such a way that a real performance emerged. As a result, Ms. Hawn won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1969, and her career began with future hits such as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although other LAUGH-IN stars fare well on television (Henry Gibson has a recurring role as Judge at BOSTON LEGAL), Goldie could only make Goldie's career. <br /> <br /> On LAUGH-IN Goldie's personality would be a naivety that would be embarrassing. Occasionally she noticed it and laughed loudly to cover, but sometimes she did not see her mistake (example: Goldie is introduced to show host Gary Moore in the 1950s and says, "Goldie, this is Mr. Gary Moore.) "She shakes his hand and says (much to his confusion)," I've always wanted to meet Mr. John Gary Moore! "). But as Toni Simmons it is very different. She is in love with Dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), a successful dentist who can never marry her. Julian told her that his wife (with whom he had two sons and a daughter) will never divorce. So at the beginning of the film, Toni tries to commit suicide by the gas of her oven. However, she is rescued by her neighbor Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz), a struggling playwright who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas. <br /> <br /> Toni stepped down to live, but she sent Julian a farewell letter. Igor tries to send a message to ignore the note, but Julian's receptionist / nurse / assistant Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) will not stop Julian's work schedule from handing over the phone when Igor calls. Instead, Julian finds the letter and races to Toni's apartment just to find her alive. When Igor confirms her story that she has tried to kill herself, Julian realizes the depth of her love and decides that he has to marry such a woman. Unfortunately Toni Julian has swallowed lies and believes in his wife and children. Julian has no wife and no children. Since Toni is firmly convinced that she can not marry a man who has lied to her, Julian sits on a weakening tree branch. Julian comes to solve the problem by getting Stephanie to call herself a woman. Winston. Stephanie is against it at first, but on her first free Saturday she faces Toni in the record shop where Toni is. They talk, and Toni realizes all the subtle strengths of the character and personality of Stephanie (and since Stephanie has her two nephews with her, Toni thinks they are Julian's children). Toni tells Julian that they need to see who the man Stephanie is supposed to marry is. For Julian, Stephanie and Toni the lie begins to wind. Soon, a friend is handed over to Stephanie in the form of Julian's friend and freelance patient Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so scruffy (Stephanie detests him) that Toni feels unworthy of Stephanie. <br /> <br /> And so it goes, with one complication (which is mostly caused by the well-meaning, misinformed Toni) to one conclusion. The script is full of prime situations and one-liners (Example: Julian rewards Stephanie for lied about her marriage, buys two records at Toni's store, steals a mink from Toni, but decides to send her to Stephanie with Julian's card Stephanie is quite happy to get the mink, but she does not say a word about the type of gift she got - if she says thank you very much to Matthau, he says she has the idea of ​​liking Horowitz - which is Vladomir Horowitz means Stephanie thinks Horowitz is the name of the furrier!). Bergman must have enjoyed the filming, as several scenes show this earthy look, which was a hallmark of her in the late 1940s films. But there was also a similarity to their 1958 movie comedy INDISCREET. There, Cary Grant lied to make sure the couple focused on the romance of their affair without worrying about the marriage. When Grant reveals Berg's lie, she decides to convince her that she has made him a cuckold. Instead of being the passive lover who believes that Matthau is telling the truth, Bergman carefully tries to get Matthau out of his mess with little white lies, only to find that one leads to another, making life difficult for everyone. Bergman is seen as a nice woman who, despite trying to be part of the solution, becomes part of the problem. <br /> <br /> All leads work well, especially Bergman, initially business thoroughness, which, however, gradually recovers her sexuality. Matthau is adorable because a man who finds a useful lie is an obstacle that simply can not be thrown away. The minor cast, especially Weston as the damn and sexually slimy Harvey, and Vito Scotti as the US ambassador who really has the best for Bergman. It was a clever comedy and a really good opportunity for Goldie Hawn's film career to move forward.
