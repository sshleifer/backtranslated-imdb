After reading the awful reviews of this movie, including the comments that were said to have been cited by Colin, I almost did not bother to add this movie to my Firth movie collection, but since I'm the Firth fan I am the intrigue made me better! <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I really enjoyed the movie. It had suspense, drama and intrigue and the scene of V.sexy Colin. The plot kept me guessing until the end of the credits, and I felt like the Jennifer Rubens opening scene was over, the actress played her role convincingly. Colin was as brilliant as ever, and it's great to see him playing a character from the "dark side", a "shiver down my spine" and after seeing that, I can not wait to Colin's new movie "Trauma'soon" on DVD. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe it was not a movie that was kind of "on your face" and you could not "sleep on the plot", especially towards the end, as there was a lot going on, but that pleased fine, the acting was subtle, fortunately not exaggerated (as with many suspense thrillers). This made the movie more casual. You could not guess what Colin's character (Ross Talbert) or Jennifer Ruben's character (Jamie Harris) would do next, and there were a few surprises in store, I sat on the edge of the seat, with a pillow handy !! <br /> <br /> Personally, I am very happy that I have seen "Playmaker" and I will certainly rewind and see again. I think any Firth fan would benefit from this movie if he did not like the storyline, then just watch Colin ;-))
