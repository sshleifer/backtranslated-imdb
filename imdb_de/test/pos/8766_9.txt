Barry Kane is an aircraft factory worker. In the factory suddenly sabotage takes place and a fire is released. His best friend is killed. They blame him for the act, but Kane knows it was a man named Fry who was there. He becomes a fugitive going to this man named Fry. He helps a nice blind man. He has his niece, the Billboard model Patricia Martin, take the man to a local blacksmith to have his handcuffs removed. I do not believe Barry and want to take him to the police. But soon he changes his mind about Barry and they learn of another sabotage order that will take place soon. There is a group of anti-American fascists. And Frank Fry is a member of this group. Saboteur (1942) is another example of the fact that Alfred Hitchcock could not make a bad movie. Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane and he's really good at it. Priscilla Lane with her good looks plays Pat Martin. Also good. Otto Kruger makes a big head rogue as leader of th The fascist group Charles Tobin.Norman Lloyd, who still lives with 94, plays Fry and makes a very credible crook. Vaughan Glaser is the most sympathetic figure of the blind Philip Martin. The dance hall sequence is fantastic. And also the moments of the circus train. At the end we are at the Statue of Liberty.
