I'm fifteen and have seen thirty-three of Sinatra's films (not counting videos from TV shows and documentaries) and were unimpressed by just two of them. "Until the clouds pass by" and "The wonder of the bells" do not really count, considering that in the first step he sings only a magnificent "Ol 'Man River" and in the latter case not half bad only the picture is pathetic: Mine Favorite records, radio shows, TV shows and movies about Sinatra are changing almost every day - everything takes on a different connotation and occasionally seems to be the best thing he has ever done and sometimes the worst until the cycle comes back, but there are a few Things that are unparalleled: When it comes to movies, "The Man with the Golden Arm" lists this list. Anyone who knows anything about Sinatra knows he thought it was his best. All the performances, he was nominated for the Oscar, it was the first serious look at the drug addiction, etc. etc. The jazz score is memorable, Kim Novak likes it despite a ridiculous accent, Eleanor Parker is annoying and too dramatic, the turtle-like Arnold Stang amused the Fi The first time, but every time more embarrassing, and Darren McGavin makes a wonderfully slimy drug dealer, the sets are not convincing - at first glance, it seems to be a peculiar mixed bag, the great Otto Preminger with a subtle charm throws together. <br /> <br /> Then you come to Sinatra. Like everything else in his life - unlike music - reports about his acting are always divided in half. Directors such as Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Otto Preminger agreed that Sinatra had worked as hard on his films as he had on singing. He would have been one of the best actors in the world - if not the greatest. Humphrey Bogart even said, "This guy has the most natural acting talent I've ever seen." Not bad for a man who never took acting classes in his life, he also produced the discography that would make him the "greatest singer of the 20th century," and made almost all of his scenes in one recording. <br /> <br /> In direct conflict with all these are the other reviews and biographies that are haughty, what a lousy actor this Mr. Sinatra was and how many "bad" films he made. The question will never be answered to the satisfaction of all, since the controversy was part of Sinatra's greatest fortune and in a sense played both arguments in his hands. In any case, Sinatra is great at this time in this role. A reviewer said in the late 1950s, "Sinatra may not be the best actor in the world, but there is no more intriguing sight." No matter what Sinatra does in a movie, it's hard to keep track of him. This, of course, is a "charisma" I've only seen with a handful of other people - Orson Welles, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift - maybe James Cagney. There is no real definition for it, and it's often difficult to figure out whether you're really enjoying a performance or just banned, but the quality shown here makes the movie. Sinatra is downright engrossing, real, intense - for decades and thousands of paper doll doll stars called quality. Like it or not, this is a one-man show with a few character actors lying around in the background. He covers every feeling with remarkable subtlety, from the sweet, lonely tenderness of Kim Novak to the frightening shock of Frank Sinatra (Frank Sinatra!), Who whimpers and cries in the agony of the "cold turkey". Sinatra was right - that's his best performance. No question. <br /> <br /> I was eight years old when Frank Sinatra died. I have not been in all those years of Bobby singers and Anchors Aweigh, Mr. Ava Gardner and From Here to Eternity, Albums with Lampposts and Swing Lover, Kennedy, Vegas. Ring. Basie and Mia and Reagan and concerts from Madison Square Garden to South Africa, from the White House to the Sands. I can not say that I like Sinatra because I heard it in the Paramount or because I hear "September of My Years" autobiographical - the usual excuses. And my apology? When I was eleven, I saw a movie titled "On the Town" ...
