Some people do not like Led Zeppelin, but fortunately, the number of people who are unbalanced against the number of people who do not. I'm the proud converter of 2 or 3 Led Zeppelin fans and the only reason I could do that is because of this DVD. <br /> <br /> First of all, how someone can hear "Stairway to Heaven" "Immigrant Song" without falling in love with Zeppelin is a mystery to me, but playing guitar and not like Page ... That's as if you were Christian and you do not like Jesus. My friend was like "Led Zeppelin sucks!" and I said, "Oh yeah, watch out!" After about 2 minutes, Page Pick glanced through "White Summer / Black Mountain Side" and he was glued to the screen and has never said anything bad about Zeppelin ever since. If you have not followed this running metaphor I call this DVD the Bible of Led Zeppelin. Held high by the followers and used as a converter for the unwashed pagans. <br /> <br /> Of course some things are missing like "Over the Hills and Far Away", a good version of "Immigrant Song" and I really did not need a 2 version of "Whole Lotta Love", but hell take it I her. <br /> <br /> As there is nothing besides "The Song Remains Same Same" I can compare that to a 10 and even if there is more to compare, I would have given him a 10 anyway.
