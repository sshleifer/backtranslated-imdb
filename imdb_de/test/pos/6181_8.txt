It's about getting what you want, if you want it. And the message of Bluebeards Aighth WIfe is to pay attention to what you wish for until you wish it. <br /> <br /> Most men have heard the stories of what happens if your sexual frustration is not alleviated and a certain part of your anatomy turns blue. Apart from misogynistic pirates, Cooper plays a very wealthy man who is used to getting what he wants whenever he wants it, and he learned too late that it was not what he had expected. Through a twisted (in soul and in the practice) business, he ends up begging / buying, but she (literally) will have none of it and frustrates him on every corner, corner and room. and tourist attraction. <br /> <br /> The film has a strong sense of French, which means that he has strong double-entenders and boudoir humor and a sharp edge for the day that you're not used to (and may not like to see) ) either Cooper or Colbert. The whole reason why I saw the movie was that they are "sympathetic" actors, and the whole point of this movie is that they are unlikely people, or at least sympathetic people, who have developed unlikely qualities to get ahead of the movie to protect the world. <br /> <br /> If you can accept it on your own terms, you will find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated movie ... and satisfaction, as I said, is what it's all about. Such a movie with such a cast comes only once in a ... um ... blue moon.
