How many movies can you imagine when you see such a movie? I can not count them, but it seemed like the filmmakers wanted to give me a hint. I've been reminded so often of other films that it became a big distraction. One of the borrowed, memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 - Day After Tomorrow. One line in itself is not that bad, but this movie lends itself so much to so many movies that it becomes a bad risk. Despite its downfalls, there are enough to make it interesting and perhaps make it look smart. While borrowing so much from other films, she never goes overboard. In fact, you will probably knock down the hatches and rip the storm off. Why? ... Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I've never been a fan of Kutcher before and I almost gave it up in The Guardian, but it turned up well. Costner wears the film with the best skills of Costner. I do not think Mrs. Robinson had anything to do with his success. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast played its part well. I did not have any problems with them in the end. But some of these characters were used too often. <br /> <br /> From here I can only nod and so I will spare you the wear. Enjoy the movie, the parts that work, work well enough to keep your head above water. Just do not expect a smooth ride. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, but almost a 6.
