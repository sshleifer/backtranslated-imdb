My favorite show ever! Yes, I thought that was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny - unless it was serious, and it was just a great show. But since we could not afford to keep Nick, I could not see episodes after February 1996, and maybe that's why I think more of the series than I should. For me, it's more the epidemic (it does not look right!), When you have to say "goodbye" to someone you love, and KNOW that you'll never see them again. And I still think, because to my knowledge there are no plans to release this on DVD soon ... yes, life is mean! I've certainly figured that out (although you can find a weird episode here and there ... but I never really liked the Bootleg copies of things either.) So enough of my sad life: (.... Most of the 7th. Classes DO NOT need powers like Alex to kill (unrealistic - safe), but how many cities have over-the-top chemical plants willing to do something for "progress at any price"? This show was fun! Although I agree, the Diaglouge is a bit overdeveloped (and sometimes a bit politically correct). My favorite parts were, if the kids had a reason to break into the grounds (videotape or similar), like a kid's version of "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six" (the years later I probably alluded to this series of games for the same reason)! Then you have Plant's "safety team" desperately trying to find the "kid from the accident" ... very mean guys (at least when I saw the show for the first time ... they seem to be more sympathetic to me now). I'm pretty sad for Larisa Oleynik, not sure if she cares if she plays that role, but I'll always remember her. Oh, and BTW, the actor plays Aaron Peirce of "24" is also here as a school coach or something .... too cool! Maybe he can get the producers of this show to get Larisa in the next season of "24". I'm just talking about it, because Jack Bauer is my other TV hero and I'd like to see crossover stuff, lol :). Both are based in California, so I'm just going to keep dreaming ... I can see it now: "Let me alone with this suspect for a few minutes ... No, I do not need a car battery!"
