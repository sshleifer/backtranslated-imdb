A group of vile teenagers goes to a former funeral home to a former funeral home. They are trapped from the inside and possessed by demons who accidentally waken them. The obsessed teenagers start killing the others and seem to be led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade), who hovers and speaks with a really deep voice. The remaining teenagers, who were not yet obsessed, must ward off the demons and try to escape the house. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent horror movie with great special effects, which also includes Linnea Quigley's some nude scenes as usual) the guys from the eyeballs and a lipstick stuck in their nipples. There is also a scene in which a couple has sex in the coffin and a man gets his tongue bitten. This is a great movie that you can watch with some friends in the late evening while you eat pizza. The terrible spectacle and the cruel dialogue almost ruin him. Overall, I would give it a 7 out of 10.
