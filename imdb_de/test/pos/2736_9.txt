If you repeat a lie so often, does it become the truth? 15 Park Avenue is the story of an alternate reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The film is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers another masterpiece. Every actor in the film was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks incredibly convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls the scroll out of her age with such ease and maturity. Shabana Azmi is incredible as always. She plays the dominant and wild older sister of Mithi, who takes care of her sick sister and aging mother. She refuses, despite all her strength and courage, to accept that, she still feels lonely. This should be a very simple movie for Rahul Bose. The role was the least demanding and everyone could have taken the role. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was the most unreal part of the Park Avenue experience. It took a while for me to know that the movie was over. That confused me and maybe even disturbed something. But later it sank. My eyes are black. But if everyone says they are blue, will I still believe it's black ?!
