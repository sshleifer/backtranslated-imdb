Peter O'Toole gives a brilliant performance in this film. I have seen the original version with Robert Donat and I prefer the performance of Peter O'Toole and the film in general, although it is a musical. I've never really seen anything that pleases Mr. O'Toole that I do not like. He is a brilliant actor, a multi-talent who performs with passion and depth. Petula Clark also showed a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the role. It's a heartwarming movie full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. I will always remember (in paraphrase) the line in which Mr. Chips regrets that he has never given her children. Thank you for the opportunity to vote for this film and express my opinion.
