I have nothing good to say about this tasteful and heartwarming movie. I think the efforts of the film's director / writer are both courageous and inspiring. I loved this movie not only for the fantastic story (which needed to be told), but also for the way the actors delivered the story. This is not another flat "gay movie" that shows stereotyped characters in humorous situations. This was a memorable and flawless attempt to show people that love really knows no boundaries and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as ever. <br /> <br /> Another thing that touched my heart was how well I dealt with the emotions in this film that describe the coming out of one of the main characters. We all have to live through similar situations that live in the society in which we live and the sense of detachment from everything that is "right" and "normal." I thank you with all my heart for this fabulous and courageous story.
