This movie certainly deserves a place in horror, but not for obvious reasons. The horror of "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is not due to sudden tremors or great help from CGI bowels and bleeding; It is a psychological horror film that awakens the curiosity of the viewer from the beginning and creates an exciting aura of mystery and questions. And best of all, the end does not provide a clear answer, forcing the viewer to analyze what he has seen and decide for himself what really happened, the slow pace at which the movie begins, and expect not to jump out of your seat immediately. This is not a traditional hack-and-slash movie with orchestral bites that will not scare you of anything. "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is slowly building up an atmosphere of terror, a terror of the unknown and a fear of things that elude the end of the explanation. Even if the final conclusion becomes apparent, it is not so cumbersome and obvious that the entire film is neatly put together. The film requires the viewer to reflect on what he has seen, trying to reconcile it with the frightening discovery of the final scene. Some things are still open to interpretation, and this is one of the joys of watching a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The real fear of "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is not in shock or noticeable fear; It is a psychological, horrific horror that defies conventions and expands a genre to proportions previously unexplored by traditional horror film. It is no exaggeration to say that this film even differs from the so-called "Asian horror" genre. It would indeed be a mistake to reconcile "A Tale Of Two Sisters" with films like "Ringu" and "The Grudge". This film can be understood from various angles, some of which do not require suspension of credibility, others that fully accept the supernatural. Regardless of how you interpret this movie, it is one that requires openness to approach, rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions about Asian cinema or horror in general.
