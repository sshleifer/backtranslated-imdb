Not since J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5 has a television program captured the wonderful art of using a story arc for a television program. This is the best on TV right now! The characters are sympathetic and you can easily cling to them and take care of their well-being. The villi are the type you hate the most, and ask yourself what they plan to do next. And Brian Hensen's puppetry is the most innovative. Kudos to Rockne S. O'Bannon for a good job!
