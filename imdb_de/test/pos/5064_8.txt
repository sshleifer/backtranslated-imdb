Is torture ever right? No The answer is simple and absolute and no qualifications are possible. The reason, as this film has shown, is the effect of torture on society. The values ​​that have been fiercely contested in Western society through centuries of revolution and struggle mean that ALL men and women are allowed to live in a free and open society. One in which individuals are treated equally and treated as human beings with respect to their essential rights. To protect this society, institutions have been developed that deal with misconduct in an open, fair and honest manner. These institutions have been adapted and refined through generations of hard work. One could argue that these are the true foundations of democracy, as they belong to us all and make us all heard. If we allow undemocratic, inhuman acts to be done on our behalf, if we divide our society into those who have rights, and those who do not, we will reverse the work of our ancestors. Besides, we are all complicit and all guilty and corrupt. Whether those we accuse are guilty or not is not important. We are defined by our attitudes and our answers.
