I think it is definite. Writing is of such quality that English language learners should model their conversations after dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey (Bronson) and Kathryn Davis (Deborah Raffin) (later more on this character) is extremely clear and in a nutshell: Ms. Davis says, "I hope you like chicken, it's the only me knows how to do that, "to which Kersey deftly replies," Chicken's good, I like chicken. "If that's not English Grammar 101, I do not know what. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this woman Davis character: Kersey sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws herself to him and tells him she wants to see him "one last time" (this is only the fourth time they ever met) before moving to her sister's home in Binghamton, New York, to rid herself of the crooks. then he does not even bite an eye while her body burns in the street just minutes later. Kersey does not even say her first name throughout the movie. Not once. Never a "Come on, Katy" or a "That's a nice dress you're wearing, Kathryn" or a "Be careful, Katie, or the crooks will get you!" <br /> <br /> "Love" develops between the two, Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) has his ever-attentive eyes fixed on her. It's almost as if Kersey uses her as bait to get to Fraker as he uses the camera or the car. Sure, when Fraker bites, Kersey bites back hard ... in the most incredible sequence of events ever caught in the movie! The last fifteen or so minutes may be only the last thirty minutes of Delta Force in brilliance. And that gives Delta Force a lot of credit. In which other movie you can see Ed Lauter throwing Alex Winter out to get Charles Bronson back, a leader of the gangster who apparently calls a hotline to call neo-Nazi bikers, and flirts with Broadway dancers Net halter tops posing as street punks, all set to a soundtrack written by none other than Jimmy Page. If this is not the highest comedy, then nothing is funny. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are a thousand ways to formulate the unwanted comedy of Death Wish 3, but the only way to truly understand it is to look at it and judge for yourself.
