I was fortunate to see this remarkable short film by Joshua Leonard before its premiere at the 2005 Sundance Festival. In twelve short but exquisite minutes, Leonard takes us on a life-changing journey as he examines one of the most controversial social and ethical issues of our time. The film embodies an elegant direction, moving performances and an exciting story. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate as the two lovers. In his first step into a dramatic narrative, Leonard proves to be a director with a bright future. I think that this short time should be turned into a feature film. It's hard to describe talents, but as this debut film shows, you know it when you see it!
