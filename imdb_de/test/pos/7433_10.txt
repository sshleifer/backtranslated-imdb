Oh my God!!! Did you ever think they would make a movie about it? Well, I knew they would, but I did not know when !! and now it's finally here !!! when i received it yesterday through the post i put it into my (evil) stereo playing dvds and immediately i had this huuuuuuuuuuuge grin on my face when cloud appeared (looked good ... gorgeous !!) and they followed all the other fascinating characters from Final Fantasy the game! including tifa and aeris, my favorites .... (they are also pretty in it) the graphic kicked me out !!!! They were really great. so real to the last hair !!! The plot is alright, a bit confusing, especially since my version of the movie was in Japanese, but of course - since I'm a longtime fantasy fanatic - I did not mind - I read only the subtitles !!! All the characters speak the way they would in the game, and Reno and Rude are still ridiculous. The kite scene is also evil. just looks so good !!! anyway .... the graphics were fantastic ... the story, fantastic .... and the basic idea of ​​even having an ff7 movie ....... genius !!!
