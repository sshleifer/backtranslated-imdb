I saw this movie for the first time in 1980 and it touched a string that reminded me of an innocent time. The opening narrative, music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone. They love the movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was always the best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in an innocent and touching manner. This movie is high on the list of all my favorites, too bad it's not available on DVD or VHS anymore. The end was also wonderful. John Hancock has done a wonderful job to capture the essence of time.
