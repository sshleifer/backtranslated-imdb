The above summary is not intended as a slam against this movie because the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templer ("The Saint") meets a woman in need and helps her. He also helps a police officer who was accepted by bribe. Along the way, he encounters some interesting minor characters (this time Paul Guilfoyle as "Pearly" Gates) and while he uncovers this unconstrained mystery (none of them really), Templer is extremely learned and just cool! George Sanders is again the consummate British maker and he manages once again to make an outstanding B-detective film. Nothing special, but a well-known and airy product that will surely delight fans of the genre.
