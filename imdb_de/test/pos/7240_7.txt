What is often overlooked in Agatha Christie's stories is her progressive, anti-conservative stance on a range of topics - from the role of women to the effects of tradition to the belief in the supernatural. In "Nemesis" you can see many of these subtexts - but you can also find an old-fashioned, intriguing mystery that keeps you most of its length in the dark. Lifting "Nemesis" over other serial entries ("They do it with mirrors", "Paddington's" 4:50, etc.) is the fact that in the crucial moments before and after the murderer's revelation, you can actually feel the tension And finally, Jane Booker can guard my body at any time.
