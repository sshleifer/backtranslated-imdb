The effectiveness of this image was best demonstrated in the target group, the teenager. My 14-year-old son was so deeply involved in this film that I rate him much higher than his imitator "Mad City." It triggered a debate in our budget on issues such as peer pressure and loyalty rather than doing the right thing. For this alone, I rate this film with 10! Parents should watch it with their teenager and discuss it afterwards. <br /> <br /> I really liked the wise dialogue and the consistent action. I thought that James Remar was appropriate in his role, but the teenage actor really wore that picture. Other IMDB users have praised the performance of Corey Feldman, who is really excited. All in all, I give this picture my highest recommendation. Go and get this!
