After seeing this movie years ago, it never crossed my mind. I always thought that this was the best performance of Michelle Pfeiffer I have ever seen. But I am amazed at the number of negative reviews this film received. After seeing it again today, I still think it's powerful, moving, and does not care if it's "loosely based on King Lear." I now realize that this is Jessica Lange's biggest achievement I've ever seen - and she has been honored for much flatter efforts. A thousand acres is complex, human, alive and immensely moving, but does not place any of the key features on female leads with a touch of glamor or "sexiness". I do not think that this is well received in these times. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one reason for the film's overwhelming response lies in the fact that the author (Jane Smiley (screenplay (Laura Jones)) and the director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women, I know that I did not read a book written by a woman in previous years, I did not focus on it until years later. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie in the past or given it a try, try it yourself to look again, maybe you are ready.
