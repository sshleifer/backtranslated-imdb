I think that's the best Norwegian movie I've ever seen. It is the 40-year-old Andreas, who is hit by a subway line and suddenly gets into a strange city. However, everything is prepared for him here. He has a job, a house and clothes. At first, this city seems to be perfect, no death, no pain and no problems. Everywhere there are men in gray suits cleaning and repairing everything that does not fit into their definition of perfect. However, Andreas does not really seem to fit and starts to return to his old world and tries by all means to come back. <br /> <br /> What impresses me most about this film is the way the city looks so surrealistic, even though I've seen many of those places in real life that seem so distant. Another thing that contributes significantly is the performance of the actors. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is the perfect guy to play the confused and annoying Andreas. And all the other characters do a great job playing apathetically (sounds like a tough job, right?). The strong difference between Andreas and the others also leads to very amusing situations. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a fabulous movie. The plot may be a bit confusing, but the movie has such a great atmosphere that I would recommend anyone to see it. <br /> <br /> And I would not recommend listening to "ccscd212" as it seems to have seen too many commercial American films and is used to getting the moral on a silver plate. The way I see it there is not much in this movie to tell us that suicide is right or wrong. I consider it rather a warning of a direction that our society seems to be taking. But surely everyone can see a movie in their own way.
