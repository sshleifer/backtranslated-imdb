and there are not many in cinematic history. "Rouge" seems to be a bit of hope. Hope in man and life. But to say, only that can be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of this embittered judge and the twentieth, but wise model. Maybe this old and disappointing love story will not be repeated - there's the new couple with the young judge after the accident. But what should I say about this master of the camera? You can not miss a second of the movie because you have to see each of these faces. Kieslowski loved people, and it shows in the way the camera treats the actors. Mrs. Jacob and Mr. Tringtignant are perfect. Not only this film, but also the downbeat "Thou shalt not kill" and "A story about love", you can think about contemporary cinema as an expression of an artistic point of view. Too bad that the American public - the average citizen - could not see these films. At least they are not in the Maltese dictionary. And even the baseline does not know what to say about this unique man. abel posadas
