This reluctant and angry film is not only against the war in which it was made, but against the whole war. It does not matter what the war is. It could be the most emotional experience I've ever had with Ingmar Bergman's work. There are no sides to the two main characters in this influential drama, which is not anchored in any ceremonial symbolism as usual in Bergman's viewpoint, but clearly shows the people and their lives and shows what Bergman has already proved to be a person's response to a movie. <br /> <br /> His top regulars Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow play an internalized but bickering couple who were once orchestra musicians. Now they live in a weathered farmhouse on an island. Part of the construction frustration we share with these two people frustrates in detail that nothing seems to work in their house. They are not retired intellectuals either. They are a rather familiar marriage that has more or less left the life and is essentially non-political. They only get wind of distant rumors about a war that lasts forever. Ullmann is concerned about the danger to her life and the desire to give birth to children. Her husband von Sydow shakes off the shoulders that the war will pass them by. Her serenity is interrupted by screaming fighters flying low over her house, the killing of a parachute, the arrival of dubious troops, her inquisition, and finally her capture by the seemingly local side, but loyalty has long since broken. <br /> <br /> They are sent back to their homeland, witnessing unfounded destruction and suffering the adverse consequences of such distressing mistrust. This is one of Bergman's top favorite efforts. It is a study of a couple shaken out of their safe, self-confident life and injured by a manipulative despair. Both are tested to find out who they really are. Partly she lacks compassion, being too selfish and restless to be patient with his capricious outbursts of rage. His suppressed emotional problems have led to the suppression of the initiative and excitement that initially attracted them. The mighty last twenty minutes, sporadically interrupted by images of the overwhelming gray sky, are among the real emotions Bergman has ever filmed. All systems of dogma and belief are the antagonists in this very essential and downbeat portrait. The fundamentally clear personalities of Ullmann and Von Sydow's characters are hurled into the degenerate world of war because they are accused of being "sympathizers." However, the film shot on Bergman's little home island of Faro does not give any information about where or where it's set, who the two sides are and what they're fighting for. For an uninvolved civilian trapped in between, the knowledge base should be quite similar. Ullmann and Von Sydow are not sympathizers for the apparent enemy, but they are partisans for who seems to be their side. This reactive allegory of 1968 could target the ordinary non-combatant citizens of Iraq or Kosovo or Vietnam or Israel or Palestine or ...
