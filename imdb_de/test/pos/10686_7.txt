In this film, the astronauts exploring a newly discovered planet must deal with multiple dilemmas, and intelligently. The film approaches the main theme of the plot in a unique way and unfolds it gradually, though it can be guessed before. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, if sometimes stiff, as is the case in the late 60's. It can also be somewhat verbose and even melodramatic, especially after the theme of the plot reveals itself. Visually, it has a scene reminiscent of one of the "2001: A Space Odyssey" of the previous year, and rather dates the film. Some of the actors played a major role in the 1970s TV show "UFO", which is appealing and worth watching on DVD. <br /> <br /> Despite these small issues, the space itself is realistic and questionable. That was in 1969, the scenes in the cockpit of the spacecraft were also realistic. (Also look for video technology of the 1990s / 2000s!) One thing: I suspect that a love scene was cut off, but I can not prove it! It would have been a distraction anyway. <br /> <br /> Unlike most sci-fi movies, this movie is about the storyline, and worth a look. I'm happy to have this movie in my video library.
