Okay, I do not understand why people are so aggravated about this movie. I thought it would be the usual Amanda Bynes movie, but it was not. It was great. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay, so the acting was not the best, but I still thought the performances were great. You can also tell that the actors had fun with this movie. In other films that have surprisingly won prizes where the actors do not like to work on the film, you realize it. All the actors had chemistry, and that has been shown. <br /> <br /> A ton of people are tearing up the football skills the actors have. Yah, so they are not perfect ... overcome it! They are actors, not football players. I've played football all my life and I trust it's hard to learn, so stop ripping at the level of skills you have. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was stupid, but it was really funny. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum make fun of a situation without saying anything is funny. I laughed a lot in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all .. I love it!
