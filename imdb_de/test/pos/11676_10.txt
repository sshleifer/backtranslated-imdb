<br /> <br /> At first I looked through this documentary because I was interested in the topic he was presenting, the LA-Punks. <br /> <br /> I heard this music and I loved this music and I loved reading lots of the little zines that were made in the early 80's and were not so easy to reach in Finland. <br /> <br /> So if you do not like this kind of music why are you writing about it here? I like this kind of music, it speaks my soul, so I know punks from all over Europe and America, so why, who finds this music "disgusting", would like to comment on it at all? <br /> <br />
