I paid attention to it and enjoyed the very expressive expressiveness of leading actress Julianne Nicholson. I have no words to describe how much I am charmed. All actors and actresses played well. I especially noticed the solid, good character, who consistently anticipated the future - Andy Richter, who played Carl. I think the idea of ​​showing a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions and different counseling sessions is like the real world. Jay Mohr, who played Ed, the future husband, also played very real behavior. However, I would like to reiterate that Julianne Nicholson is able to offer a very rich repertoire of expressions, which of course is overwhelming for me. In fact, the theme that this film deals with seems to me to be very important and touches upon the meaningful thoughts of many people. I saw this movie several times and I was not bored. It keeps rising in my mind.
