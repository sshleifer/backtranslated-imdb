First, the story is not as simple as many previous reviewers emphasize, it's actually a very complex story, unlike Bergman's other films, which focus more on character studies. We have two main characters in skams, but since we're thrown in the middle of a war from the start, we do not know who's fighting and why. Everything is open to all solutions. This creates an enormous tension and makes every event meaningful. Throughout history, we are presented with numerous characters that become symbols of humanity, both its dark and its luminous side. We have the example of the innocent bystanders trying to get away during an absurd war, the cynical doctor who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor in the entire movie, the perverse opportunists who try the best out of a cruel one to make event (Bjornstrands character), the innocent dead children, the nameless figures almost turned into animals from the boat, etc. All are somehow through the eyes of Jan (von Sydow) and Eva (Ulmann) to see their characters are then more restrained in other Begrman films (En Passion) and this is precisely because history depends on how external events have the ability to radically change human nature. Bergman made this movie two years after Persona where the main conclusion of the only word innuengent voiced by Liv Ulmann's character is nothing. That's it: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter being nothing but a piece that encompasses all the pieces. But what about war? And especially the annihilation of the 20th century. In Persona, the only real emotion that Ulmann's character experiences is when she sees a victim of the Vietnam War turned into a human torch. In sketches this idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. In a nameless region of a nameless country (we just assume it's Sweeden), two factions that speak the same language are fighting an absurd war. Jan and Eve are two dreamer in the middle, but their dreams are interwoven in a kind of counterpoint. Jan is initially an idealist who is unable to respond to the world properly and is subject to the will of his wife. Towards the end, he transforms into a radically different personality capable of unmotivated murder, strong-minded and merciless murder (pay close attention to the suicide on the boat ... the simplicity of the deed is staggering). On the other hand, Eve gradually loses contact with reality, and in the end, she is completely filled with her own unfulfilled dream. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the entire movie delivers its message in a very effective way. Bergman puts the viewer next to the character and puts the camera in the car with the actors or in an extreme close-up behind the actor. Nykvist manages an extraordinary control of the camera, there are some masterful "handheld" effects that make everything look very "real". The pictures, with the characters captured by the army, look remarkably documentary. The script is minimalist, but the story is pretty complex in that regard. In fact, the entire film is paradoxical, it has an intensity in the subject that is in sharp contrast to the cold and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. Nothing is melodramatic here, there is no compassion, no hope and no apparent salvation. But as in Liv Ulmann's dream in the end, everything is so beautiful that you can not help but be astonished ... It was not so terrible because it was so beautiful!
