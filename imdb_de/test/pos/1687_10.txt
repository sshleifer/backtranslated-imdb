An incredible achievement! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I know that's saying a lot, but I bet you will not regret seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> It's great from the beginning to the last second. Acting (especially the mother - played by Judith Light) is so convincing that there are not many other films that I could compare, and it seems that it's impossible to feel anything for the people in this drama. > <br /> There are many, many films made every year, but if you have to choose to see just a few in your life, make one of them.
