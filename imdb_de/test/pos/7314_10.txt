The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I've loved. I love pretty much every one of the shorts they made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the short films are funny and also face many other great actors and actresses, many of whom have been in many short films! In my opinion, The Three Stooges are among the greatest actors of all time and are the weirdest comedy team ever! <br /> <br /> One of the funniest Three Stooges shorts is Men in Black. This short version features Bud Jamison, Jeanie Roberts, Phyllis Crane, Dell Henderson, Rhodes, Billy Gilbert and Ruth Hiatt. There are lots of fun scenes that most of the Three Stooges fans will love! In my opinion one of the most varied Three Stooges shorts. I recommend it to everyone!
