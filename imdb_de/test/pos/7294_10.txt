This is a very unusual movie that starts with a rich guy completing a brand new sports car and decides to take him for a round in town. A rich boy meets a poor girl in 'Mabel's Diner', a waitress, and the local friend gets very angry and the fight begins. There is a chase, and it seems that all sorts of problems occur, and the rich boy and the poor boy have to perform the community service, as ordered by the magistrate. The rich boy and the poor boy just do not get along and the rich boy wins the heart and soul of the poor boy's girlfriend. There are many walks in the woods and there are quoted poems and some very deep thoughts about life. The poor girl says: "Some people go through life and never find love, I can say that I have found love and hold on to it." You will need some handkerchiefs if you are delicate, there are many romantic scenes and I very much doubt if you will guess how this picture will end. The producer and the director had a good idea and finally finished a movie. If you like lifelike stories with poetry and very sensitive topics, this is your movie.
