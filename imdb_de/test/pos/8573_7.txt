If you've seen this movie (like me) for nudity, you will not be disappointed. But I could have done without the clumsy rogue or the bear. A bottomless nakedness could have been shown, but I think H.O.T.S. must be the best of his genre. <br /> <br /> It's not the kind of movie that could have been done today, and that's too bad, because it's the kind of movie that's worth watching in these days. I would do one every day to take thoughtless nudity over crucial points. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the DVD has no extras, but since they did not have any DVDs filmed that's understandable. I would have liked to know more about the shooting of the film, especially where the football game was shot in the end.
