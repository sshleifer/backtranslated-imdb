Great, deeply moving thriller with Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan. <br /> <br /> From the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion: this cat and mouse hardly miss a beat. <br /> <br /> Johnny To, once again working with composer Arthur Wong, constructs another opera shareholder who grumbles in the face of his contemporaries. The pictures of To are strong and moving. His cutting, combined with the extraordinary musical clues, is exemplary. You are in the hands of a master cinemas. <br /> <br /> The two sequences in which Andy Lau "hides" in a bus in front of the police, pretending to be a supple beauty (Ruby Wong), testify to Tos's uniqueness of directing techniques. <br /> <br /> Lau Ching Wan is strong and commanding as a harassed policeman, while Andy Lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging his father's death. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent filmmaking product, only marginally endangered by some poor English dubbing in a scene with the criminal orphan Lee.
