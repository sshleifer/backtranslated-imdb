I saw this early morning movie in the early 1990s when I was about 12 years old. I tried to find out what it was, and today I did it! I remember that I enjoyed it and ended up a bit freaked out when the movie was shown The boy's tombstone and his ghostly face! Could anyone leave me no, if I can get a copy of it, as I would like to see it again. I remember how the child was stuck in a Cornish tin mine and then made friends with a boy. I can not remember the kids being stuck there with miners, but it must have been. The boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who died while I worked there, I think.
