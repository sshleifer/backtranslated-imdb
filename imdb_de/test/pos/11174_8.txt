Lucasarts has pulled out yet another beauty from a seemingly bottomless bag with great games. If more evidence was needed to dominate this genre of the game, then that's it. Before the game was actually played, there was some concern over how the authors would maintain the gags after the first two games. There were many fears that it would be a bit thin. <br /> <br /> Play the game and see how quickly these fears are removed. From the introductory video with Guybrush in the boat (!) Until the final stages of the fair, the jokes keep coming. I was a big fan of the first two games and the other Lucasarts works (Day Of The Tentacle, Sam & Max etc), and this one can not miss the quality. You will not be disappointed. (Well, I was not.)
