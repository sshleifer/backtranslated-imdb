Can contain spoilers <br /> <br /> This historical movie was so refreshing. Although it may exaggerate the actual events, it shows the heartless nature of Emperor Qui, for whom he was later notorious. And there was not a single computer-generated person in it. I think it's great that China has produced such an epic film. The costumes and the scenery were beautiful, the services were also excellent. Would vs. Death is a major theme in this film and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I also enjoyed a small allusion to the Terracotta Warriors, a 3D map of China's capture with individual soldiers. Emperor Qui, of course, later buried with his life-size terracotta warriors. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the scene with the dwarf, he was a very interesting character, even if he only had a small scene. > <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
