This was absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Outstanding achievements from a wonderful a-list cast that will make you smile, smile, tear and back. <br /> <br /> I can not help caring for the characters. Mrs. Merkerson will blow you away, as well as the young man playing the young lead role. <br /> <br /> I also thought the set design was top notch. The viewer is placed in each epoch as it is presented. <br /> <br /> The music is also a great time. Nice selection for mood, time and place. The Blind Blues man is stereotypical but delivers some great songs. <br /> <br /> This is a great story that will survive many repeated visits. Take your time to see it!
