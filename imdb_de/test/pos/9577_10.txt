In the era of the Farrelly Brothers and the Jackass series, it's almost miraculous to have a movie made and performed by Americans. This ensemble was behind some other efforts, most recently "A Mighty Wind," which was so subtle that it seemed like a real documentary without the superimposition of entertainment, but "Best In Show" hits all cylinders. It is superbly staffed with some of the best American actors, Parker Posey, who radiates energy even when at a standstill, Eugene Levy as a tolerant everyman who is not even if he seems (or perhaps "uncomfortable" doormat). ). The brilliant stylings of Fred Willard, the unobtrusive performances of so many others, a trait that is not usually associated with Americans or American actors. One of the few humorous films that I can see again and again.
