Michael Haneke is known for his disturbing films like "Funny Games". This time he took over Elfriede Jelinek's "Die Klavierspielerin", which is probably her best work so far. Jelinek always writes about abusive behavior in families and especially about the oppression of women in a patriarchal society. Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) works as a piano teacher at the Vienna Konsevatorium. She still lives with her mother (Annie Giradot), they even sleep in the same bed (a bit strange). Erika harasses her students just as she is bullied by her mother, and secretly watches porn movies and plays with herself sadomasochistic games. A student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), falls in love with her, but she refuses to sleep with him. She wants to play her games with him, but he is disgusted. He reluctantly follows their rules, which is a catastrophe for both. Haneke has a very clear imagery, everything is filmed almost Spartan, so the complex characters and the story are upgraded /> <br /> people who do not know Austria well, may not know how important the setting for the story. Jelinek (as well as other great Austrian writers like Thomas Bernhard) suffer from the coldness and nonchalance in Austrian families and society. Austrians (at least the Viennese) are often unable to articulate their pains, desires, they suppress their emotions, so often enough there is no real love, affection and closeness in their families. In a society where it is more important to give society a perfect fa√ßade (even if it means protecting crimes within families, since Erika and her mother protect Walters rape from Erika from a scandal), as with her emotional It's probably not right to deal with problems. I'm surprised that Sigmund Freud founded psychoanalysis in Vienna. Erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother. Only when they share some emotions is she very violent and not at all affectionate. Erika replaces her hidden emotions with desires for violence, so that she can finally let go of emotions. But she does not have anyone who really wants to talk about her feelings, and in the end she has to stab herself to relieve her inner pain. <br /> <br /> Isabelle Huppert shows her best performances (also most of the other) actresses). With an outrageous face one often sees only a hint of emotion in her face, a quick smile, a look with her eyes. And in the end, her pain shows up masterfully without a single tear. <br /> <br /> Benoit Magimel and Annie Giradot also show strong performances, but the film belongs to Huppert.
