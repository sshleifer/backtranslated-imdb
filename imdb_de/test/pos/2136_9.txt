I only saw this movie a quarter of a century ago, but its effect has never left me, and I still remember how I responded to it. I was fascinated by the breadth and beauty of photography. I was amazed that an American studio could produce such a European movie with its slow tempo and fuzzy plot. The lack of strong characters felt like a mistake, but I rested over the utterly unnecessary end on the yacht, which looked like it was screwed down to create a kind of cohesion of action, and it completely contradicted the style The rest of the ship It was refreshing to see a Western that did not seem to have the brutality and exploitation that was so often the unfortunate detritus of the American Dream. The Western scenes and sets also had an authenticity that was completely new to me and that made the impression The Last Deadwood Series. The film has been massively cut for the American audience, and it is my true desire that Michael Cimino in these days of Director's Cuts will get the opportunity to make a new cut in the light of reflection - a cut that could make this sick movie into the masterpiece it had the potential to become I have now seen the original first cut and the relationship web is so much more useful, although Christopher Walken is mainly responsible for doing so. If only De Niro and not Kris Kristofferson had played the main role, there was still a big concern to create the reality and atmosphere to the detriment of a good script. Nevertheless, the camera work was so cleverly done that sometimes you could almost believe you were in the action yourself. And there were many special moments. Anyone who explored the hall in different languages ​​and tried to overcome their national differences and to seek some unity of action in the face of the impending catastrophe gave a real insight into the difficulties the US has been welded together, especially if the Threat of a combination of the old elite and the money. Nate's staggering approach to Ella when she first visited his cabin was in stark contrast to the violence that was to follow and was another. I had a special show with a large group of colleagues to see the new cut, and we all enjoyed changing the caveats. This revisionist version and much closer to the truth version of the events was probably too much for Americans when the movie first appeared released, but we all felt that it had a tremendous merit and that its place in cinematic history also for a fundamental revision was planned
