I was packed to see that many other people have enjoyed this movie as well. At first I looked at it when I was in my early teens, and then several times late at night a few times. Unfortunately not anymore. I'm almost 49 now and I wish it could be made available on DVD. Why not? The best Anthony Quinn role, no one would have been better suited for the role he plays - I have it to other movie lovers of similar age and unfortunately, nobody I know remembers it. As the daughter of a generation that lived through the Second World War and its aftermath (and I am deeply fascinated by what this generation went through), I appreciated that this film gave me a wonderful cinematic glimpse of some of the heartbreaking themes of the day. For classic final scenes, this film is an outstanding element.
