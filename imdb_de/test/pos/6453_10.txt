I thought I had seen every wrinkle the crime / gangster beat had to offer, but the combination of Garrett-Marcin-Hammett provides real thrills and surprises here, thanks to the inventive direction of Mamoulian, the atmospheric photography of Lee Garmes. plus remarkably sharp movie editing and flawless special effects. Brilliant drama also helps. Coop gives one of his most convincing performances as a timid bootlegger out of hayweed ruts (the kind of character development he should repeat in roles other than Sergeant York). Miss Sidney (center) in her first major role is also an eye-opener. The principals receive great support from Paul Lukas, Wynne Gibson and Stanley Fields as the heavys and even from Robert Homan's detective. Obviously, the film was realized with an extensive budget, brilliantly used in realistic, crowd-filled sets.
