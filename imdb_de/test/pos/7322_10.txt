This is a special Stooge Short that uses satire in conjunction with slapstick, a rarity. As already mentioned, the title and concept for this short film was borrowed from a movie from the same year with Clark Gable called "Men In White". It is essentially about the trials and tribulations of interns and their sacred reason for "duty and humanity". I have recently seen this and treated it almost like the Stooge version because it takes itself too seriously. Anyway, "Men In Black" is so well written, directed, and not to mention the original, it has not borrowed anything from Chaplin or any of the others, so it was nominated by the Motion Picture Academy for Best Short Film Comedy 1934. Some stinking short films called "La Cucaracha" surpassed it and stole the price. The brother-in-law of a producer must have been in the voting committee of the academy. "Men In Black" makes fun of the whole concept of the medical profession, as the Marx Bros. always did at that time. Maybe not a fair comparison, but I can do the Marx-Bros. see in this short description. In her feature film "A Day at the Races," there's actually a scene in which "medical things" are going on, causing them anarchy as usual. My guess was that this short film was judged in this regard, which is why he was even nominated. In fact, try this: Watch this short film first and then watch the Marxes "Duck Soup" or "Day at the Races" and see if there is not the same quality of comedy.
