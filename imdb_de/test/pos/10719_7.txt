I have seen this movie on three different occasions. The first time I was thrilled by this movie. He appeared to me as a very friendly movie. I hated this movie as a sentimental garbage on my second viewing. However, on the third viewing I confirmed my belief that this is a good movie. There is a lot of emotional power in this film, especially scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr. Kramer and Madam Kramer. There are scenes in which Meryl Streep, despite her fact, appears as a cruel person A beauty in real life. Justin Hoffman seems to be a lost hero who can not deal with his child's recent custody task. There was even controversy on the sets of this film. He only escaped injury when the character of Mr. Kramer, to show the intensity of his anger, decides to break a glass hard. Fortunately, nothing happened to Nestor. Kramer versus Kramer shows the destruction of a family structure. It also tells how fa mily needs to be serviced when children are involved.
