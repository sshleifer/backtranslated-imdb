It's quite surprising that this wonderful movie was filmed in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the black and white area at that time. The film deserves a lot of praise for taking this position, for having an extraordinary spectacle from its mostly lesser-known cast, and for the hyper-intelligent script that does not offend the public or take the white path to white racism. And with the rather modest budget and the short running time of the film he does amazing work! <br /> <br /> Juano Hernandez (an extraordinary actor who has played a supporting role in many films of the epoch) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south. The crowd could really care less about the details - they're just hanging on a hillside. And despite his commitment to the law, one lawyer in the city who has pledged himself in his defense is also guilty and does not want to know the truth - just hesitate to stop the investigation until they try to convict him , and then have a LEGAL hang! Fortunately, a young white man (Claude Jarmin) wonders about Juano's innocence and begins to find out the truth. At this point, the best character in this wonderful drama is introduced - played by Elizabeth Patterson (the old lady who later played Mrs. Trumbull in I LOVE LUCY). She steals the show single-handedly as a white person, not only with conscience, but also with the will and determination to fight for the black man. At a wonderful point in the movie, a mob tries to pass her by to come to the prisoner to kill him, but she is very firm, forcing her to retire. This rather complicated but intelligently written story contains much more, but I leave it to you to see for yourself. Take a look at it with your children, if you have a chance - there will be an amazing dialogue on how far inter-racial relationships have come in the past 50 years. Incidentally, 1949 was apparently a great year for Hollywood, which eventually dealt with prejudice against the breed, as Twentieth-Century Fox also released "Pinky" - an equally effective and powerful film about racism, between different races and even rape! Watch both movies if you can.
