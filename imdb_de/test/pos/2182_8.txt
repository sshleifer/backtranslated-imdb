I saw that last night on Turner Classic Movies (TCM). I had never heard of it before and was quite surprised that it was so captivating. <br /> <br /> Bogart is making a star as an urban cynical editor, reluctant to go along with his greedy wireless network boss this incisive "B" programmer. About 12 years ago he played similar cynical cities in terms of perfection in films like Deadline USA, Knock On Any Door, The Barefoot Contessa and The Harder They Fall. Bogie already had the star qualities. <br /> <br /> In order to improve the ratings and bring the program to a more popular level, WUBC, "The Voice of America," urges a radio miniseries on a woman 20 years ago was acquitted by a plea of ​​self-defense to kill her husband. Unwilling to be discreet to save the reputation of the woman and her husband, the station uses all sorts of cunning methods to show them as openly as possible. <br /> <br /> I also found it as a time capsule In the mid-1930s, it enlightened a great many male and female mores in the workplace. Although Henry O'Neill is unfamiliar beyond Henry O'Neill, the players were second to none. The players were consistently excellent and the direction was taut. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie at all (eg A Face.) Do not miss The Crowd, An Inspector Calls, etc.) for the opportunity to see this one. <br /> <br />
