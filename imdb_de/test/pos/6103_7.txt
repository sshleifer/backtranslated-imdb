(There are spoilers) Driving down a lonely country road on a rainy afternoon Joanna Kndall, Margaret Colin, is distracted for a moment and runs a little girl by bicycle along the roadside. Joanna tries to ask for help at a local gas station. Before she can give her name, Joanna hangs up the phone to go back to the girl and see if she's okay; It is when the nightmare for Joanna begins. <br /> <br /> Heartbreaking drama that can affect each of us as you try to do the right thing, but be influenced by the words and feelings of your fellow human beings. Back to the accident site, Joanna sees that she is being blocked by the highway police. Before she can tell them what happened and how she's involved, Joanna thinks about herself. <br /> <br /> What would have been a tragic accident first turns out to be a hit - spending time behind bars with Joanna if caught. Even worse, she has to live with herself when she saw the little girl's family almost every day she ran into Kelly Corey, Dallas Deremer, with her two daughters Mindy & Holly, Gretchen Esau & Kira visits the same school Posey Joanna's life is beginning to break apart as she tries to get the truth from her friends and family, not to mention the Eaton police, which involved her in the Little Kelly accident. <br /> <br /> It is easy to see how the words of her friends and neighbors and her husband Doug Drewbury have influenced the success of Joanna. It was these words that could not make Joanna admit what she was doing not only for her own care but also for her two daughters and her husband. The feeling that they are shunned for years by the people they know as friends and neighbors. <br /> Joanna, who is about to lose her mind, is trying to get her friend Nancy Grayson, Sherry Hursey, into Kelly's accident by trying to place her ear in Joanna's house Then she loses sight of what she is doing and suddenly stops. It keeps them from exacerbating an already bad situation. She does not want Kelly's accident, but also the innocence of Nancy on her conscience. <br /> <br /> Margraet Colin does an amazing job of torturing Joanna Kendall with guilt, and you can really feel her seeing her eat herself and not knowing exactly what to do. Since she initially wanted to make a number of misjudgments of the police, Joanna becomes a refugee of the law. When she finally did, Joanna became the most hated and despised person in Eaton. <br /> <br /> Since Joanna's husband is not on his own, he suddenly feels like smoking again or even has an affair. Never in a million years, Doug would have thought that Joanna was the one person who ran down little Kelly and let her die on that rainy road! The expression on his face, his mouth trembling as he found out the truth, said everything. <br /> <br /> The last minutes of the movie made it very hard for you to know what Joanna was going through, not to downplay the suffering of the injured Kelly Corey and her parents, and how to face the music now, what she does has done and must live with it for the rest of her life.
