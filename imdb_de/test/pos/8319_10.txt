This series, when the dinosaurus lived 65 million years ago. The dinosaurus looks very real and is very realistic when it moves. It is also very interesting how the climate changes. <br /> <br /> I am very interested in how the dinosaurs lived and died. I am also interested in the behavior of the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The color of the dinosaurs is also interesting to see and to discover. They think what color they had. <br /> <br /> Most interesting is why the dinosaurs died and what happened afterwards.
