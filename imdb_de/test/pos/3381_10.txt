After enjoying the miniseries "North & South", I could hardly wait for the sequel "North & South II". Then years later came Book III, "HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III". FINALLY came the last installment for the ongoing history of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so excited about this series that I scanned every part of the TV and then managed to addict my family and friends, and I saw it again every time someone new wanted to see them. My cassettes are old and I long for this trilogy on DVD. If you missed Book III, you are not satisfied and do not know how it all developed. Do yourself a favor and ask for this set on DVD!
