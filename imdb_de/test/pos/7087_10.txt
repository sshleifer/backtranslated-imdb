Written by someone who has been there, you can say, but only if you were there. Excellent performances by Meryl Streep (of course!), Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. <br /> <br /> Many people have said that this is a dysfunctional family torment. NOT being dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! You lose your family as you know it can be worse? People have to watch this movie. So when faced with this nightmare, they may change how they do it. Maybe they will see that the father refuses valuable time, which he will never get a chance again. Maybe you realize how hard it is to die or to see someone you love. You have not missed the nightmare, it's hard to forget.
