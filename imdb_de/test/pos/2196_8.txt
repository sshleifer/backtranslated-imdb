Last year, I fell in love with the Tim Burton version of Sweeney Todd. I wanted to look at the other versions of this musical and found them in the library. Although I think Burton's is the best, probably because I like film a lot better than theater, this is still a great production of the story. I have not seen any of the other versions, but I try to get my hands on them. <br /> <br /> After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd, I can hardly imagine anyone in the role unless George Hearn does a fantastic job. Angela Lansbury is great as always and the vocals are fantastic. I found myself singing along. This is a game you do not want to miss, but try to see it before you watch the movie so you do not have a biased view like mine.
