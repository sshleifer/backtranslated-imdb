Some people are born with grieving souls, singing their song one by one, until they meet another soul that is as tormented and / or bitterly sweet as their own, and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look at two tortured souls intertwining for a moment of understanding and oneness, only to be torn apart by the differences in the unity of their pains. Death is figuratively and literally explored. It's what happens when a soul is dead or similar to being alive, too awake for reality. It is the life that you have NOT imagined behind the eyes of passers-by. This film explores the aching pain in all of us, frowning under the happy facade and the pain underneath. The ugly instinctive animal thoughts and actions become honest and matter-of-fact, and then Bechard disperses unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix, as both know that both dwell within us. Bechard, the writer, is an experienced observer of the human condition. Because of its non-judgmental attitude, life is presented in a light that we often protect our eyes, but want to see and understand. As a director, he focuses on the nuances of the actor's spirit, which shines through the character he plays to recognize the personal familiarity of the actors with the emotions evoked by each situation. This is the most accurately written and directed character representation of a man and a woman I have yet to see, though the encounter between the two characters is unlikely to be the "normal" encounter. In every lyrics, the characters would pour their hearts if they were able and strong enough. It is the real voice of any character sung by the beauty, pain, talent and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode in the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those who have problems - those who admit we have problems and those who hide us. <br /> <br /> I always like to explore the dark side of life with Mr. Bechards two fascinatingly creative and realistic view of the life and the characters turning in it.
