Although this film is in the upper English upper class, it is a simple story of a torn apart couple. It's a little old fashioned and an adaptation of "A Way Through the Wood", a Nigel Balchin novel from 1950 (once very popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who despite having an Academy Award for the screenplay of "Gosford Park" himself has a somewhat anachronistic personality, wrote the script and directed (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version I've seen, there's a most revealing audio commentary by Julian. His main focus was on getting his characters right and on the whole he was successful. He was helped by two outstanding performances by Tom Wilkinson as James, the sewn City attorney, and Emily Watson as an attractive Ms. Anne. He also kept it short; The running time is only 80 minutes. James and Anne have a townhouse in Chelsea and a comfortable former rectory in Buckinghamshire. Anne is a few years younger, but they are childless. Externally they look happy, but James, one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control freak. Just down the street is the aristocrat of Hon. William Buel, who does not stand for bourgeois morality, and he's more than happy to take advantage of that. But there is one complication, a traffic accident in which an elderly cyclist on a country road is overturned by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover like the Hon. Bill is. Soon, James, Anne, Bill, and the victim's widow (who happens to be James and Anne's cleaning lady) conspire to hide what really happened. The main focus is on the caustic effect of all this on James and Anne's relationship. <br /> <br /> The third person in this trio group, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. As for the casting, his lazy, superior manner is right, but somehow he does not quite go there. This is partly because he should be ill at times and he looks good when he is ill and vice versa. The part seems to be underdeveloped. It's interesting that as the father of Bill, who has only one significant scene, John Neville manages to beautifully establish his character in the time he has. <br /> <br /> The world of five-star hotels and upscale restaurants is well remembered. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people can convince themselves that the Edwardian era still exists. Basically, the movie is about what a couple brings together and what it rips apart. Nigel Balchin was in the process of separating the marriage when he wrote the book, and Fellowes is committed to bringing the atmosphere to life. As he says, it's a pretty free adaptation, but the central theme is the same.
