A short Three Stooges, this one with Shemp. Of all the shemp I've seen, this is my favorite performance of him in a stooges shorts. The basic idea is that Shemp will have to marry that night at six o'clock if he is to inherit the half million dollars left by a rich uncle in his will. Shemp goes in search of a bride, but finds a harder path than expected, until they learn of his inheritance. The best parts are Shemp Shave, Shemp and Moe in a phone booth and Larry on the piano as accompaniment to Shemp's singing practice. Also, the order in which Shemp is confused as Cousin Basil and his result turns out to be hilarious.
