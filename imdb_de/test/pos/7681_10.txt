Of course, the Gershwin family is sure that this is one of the greatest American operas. Thousands of fans of this opera are waiting to be released on DVD. Please do not be so stubborn, give us a break. Think of the joy and wonderment you can bring to a hungry audience for quality music by releasing this great GEM. Do not wait until the film is beyond repair. The cast is first class, the music is just great, we need beautiful music in today's world. It must never be filmed again with such a great cast. With today's home theater systems, wonderful sound systems, and the need for great music, I'd like to ask the Gershwin family to rethink and publish this great movie. Many Thanks
