Of course, I'm a bit biased, but for the time, this was the most accurate representation of Marines ever shown on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I was at Camp Pendleton and I was training infantry when Webb brought his crew to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to attend. It took about two or three days, as far as I can remember. <br /> <br /> Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and businesslike. <br /> <br /> While filming our short scene - which seemed to me forever 18 years old - Webb was very conscientious of doing things right (marine stuff), and he did a good job with one exception - the scene where a recruit wore sunglasses. Never for a couple of reasons. <br /> <br /> I have a video of the movie and will bore my grandchildren if I can get them to sit still for a few seconds while I show them their papay when he was a young stallion and part of the greatest fighting power the world (no boasting, only fact). What astonished me at the time was how well the real marines performed their acting roles. That was before I realized that DIs need to have some acting genes to do their job. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've seen since then is the first part of Full Metal Jacket, and this part is superior just because of the bad language. When the DI was made, the cursing was not allowed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of profanity, it is still a great movie to borrow. <br /> <br /> Ooooo-rahhhhh !!!!! <br /> <br /> Semper Fi, do or die
