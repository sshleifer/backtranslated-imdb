I really hate musicals because music numbers just start from the sudden and spoil scenes, but this one is totally different - it's just brilliant. Plot may not be a challenge to viewers, but the simplicity of people's life stories makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> I've seen him at least a dozen times and yet I'm not tired of the plot, characters or music (I love the soundtrack - it's the only soundtrack I really wanted and probably the only one stay who I owe). <br /> <br /> For me, it's a must-see type of movie, great characters with entertaining songs and much to think about after the movie ends.
