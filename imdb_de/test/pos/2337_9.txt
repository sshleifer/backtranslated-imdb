I would like to thank you for giving me the chance to be one of the first to watch the movie. It really grabs you. John Paul finally gets to see the light and makes a living not being tied to his mother's apron strings children leaving their home older, but I would not say wiser) with very sad parents who have no life of their own and who make their lives a misery wider audience. I would also say that the other actors also played brilliant roles. It's such a deep movie and very moving.
