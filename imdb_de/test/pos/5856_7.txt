Well, I know that Sandra Bullock produced this movie, but she has to learn that sometimes certain sacrifices have to be made to advance the story ... as if one would not try to make the whole movie about her character! <br /> <The story is about two high school students (one rich and popular, the other smart and anti-social) who formulate a plan for murder and follow the number ... just to see if they can get away with it , State Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case. The boys have planted evidence, created alibis, and corrected them so well that the police fall during the whole incident. But Sandra feels that not everything is as it seems. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a great little Hitchcock thriller, but the movie spends too much time getting to know Sandra's character better than focusing on the real crime. You see, something happened in her past that haunts her throughout the movie. And we learn all about it ... ALL about it. It gets pretty boring after a while, especially if you're in the midst of an interesting murder investigation and then have to stop this investigation to find out what's happened to her in the past. Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the true winners of this film. They play their characters convincingly and with the right amount of malice. If the script had been more concerned with these characters and the detectives stayed there to do their work, this could have been an extremely entertaining thriller. As it is, most of the thrill is lost. They would have had to cut out all that stuff with Sandra's character and make a separate television movie for the Lifetime Channel. But I digress. Still, it's still an entertaining movie. I recommend this movie ... but wait for the video / DVD.
