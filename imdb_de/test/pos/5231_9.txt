The details in The Big Trail were so incredible that I felt that the movie was made at the time he portrayed him. I've never seen cars that were so real! They were big, loaded with accessories and even felt like they were filled with details under the screens that were never seen. Every filth, every scratch, every splinter was there. Today's computer technology could never recreate the scenes of the numerous wagons as they move across land or county to ward off Indians. The wagons were real, individual vehicles, each with its own team of horses or oxen. The actor's clothes would not have felt more authentic. Except for John Wayne's suede outfit and the beautiful dress by Marguerite Churchill, the clothes looked very ordinary, tattered or dirty in an authentic way. Many of the actors and actresses were born before electricity and plumbing were common, and they must have felt comfortable in the area. All Indians were real Indians and no white, browned extras. Women of the old west had to be robust because there was a lot of work. In each scene, where the work of the wagon train people is shown, women are shown chopping wood, transporting tree trunks, etc. This realism looked so natural that it did not look like a statement about the woman's role of the day Fact of survival. <br /> <br /> The act of revenge and romance is played well. Nothing is exaggerated or exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Something was lost in the 1930s in Hollywood. As much as I love the wrong scenery and the controlled environment of old movies, The Big Trail feels like a real thing. The more I see big budget films of the quiet time, the more I like them. I can imagine a few thirties films I've seen that are the size of the best of the twenties. If there were home videos at the time of the waggon trains, they would look like The Big Trail.
