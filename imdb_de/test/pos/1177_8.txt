Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, both of whom are sadly missing, prove once again that they are a team focused on bringing fun moments to the screen. This movie is just another example. <br /> <br /> This time, they play two brother-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board. <br /> <br /> Of course your boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin who just harasses these boys. It's funny how Lemmon gives Matthau a short dance lesson and how he dances a seditious rumba with boat owner Rue McLanahan. Too bad that the dance teachers Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor are given so little to do, but their parts demand that. Matthau falls in love with Dyan Cannon, on board with her gold-digging mother, the usual, outrageous Elaine Stritch. You do not know, Matthau has no money either. The widowed Lemmon falls in love with Gloria De Haven and looks prettier than ever. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will be another honor for their famous careers.
