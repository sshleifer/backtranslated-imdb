First, let's call this movie what it is: <br /> <br /> 1. It's a feel-good movie with a message. <br /> <br /> 2. The acting is just fine, the dialogue is a little better, the production value pretty good. <br /> <br /> 3. Rugby scenes ... just walkable. <br /> <br /> But here's the trick: this is not something that Hollywood invented, and it's not trying to be a very accurate portrayal of the sport. Instead, it's a pretty good portrayal of mostly real people under real circumstances and a real act. Sure, they could have done a better job to represent the sport, but my voice is that it does a pretty good job on what it's up to. <br /> <br /> (And fwiw, I can not think of many football, baseball, hockey or football films that are either true to sport ... Come on ... Bull Durham?) <br /> <br /> I'm not a rugby player (I was a wrestler) But I graduated from highland, visited '86 -'90 and occasionally trained with the rugby guys. However, my brother-in-law David was one of the founding members of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His younger brother Billy played, I remember, next year.) If you're interested, there's a Highland rugby site on highlandrugby.net that covers the team's history.) <br /> <br /> As I was there, the club had been around for about a decade and had long been a name for excellence. It is a fact that they focused on "broad" training topics: dedication, honor, discipline, effort, no tactics. I thought the rugby guys I knew were a bit "down" in the head, but I think I was just a bit jealous. They were dedicated to the belief system that supported Gelwix. <br /> <br /> In terms of the mentioned "cultural mixes" it might be interesting to note that I was there while I was there. In the 80's one of the larger schools in the city was closed - the South High School - and their students were split into the other 3 SLC elementary schools. To be honest, Highland was pretty white bread before the '80s ... I have a picture of the team from 1977 (I think) showing a white white club. On the other hand, South High was a much more racial school before the school closed: I had a couple of friends from the South, a Tongan, a Samoan, and, as I recall, there were a lot of Island Nation players out there '88 -'90 have connected. I do not think anybody questioned the team's credibility in adopting Maori traditions (or other cultural traditions): If there was one thing that was obvious about these guys, it was they taking the walk , <br /> <br /> And as for the team's strength compared to the world's best college teams: Yes, it's true that US rugby on average overall is not particularly representative against the best elsewhere. There are exceptions, but hey - it's a simple fact that rugby does not have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the diverse traditions of excellence in the US that occur in other countries. <br /> <br /> Judge Highland on his merits: <br /> <br /> - the * only * team that qualifies for the USA Rugby National Championships each year in the organization's 25 years of existence. <br /> <br /> - a profit record of 392 wins, 9 losses. Read that again ... the best coach in all US sports history. <br /> <br /> - regular international tours. <br /> <br /> - some convincing victories against some legitimate international teams. <br /> <br /> Are you the best in the world? Maybe a few years, probably not most ... but they are pretty good on a constant basis. And it's disrespectful for the game to blow it out when Highland Rugby is the best sports ambassador in the US.
