After the collapse of Yesilcam (Turkey's response to Hollywood) in the mid-1990s, few but the most forward-looking observers could have foreseen such a turmoil in the Turkish film industry based on the work of ex-photographer Nuri Bilge Ceylan. <br /> Uzak is the director's third film and, with its two previous images (Kasaba and Clouds of May), is a kind of trilogy that follows similar themes and techniques. The film finds Mahmoud, a commercial photographer who lives alone in a small apartment in Istanbul, which is visited only occasionally by his rugged, married lover. Yusuf, his nephew, left his village house after closing a factory and losing his job. The younger man stays with Mahmoud, unsuccessfully seeking work in the city, drinking in caf√©s, and nervously looking at young women he never meets. <br /> <br /> The film title is translated as "Distant," and the film miraculously illustrates every possible connotation of the word; Yusuf's physical distance to his home, Mahmoud's emotional distance from the world around him, and the generation distance between the two men. Ceylan's films seldom contain heightened drama, instead, full and rich characters can evolve from the inside to tightly framed static footage. He is a director, producer, author, cameraman and co-editor and plays many roles friends and family. It is expected that such a limited, isolated approach to filming will result in films that are difficult to infiltrate and connect with for most viewers, making Uzak's undisputed humanity all the more impressive. Ceylan, however, is a better cinematic formalist than a playwright who took over the reign of masters of earlier film language such as Ozu and Tarkovsky. Having seen Uzak, I can imagine that it is less suitable for this task.
