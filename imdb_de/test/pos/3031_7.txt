"The Cell" is a journey into the head of a serial killer and I mean that literally. The film is about the journey, about the world she shows on this journey, the destination does not matter. In my opinion, this journey through the mind gives such beautiful pictures that other things do not matter, as long as they do not distract. In fact, the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the head of a catatonic boy. How that works is not important, but it looks very much like virtual reality. She and other scientists, including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), believe that this method could work. Catherine penetrates into the boy's head and talks to him in a world completely created by the boy. She hopes that she can let him do things that will eventually lead to results. <br /> <br /> The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) has just unloaded the body of one of his victims. FBI agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) deal with this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears, and at this point Carl can be pursued and captured after a forensic examination of the dead body. There are two problems. 1. Carl has just fallen into a coma; he was ill for a long time. 2. His house and the house with his last abducted victim are not in the same place. In a sense, this part of the story is pretty much normal. <br /> <br /> Things will be interesting again soon. To find out where the girl is, Catherine has to go into Carl's mind. This is dangerous for many reasons. In short, Carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. When Catherine starts to believe that Carl's mind is the real world, then her mind can convince her body; She could die in Carl's mind. A tape with the death of the last victim, a fate that this girl will have in about twenty hours, ensures that Catherine will try to get the place out of Carl's mind. <br /> <br /> It's the journey through these sick people This makes the movie more than worth seeing. Director Tarsem Singh, who previously made music videos, goes back in some ways to these music videos. Each space in the imaginative world is another short clip made up of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me, the visual style felt completely new, just as 'Three Kings' had a new visual style the year before. If you can do something like a movie, 'The Cell' will not disappoint. Fans of the thriller and the horror genre, however, can still enjoy this movie. The story itself without the big fantasy world is good enough for that. I think you have to be open-minded, of course events in our real world are not (yet) possible. Still a very entertaining movie with beautiful ideas that looks great.
