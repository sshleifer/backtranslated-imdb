I love meatballs! Great characters and poignant situations make him loved. Bill Murray is hysterical and you have to love the 4-mile trail race in the end! A total classic and for over 20 years one of my favorites. It brings back good memories of the camp and deals well with the experience of being rejected by foolish peers and the empowerment that a sympathetic adult saves. Tons of good one-liners and a whole bunch of Wacko advisers. This is the kind of movie where you repeat key words among friends for years. Also, nothing very crude and what a sweet soundtrack from the late 70s to produce just the right amount of nostalgia. I can not say enough about meatballs. It is a classic. Be warned! All sequels are stinking bombs that have just earned the naming rights for marketing. They have no connection to Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.
