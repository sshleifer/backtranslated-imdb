My kids loved this movie. We saw every opportunity we got. We saw it as a family and each one of us enjoyed it. It was a movie that you could see without uncomfortable spots you would have to explain to the younger one. My boys loved this movie and would like to see it again. Even after all these years, they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. All my boys had a crush on her. They loved her as a Pink Power Ranger, which is why we first watched this movie. (As you can see, I walk a bit to fill the LOL lines). But seriously, it's a funny movie and it's worth to look at it. Disney, please give us a DVD or a replay!
