As a big fan of horror, especially in the Asian horror, I have seen tons of movies, but this is outstanding. Why? It has an action (which unfortunately is quite rare in horror movies). The actors did a good job. It feels like a real documentary (though not). It does not get boring for a moment. The director cleverly combines the plot with the files of a certain Japanese magic cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but is still believable). It reminded me of the similarly great movie "Forbidden Siren". <br /> <br /> For me, the only annoying thing about this movie was the character Hori, the psychic, but that's subjective br /> I recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
