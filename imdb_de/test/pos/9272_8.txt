Do you remember Greg the Hare? It was this show that started on the Independent Film Channel but became a full-fledged sitcom about Fox. My cousin and I found it rather funny, beyond the premature notion that puppets use TV-PG material. Puppets Who Kill occurs in a similar universe in which puppets live in the same world as humans and how we ourselves take on our own jobs and lives. Let's just say, if you can not handle this, you should not bother looking at PWK, because this show is a profile of 4 dolls who fell out of the good grace of society due to drug abuse, hedonism and violent crime and ends in only one half of the house There's plenty of violence, sex and bad language (that's the way US Network TV would never get there). As if sociopathic puppets were not enough, the fact that this is happening in Canada makes it even more disturbing (by the way, the government pays for it), and I think every American television viewer would demand such a denied cable TV feed like this. I do not know where you can get it in the US except Satellite TV, but I would advise you to try it. Really funny stuff. (It airs on Comedy Network in Canada)
