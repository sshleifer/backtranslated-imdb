This is a romantic comedy, so a fairy tale, but an unconventional one. Cinderella does not live in the ashes, but lives in an overstaffed castle in the suburbs with a handsome husband who is not a prince. She finds her prince, but he does not look so good. Instead of a castle, at least initially, she gets a tiny walk in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Pfeifer, Stockwell and Ruehl lead a cast full of accomplished, if somewhat exaggerated, characters. <br /> <br /> Demme reaches the highest level of filmmaking in my mind. He is creating a world I want to move into - a neighborhood of Manhattan and a life in the street where life and community abound. I'd like to know what other films the people who fit this movie hate. I'm always looking for a lot of laughs and beautiful places where I can "live" for at least an hour.
