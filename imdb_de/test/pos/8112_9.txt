This film was put into production before the beginning of World War II, but it was only released when it had already started. With great fascist sympathy in the US and Chaplin, who was suspected of being a communist sympathizer, The Great Dictator was a very courageous undertaking. Such risks in filmmaking - thinly veiled political statements - would be almost unthinkable today. Imagine the fallout if someone were shooting a satirical film that criticized US foreign policy today? <br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious, poignant and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin is pleading for the end of madness, but it's already too late - for him and for us. A must if you are interested in history, film, politics or saddle as an art form.
