I saw this movie when it was first released in 1973, and I really liked it. Since then, I've been looking for a video that I've never found so far, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. I'm sorry to say that it does not last. This glamorous version can not rise to the production level of 1937. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is, when he's heard by himself, and I even bought a CD of it, but to my liking, this mysterious and compelling story is not good. Only does not fit. Michael York is lost here. Sally Kellerman performs well, but Olivia Hussy is just ridiculous and not worth the haul. The best performance is Charles Boyer as the main lama.
