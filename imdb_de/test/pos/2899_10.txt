Personally, I consider "The Egyptian" in an extremely favorable light. <br /> <br /> It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian film commentator and critic named Bill, known for his insight and broad vision of people & places & especially movies. This film was a perfect fit and I appreciated his commentary and his enthusiasm for the film, which became all the more evident when I saw him, as I literally got involved by the minute, on a minute-by-minute basis, beyond his introductory comments was years ago. <br /> <br /> For me it was driven layer by layer within half an hour into a fascinating and fascinating production! Yes, I am aware of its shortcomings! But it was so tempting? the young man of idealism who learns from his father and is inspired by him? The farmer was treated like garbage in his suffering? the opportunist friend, however, flawed, but still loved by his friend, the central character Sinute ?? and of course a flawed hero like so many people in all societies and in all times? but adorable and worth the love! Yes, I believe in a Christian God, but I also recognize the rights and the respect that EVERY human being should have with a good heart that does not or will not respect the rights of his fellow human beings without reason. Therefore, I support this film and its presentation of a man with a good heart and conviction in his belief in the sun god to whom he was dedicated. Such people are always welcome in my world view, and hopefully in many other areas as well. <br /> <br /> Also, the drama in the following movie, which I've often looked at as sure as it touched my heart and soul, as sure as it seems to upset critics in its era. It is fascinating to watch the fights, the sadness and the love of Sinute, the doctor! When I look at it again, I always remember my friend in my heart, Bill, the film critic who dared to fight ALL the critics who were against him long ago. He added criticism to many critics? that they make statues to honor stars, on the canvas or in history, but no statues to honor critics! Moreover, every time I contemplate a SUPERB & TOUCHING spectacle, I remember a beautiful and well-presented drama that was not only relevant to the 1950s or a bygone era. It was meant for YOU & ME, temporally and locally, for every man and woman and every child and for his personal pursuit of love and freedom, and overcoming obstacles to misunderstanding and gross injustice and tragedy, the simple beliefs of many religions it seems too many to consider as a reason for war! Take one night away from invitations or unjust violence, from bigotry and relentless attacks on others who have been unlawfully executed, and consider the merits of this offer. Not the sun god or a power that always proves to be so knowledgeable. Let yourself be flooded by this EXCEPTIONAL movie, like waves on a beach, like the passing hands of time? as if life were meant. And maybe you will be carried into the world of possibilities! Lost offers no more! 9.9 out of 10!
