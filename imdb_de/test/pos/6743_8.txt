In April 1947, New York City was in an epidemic crisis. Eugene LaBar, a carpet importer from Mexico, arrived in the city carrying the deadly pox virus. He stumbled out of a bus, complaining of fever and headaches, and soon died in a Midtown hospital, but not before he had infected a dozen pedestrians. The damage had already been done; For the first time in decades, smallpox hunted the streets of New York. The health authorities in the city have acted quickly to isolate those affected and stem the virus. They ran a free vaccination campaign that immunized over six million New Yorkers against smallpox. Thanks to their rapid response, the virus was locked up with minimal loss. The outbreak, however, must have left an indelible mark. Several years later, two film noir thrillers with similar themes followed, in which doctors had to track down a single contagious carrier in megacities: Elia Kazan's "Panic in the Streets" (1950) and Earl McEvoy's budget movie "The Killer That Stalked New York ( 1950) ". McEvoy's film unfolds in an unbelievable docu-drama style. Reed Hadley's tale sounds as if he had been dragged straight from a newsreel and had told facts as if he was reading the official police book. This technique sometimes feels a bit cheap, but fortunately, the narrative is largely confined to the book's bookends and also provides an explanatory clue in the action breaks. The "murderer" who persecutes New York in this story is not a carpet importer from Mexico, but the beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes), who has just arrived from Cuba. Within days, Sheila has two parties that pursue them independently: a finance minister (Barry Kelley), who wants to arrest her for smuggling for crimes, and a medical team (led by William Bishop) who identified her as the cause of the smallpox outbreak. As in "Panic in the Streets," an otherwise routine manhunt is given a heightened sense of urgency, especially if the persecuted initially have no idea of ​​their suspect's identity or appearance. <br /> <br /> 'The Killer That Stalked New York manages to get around its low production budget most of the time. Apart from a few lines of dialogue ("We have to stop!"), Dr. Wood calls out at some point as if he is making a difficult decision), the filmmakers and actors allow the story in a realistic, engaging way Way to unfold. In this regard, the low budget may well support the film's intent and require a documentary style that enhances the immediacy of the outbreak scenario. Evelyn Keyes excels in leadership and shows stubborn resilience in the face of unimaginable agony. At the end of the film, she seems so brutally incapable of her illness that it's almost painful to look at her face. Apart from the virus, Charles Korvin is the main villain of the play, as Sheila's greedy and eager husband, who will surely get everything that comes to him. And if all the nurses looked like Dorothy Malone, perhaps the pox catching would not be such a bad break.
