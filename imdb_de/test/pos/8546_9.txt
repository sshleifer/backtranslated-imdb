Anthony Quinn controls our hearts and our compassion. He portrays a Romanian farmer with a below-average IQ who is urged by his wife to do more. It is World War II and the Nazis have conquered his country. He soon digs into his wife's eyes and digs anchorages. The Nazis have different ideas. Over the next few years, we watch the events with his naive eyes, but he just wants to go home. His manipulations and misfortune bring him into further hot water. Finally, we see his picture on the cover of "Der Spiegel" without fault as a perfect Aryan. The war ends and the Allies take him to court for war crimes. But our farmer only wants to return to his wife.
