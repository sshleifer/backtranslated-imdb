My one-line summary indicates that this is not a good movie, but that's not true. I really enjoyed the movie, but I probably expected too much. <br /> <br /> Adele, who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon, has not turned out to be a very nice figure. She is fleeting and irresponsible, which would be to an unpardonable extent if she did not have her enormous love for her daughter. This is the one thing she can do. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who has made up so many of her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14 to 17 years old. Of course, Natalie Portman is the perfect choice to play Anna, as she never seems to be 14 to 17 years old either. Portman pulls this role off so easily that you almost forget that she has not been making films for 20 years. But even with the two solid clues Wayne Wang never seems to attract the crowd as much as The Joy Luck Luck and even more with Smoke. Although I have not read the book, the film feels like it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen, which can affect the emotional sharpness of the story. I enjoyed the movie for the fun of seeing two wonderful actresses at work, but I've never strayed into the experience and have never had anything to do with their plight.
