This is a decent effort for a B-movie martial artist. Ian Jacklin, a former North American cruiser who is a kickboxing champion, leads the way and gets on well in the action scenes. The muscular Matthias Hues gets in this film the chance to add more to his personality than martial arts than in all his many others. If you are a fan of The Teutonic Titan, you can rent this movie now! <br /> <br /> Renee Griffin is also notable as the romantic interest in this movie. She starts with her posture, but soon warms to the hero and they do "The beast with two backs" in a very stylish way. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes are good in American tradition (NOT acrobatics from Hong Kong.) here!) with added realism, as Benny plays "The Jet" Urquidez himself as John Larson's (Jacklin) coach. All in all, this movie seems to have more sub-plots than most in its genre MORE of a story.
