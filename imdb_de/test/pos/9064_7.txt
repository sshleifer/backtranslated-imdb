This movie was original in an unoriginal way. Although the topic of suicide and psychiatric institutions has been tackled in many films, it has always been about treating the patients and making them better with the help of the doctor. In this film, however, we follow a depressed man who falls in love with a suicide bomber She stops at nothing to make her happy, even if she does not care about happiness at all, she just wants to die. This was a very interesting sweet romance comedy that is nothing short of fun. This is fun to find out if you ever have the chance, you just have to be open to the material. Overall, I give a 6.4, I've just chosen 9 to get the rating higher :)
