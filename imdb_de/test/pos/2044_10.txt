I love this movie...! I saw it 1000x on DVD and can not say enough about it. It has everything, comedy, great action and incredible stunts / FX. Samuel Jackson steals the show here big. I do not think there is not a moment when he is not funny! "Everyone knows that if you make a guess, they'll make you an ass and umption" !! The f / x are great! The bridge / truck explosion is unbelievable, even if the sound is not great! When Samuel drives out of the truck, the sound is a bit off, I think and what he says is priceless !!! For those of you who own it on DVD, set the tone in French !!! It is halary !!! Even emotional moments are great when the villain finds out that Sam / Charlie's daughter is his, great ... This is a great movie that no action fan can do without ... I recommend Cutthroat Island ... Apart from all that negative advertising, it occurs !!!!
