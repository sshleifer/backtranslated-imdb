Souls Midnight plays Armande Assante (Simon) staring at "The Mambo Kings" and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). Along with sexy vampire vixen Lucila Sola (Iris), Simon lures pregnant Alicia and her husband Charles into the underworld of Soul's Midnight. Assante brings his fangs to writer Brian and Jason Cleveland's script and you enjoy seeing him and Iris killed. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) try to stay alive while Gore feeds your lust for blood. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert) In today's run-off landscape, it's no wonder a biting preacher is bitten. Set looks cool ?? Many details at the Borgo Hotel and cool special effects at the end. I had a lot of fun watching this movie? it does not take itself too seriously and looks good.
