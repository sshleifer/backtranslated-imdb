When I saw the preview for this movie, I thought to myself, "Here's another stupid television movie written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera," but when I saw it, I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen plays the lead (and proves that she can actually act if she gets the chance) as a woman who falls in love with a man and marries (Now and Again's Eric Close), but loses faith in him When a series of rape starts taking place in their community. At first she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and her love for him, but over time she continues to be suspicious. <br /> <br /> This might sound like a melodramatic TV movie after the set-up for another boring, it's really much better than that because the characters of Thiessen and Close are well-played and the script of the movie allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than you would expect; These are not just caricatures or cardboard figures that serve only to drive action, but real, three-dimensional people, and we find that we really care about them. And the film is smart enough to provide a thrilling, sweeping climax to the story without resorting to stupid action scenes, thoughtless clichés or cheap melodrama. Instead, we share the inner conflicts and fears of the main character and get a realistic account of how they might be able to solve them and do the right thing. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to give them a look please. The production values ​​are not exactly first-rate (after all, it's a TV movie), but if you can look beyond that, there's an excellent story to enjoy.
