I have the good logic to know that oil can not endure forever, and I am very aware of how much in my life in the suburbs is about petrochemical products. I was an avid consumer of new technologies, and I have less and less power board space. So I know that even the energy crisis associated with Peak Oil will change my life significantly. <br /> <br /> The End Of Suburbia shows in a rational and entertaining way how much the lifestyle of my entire family has changed in my life. I am particularly concerned about the future generations who have to choose our excesses. However, the filmmakers give a glimmer of hope by recognizing human resources and determination - and the sense of community that tends to develop through shared hardships. <br /> <br /> There is no use in trying to claim that Peak Oil is not groundless propaganda - or treating it like an approaching radioactive cloud in "On The Beach" (ie with suicide pills at the ready)) , Despite our best efforts, times are getting tougher, and I hope that there is enough compassion and humanity.
