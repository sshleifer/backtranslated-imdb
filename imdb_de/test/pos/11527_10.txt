I have to admit that this is one of Cameron Diaz's outrageous films, and I was also surprised she played an important role, but she was not the main character. I was very touched, because I can really see the pain of a loved one, as I have experienced him up close. <br /> <br /> Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were really good protagonists in their depiction, Phoebe, and I have to hand it over to casting people to find two actresses who look so similar that I really thought they are sisters (in real life). This is one of those movies that Cameron made for reasons of acting and not starring. She looked like a beautiful, rebellious hippie who wants to change the world, even though she sometimes turns out to be a rebel for no reason. <Br /> <br /> Beneath a dysfunctional family where her only great strength is her big sister Faith, the little girl Phoebe understandably gets very upset when the faith goes to Europe. When she grows up, she goes in search of her sister and is slowly disillusioned by the truth about her sister and falls in love with her sister's friend. <br /> <br /> Great story and great locations in Europe. I will watch it again
