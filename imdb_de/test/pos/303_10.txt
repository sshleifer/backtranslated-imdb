I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was fortunate enough to meet Martin Sheen one evening in front of the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in 1981, waiting for Charlie and Emilio to leave the concert. He was very humble with regard to the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young captain. This is undoubtedly an absolute must, a complete and important part of American film history. "Charlie do not surf". The famous line of Robert Duvall (the other) does not have to be repeated because it has become a frequently repeated hymn and its Pattonesque character will be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition. It's a surprise to see what young Laurence Fishburne looks like.
