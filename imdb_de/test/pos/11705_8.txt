This is the first feature film by Australian comedian Mick Molloy. Mick wrote the film with his brother Richard with the help of John Clarke, another comedian and actor. Mick & John also starred alongside some other Australian actors - Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson and others. The basic requirement of the film is that the slimy Jack Simpson (Mick Molloy) has become a member of a Lawn Bowls Club just to get a free parking near his work. The club is in dire financial straits and urges Jack to help. John Clarke plays the club's archenemy - he's trying to take over the club and turn it into a poker machine slum jack. Jack and the other club members team up to try to save the club with lots of fun twists and Jacks. This is a pretty smart little movie. It's way beyond Mick Molloy's usual gutters humor. It's pretty well written and well played. The older Australian actors are brilliant (Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan and Ors). The film winds its way rather than playing at break-neck speed, but that adds to the film's charm. There is a rough language.
