A heartfelt sentimental story from the author of the Waltons. If someone accused me of the material, I would probably reject it as too maudlin. But the dramatization here creates a rift without the expected embarrassment. In the fifties nobody was better at lovable haystacks than Arthur Hunnicutt. His call is perceived here as a miner who is faithful to a loyal hunting dog. Their destiny is as inseparable as any human bond. Well. I see a subtle environmental message here. All living beings go to heaven, because how can we condemn every poor devil who follows only the instinct to stay alive? In the realm of animals there is no deception, and yet how cruel we often treat them. A strangely satisfying episode confirming this important message.
