Nightbreed is not only great, but also unique, even if other Barker films are considered that never suffer from originality. An amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre, there are a number of subtle symbols and references. Certainly a lot of fun, a bit of thinking, if you want. And not to forget a nice music score. Well, as usual, the special effects are getting faster faster than anything else, but that's probably the only downside. I only saw it again after ten years and still find it highly recommended.
