On more than one level, I can relate in a very personal way to what's going on in this film. And all I can say is that it's true what Dexter's mother tells Eric at the end of the story: He actually "healed" her son by taking away his sad feelings and loneliness. This film emphasizes a philosophy which I can agree very well. We will all die sooner or later someday. In the end, it's not the time we live, but the fun / good time / happiness we have in this time. It does not depend on the quantity, but on the quality. <br /> <br /> I think all other words used here would only stop you from seeing this movie if you have not already done so. I would really like to see it on DVD. In any case, it would immediately be added to my 'All Time Classics'!
