Again, I have read all the comments published here and agree with the many intelligent ones, but disagree with those who think that it is / is hokum. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that Nuclear is about the only thing left to us to do, unless our governments (government agencies and governments) increase the subsidies if they think that homeowners are taking photocells on their homes Roofs will be used. Many attractive and expensive homes in Southern California are designed and built to harness the purest of energy, the sun. I live in a loft that is exposed to total sunlight on its roof all day long.

"Tiberius1234" has posted a very good comment here - I agree to spill is much better than living in a wasted world and becomes "Blade Runner" and / or "Solyent Green". Get away from your video games for a few hours and watch this "dated" movie (really is not), and get some knowledge about nuclear energy. I recommend it to the whole family ...
