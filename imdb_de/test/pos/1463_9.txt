After the heights of Darkplace, it was never imagined that Holness and Adobye could do something good that was only half as good as garth marengi. However, I think that man by man is just as good a show (in the good episodes) as Darkplace. I can not say that two of the episodes are really not that good, but the other four will certainly make up for it. If I had to pick two great episodes, you have to choose the Formula 4 driver Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. Having a little bit of understanding for the program is a real plus as Dean Learner does a lot of inside jokes, but even if you have not seen much Dean, we recommend this because some of the rants he starts in are awesome. His quarrel with Def Lepord because of her name. All in all a great show that missed the full score due to the few less funny episodes.
