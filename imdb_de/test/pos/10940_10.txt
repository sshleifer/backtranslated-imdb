The Twins Effect is a Cantonese vampire martial arts movie with English subtitles. It's a Jackie Chan production, and he makes a special guest appearance, though it's not for those who like the Shanghai Noon / Knights and the other Hollywood movies he has become known for, this movie is a lot more special than this one. <br /> Originally called The Vampire Effect, but as a very popular Chinese pop duo called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung), the title took over the two main roles, and the title was turned into fame. <br /> The film addresses three types of audience: those who love martial arts films, those who love vampire movies, and those who abhor the garbage films that Hollywood generally erupts. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for the movie is that it's about vampires and a secret society tries to hunt them before we all become snacks for the undead. This bloody work is done by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the benefit they need. Well, it has to be thirsty work! Things are going pretty well for the course until a particularly vicious European vampire finds out that if he receives a key phrase held by all vampire princes, then he can walk around in sunlight, etc., and generally eat whenever he wants , Saying more on the plot would affect the enjoyment of watching the movie. The twins consist of one assigned vampire hunter (Chung) and the sister (Choi) of another. It's the twins who really make the movie. with some of the freshest and funniest actors. The fight scenes they perform are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of real athleticism and wire work. To bring the cherry on the cake, the twins are both very pretty to look at. <br /> <br /> The direction is sharp and the script is sharp. There are only three things that have let this movie down: The make-up for the vampires is pretty bad, Jackie Chan seems to be in the film and contributes nothing to it, and the slapstick comedy is something of the male vampire hunter pretty lame. Fortunately, the twins save the day and give the film, which is usually found only in European films, originality. The best scene for me was one of them (Choi) who only communicated through screaming. Her ability to convey her thoughts through this medium was a weird joy. <br /> <br /> You have many other elements of originality in this movie - I really liked the coffin with surround sound stereo and TV screen! And it's the many original touches and acting of the films that prevent this tired old flop from becoming a movie that needs to be seen.
