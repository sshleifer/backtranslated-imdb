Impressive! It's even better than I expected! the best animated Astérix movie ever! and it feels so good when Roger Carel hears the voice of Astérix again! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the comics of Astérix! but I suggest you look at the French version, because it is certainly the best and you will hear the original cast! Did you know that Roger Carel has played Astérix for almost forty years? I think he has done a wonderful job! and the song of Celine Dion in the end fits in well with the credits! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful ... in one word: a masterpiece! Go see it! You will not regret it!
