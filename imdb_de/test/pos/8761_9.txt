"Traffik 1989" is an Emmy award that has won a six-part miniseries from the UK. She was the inspiration for the Oscar-winning "Traffic 2000". The five-hour film breaks the opium / heroin trade for the viewer from poppy-seed pounding in an Afghanistan field to the "main rush" of a mainlining junkie in an apartment in England. "Traffik" not only offers entertainment value through interleaved dramatic stories, but also provides an overview of international drug trafficking at all levels and answers the question "who, where, how and why". "Traffik" is a synergistically entertaining and educational time, which proves to be useful for young people and the elderly. (ON)
