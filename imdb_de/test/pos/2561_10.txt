I've decided to watch this movie for one reason and for a single reason ... Samuel L. Jackson. I like him very much. I had not seen any previews or trailers for this overlooked movie, so I went in with no real expectations. <br /> <br /> Jackson did not disappoint as Lazarus, an outspoken Blues man in the Deep South, perhaps delivering his strongest performance ever, including playing and singing a string of great blues songs. But the real surprise here was Christina Ricci, at best a vapid airhead, who took on the role of the sexually abused city tramp Rae and made her a believable, almost sympathetic character. Watching the development of the decidedly non-sexual relationship between Lazarus and Rae was simply amazing. Justin Timberlake, a pop star who becomes a strong-willed actor, should go back and cause "wardrobe malfunction". His mostly forced performance distracted at best from the actual story. <br /> <br /> This movie is raw, somber and sometimes pretty "in your face". Not everyone will like it. However, those who do will quickly move them to the top of their favorite list.
