This movie does not have the outstanding images American Beauty or The Ice Storm offered. Since he was made after these films, he also can not be described as very original: The music sounds subtly brilliant, but sounds very much like that of American Beauty. <br /> <br /> The story has some similarities with The Ice Storm, especially with Sigourney Weaver. Unintentionally, the film seems to be trying to replicate the success of the two aforementioned films too much. Sometimes the story stays a bit flatter than its bigger, more successful "brothers" when there is too much going on or the most effective dialogues are not executed. Here the writing can not compete with that of American Beauty. But this can be said about most of the films ever made, even the best ones, and there is still a lot to like: said music and (as expected given the cast) effective performances. Remarkable is Emile Hirsch, who would shine a few years later in the outstanding "Into The Wild". Overall, I would recommend this movie if you like suburban drama, although this is not the first on a list. A must! 1 American Beauty 2 The Ice Storm 3 Little Children. <br /> <br /> After seeing and liking them, look at them.
