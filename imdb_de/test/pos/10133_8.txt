That was unusual: a modern movie that was very beautiful. In fact, it was so beautiful that it bordered on believing in parts. As I looked at this story, I thought, "Nobody is so nice, so tolerant." Mainly, I referred to Ed Harris's role as "Coach Jones." I think they were a bit overboard with his character, but that's better than the opposite: to show him worse than in real life. Strange to see that Harris also plays the role, since he plays unpleasant, profane characters for a long time. Anyway, I never complain about a nice, good movie, and it's nice to see a lot of well-meaning, friendly people. These people derive their friendship, love and compassion on "James Kennedy", better known as "Radio," a mentally slow schoolchild played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in South Carolina in the mid-1970s. Gooding also does a good job with the role. Like Sean Penn's role as a mentally challenged man in "I Am Sam," one and a half hours of such a figure is plentiful. After that, it gets louder to hear the volume of these guys. <br /> <br /> Note: In one of the documentaries on this DVD, it was interesting to learn that in real life years were needed for "radio". to make his transformation, not months as shown in the movie.
