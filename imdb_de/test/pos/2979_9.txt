Great movie! The soundtrack is great! Very relaxing sound. Elton was already ahead of his own time in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a great job producing and directing this movie! The movie was romantic and fresh air. The soundtracks written by Sir Elton complemented the film to a T. Rex Morris, who does a great job with the tenor sax on the song "Honey Roll" and the poem "I Meant To Do My Work Today" by Richard Le Gallienne. Kudos to all who are involved in this fantastic movie! It was no surprise that many of the people involved in the film were among the best in their field.
