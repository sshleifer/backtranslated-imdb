The Turkish culture is complete with many different cultures. Different cultures have different styles of music. Istanbul is like the turkey mix. It usually has the same language but different dialects. This documentary shows us these different types of music with different dialects and instruments. You can watch reports with singers and groups, their performances, their daily lives and learn their musical thoughts. The film not only includes the music of Istanbul, but also life in Istanbul, how people communicate and what they eat and drink. The surprising part is that even though I live in Istanbul, I have learned many things from this film.
