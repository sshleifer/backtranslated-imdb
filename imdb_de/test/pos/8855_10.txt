In 1982, two films were published within a few weeks, both dealing with foreigners. Steven Spielberg's ET and John Carpenter's The Thing. Of the two, ET has won the hearts of people around the world, though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so fascinated by Spielberg's warm, fuzzy alien fable, they stayed away in droves from The Thing. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic story intended to warm the cockles of the still beating heart. The other is a tough, uncompromising film that portrays extraterrestrial life as something that is intent on destroying us. I think the audience believed that ET was a much sharper perspective than The Things Tentacle and the phlegm-covered saliva! <br /> <br /> It took some time, but The Thing has gained a considerable cult audience. As it should. For The Thing is the rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the classic from 1951 and reinvents them in a surprising and imaginative way. In fact, Carpenter does his job so well that he actually manages to make a film that equals the showrunner of the genre Alien in every inch. And that is even rarer! <br /> <br /> Carpenter's film follows its source more faithfully than The Thing From Another World. It keeps the cold deserts of the Antarctic as a backdrop, because it is the perfect backdrop when trying to create a sense of isolation. Although the characterization is a bit thin, the remake gets straight into the mindset of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, Carpenter, returns to Escape From New York, again cast as one of Carpenter's eternal anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot in a research station in the Antarctic (what you can guess, what you can guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian helicopter flies from a nearby station over MacReadys and tries to fend off a Siberian Husky from the air. <br /> <br /> They end up dying for their problems and as the camp tries to solve the problem riddles of what happened, they pick up the Husky and add it to his own. Except that this husky is not a husky at all. But a shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered that it was frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it, it massacred their crew. She is able to absorb her victims at will and can imitate a living being down to the smallest detail. Soon, paranoia and mistrust prevail through the 12-man crew until no one knows who is human and who is not. The Thing is one of John Carpenter's best films. In fact, I'm tempted to say that it's the best movie he's ever made. Even classics like Halloween and Dark Star surpass. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last movie of his that could really be called a classic. Everyone else felt as if Carpenter were slumbering. Films that did not flow with the cool sophistication and harsh intensity that were so prevalent in his earlier works. But The Thing had John Carpenter at the height of his powers. Never before has he created tension in such an unbearable way. Not even in the wild assault on Revier 13. From the moment the alien announces his presence, he relentlessly scans the tension. And when he delivers his punches, they come with a painful jerk. <br /> <br /> The film is a mixture of pure atmosphere and visceral horror. An approach that can often be in conflict with each other, but in Carpenter's hands, it blends wonderfully together. He brings fame to Rob Bottin of The Howling and brings forth some of the most amazing transformational effects you'll ever see in a horror movie. Amorphous forms. Semi-formed human features stand in stark contrast to gaping jaws, spider legs, and fully flexible tentacles. In fact, the effects of the movie are so amazing and windy that The Thing came under fire because it was too realistic! <br /> <br /> This way of thinking misses the point completely. It only changes the values ​​of the movie. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effect when he needs it. In the quieter moments of the film, he seems to be particularly attuned to the story. The thing is an often confusing story of shadows, whispers, and implications. The characterization was never one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it does work to his advantage in The Thing. Since we hardly know anything about the occupation, the present situation only gets more confusing. We are never sure from one moment to the next who is who. For that reason, The Thing holds up very well and retains its mystery on subsequent visits. <br/> <br /> A special mention should be the excellent score by Ennio Morricone. Every two seconds a pulsing beat. It creates an eerie, scary feeling that is very difficult to shake. The whole movie is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. In the scene where they have each other a blood test to see who Carpenter man is wrapped with such dexterity, you may bite your nails without realizing it. Even the end gives rise to the vague suspicion that not everything is solved. An underrated film that was worth the revaluation. And so much better than ET!
