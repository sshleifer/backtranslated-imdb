Forget the tiny (and meaningless) comments left by some here. This series is well played, well shot and changes most of the papers on TV. <br /> <br /> Any fool can take everything. However, in this show the characters are believable, the stories are intriguing and captivating (but they require some intelligence on the part of the viewer), overall it's enjoyable and it's British !! (We occasionally have a few jewels, and this is one of them.) <br /> <br /> The shows are each one hour long and I think there are four of them all together (at least I've only seen four of them them). The show clearly impressed some US TV stations / directors who produced a longer series that was far from convincing despite the larger budget. <br /> <br /> If you are like soap operas and reality shows, you will not like Eleventh or understand the hour.
