This British film version of the stage play I AM A CAMERA is based on Christopher Isherwood's "Berlin Stories". This is the source material for the famous musical CABARET. <br /> <br /> Julie Harris, one of the leading actresses of her time, repeated her 1951 Tony Award winning role as Sally Bowles. She's a long way from the Liza Minnelli character, but the basic "Sally" is all here, despite the various code codes that would not have turned the story in Hollywood. Harris may be dizzy, but she's also pretty good as the crazy and crazy Sally. Her singing number is obviously synchronized (no less by Marlene Dietrich), though Harris apparently sings for herself at other moments. Laurence Harvey (with the very ugly hair) plays Isherwood without charm and also can not make the character interesting. Shelley Winters has little to do with Natalia's role (Marian Winters has won a supportive Tony for the play), and Anton Diffring is fine as Fritz. Ron Randell plays the Caddish Clive but seems a bit loud. Lee Seidl is funny as the landlady. <br /> <br /> Despite its pervasive and cheap looks, Harris is the center of attention and she is amazing. This film was released in the same year as EAST OF EDEN, in which Harris shines as Abra. The comparison of the two performances gives an insight into the talent that Miss Harris possesses. These two characters could not be more dissimilar. Harris' sally squeezes and groans and growls a very lustful laugh. She also acts in circles around the boring Harvey. Without the music and with a familiar plot, many viewers here may find little to recommend this movie, but it's a great opportunity to see the great Julie Harris, which was probably a very shocking role in 1951.
