A good story, well implemented with unexpected character changes eg. vicious murderous gangster Bryan Brown teaching macrame to his son. Although it succeeds as an action drama, hoping that the Good (Ledger) and his Gilrfriend will be successful, it also has some weird, ironic black humor, eg. the bank robbers who become "winners" of the radio contest, and their reaction, the revenge of the street musician, etc.
