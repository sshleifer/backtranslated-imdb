Citizen Kane ... The godfather II. Part ... D'Urville Martins Dolemite. This is the greatest celluloid ever created and unleashed for humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that transcends Oscar stars as Dolemite, the nastiest cat in the universe. Obviously he does not take a turkey drink (unfortunately I'm a turkey myself) and proves it with his power of knocking, holding and karate strokes. This is blaxploitation at its finest, a shining example of the low-budget genre, continuity flaws, and hatred of ratted soup that eats a real explant leap. The true godfather of rap (not this new Ali nonsense) Moore is a kind of juxtaposition of acting technique; somehow he managed to be the most charismatic horrible actor of the 70s, and that says something. This is highly recommended, if not for the one-liners alone.
