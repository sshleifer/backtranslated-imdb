Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a translator living in Italy, discovers that she has a memory loss and can not remember the last few days. She follows a trail of remembrance fragments that leads her to the small town of Garma. People in the city seem to recognize her, and she senses that the recurrent nightmares of astronauts performing terrible experiments have something to do with their own amnesia, but it's a bit too slow and arty for my liking. The plot makes some nice turns and it's really hard to figure out where to go. Florinda Bolkan is good in her role (but even better in "Flavia the Heretic") and it's always nice to see "star" kid actress Nocoletta Elmi. Klaus Kinski's role is too small. This is not a movie for the hard-bitten breeding dog or exploit addict, but still a very nice secret of an hour and a half.
