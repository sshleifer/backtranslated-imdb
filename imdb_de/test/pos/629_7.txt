I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Except for the sister. She reminded me of Janice at Friends. I could never believe that she was anything but disgusting. <br /> <br /> My main problems with the movie were the anti-climatic end and the execution scene with my sister and brother-in-law. The guy falls out of the exploding car? If his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help, she kissed him and dumped him in a hospital. I think someone had to die in the execution scene. Mainly the brother-in-law. He was a pain in the ass anyway. Or maybe the nurse had accidentally killed the guy who saved the mute. I could even have bought the brother-in-law who kills the hero, and in the end are the two sisters who are put into snuffbox movies. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look again, and as I always say, it's much easier to be an appraiser than an author.
