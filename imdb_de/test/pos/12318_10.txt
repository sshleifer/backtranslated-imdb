John Huston ended his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive films I have ever seen. When he left, he decided to adapt James Joyce's beautiful short story "The Dead", making not only one of the most faithful adaptations of literature to film, but also a film that still surpasses more than 20 years later <br/> <br/> When I saw this film a few years ago as a student at the university, I was in awe of the screen and was amazed at every aspect of the film: drama, script writing, directing, costumes, attitudes, music, cinematography. When I think about it now, I still can not criticize it. Huston just knew how to tell a good story. <br /> <br /> A good credit should also go to Tony Huston. He knew better than to mix with a text that is not only perfect, but already visual enough for the cinema. Father and Son let the story breathe and enjoy in the long, fascinating conversations between the characters and the meaningful silence. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann also deserves credit for his performance as Gabriel Conroy. I'd never seen him in movies before, not after, but he gave one of the most moving performances I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> All in all, The Dead is a beautiful cinematic experience from a legendary director who has never stopped being excellent.
