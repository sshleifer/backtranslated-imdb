I do not know what the critics saw when this movie was released, but it slipped past unnoticed. It is well written, witty, satirical and absolutely enjoyable. It's like a video game that comes to life. You never know who is behind the door or what will happen next. The violence is not unfounded or exaggerated for a splatter effect. <br /> <br /> One last word: For you, Mickey Rourke fans ... the Mickster has returned in the end and is the coolest.
