What is the music in the first transformation scene? I heard it was "The Greeks do not get freeks". Is that correct? I really liked this sound. I also liked the "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide" in the last scenes. Truly a Doper movie, but with lots of laughs and puns, gags and slapstick. The place of Mrs. Woo-Woo reminded of some places that I visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in other things that are really amazing. She looks very different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity did not hurt her a bit. Mark Blankfield is reminiscent of Gene Wilder in some ways. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and kept her beauty for a long time.
