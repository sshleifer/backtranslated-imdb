This is a wonderful movie. Elizabeth Taylor does a wonderful job, as does Mickey Rooney. The movie just makes you happy. It's inspiring, and while some parts are a bit too sentimental, it's easy to forgive. I could see this movie again and again. The race at the end is always exciting when I see it. I highly recommend this movie.
