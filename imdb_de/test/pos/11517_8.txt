Lights of New York was the first all-around feature film. Of course there was The Jazz Singer, which was released in October 1927 as the first feature film with dubbed dialogue. However, this film, published in July 1928, is almost unconsidered for its place in film history. It had begun as a short film, but gradually became more and more tackled until it was - with 58 minutes moving - accidentally became the first all-talking feature film. It opened for a bad home run and for Warner Bros. surprise that brought in over a million dollars. That was good money in 1928. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple. Two country barbers naively buy themselves into a barbershop on Broadway, which serves as a freedom of speech for "The Hawk", a gangster. If they learn the truth, they can not afford to come out, because the younger barber Eddie has tied all his mother's money in the apartment. Kitty is the younger barber friend, and Gangster Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) has an eye for looking for his older girlfriend (Gladys Brockwell) for a newer model - the chorus wife Kitty (Helene Costello). A police officer is killed as he tries to prevent the hawk's men from unloading a load of brandy, and the hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame Eddie, thereby providing Kitty with self-prepared fun for the enthusiast of this groundbreaking work. Sure, the plot is elemental and the dialogue dulled, but there's something you do not see much in early talkies - background music rating. Originally, Vitaphone was used for this purpose, and here they still use it for musical accompaniment along with the dialogue. And there are singing and dancing numbers! The scenes in Hawk's nightclub are used as an opportunity to show what films could never do before - musical numbers. There's even a wild eye with some make-up from the silent era, that's a shout to see. <br /> <br /> At this point Vitaphone could be simulated because of the static camera cabs, so the scene in the park between the two lovers Eddie and Kitty is being simulated - and cheap. The green looks like an Ed Wood movie or maybe a high school production of Our Town. <br /> <br /> Gladys Brockwell delivers as punchoff girlfriend of Hawk their lines with punch. She is a real soldier when it comes to what lines she has to deliver. The Hawk - "So you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck!" Huh mixed metaphors? And then there are her last lines "I lived and I loved and I lost!" Was someone paid to write this dialogue? Brockwell had a great success in her talkie career after scoring some trumps in silent film (the evil sister in "Seventh Heaven") when a fatal car crash shortened her career. <br /> <br /> Then there is Eugene Palette - the older of the two hairdressers in our history. His frog voice, natural lines, and cuddly looks gave him a long career as a character actor, usually appearing as a grown-up family man / businessman with a rough exterior and a golden heart. In fact, Mr. Palette is the only member of the cast who has a remarkable career in movies just three years after the release of this film. Finally, the question arises, "where the microphone is hidden." ? Microphones were still stationary at the time and it's fun to find out where they are hidden. However, there is a famous scene where everyone can understand it pretty well. Hawk is in his office talking to his two followers - who seem to understand how they are talking - about taking Eddie with them. If you see this scene, you would swear that the phone on the desk is a character in this movie. It is up front and center throughout the conversation. The microphone is probably built into the phone. <br /> <br /> It's a bit heroic when these pioneers fly blind in the face of new sound technology. There are silent actors accustomed to using mime as a means of expression, Vaudians knowing how to play to a live audience but not knowing how to make the same impression in a Vitaphone booth, and you have Dialog authors trying to write conversations as compact as title cards or movies with endless chatter. <br /> <br /> Look at this. It's not boring, it moves quickly and it's great fun if you know what to look for. And no, I do not expect this album ever to appear on Blu-Ray, but I hope the Warner Brothers people will soon be adding it to the Warner Archive so everyone can see it.
