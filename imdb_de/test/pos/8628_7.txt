For us, a movie by Abbott and Costello is something you want to do. I am very happy that I recorded this - my wife remembered when she was young, but I had never seen it before. The family wanted to see something at bedtime that was not too serious. This daughter was selected. <br /> <br /> Our daughter has seen many old films with us - always complaining at the beginning, but mostly over and over again. In the beginning, she mostly ignored that and preferred to check her e-mails, but she started to enjoy herself - she often laughed aloud at the Zaniness 55-year-old. The monochromatic introduction, which fits in the colored fairy tale. It's a funny twist on a story everyone knows that includes a little song and a little dance, along with everything you'd expect from Lou and Bud. <br /> very funny evening!
