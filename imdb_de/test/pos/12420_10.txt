I came to Monster Man yesterday. I had waited a long time and after much anticipation and setup, I am happy to say that it has met my expectations at all levels. Sure, you really can not expect too much if you hear the conspiracy, but after reading some of the reviews, I was thrilled. I mean, which trash fan would not like to see a jump over a confused inbreeding hick lolling people in his truck. I expected a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got so much more. This was a horror comedy that actually worked. The filmmakers got it right when it was about squirming and howling at the same time with laughter. Kudos to Michael Davis for doing everything with the wound and pushing the envelope with ill humor. Let me just mention a few reasons why I love this movie so much: First of all, the story. It was killed in so many other flicks. A college guy gets wind that his childhood is in love. He is the 25-year-old maiden he is, jumping into his Vista Cruiser and deciding to embark on the journey to confess his love in the hope that she will fall over mountains and all the good jive. In the back seat of his station wagon hides the good buddy Harley. Harley is the bigmouth, a former friend who laughs and talks like Jack Black in High Fidelity. You can not help but like the guy, but if he was your friend in real life, you'd have to have a Whiffle Ball racket ready (laugh, whatever you want, but have you ever met one?), To him keep it in check So, he's a bit on the detestable side, to say the least, but you can say he's a loyal friend, deep down. Now they are being pursued by a leather face clone in a monster truck. That's it. Yeah, on the way they get a beautiful hitchhiker, but I'm too lazy and hungry to respond immediately ... so just look at the damned movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, what I love was the humor. This one had some of the sickest laughs of all movies since Cabin Fever. How confused is it? Well, I will not even go into the whole cat scene, and as far as the "corpse burrito" is concerned, I leave that to your virgin eyes as well. The bar with amputees was a bit disturbing and the guy who looked like John Turturro bothered me too. Although Harley is a totally disgusting boy guy, he can really tear down the one-liners. By the way, love the wooden shoes. I need a new couple. <br /> <br /> The GORE. This pours it hard. While the first hour is a crazy street comedy, the last third is about blood and courage. If the movie did not maintain such a bright tone everywhere, it would have been a bit disturbing, but seeing how it all played laughs, there's no way you'll be disturbed by it. If you're still sitting in your seat at the time, you'll probably see the humor inside, but seriously, there were buckets and buckets of red stuff. There was a big turn I did not see coming and when the credits rolled I was completely satisfied. I got exactly what I came for and I'm really glad I bought it. Similar to Cabin Fever, there will be a lot of repetition. <br /> <br /> The look of the movie was outstanding. There was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole of the late '80s scream, and I loved the exaggerated colors. It's obvious that Monster Man had a relatively low budget, but like Cabin Fever (I'm sorry, I compare them over and over again), it actually works in favor of the movie. Cabin Fever was an ode to the greats of the 70s, that was the answer of the 80s on it. So take that for what it's worth. No CGI here. We all needed that. I'm not sure why it did not get a theatrical release, because that's what Jeepers Creepers should have done. Thank goodness for Lions Gate.
