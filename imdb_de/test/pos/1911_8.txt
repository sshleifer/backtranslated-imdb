A classic of blaxploitation, this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the "toasts" that Rudy Ray Moore plays. Toasts are long rhyming stories that are funny and score a point, and you can see how they would naturally turn into rap. For more information about Toasts, Rudy Ray Moore and why this film is so important, visit Dolemite.com. <br /> <br /> What only lets us talk about the movie itself. This movie offers a lot of "laugh-at-the-fun-outfits-and-hairstyles" - for just about any price, since almost every shot has some kind of unheard-of element or dialogue. It begins when Dolemite is released from prison to find out who has framed and tried him. I did not know that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence, but that's me, I'm a freshman on the prison scene. In the process, Queen Bee, the leading prostitute of Dolemite, helps him and has run his brothel while he's gone. She has also brought all his prostitutes through the karate school, and now he has an army of female karate fighters. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case it offers an interesting contrast. The first part I watched during my lunch break during exercise was not much fun for me. It seemed to me a particularly badly made blaxploitation, with a ridiculous story, inferior craftsmanship - well, I suppose that sounds like there was some craftsmanship - and lots of outrageous settings, outfits, and dialogues. But I did not enjoy that. I somehow felt dirty. Let's face it, a white man who watches something to laugh at the outfits and the things that the characters say are essentially racist: how ridiculous are these black people dressing, what stupid things they say. I did not really enjoy it, did not laugh and was not looking forward to watching the rest. Later that night, when I was in a "much more relaxed state," I looked at the rest - and rightfully loved it. Like Disco Godfather I had seen a few days earlier, this has a warmth and sweetness that makes it likable, even if it is stupid or violent. The character of Dolemite has an element of self-parody about it, which makes the whole thing funny, and the appearance of several actors who were also in Disco Godfather implies that we observe the group effort of a group of friends who just want to do something together even The bad synchronization, karate fights and everything else just makes it a lot more charming. <br /> <br /> What I find interesting about the Dolemite films is that they have some moral ambiguities that I do not see in other bubbling films and certainly in very few mainstream movies. There is an African-American woman who gives a speech about the (white) mayor and says, "He did more for the black community than anyone else." We later find out that the mayor is surprisingly corrupt, but I think it's good that the movie would make this woman look essentially misguided and would not try to "redeem" her in any other way. There is also the character of the Hamburger Pimp, who is presented as a useless junkie, and no one is trying to find a redeeming, socially positive perspective on what he is. In Disco Godfather, the religious character Lady Reed plays is only portrayed as crazy because he wants to pray for her child, who was hopelessly lost to angel dust. I think it's good that the films present so harsh critical portrayals of people in their own community without coating or trying to redeem them to make them tastier. <br /> <br /> There are many terrible elements, such as z. As Dolemite says, "Move and let me go, or I'll pull those hush puppies out of your mutt **." There is Queen Bee answering the phone: "Dolemites Total Experience". And you will not be able to miss the extended nude scene of the REPULSIVE mayor (even if you want to hide your eyes). I'm all for mustache-perverted older men, but even I have limits - and my limits are usually a few miles behind most people, so be forewarned. The DVD I had is clearly cut, which is noticeable in certain dialogue scenes, and in the end when Dolemite's murder of a protagonist with his bare hands obviously excludes the main event. <br /> <br /> If you get the DVD, be sure to watch all three trailers for the Dolemite movies as they are a shout. I would not look at The Human Tornado, but once you've seen this trailer, you better believe it's me. There's also a scene in the Dolemite trailer that I do not remember from the movie, when Dolemite swings on a Mexican-looking bat, is obviously missing and the man plunges into a nearby trunk. <br /> <br /> After looking at the first half, I wanted to say that I should skip that and see Disco Godfather, as the movie production and story have improved a bit. After really enjoying the second half, I would advise seeing them as Disco Godfather this is even more fun, outrageous and good-natured and has these toasts that, even if you do not understand the roots and nuances of the form, still something you can see. <br /> <br /> --- Check out other reviews on my website about bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
