This is definitely one of the better documentary films I've seen in terms of family relationships and marriage. I've recently seen "the Friedmans captured" and I have to admit, I thought that would be better. <br /> <br /> The story is not unbelievably shocking, but it's a great exploration of trapped personalities and relationship cold war. Block skilfully guides the viewer through diaries, family footage, and post-interview interviews. His interviewing style is sensitive and proving, and his insights are clear and measured. 51 Birch Street is a great exploration of personalities and relationships over a period of 40 to 50 years of social change, social impact, and the potential for salvation.
