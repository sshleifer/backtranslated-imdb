I remember watching this movie in the theater and liking it. I happened to stumble on fearnets last month and looked better with age. First of all, for those of you who call this '80s cheese' objectively compared to the horror flicks of the last two decades, it's quite comparable when compared to movies in their unique horror sub-genre, which I call Action / horror would designate Unlike psychological horror like "The Shining" or "The Exorcist". <br /> <br /> Also, this movie really delivers the goods for your budget (or bad in this case). In fact, the movie has some character development, and gives enough of the history of the notorious hull house to get the atmosphere right in front of the characters in the front door. The film also has several humorous inserts and gives the right mood, which should have a scary horror movie. If you compare NOD to contemporary high-budget horror movies like "I Am Legend" (the Vincent Price version was much better), this movie really stands out. Modern horror movies were almost completely dominated by CGI. Most have no action or character development at all and are fully predictable. The special effects dominate these films from start to finish and the characters are made of 24k plastic. If it's horror cheese of the 80s, I take over 95% of the current entries in this genre. <br /> <br /> When I saw NOD again, I remembered the beautiful Jill Terashita and wondered why I have not seen her in more movies horror or otherwise. Jill, about the odd chance you're reading this - I think you're beautiful and played in more movies. If you like action horror movies, you will probably like them very much.
