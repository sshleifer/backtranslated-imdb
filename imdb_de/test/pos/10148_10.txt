The man who knew too much is extraordinary entertainment. For those who prefer the 1934 original, I'll say it's faster and funnier. Although the American version (heavenly ban!) Was a big budget blockbuster, I think it blows the British version out of the water. I think this is one of Hitchcock's 10 best - not a trivial one, considering he made more than 50 films and many of them were among the best ever. I love so many things to love: <br /> <br /> 1) James Stewart, America's most popular American for many years, does an excellent job of playing the desperate father here. He can make any movie entertaining, and when he works with such a likeable character in such a gripping story, he has deeply rooted me with him. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing compared. <br /> <br /> 2) Doris Day. Yes, Doris Day. Despite all criticism of her, she makes the loving wife / mother a very personable person. I do not agree with the negative remarks on her character; Just because she is quiet and gentle does not mean she is docile and helpless. I do not want to ruin anything, but she herself makes a crucial discovery after her husband has failed. It gives the story a measure of warmth that was not present in the first. For those who are interested, this version is the way to go. And I loved Que Sera Sera. I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and rightly won its Oscar. The movie was lifted to another level. 3) The Albert Hall sequence. I do not think it was too long. I think the tension that has been built all the time on this great crescendo and Hitchcock's direction in this scene has been absolutely awesome. And the assassin was really scary. <br /> <br /> 4) The end really makes a smile on my face. Even after the scene was over, I found the rescue scene exciting and it was great to see the charming family back together. The last line of the movie is very amusing. I do not think that the movie started slowly. Hithcock tried to get to know and like the McKennas, and he did a great job. I was not a big fan of Hank, but I had no problem with him. Since Hank Ben and Jos were kids, I also took care of him. It's not like he's a brat or something. <br /> <br /> I have not found any major flaws and so many great and minor virtues in this film. Way to hitch!
