How often, when manga is implemented in live action, is lost in translation a lot. However, this remains a very entertaining movie. The premise is unusual and presented in a calm, unobtrusive style prevalent in Japanese films (ha!). The special effects are a bit of a 70s camp, but the comic feeling of the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you're familiar with (and enjoying) other Japanese horror movies like "Evil Dead's Trap", this movie will appeal to you.
