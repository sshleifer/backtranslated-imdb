It's a mystery to me why I did not catch up with this masterful 50s caper movie? Noir grunted so far, but I am certainly glad to report that it was not disappointed. I have not seen an American movie by Jules Dassin for several years, but based on that, I'll probably be watching "Brute Force" and "Night and the City" again soon. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais, a name I'm not familiar with, but a familiar face in his world fatigue and cold, has recently spent a lengthy period in jail and, as in these movies, the case (hey, otherwise there is no story) does not handle the straight life well. There's an opportunity: a simple million-dollar jewel robbery that can be carried out at night without some men being afraid of discovery. The tight filming of the robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what people naturally remember most, and that's really remarkable; but I liked the half-finished location of the last shootout after the robbery by the big mouth of a thief became sour; the excellent representation of the gritty sides of Paris in bold black and white; and Servais' channeling of Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart in his spare but brutal performance. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a bit too sentimental in the end, but this is one of those classics that are really good enough for reputation as pure entertainment, even though what it has to say about the human condition is not just deep or thought provoking; Another highlight of George Auric is the modernist, romantic and jazzy score.
