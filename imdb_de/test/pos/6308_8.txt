I saw this in the week that opened four years ago, and I really did not know what to expect, that Sorrentino's work was unfamiliar. He has made a very interesting and ultimately moving account of a strange character for whom the phrase "life is to live" is no longer valid. It overtook me at every turn and I was always surprised by the story. I really enjoyed the tempo and the way I gradually got the pieces to find out what happened. Tony Servillo is great, as is Magnani. It starts with a brilliant, stylish wide-angle shot and ends with a very moving image that brings the film into sublime terrain. I thought for a long time about the main character and the position he was in, and about his last fate, and I did not shake it for weeks. I recently bought the movie and the last scene in which he thinks about his friend brings me every time. I still have to talk to everyone who has seen this. It is a shame that it did not reach a wider audience, as this could be the direction of Italian cinema, it can only be a good thing.
