Sonny Chiba is, as everyone knows, the man. In this film he portrays Mas Oyama (1923-1994), a real martial artist who fought and won over 50 bulls with his bare hands (interesting type). In any case, Chiba kills only one bull in the movie, but it's a memorable scene and, as the liner notes say, at the top of the zombie-against-shark scene in Zombi! The film also offers a lot of hand-to-hand combat and a decent plan, but I do not think that's all right. This movie is the first in Chiba's Oyama trilogy and is recommended for fans of martial arts action. Finally, three nice little tidbits; Part of the opening theme was used in Kill Bill, Volume 1. Oyama himself appears in the opening episodes, because he trained Chiba for five years in real life!
