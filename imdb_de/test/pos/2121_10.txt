Went to the preview engagement of "Grand Champion" today (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and several other cities in Texas). There are so few films that are suitable for small children ... but this one is and is great. Although the plot is a bit "hokey" (also the name of the ox in the movie), it's a wonderful story for kids. And I liked it too. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty good on family life in West Texas Ranch, if a bit over the top. Director / author Barry Tubb should do it right because he grew up in this environment. He called the movie his "love letter to Texas." <br /> <br /> Joey Lauren Adams plays the single mother of Buddy (Jacob Fisher) and sister 'Blow' (Emma Roberts). Watch Emma Roberts (Julia Roberts niece); She is very good and I think she will be involved in more films. There are also cameo appearances by Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, musicians George Strait, Charlie Robison, Robert Earl Keen, Joe Ely and rodeo legends Larry Mahan and Tuff Hedeman. If you have small kids or just want to watch a movie to feel good, check out "Grand Champion" when it comes to your city (probably later this month). You will enjoy it and it will feel good. <br /> <br /> I think since I'm from West Texas, I might be a little biased ... well, I'm impartial. The movie is excellent!
