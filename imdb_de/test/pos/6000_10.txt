Gulliver's Travels is initially a satirical novel written by a great misanthrope named Jonathan Swift. Therefore, it is not recommended to judge this movie alone. We need to go deeper into the human conscience to get to the point where Swift could have led us. Gulliver has lived a journey of truthfulness, loneliness and the perception of his true life. We can not just sit and watch the movie, it's so cute or boring. The matter goes much further and I want everyone to expect that. This is the greatest movie of all time, as far as you can feel the truths that derive from Ted Danson's character: the unforgettable Lemuel Gulliver.
