Impressive! What a nice, warm, rural movie! The story focuses on Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), a young male hiker whose journey takes him to a quiet, rural coastal town. There he stays with the Brown family. Velvet (Liz Taylor), her youngest daughter who makes a subtle friendship with Mi, has a passion for horses and wins one at auction. This horse is a beautiful chestnut stallion. Called "murderous pirate" by his previous owner, Velvet calls him Pie. Not long after Velvet proposes to enter the Grand National Race. Mi and her family are against it, but soon agree, and Velvet and Mi started training him for Britain's most famous horse race. This movie is a nice example of what British films look like. I remember seeing this for the first time at the age of eight and during the summer holidays. My parents took it from the TV and I got warm right away? I see it on most days instead of the large collection of Disney movies that I owned. <br /> <br /> I think it was one of Liz Taylor's first films and a good movie! Your character is naive but cute? Her acting is extremely compelling, especially as she portrays her love of horses. It's also a great opportunity to see Angela Lansbury in one of her early roles. She plays as Velvet's older sister, who spends most of her time in the movie being beaten up with a boy in town! I have to say that she was a beautiful lady when she was younger. Beautiful blond hair and a rosy, cheek-faced face. Although she does not play a major role in the film, she has several scenes - so as not to disappoint her fans! Parents who read this, must I stress? If you can get a copy of it, please do so! If you love children animals? I urge you to show it to you! You may find some scenes boring, but you will see Velvet riding on many horses throughout the movie. A nice and nostalgic movie. I could just go and put it on now!
