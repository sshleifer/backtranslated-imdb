"Pearl Harbor, buddy." This movie is brilliant! Sure, it's not exactly like a multi-million dollar comedy, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one who thinks of stupidity, like "Stupid and Dumber," "Airplane," and "Wet Hot American Summer," and I have to say it's easy up there. Films are simply not written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes are such a surprise to the viewer that, frankly speaking, it's amazing that more do not know and praise this slapstick masterpiece! If you see this you will easily find over 20 quotes to quote quotes from and after you look at it again you will find more!
