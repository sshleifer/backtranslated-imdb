I saw this movie for the first time last night. Impressive! What a movie! This is the kind of movie that everyone in the world should see because it's just so cool and so interesting. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say a single word on the story because I think it would be better for the people who are cold. DO NOT READ THE PLOTS OVERVIEW before you watch the movie! I'll just say that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson, and Jeff Maguire's screenplay are top notch. I wish all the thrillers were more like that.
