If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you'll know pretty well what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. And even if you have not seen the previews yet, it does not take long to figure out what you feel like - especially a good time and a lot of laughter - from this smart satire by Reality TV. Shows and Buddy Cop films, Showtime, directed by Tom Dey, featuring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a LAPD detective and knows very well what he does; But one night, things suddenly work their way south, when another cop, Trey Sellars (Murphy), inadvertently intervenes, a television news team appears and Mitch loses his coolness, leading to a lawsuit by the television station that costs the department a few big bucks , Besides being able to get around it, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo) who works for the station and what she sees in Mitch - enough to give her boss an idea for a reality "-Popshow submit. this would be none other than Mitch Preston, whom Chase considers a real Dirty Harry. <br /> <br /> Your boss likes the idea and gives Chase the green light. Now all she has to do is persuade Mitch to attend, which should not be too hard, as the station has agreed to stop the lawsuit if he does the show. But Mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he does not want to have anything to do with anything - that is, until he's with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), with Mitch's future in mind, a heart out of heart has perspective for him , And that's exactly how the show works. Oh yes, there is one more thing. Mitch needs a partner for the show. And who will they come to with whom? Let's put it this way: Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects. <br /> <br /> This is Dey's second film as a director, his first "Shanghai Noon" - also a comedy - and he definitely shows a preference for the genre. From the opening pictures, he sets a tempo that keeps the story going, and he allows his stars to take full advantage of their respective talents and personal strengths, including their flawless timing. Of course Dey had a lot to do with stars like De Niro and Murphy, but he's the one who keeps it on track and shows he knows what works and just the right mix of physical comedy and the intricacies of dialogue with great Use effect. <br /> <br /> There is no more natural actor in the industry than De Niro, and he hits Mitch in the skin as if he was born for it. And after years of showing off sharp, cutting drama (in which he made a notable performance) with such films as "Analyze This," "Meet the Parents," and now this, he has firmly established his skills as well as making comedy. Mitch is not a very complex character. He is in fact something of an "ordinary" guy, but this is the challenge for the actor to make him credible, make him look like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community. And on all counts De Niro is successful. He's Mitch, the type you meet at the grocery store or at the bank, or you say "good morning" on the way to work. who likes to see the game on TV and has a life, just like you and me, who deserve his life as a cop. It's the character Mitch must be to get this movie working, because it makes the perspective of an "ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances" believable. It's one of those roles - and work - that's often wrongly done because it looks so simple; And that's what makes De Niro so extraordinary - it makes it easy, and does it with decor. <br /> <br /> As Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy shows a winning performance as Well, and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial glove. Trey is a policeman, but also an aspiring actor - and a bad one - and he gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the exuberant side of his personality (but Dey ruled enough to keep him from flying over) the area of ​​Jim Carrey), which works perfectly for this character and this movie. From his melodramatic stance during a prelude to his throwing out of a one-liners, which he transmitted by shooting directly into the camera (which he thinks is not even there) when shooting the reality show. Murphy is a rebellion. And he has a chemistry with De Niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected, since this is another of De Niro's many talents, his ability to connect with and produce the best colleagues of his co-stars, all the evidence Support-- are better at their craft after working with him, including Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, just to name a few. Most importantly, this is part of allowing Murphy to excel at what he does best, and he's certainly making the most of it. Russo makes the most of her role as Chase, a character who plays a role is not much artistic, but who presents herself with a strong, credible performance. And William Shatner (who plays himself) steals absolutely some scenes as a director of the show. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday (Camera Man). 'Showtime' is a comedy that is exactly what it is meant to be: pure entertainment that offers a lot of laughter and a few pleasant hours in which you will giggle after some time. It's the magic of the movies. 8.10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
