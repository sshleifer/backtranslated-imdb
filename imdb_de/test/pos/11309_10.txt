This is one of Julie's biggest tributes to music, along with her album "Trapped in the Body of a White Girl". To quote the great Medusa: "Dare to go naked, just wear your underwear, you will go home every time" - Wow !!! Well, that's good advice. "You can dance at my party! Yeah, justify your dance shoes! ... You're invited to a party in my pants, yes, come on, boy, let's dance, at the party in my pants." !!! It's almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is fantastic !!!
