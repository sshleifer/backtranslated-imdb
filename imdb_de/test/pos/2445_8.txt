The Outsiders is without doubt a classic Australian TV series. Well-defined characters, close scripts, varied and interesting locations, great guest stars and a cinematic ambience make this series a special one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Andrew Keir & Sascha Hehn from Germany does not seem to have (unfortunately) had a small screen success in his home country. The ABC has repeated the series many times, but a DVD release is not yet possible. <br /> <br /> The series is timeless. It is just as likely nowadays that it resonates with the audience, as it did in its day. Come on, ABC ... released the Outsiders on DVD !!!!!
