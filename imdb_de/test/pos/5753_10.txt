My God, that's weird stuff. Yes, it is extremely puerile, but also quite funny ("Here is the page with all the wines." "It's a bit too early for us, I'm scared.") And the combat sequences are second to none. Despite what you may have heard, the laughs are always surprisingly generous. The sheer comical skills of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson help keep it excitingly funny. Take every drop of comedy from the script. I can only compare it to "fear and terror in Las Vegas" - the movie is either hysterical or not at all; that is also true here. It's probably the funniest British movie since "Withnail and I," but to say that it's an acquired taste is a kind of gross understatement.
