This movie is excellent! Afraid to watch documentaries? Break off your shrink and take a look at Dieter's little story. You will not believe how fascinating this beautiful piece of film is until you experience it. I would like to say that it can even be seen in almost every Vietnam War movie, including Apocalypse Now. It's a real story, it's a personal story, a story about the love of flying, the pilot's dream and the nightmare of being shot down over the enemy's territory. Everything is shot in the "return to ..." style - on the spot, Herzog asks the questions, Dieter answers them with a memorable German-English accent and reminds with fine memories of what happened about 25 years ago. There is this part that I've told friends over and over again: Dieter was ejected from his plane by the US Navy and becomes the POW of the Viet Cong. For most of the days, he is blindfolded for long stretches through the Southeast Asian jungle - on bare feet. Tortured, insulted, disoriented, hungry and covered with contagious wounds, they arrive in a small, friendly village to spend the night. The next morning, after running for several hours, Dieter discovers someone who has stolen his wedding ring from his finger. That's it. He can not take anymore. He starts to cry because he is completely exhausted. The Vietcong men are surprised. Dieter manages to explain what happened. Immediately the group returns to the village looking for the person who stole the ring. They find the man, hack him immediately and give Dieter the ring back. - The movie is full of these overwhelming and surprising situations. The immense cultural differences, the clash of East and West, the fear of the unknown (ie everything that stands for America on one side, the Asian jungle and its secrets on the other side), can feel the whole movie , Back problems? That's because you spent two hours sitting on the edge of your seat, not noticing anything.
