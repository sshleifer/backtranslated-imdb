one of the best films ever ... fire ... it's not about the sociological description of India today ... it's the overwhelming use of light that never stops, never ... becomes normal ... itself if .. In that sense, the film is almost unique ... both leads are of very good quality ... the origin of Das as a street artist is quite obvious ... her performance is an excellent "Cammeo" ... but the use the light ... I have looked at it and looked at it again and again ... still angry after old times ... nothing acid in the story ... rather "pure" way to face the topic ... In a certain It is sad that in the bizarre world in which we live today, a significant work of art is usually known as a gender movie ... Fire can face Jeanne D'Arc of Dryer's or Biruma no Tategoto of Ichikawa or some of them Major -Kurosawa films, just to name a few. I wish my input could help this movie a bit to its deserved way.
