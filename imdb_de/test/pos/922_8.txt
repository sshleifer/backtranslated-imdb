In my analysis of "Trois couleurs: Blanc" I wrote that his tone is much brighter than that of "Trois couleurs: Bleu". I think it's the same with this movie. This time not because of a tragic comedy element, but much more because of the main character Valentine. Although her friend lives abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with ease and optimism. It seems to me that she is Kieslowski's image for a carefree teenager. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man who experiences great loneliness. In my opinion, Valentine and the judge are quite similar, the judge is only much older and has experienced many more disappointments. They share a different kind of naivety and both discover that they can learn a lot from each other. Finally, I would like to emphasize the performance of Ir√®ne Jacob. She completes the series of amazing female contributions to the "Three Colors" trilogy.
