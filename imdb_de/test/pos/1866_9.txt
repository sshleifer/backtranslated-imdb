I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest. This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> The real man and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly play the lead role between Charles and Emma Darwin writing and deciding to release "Origin of Species". Their consideration of the impact they can have on their family and the future of humanity are conveyed in such a way that one suspects that only a couple outside the screen could achieve anything. <br /> <br /> Jon Amiel (who gave a heart) felt introductory) and John Collee have managed to bring the biography of Randal Keynes to life. They created some very poignant and human moments, great cinematographs and sets, and generous support for the still-divisive theory of evolution. <br /> <br /> The surprise star is Martha West, who plays Annie Darwin. the figure around which much of the story unfolds. She plays the precocious girl at a tee. If this performance is something your star should use, she should be on the rise. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie, and although it's a time drama, the problems that drive it are still alive today.
