A terrific, fast-paced, screwball-like comic / drama / farce against France's implosion in 1939. Played with wide-open, straightforward faces from a talented cast and chockablock with action, satire, social commentary and authentic details, smooth, shiny hairstyles and marcelled hairstyles up to a fleet of Citroen "Tractions", a rolling soundtrack credible imitations of Charles de Gaulle and Marshal Petain. <br /> <br /> It's simply one of the best entertainment shows on the screen recently, with no presumption and "message". If movies were trains (and there's a creative replica of a steam train that works, even though there's no steam locomotive - no doubt an expensive prop), this would be a TGV.
