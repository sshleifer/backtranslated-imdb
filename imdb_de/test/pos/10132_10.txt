Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. were perfectly cast in this film. It is a heartwarming story that confirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we are only interested in it. I think there was a lot of realism in the characters. The scriptwriter did not incorporate racism into the film in a way that most movies do, which in my opinion produced a more realistic plot. Writers tend to inject racism to generate realism, usually going overboard. <br /> <br /> There are so many cities like these where people of different races live harmoniously. Ed Harris should have been nominated for an Academy Award because he was great as a Leader and Coach, when Father was realistic and had a warm, caring side in supporting the radio.
