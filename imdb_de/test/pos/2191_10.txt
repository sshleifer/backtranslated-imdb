I saw this version about ten years ago and have been looking for it ever since. I recently found an original VHS version and bought it for $ 125.00. Sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it one of the best the Broadway music stage has ever produced, you would not even think about it. <br /> <br /> Why? today a Broadway ticket. I really hope that they will release this soon in DVD form. It's a piece of music theater that screams to be seen by everyone!
