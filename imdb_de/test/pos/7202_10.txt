I must confess that I slept in the cinema during the first Asterix movie ... but this movie is just fantastic! It's really funny and leaves the first kilometer far away. There have been countless jokes and funny situations that have made me laugh since the first minutes of the film, and I stopped laughing when I reached the car to return home. I repeat: This movie is spectacular ... Obelix is ​​really funny and Cleopatra is a real baby !!
