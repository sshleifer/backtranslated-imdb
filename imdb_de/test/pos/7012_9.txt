Hello everyone you love Dirty Dancing Fans !!!! I came across this message board when I was bored one day and think it's cool. I absolutely love DD! I first saw it with my friends when I was 13 (now I'm 17) and became addicted !! I have seen it there at least ten times and shortly afterwards I bought the DVD. At that point I memorized most of the script and can always recite it when someone asks me. I had a watermelon with me ?! It got so bad that I bought the soundtrack and recorded Mickey and Sylvia's song. Most of my friends think it's a crap movie, but I do not care what they think of it, I know it's brilliant! I read the comments earlier and I have some questions for you - 1. Why are you asking trivial questions about how old Lisa and baby are? I do not think it's that important. You're a teenager in your 60s, is not that enough? 2. Where did you get this special issue that you all talk about? It sounds very interesting ... please respond. I would like to see the opinions of other fans ... Cheers! charliesangel415 xxx
