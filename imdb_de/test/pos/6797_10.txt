Two of Hollywood's big kid stars (Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney) are perfectly matched to deliver one of the classics of all time. The story of a determined 12-year-old girl whose worship for horses does not allow her to turn away from her goal to win the British Nationals. Mickey Rooney is the recently orphaned drifter who tries to tie himself up until he can follow his own dreams. <br /> <br /> A beautiful subplot reveals that the girl's mother had her own ambitions as a young girl. Again and again to override the decisions of the father in favor of her spirited daughter, the mother seems to know it best. The scene in which exhausted Taylor rushes to school is invaluable: Father protests, "Why did you let her go to school, she'll fall out of exhaustion before noon!" Do not worry, she'd be back in half an hour; It was Saturday! The brilliant technicolor, the lush music score and those beautiful faces, all of which tell a bittersweet story. Here's a good reason for the old adage: you do not make me that way anymore!
