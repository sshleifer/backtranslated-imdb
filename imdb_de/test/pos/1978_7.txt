Well, a fan of science fiction, the trailer for this movie also looked a bit like hollywood. But after seeing it, I can say that it impressed me a lot. Jude is a class actor and Miss Leigh does better than Delores Clairborne. It's reminiscent of movies like The Matrix, 12 Monkeys and The Cell, which may not sound so appealing, but it's really one of the best movies I've ever seen.
