Dark and gloomy sets, exciting music that cuts through your shoot, like Aknife (or Razor), a perfect cast, led by Broadway greats Hearn and Lansbury. This is an exciting theater that is easily transferred to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our time and Todd is his masterpiece, from the Brechtian opening ballad to the dark-humorous Act I finale - "A Little Priest", where Lovett and Todd dream about the victims who end up in their meat pies become. This game always stops to inspire, inspire and satisfy. Betsy Joslyn is also known as Johanna, even if she seems a bit crazy. Edmund Lyndeck is developing into a brave performance as the corrupt judge who craves Joslyn and is the subject of Todd's Vendetta. Lansbury and Hearn dominate the show, with only two great actors / stars able to do so. Other musical highlights include Todd's "Johanna" Lovett's "Worst Pates in London" and the opening of Act II "GOD THATS GOOD". And that's a title that describes this production.
