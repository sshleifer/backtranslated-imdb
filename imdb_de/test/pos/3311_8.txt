This is a bad, slippery, predictable, sticky, stark soap opera? "Best of all" is such a guilty pleasure to me, much like "Valley of the Dolls". I mean, "Best" has everything. Someone becomes pregnant outside of marriage (when was the last time you heard THIS sentence?). Everywhere there are affairs: drinking, retreating, jealousy and even a tragic but not totally unexpected death. <br /> <br /> Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centers of action. Their chemistry is immediate and is the glue that keeps this film from fragmenting. Suzy Parker, the great ex-model on the chart, appears as Gregg Adams, an aspiring stage actress. A role that, according to every biography I've ever read about her, did not appear to be very long. But Parker does a surprisingly credible job here, instead of asserting himself in some scenes against Louis Jourdan, who plays David Savage. Jourdan likely assumed that role for the money and special screen credit because he had clearly descended the aging star. Diane Baker is all right, as a naive, gullible April Morrison, Martha Hyer Barbara Lemont has a particularly juicy plot, and film legend Joan Crawford chews her usual scene as Amanda Farrow, another role like Jourdan's Savage, which Crawford probably took for the paycheck , <br /> <br /> There are obviously some dated dialogue and plot devices (this is 1959) and the predictability of the soap opera genre. However, if you like a good soap, "The Best of Everything" will more than satisfy you.
