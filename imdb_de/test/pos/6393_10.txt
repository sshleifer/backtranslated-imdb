If you take the Huxtable parents and mix them with the Kyle parents, you will get a perfect mix of superhuman and subhuman parents who you may wish for your own family to raise children. The best thing about any show is that parents do not act as a pompous, self-righteous upper class who knows everything, but at the same time they are not the stereotypical educated parents who are constantly abused by their children. My children are 20, 16 and 6 years old; About the same age as the Kyle children, I see so many of their situations that reflect my own experiences with my family. The stupidity they indulge in only shows that if you have love in your family, you do not have to take yourself too seriously to keep your household together and have fun with your children.
