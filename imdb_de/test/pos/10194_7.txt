This movie is an evolutionary piece - from Terminator to Robocop. <br /> <br /> Stan Winston did the SPFX! <br /> <br /> In this film, a scientist working in a weird robotics company that's really scary boss (they always are) is killed by them in a terrible laboratory explosion and put his brain in an indestructible robot body. <br /> <br /> The rest of this film continues at a romantic angle as this cyborg / man regains consciousness and confuses himself while trying to communicate with his wife, played by the beautiful (then 1986 ) Terri Austin. (He's trying to reconnect with his old life, as in this scene in RoboCop.) The rest of this movie is about breaking things while he tries to do the evil of his evil boss Defeat it by recovering it for some ill-defined 'Transform Humans into Cyborgs' Project. <br /> <br /> This film pays tribute to past films like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL - just as the cyborg can free itself, like the giant robot Gort. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the Frankenstein Suite designed by Stan Winston, the production values ​​of this film are typically Canadian: SLEAZY! ! <br /> <br /> In this movie, Pam Grier plays the role of a hired killer squad, a cheap role of people she did so often in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> As for a Sci Fi Horror B movie of 4 stars, this movie is ranked <3
