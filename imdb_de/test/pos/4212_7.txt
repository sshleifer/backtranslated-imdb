It's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods if you did not expect them. The Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys found themselves in many uneven movies and usually outnumbered their role as supporters, as in "Angels With Dirty Faces". Their presence as background to the story of a boxer boxed up for murder gives them plenty of time on screen without distracting from the main action. John Garfield is the light heavyweight champion Johnny Bradfield, a Southpaw hitter who differs greatly from the image he presents to the sports world and the press. When a newspaper reporter unintentionally learns that Johnny is a party lover, his plan to distribute that information in a column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle on the head of Johnny's manager Doc Ward (Robert Gleckler). In return, Doc Johnny's friend Goldie (Ann Sheridan) persuades him to run away with him to avoid legal trouble with the death of the reporter. As the two flee, a police pursuit gets into a fiery car wreck, and Doc's body is misidentified as Johnny from the gold watch he wore. Claude Rains takes an Edward G. Robinson ridicule that does not really work as a detective, who after years of bad arrest was taken back to the morgue. His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a pretty good feeling that the bodywork in the car accident was not Johnny. He harasses his boss with the delivery of the closed case and receives the order to clear him from the city and out of the way. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Johnny seeks advice from his lawyer and makes the wind even worse when he is cheated for most of his ten thousand dollar savings. Johnny travels across the country to Rancho Rafferty Date Farm in Arizona, which is run by a crunchy granny Rafferty (May Robson). The farm is the legacy of Granny's brother, a late Brooklyn priest, and is now home to a gang of rag-streetwear Boys (The Dead End Kids) who work on the farm. Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this case, and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dickson) becomes the romantic interest for Johnny, who is now called Jack Dorney. <br /> <br /> I get a kick of the historical perspective offered in these pre-war movies. When Johnny and the boys make a fun ride on the farm's truck, they fill up at a gas station for $ 1.28! Tommy (Halop) has the idea that a gas station on the farm is a good way to make some extra money, and with that in mind, Jack Dorney chooses a barnstorm boxer who can give anyone who can stay at the hotel $ 500 per round offers ring with him. The stereotypical premise is a bit scary when Jack is eliminated in the fifth round, but until then he has earned enough to give the orchard its own chance to fight. Maybe Grandma Rafferty should have been in the ring, she has removed almost everyone around her at the ring. When Johnny / Jack passes the locker room, Detective Phelan is present to detain him. Knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this necklace is a matter of whether Phelan gets away with his arrest - you need to watch the movie to see if I'm okay. <br /> <br /> I like the dead end movies that Leo Gorcey is responsible for, but he does not have much to do. However, he makes a great movie flare on the ticket buyer at the gate of the boxing match. Another thought - would not it have been great if the ubiquitous image on the priest's wall had been the one of Pat O'Brien? All in all, this is a pretty good entry in both the filmography of John Garfield and Dead End Kids and a fun way to spend an hour and a half. If there's a downside, pretty Ann Sheridan is not enough. The movie could be even more satisfying if the roles of Sheridan and Gloria Dickson were reversed, as the chemistry between Dickson and Peggy and Jack seemed more forced on screen than natural.
