This is one of my favorite books, and I remember seeing this series and loving it a lot. Unfortunately I have never seen it repeatedly or could get it on DVD, but it made such an impression that I have never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> The main characters were perfect for the roles, especially for the lovely Bryan Brown and although the scenes in Australia were not quite in line with the book, they were at least there, unlike the movie version with Virginia McKenna, who completely missed this part Quite different from the book, but he is still excellent. For your information "MOLEY75" "Strawn" is the Gaelic pronunciation of "Strachan".
