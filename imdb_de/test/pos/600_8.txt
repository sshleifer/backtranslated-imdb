I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released. All those years later, at the age of 37, I had no qualms about renting it on DVD. Great entertainment for all ages. And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See: <br /> <br /> Why are there so many songs about rainbows? And what's on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbows have nothing to hide. So we were told, and some decide to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see. One day we will find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers and me. Who said that every wish was heard and answered When did you wish for the morning star? Someone thought about it, and someone believed it. And look what it has done so far. What is so amazing that we are watching the stars? What do we think we see? One day we will find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers and me. <br /> <br /> We're all under his spell, We know it's probably magical ... <br /> <br /> ... Have you been half asleep? And did you hear voices? I heard how they called my name. ... is that the sweet sound calling the young sailors? The voice could be one and the same. I've heard it too often to ignore it. It's something I'm going to do ... At some point we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers, and me. Laa, da da da da daa daa, la la la la da da doo ...
