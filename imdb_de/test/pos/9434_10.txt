Evil Professor Moriarty plans to take control of SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEAPON, who could win the war for the Nazis. Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce return as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved detective and back to the screen Sidekick, Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson, in this entertaining little puzzle. Universal Studios wasted no money on fancy production or a sensible script. They knew that the two stars would be the magnet of an audience. Rathbone as the cerebral ego and Bruce as the limping id seem to actually become the characters they create, happily keeping their faces straight while they are dealing with the most absolute nonsense. Dennis Hoey makes his first appearance as a stinging inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard; Together with Bruce, these two good-hearted but pedantic colleagues can save the intellectually superior Holmes life twice. Lionel Atwill, a master of the dark, who deserves more credit for his talent, does a good job as Moriarty. He makes the evil scoundrel into an enemy worthy of Holmes' steel, and enjoys the scenes in which he can inflict torture and pain /> <br /> William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne play the Swiss scientist and his Girlfriend who is at the heart of the puzzle, but they do not have much to do. The sweet Mary Gordon appears as Holmes-landlady Mrs. Hudson. Rathbone spices up his already classic interpretation of Holmes by appearing three times disguised during the story, revealing that to the viewer. The big fucking kid was basically a bit of a ham actor. <br /> <br /> This film - loosely based on elements in Sir Arthur's short stories 'The Dancing Men' and 'The Empty House' - followed SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR (1942) and went SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON (1943) ahead.
