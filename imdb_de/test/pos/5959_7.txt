I've just watched the movie, which is actually pretty good. The trailers had given me an impression of another Dujardin One-Man show-turn film (Ã  la Brussels by Nice) or an expensive, stupid French comedy. Surprisingly, it is none. Secret Agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he knows it, though I've always found out that James Bond was stupid but behaved like a smart ass. The dialogue is witty with a lot of humoristic humor, which one would expect from a British instead of a French film. The women and the music are beautiful. A refreshing journey into the past, when the bad guys were ex-Nazis or Soviet beasts, cars shone and France had colonies!
