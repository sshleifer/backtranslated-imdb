I would watch this movie every time it was over cable and never got old. Who can forget some of the best lines in film history? --- Johnny's FAT BOY BURGERS !! Johnny's FAT BOY BURGERS !! and look between the huge melons! I wish I could walk the whole city in such a fun treasure hunt. It's an absolute favorite and I'm glad to hear it's on video! I'm sure MTV got its original premise for the Road Rules series here.
