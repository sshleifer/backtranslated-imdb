When I saw Gone with the Wind, I thought that there could not be better actors than Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable for Scarlett and Rhett, but then I saw the movie Scarlet. I fell in love with this dramatic story. I love Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler, he is fantastic. This is a movie I could see a thousand times and still would not bore me.
