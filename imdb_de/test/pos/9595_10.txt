As one critic has commented, this television comedy is one of the best football parodies of all time. But ... after I did not manage to film it on the first broadcast, I now think that it is not available in any format. Okay, this has only received 17 votes so far, but an average of 9+ seems to be something special. Basically, I think it's unfortunate if you missed it because it's not available for viewing !! Aaaaaaaargh.
