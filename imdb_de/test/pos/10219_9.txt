This movie is masterfully directed by Clive Barker, he really knows how to establish a relationship between the audience and the characters. I think there is no continuation for this one, Barker should have dedicated himself to continuing this film instead of making the boring master of illusions. But I also think that NBreed for this reason and because of the lack of continuation has become a dark cult classic horror films.
