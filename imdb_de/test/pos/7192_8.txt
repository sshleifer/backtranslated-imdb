The second live-action excursion for Asterix is ​​far better than the glued-together elements from ten different stories that were referred to as the first movie, instead staying pretty close to the original comic bet with Caeser to build a palace in Egypt to show that the Egyptians are a great people. Royal Architect Edifis seeks the help of Asterix, Obelix and Druid Getafix to accomplish his task. There are several loud moments, some jokes that only the French could get (jibes in the 35-hour week), while others are more universal. The big budget special effects are spectacular, but are overshadowed by the jokes from the original comic. <br /> <br /> Depardieu and Clavier still work brilliantly as a couple, while Monica Bellucci is perfectly staffed as Cleopatra. For fans of the comics, the funny pirates also get a glimpse of their absence in Film 1.
