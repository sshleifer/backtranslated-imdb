Julie (Meg Tilly) is a high school girl of the type "Goody Two Shoes," determined to prove herself, and embraces the rituals of "The Sisters," a small clique driven by a dull homecoming Family headed, will be subjected to Queen Carol (Robin Evans). The sisters suggest spending the night in a mausoleum for Julie's final test and getting ready to drive Julie to the wall, unaware that the late, abusive clairvoyant Raymar is buried there and intends to bring chaos beyond the grave <br /> <br /> While this debut photo for Tom McLoughlin ("Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives" and "Sometimes They Come Back") is limited by its obviously low budget, it's McLoughlin and his crew Being able to handle that counts. It's really scary, unsettling fare; If I was under the age of 10, I might have scared the fear of the stuff, and even at my present age, it has still taken me to a degree. <br /> <br /> Some of the effects look cheesy But the handsome-looking corpses and Goren are created by Tom Burman, an experienced make-up artist who, though he's more of famous names like Winston, Baker and Bottin is overshadowed, has a good resume with other films like "Cat People" (1982) and "The Beast Within" in his favor. <br /> <br /> What I liked most was a true sense of foreboding and atmosphere, an aspect missing in some of the current trendy horror movies in our multiplexes. <br /> <br /> Tilly is sweet and appealing in her role, having recently completed her debut work in "Tex" before moving on to "One Dark Night" was completed some time before its release in the theaters in 1983, where it actually did good business in the first few weeks, the other actors are doing what they need to do well enough, to the familiar faces in de The minor cast includes the equally appealing veteran singer / actress / spokeswoman Elizabeth (also known as EG) Daily, Kevin Peter Hall, who does not play a creature character, but unfortunately ends up with little screen time and none other than Adam "Batman" West. The wife of director Nancy, who would play Lizbeth in "Jason Lives," appears here as the spacey girl in front of the arcade. <br /> <br /> It's a decent B-level horror entertainment, maybe too cheap for their ambitions. and maybe not so smooth (hey, McLoughlin * was * just starting), but definitely good for some showers. <br /> <br /> 7/10
