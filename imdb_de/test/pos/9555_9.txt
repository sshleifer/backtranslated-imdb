<br /> <br /> This is the best imitation documentation of a dog show I have seen in a long time. A very long time. Well, honestly, ever. Is not that part of the charm? The idea of ​​actually bothering to make a film that mocks a documentary about an event that most people find strange. Even if there were no big laughs, one would still grin at the thought. Every film that tries something new scores in my proverbial book. I loved the dogs too!
