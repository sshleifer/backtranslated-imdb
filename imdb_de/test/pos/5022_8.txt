I have made many international trips, both on business and as a tourist. For both varieties, I assure you that the best advice is also the oldest: always drink the wine of the country. In this film, the Archangel Michael comes down to business on earth, quickly packs him in and decides to hang around a bit. Boy! Does he drink "the wine of the country"? Could man be drunk forever with alcohol, love and struggles? Nights. <br /> <br /> These are things you can not do in heaven, so he enjoys them while he's here! Of course, it turns out that he had a few other tasks to complete. If he is less in front of them than in the first, he is just as successful. The final scene is a bit sulky, but it's also wonderful. Jean Stapleton dances with John Travolta.
