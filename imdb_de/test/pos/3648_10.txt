People who claim that some of what Looney Tunes' cartoons are unsuitable for children seem to have forgotten something: they were not originally intended for children. They were produced for the cinema to be screened before feature films, so they could show what they wanted. "Tweety's S.O.S." has the damn pudding when Sylvester finds Tweety aboard an ocean liner and boards the ship to reach him. But two things are against New Year's Eve: Granny protects the canary vehemently and Sylvester gets slightly seasick (we do not see how he pukes, but with his green face they make it clear that he did just that!) And then he has the apparent cute tweety of course a bad track. <br /> <br /> It's just great to see how these cartoons were not afraid to give everything; whatever they thought about it, they showed. We must understand that cartoons should not always be a nice conversation for kids. Really funny.
