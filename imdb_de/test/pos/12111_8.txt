Klaus Kinski appeared in a considerable number of spaghetti westerns in the 60s and early 70s; He was usually cast in secondary parts as evil villains. Kooky Klaus gets a hefty starring role as Crazy Johnny Laster, a nasty, restless and confused sex-madman who sets out to kidnap a beautiful heir to preserve her considerable legacy. Johnny and his gang become sought-after refugees after the plan has turned catastrophic. Author / director Mario Costa skilfully crafts a formidable portrait of a seriously ill and twisted, snooping, wicked work: the plot evolves at a steady pace, the sound is accordingly somber and serious, and the exciting action scenes are staged with real stunts and skill Brio (the shootings in quarries are particularly exciting and exciting). Ironically dressed in white, oily charisma from every lazy pore, and every chance he gets to jump on beautiful women, Kinski's Johnny makes a fascinatingly scary and monstrous blank. Kinski is just spectacular as this gorgeous repulsive character. He is supported by lavish Gabriella Giorgelli as sweet, fiery salon girl Juanita, Steven Tedd as happy Riccardo, Giovanni Pallavicino as ruthless gang leader Machete, Giuliano Raffaella as clever lawyer Gary Pinkerton and Paolo Casella as Johnny sensitive partner Glen. Kudos are also fine for Stelvio Cipriani's moody and spirited score. Worth seeing for Kinski fans.
