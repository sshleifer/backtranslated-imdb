In "Landscape After the Battle" Andrzej Wajda shows in the second epoch of his career as a filmmaker emotional and psychological confusion in a former Nazi prison in Poland, which was released immediately after World War II explores many extreme close-ups and vibrant colors. The final credit as graffiti on flanks of freight cars concludes the film symbolically. The soundtrack is great, except for Vivaldi, who sounds sticky in pop-art fashion in the opening sequence.
