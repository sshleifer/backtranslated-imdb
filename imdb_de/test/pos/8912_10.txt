Alien Warrior (or King of the Streets) is one of those '80s gems that you accidentally stumble upon, and then marvel at how wonderfully stupid and on top of that it gets. <br /> <br /> A rather fat alien arrives on Earth (LA, to be exact) and stumbles into a world of drug traffickers, gangs and corrupt cops. He falls in love with the shallow-haired, pretty teacher, who only wants to help children from the inner city to read more. He also manages to annoy a kokagespitzenden drug kings spur, who vows to destroy him. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this movie for the first time ... sure, it's funny, stupid and cheap. But you realize that the filmmakers had their hearts in the right place, and damn if that thing does not work! I just pray that it will soon be released on DVD. <br /> <br /> It has a hot soundtrack, breakdancing, violence, nudity ... all with a positive, healthy message! Do you see it
