I swear, if I've ever tried cocaine, I could relate perfectly to this movie. The tempo and dialogue are performed at a speed that some viewers may need to pause and relax their minds. <br /> <br /> There are great little elements that move through the film, like Rob Lowes The character always seems to lose a shoe, or how some characters run spirals around his zigzag path. The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems to be flawless. <br /> <br /> The film stinks of awkwardness and cuteness. I think that could be the most fun. A few moments of laughter, even if you were alone, make sure that I'll look at it again.
