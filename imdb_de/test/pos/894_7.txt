You know that you see Softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm fine with the crappy lip sync, but the sound mix is ​​really good too. Every time someone says something, it sounds like a narrator. In any case, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly camps of Joe D'Amato that include cannibalism and so on. Do not get me wrong, there's a good deal of exploitation, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser Stars, and that's a good thing because she's hot. It's a bit crazy, as you sometimes see her bone structure, but she still rules her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game out of how often she takes her gear. Frequently. Every reason is good. Every human being is good. Every location is good. In one scene, even a whole hockey team is involved, no matter what they do in Africa. Sometimes the storyline gets in the way, and the minor cast consists of really bad people, but there are enough Laura Gemser for everyone.
