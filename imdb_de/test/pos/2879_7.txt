This, ladies and gentlemen, is really a modern B-movie. The dialogue is stilted and comes with wood rigidity, the premise is predictable (there are a few decent twists) and the characters remain for the bulk of 2D. And yet there is a certain ... charm. WWE wrestler Kane brings to life the sick, twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos (though he looks something like his character he's been playing for ten years), and I find it rather amusing when people say it's "not much reach for him," but Glen Jacobs seems pretty nice, so it really is. In any case, he is perfect as a huge beast and the deaths are appropriately exaggerated (Jason would be proud), but I've heard at least four applause breaks for four different killer scenes. Honestly go into this movie and think that you have a bit of fun and a gorefest, oh, that's all Gorefest. The R rating is well earned and in some graphical times I felt a little sick. Definitely a very, very funny, but pretty bad movie.
