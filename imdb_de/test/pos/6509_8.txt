- That's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this movie. I just saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and it rocked the house. Director Doug Pray is never seen in this documentary, and I believe he is even heard, but he has been very busy with the life and history of the Mixer. He has divided his film into about eight chapters, and then his colorful, enthusiastic group of interviews will grow through, depending on what they're talking about. I've never been "scratchy", but the film is a wonderful job for those who know little, to remain elemental and to joke for those who are themselves experts in the field. Mix master Mike from the Beastie Boys is in this movie, but only after the movie could I name some heavy hitter of the industry (DJ Shadow, Q-Bert, etc.). The extreme fascination of the turntables of these talented and quirky DJs shows in their explanations of what their music means to them. The film casts a little happy light on these guys (and a woman) to qualify as musicians. Pray does not let his movie become idle, and if there's a slow scene, it's soon revived by barely-stopped music. Last but not least, this movie increases your slang vocabulary. I have to "dig" again, so I end this meeting. See, it will be of interest. Good stuff, man. Good stuff.
