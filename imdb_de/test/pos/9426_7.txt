Since others have complained about bringing Sherlock Holmes into a contemporary environment, I will not do that. Basil Rathbone could have fit into any era with this voice, this savoir faire. This is a beautifully composed puzzle loosely based on The Dancing Men, one of Conan-Doyle's best stories. Instead of the original conspiracy, the men become part of a National Socialist plot. Holmes becomes the spokesman for the British war effort. His opponent is Moriarity, who seems to die often enough to keep up with the central figure in the Friday 13 movies. He is certainly creative, but the Rathbone Holmes is unshakeable. Watson is just there. He does not get much stupidity in this movie, and that's a real plus. The plot is complex enough to hold the interest. There is a final speech that is almost a parody of itself. But then I can not be critical of a time and a nation under great pressure. If they had to call Holmes, so be it.
