A city in Japan is taken over by a terribly brutal abstract form: the spiral. It becomes a topic in everything, from animals to clouds, to people and to turning them, mentally and literally. This movie shows how it happens to several groups of people. Part of a demonic obsession is implied, but nothing is completely safe, except that it's best to get rid of the Dodge. The film is developing really well from normal life over abnormal phenomena (giant slugs and crazy people) to the truly supernatural (dead). <br /> <br /> As a dry American horror movie, this was exactly what I needed. Maybe it was just the novelty of a movie of another culture, but it seemed like a very original progression to have a set of characters, and the premise was definitely new. The Japanese like "Horror Shapes" (uzumaki means "spiral", I am told) are now old, but it was nice for me because I'm used to monster / alien / virus / disaster / undead movies. In an American movie you know who will die (the annoying / evil / lascivious / racist characters) and who will live (the kids / heroine / dogs / cats / nice guy). In Japanese horror that is not true. It was unpredictable how they would fight evil or how it would end. It also had this really new (but probably Japanese) paint leached from the Pacific Northwest style cloudy newspaper, which was a new visual effect for me. The terrible moments were seriously scary and relied on a little thrill, but mainly exaggerated facial expressions (think about the ring) and body manipulations. This should be one of the greats, with uniquely original ideas like the first Nightmare on Elm Street or Night of the Living Dead.
