Having just seen this, I can not believe it is not better known. This and the slightly better known, but almost equally shamelessly neglected COME AND SEE (Klimov, 1986) must be two of the biggest war films. They are significant, powerful, incisive. The ASCENT is also presented by Schnittke with a sparingly used, but brilliant trenchanten score.
