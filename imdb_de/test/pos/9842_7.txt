This was one of those social dramas that WB was able to assemble and guaranteed box-office hits in the 1930s. These early "dead-end children" are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. Cagney, a gangster in a deal, is named commissioner of the school. He does not take it seriously at first, but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys. The idea is that the boys govern and manage their community. Whether this is a solid social reform is beyond belief, but it is a film. It is very similar to Boys Town with a slightly darker tone. A useless happy ending curbs what had previously affected the scene, but is still good. WB would do this later with Bogart in the Cagney / Paternal role.
