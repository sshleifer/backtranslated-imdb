It's really a great movie (after ignoring Blake Edward's Pink Panther clues that he seems to be obsessed with and extremely irritated with). Julie is as always wonderful - she sings and plays brilliantly. I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema at Haymarket, London, on its release. Julie's non-appearance at the British premiere of STAR! was very unhappy and (apparently!) due to the aerial photographs of Darling Lili about Ireland. A reasonable apology if she'd appeared in one of these aerial photographs, but she did not. Two Kinoflops in a row ruined their film career for several years. But Darling Lili deserves just like STAR! Much more public recognition.
