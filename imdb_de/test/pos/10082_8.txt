I saw this movie twice, both times on Cinemax. The first time in his unrated version, which is softcore porno at its best, and the second time in a pulled-down (cut-sex and most nudity) version that was entertaining in a typical beach movie style. The unrated version has a great sex scene with Nikki Fritz, a guy and a bottle of oil that is out of this world (no pun intended). Unfortunately, this scene is almost completely cut out in the slimmed-down version, as are all other sex scenes. Rated or not rated, it's still fun to see all the siblings of bigger stars (Stallone, Sheen, Travolta, etc.) try to act. We also have performances by B-Queen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin from the old Batman series).
