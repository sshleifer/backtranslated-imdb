This depiction of the lost Japanese forces in the Philippines is a feat in the utter futility of war. It is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after the Second World War. In the film, Japanese soldiers were left alone in the jungles of the Philippines. In the face of impending hunger, they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose what is left of them. To call this film depressing would be an understatement. The viewer remains completely desperate for the lost value of life in modern combat. The last scene is almost too nihilistic, but the movie is still a worthy statement. Highly recommended.
