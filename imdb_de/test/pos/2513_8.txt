This is an unusual film, because despite being made by Twentieth-Century Fox, he is one of the few pairings of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had made films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount, and Selznick) at about the time she was making THIS IS MY AFFAIR, but Taylor was an MGM contract player, so he only appeared in that movie because he was with Fox was borrowed. Something that studios did occasionally during this time. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting because a lot of real-life people have roles in the film, even though the play is otherwise fiction. You see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I can not remember a movie with McKinley or Dewey as a character, though I remember Roosevelt from THE WIND AND THE LION and a few other films. Three cheers for a "smaller president" in a movie as a main character! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with McKinley setting aside a young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) and asking him to be a special agent for him - and not telling anyone - even the Secret Service. The president fears that someone in the agency is tipping a gang that has committed a long series of robberies - all based on insider information. So it's up to Taylor (who is NOT known for his male roles - especially at this stage of his career) to pose as a thug and find the responsible gang AND the inner man. <br /> <br /> However, there are two serious complications. First, while he can find the gang members, Stanwyck is one of the gang members' stepsister. Taylor feels he has fallen in love with her, but he must also fulfill his duty and hand them over to the authorities. Secondly, because McKinley is the only other person who knows the truth, serious problems arise when McKinley is murdered and Taylor is on death row for the crimes !!! <br /> <br /> The film has done a good job creating a story and placing it in a historical context. While most people today do not remember McKinley or remember being murdered, the film plays in this interesting time. The acting is pretty decent as the stars are supported by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, though I have to admit that Donlevys role was pretty tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles. All in all it is very interesting, well written and not too juicy in the romance department. A good trip for everyone.
