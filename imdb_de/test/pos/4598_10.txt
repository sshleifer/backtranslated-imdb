I'm not sure why there are no articles or posters about this movie because I just saw it and thought it was WONDERFUL. I think it's not for everyone, because it's basically Kafka's "The Trial" meets "Beevis and Butt-Head", a rather difficult combination to swallow. Still, I thought it was great. If you want to see it because you want a sequel to Office Space, you'll probably be disappointed. If, however, you want to cast one of the most brutal, acidic and comically righteous looks at where our society is right now, then you'll be looking forward to something. I just saw the 8:00 pm opening night in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the movie is likely to be over in a week. That's a pity, because Idiocracy is in his own way one of the best satires that has come along for quite some time. But on the other hand, it basically just makes fun of the people who make up about 99% of the movie goers. I think it's no wonder that the studio panicked and tried to take it off.
