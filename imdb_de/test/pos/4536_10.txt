This is one of my favorite comedies. Chris Farley is weird as the felony fool, and David Spade is perfect to play Farley directly. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the two is brilliant. The scene, in which the two in the car to superstar of The Carpenters sing along, is a classic. <br /> <br /> Chris Farley was a great comic actor who had amazing potential - unfortunately he will be missing /> <br />
