Many people are flaming this film because of the presence of Paris Hilton, but this is not a valid reason to contradict the film. The reality is that Paris plays a relatively minor role, it spends the vast majority of the film off the screen. The movie also makes fun of her several times, mostly with a camera and at least once in the night. For those who like the on-stage presence of Paris Hiltons, this may be a movie that you can see at home when it's released on video, because at the show I was with, we all laughed at their misfortune in the movie and she is called a "woman of questionable values". <br /> <br /> The film itself was pretty good (as opposed to the recent flood of faint horror films), it has everything a good horror should; a creepy villain, excessive acts of violence that make this average person wince ... this movie hit all the basics. It's definitely worth a watch.
