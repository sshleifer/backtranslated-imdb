John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief, Arsene Lupine. No one knows for sure if this is the case, the inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is sure but can not prove it. So Lionel spends much of the movie following John - hoping to catch this shiny and slippery thief. <br /> <br /> Although I liked the movie, I really think I had higher expectations and thought it could be better than just a very good time pass. That's because John and Lionel Barrymore got together in the movie, and since these brothers were such dynamic actors, I reckoned with sparks and magic, but instead just glanced at them here and there. Now that does not mean that this is a bad movie - it certainly is not. It just is not that far to be unforgettable or a movie that I strongly recommend. Thanks to an adequate script, the film is pretty good, but I was surprised to hear no French accents in the film, even though it was supposed to be French! There was not much life in the movie until he was almost done. The ending was indeed excellent and entertaining - so good that it raised the movie from a 6 to a 7. It's nice to see that it ended with a high note.
