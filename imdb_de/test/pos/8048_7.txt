Epic early film, directed by D.W. Griffith Mae Marsh, her little sister and her dogs are orphaned - they have to go to an uncle to live there. On board their trainer, the young couple Lillian Gish and Robert Harron celebrate the birth of their first child. The bus arrives in Elderbush Gluch. Marsh's uncle tells her that she can not keep the dogs and they are expelled. Nearby there are Indians (Indians); and, Indians like to eat dog meat (no joke?). These Indians are hungry! Lionel Barrymore understands Ms. Marsh and wants to help her find the dogs that are out of control. In the rescue of the puppies, an Indian is shot, leading to a confrontation between "Cowboys vs. Indians". <br /> <br /> This "saga of the American West" is certainly an important movie; The trusted Griffith performers, however, begin to dupe their hands, and the story is to be invented. Many of the Griffith elements are present - some good and some bad. "The Battle at Elderbush Gluch" foreshadows the later epic "Birth of a Nation". <br /> <br /> ******* The Battle of Elderbush Gulch (28.03.14) D.W. Griffith ~ Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Lillian Gish
