I do not understand why everyone bombs so much. I thought it was a great time that unfortunately was not popular enough to be so famous. Believe me, I have seen much worse. If you want to see a bad movie, you'll see Blood Shack or the alien dead or something. So, what is normal Slasher fare, but better than most others. And it is visible. This movie also has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. Part of the music is very exciting. And the death scenes are cool too. We see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words SOLD in blood on the mirror, and we also get a cool double hit with a toilet butt! attached to it with a razor! This was a good fun of the 80s Slasher who is definitely worth your time even if others talk about it.
