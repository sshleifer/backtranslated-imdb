We have titles around the world when it comes to competitive features at the Split Film Festival. China, Korea, Canada, USA and Australia and many of these stories show that the world is really a valley of tears. Modern love ... that's for sure. <br /> <br /> In this film by Alex Frayne, two younger married people and their boy travel from the city to the coast to visit the tomb and home of the man's uncle, who has reared him long ago and there died mysterious circumstances. The coastal village seems to be something of an American horror movie in which the village is bizarre and humans are unusual mutants. But episodes in Alex Fraynes Pastorella can not be described as horror in the normal way. In fact, this is an extremely interesting drama in which relationships and horror can be seen through flashbacks and more. In this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors, we will be showing a peepshow with charming eccentric Australian films. Such is the case of Frayne. Always something new and fresh. Visual intelligence and the unique sensitivity of some Australian directors is surprisingly good. Fraynes movie is great. There's something in the Australian landscape that makes her films so special, as we see in FRAYNE's Modern Love and RAY Lawrence films Lantana and Jindabyne. <br /> <br /> In future titles from Alex it seems to be the same Frayne
