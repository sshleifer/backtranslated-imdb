The Duchess and her three kittens enjoy the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, who looks back on a great legacy, decides to double them and take them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar landscapes and the wrong streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irresistible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in the heart. After getting a taste of the vast, dangerous world, he leads them home and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse. As always, it's the voices rather than the animation that make up the heart of Disney magic: Phil Harris is as brilliant as O'Malley, Eva Gabor is the Duchess ... well ... Eva Gabor; But the most memorable twists come from Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn the old hunting dogs Napoleon and Lafayette into a few murmuring Southern Rednecks. Her scenes with Edgar and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool-dude band are classic. Most impressive in seeing The Aristocats is how deeply Disney's animation style has changed since he was up to date in 1970. Perhaps the nostalgic, dated feel is just the result of a performance in the Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are more awkward (a shame) and the animation and the overall tempo are much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than more recent efforts like Aladdin.
