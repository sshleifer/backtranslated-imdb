Stefan, a German freshman, travels to Paris during the summer holidays, where he falls in love with a mysterious young woman whom he meets in the Parisian freak scene. Then he follows her on the famous island of Ibiza, the hippie joint met Wolf, a man who throws knives of the Hitler Youth, owns bars and hotels and holds Estelle with Dope under his thumb. The couple is trying to escape Wolf, Stefan is addicted to stupidity and jealousy on Estelle, which is groovy and free. Great photography and music, plot is quite common for this time, but no exploitation, cold and dramatic. The morale is pretty strong (he was looking for the sun ...), but I would not say that it is a movie against drugs, even if he is poisoning the drug.
