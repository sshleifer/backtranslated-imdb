When it comes to political films, I usually get away from it all. They generally take a certain moralistic stance and they have a clear good vs. bad story, as if it were some kind of Batman movie. <br /> <br /> But with Lumumba, it's the first movie I've seen that showed politics for what it is, and the real problems of trying to rule a land of broken people who have no other rule than that Know violence. There was neither good nor bad, there were only interests and conflicts of interest. In my opinion, this is the only political film that really teaches you something. For anyone pursuing politics as a career, this film shows that you can not decide what you want for a country, but what the country wants from you. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I disagree a lot I think they come from too idealistic, (the Belgians want the perfect colony, Lumumba wants a perfect Congo unit, Tshombe wants wealth and wealth, America wants the perfect ally against communism , Russia wants the perfect help for communism). And the Congolese? They are exploited and abused (the best example in the film, when Général Janssens tells his black troops that your government has lied to you and stirred them all up). You're always being forced to support this or another person /> <br /> This film shows in politics that a mistake can cost you dearly, and every movie makes one mistake after another until it escalates and destroys the country , Their intentions may be good (or at least in the minds of the characters), but it is the fault of all who lead to the fall of the Congo. I do not think anyone in this movie is bad. I think they want too much of people who are fed up and want to start taking. All in all, it's not just the best political movie a great movie in general. The acting is fantastic (Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba was perfect casting, I really believe). The script is immaculate, the tempo is perfect and the production value is higher than I would have expected for a Central African movie. A must to look at it.
