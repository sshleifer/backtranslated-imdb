Six out of seven people who have taken the time to comment on this film have very positive answers. The one negative review is on the first page of the movie in IMDb. <br /> <br /> I found "What Alice Found" as one of the best movies that almost nobody has heard that I have seen this year. The rating of 6.4 is misleading and may depend more on the difficult topic than on the quality of the film. Who would think that a movie supposedly about car prostitution would be worth a visit? Guess again. <br /> <br /> For me, "Alice" was a positive psychological thriller. I was all the time on the edge of the seat. It is a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well staffed. In a fairer world, actress Judith Ivey would win prizes for guessing whether she's good or bad. Ignore the rating and see this awesome movie. (By the way, I wish there was a soundtrack album.)
