Three children are born at the same time, during a lunar eclipse. Only before their 10th birthday, they begin with a murder rush. "Bloody Birthday" is a typical slasher from the early 80's. Evil children never create a threat and there is almost no tension. There is no thrill or fear at "Bloody Birthday", but the movie is mildly entertaining, it's pretty cruel. For example, we have death by a pistol, a baseball bat, a jump rope and a shovel. So if you're a fan of early 80s Slasher movies, take a look.
