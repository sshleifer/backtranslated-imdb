I was totally surprised how good this movie really is, because when I saw it for the first time, I was only slightly amused! However, I have to say that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor did not get a bigger and better role! He was an enormous talent. <br /> <br /> There is great chemistry among all the main actors, and Matthau has never been funnier. <br /> <br /> I am incredibly happy that this picture was taken we see Lemmon and Matthau for the last time in the team; in a vehicle that uses her talent very well. Brent Spiner proves that "Data" from Star Trek the Next Generation is not the only good character he can play. <br /> <br /> The plot is really pretty simple, but the comedy and the characters work really well and I laughed heartily in this movie and I highly recommend it.
