(This review contains a huge spoiler, but I do not know how to explain it without revealing it.) I've just seen "pinoccio's Revenge" just a rip-off of child's play. In fact, there are similarities. However, Chucky was a possessed doll that works independently of the child. It is possible that Pinoccio is possessed or cursed by a demon or something. The doll itself is actually completely inanimate. The KID is crazy, and THE KID is the one who kills people! Everyone, including the audience, the survivors and the child itself, believes it is the doll. But it is the KID. <br /> <br /> Nudity is almost a pity, otherwise I would say it all, because it really is an interesting horror movie.
