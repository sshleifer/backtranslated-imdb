Comedy puzzles from the 1930s about "The Crooked Circle," a gang of crazy crooks planning to kill someone who swore to oppose them. An enjoyable, but really inconspicuous little movie. The movie works simply because the cast of Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both dropped out of this series together later in some of Hildegarde Wither's films after Edna Mae Oliver) and a movie supports great cast of actors and actresses you know that they do not know the name (so I can not name the missing name). For an hour the wind raged, making no sense with false identities, secret passages, ghostly music, and people who are not what they seem. It's the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a late night sightseeing, if you're nostalgic for the late-night show.
