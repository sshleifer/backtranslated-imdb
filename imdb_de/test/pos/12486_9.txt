H.G. Cluozot had difficulty working in France after creating "Le Corbeau" in 1943, which was produced by the German company and later judged by the French as anti-French propaganda. Louis Jouvet, an admirer of Clouzot's work, invited him to shoot the thriller "Quai des Orfevres," where he played an ambiguous police inspector who was investigating a murder at the Paris Music Hall. Without any other knowledge, seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure (Suzy Delair) and her jealous piano companion husband Maurice, who is immortally in love with her (Bertrand Blier, father of director Bertrand Blier), try to cover up (without the knowledge of the other). what do you think as your involvement in the murder? Enter the stubborn policeman (Louis Jouvet) who is determined to discover the truth. Jouvet has stolen the film almost wonderfully cynical and sentimental. "His character, his eagle-like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "Quai des Orfevres", humorous and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses, was a great comeback by H. G. Cluozot, the good director "French Hitchcock".
