This is indeed a very long movie. But it's pretty good and a good example to show why cinema can be considered art. A story that can easily be told is not to be expected in Les Amants RÃ©guliers, but every scene, every silence here tells far more than a hundred dialogues. Touching, different, perfect in images and soundtrack, it shows why the completion of cinema as one of its key features has become the greatest innovation in any dramatic performance. Someone who is used to these kinds of films, in which everything is told and actions take place, will find this tiring. But it's worth discovering other ways to feel a story.
