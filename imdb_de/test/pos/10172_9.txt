The original man, who knew too much, brought Alfred Hitchcock to the fore for the first time outside Britain. One reason for the success, of course, was that people wondered how Hitchcock could bring so much on screen with such a tight budget compared to the elaborate Hollywood products. The original film was shot in a studio. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason he chose all his films, Hitchcock, who now has an international reputation, and a large Hollywood studio (Paramount) have decided to see what The Man, that knew too much would be like a wasteful budget. The film will be filmed on location in Marrakech and London and has two major international names for box office. This was James Stewart's third of four Hitchcock films and his only affiliation with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock movie. <br /> <br /> I wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance, she would fit in with the profile of the blond actresses favored by Hitchcock. Perhaps because her healthy screen image contradicted the sophistication that Hitchcock wanted among his blondes. <br /> <br /> Doris plays some of her best roles in The Man Who Knew Too Much. Her best scene is when her husband, James Stewart, uses her tranquilizer before telling her that her son was abducted by an English couple who made her friends in Morocco. Stewart and Day are wonderful in this scene. But Doris especially because she registers four different emotions. <br /> <br /> Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and meet the Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the English couple Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie mentioned above. Gelin is stabbed in the back in a marketplace in Marrakech and whispers to Stewart a few dying words about an assassination attempt at Albert Hall in London. Your child is kidnapped to ensure her silence. <br /> <br /> For the first time I think of a hit coming from a Hitchcock movie. Doris actually plays a well-known singer, who has retired as a wife and mother from the stage. The song was Que Sera Sera, and I remember it well when I was nine years old. You could not hear it without hearing it in 1956, it even competed with the fast-growing Elvis Presley this year. Que Sera Sera won the Oscar for the best song, beating titles like True Love from High Society and Around the World in 80 Days. It became Doris Days theme song for the rest of her life and still is, should she ever want to come back. <br /> <br /> Actually, the song is pretty well incorporated into the plot, while Doris sings it at a message party at the climax. <br /> <br /> Instead of shooting with mirrors, Hitchcock shot the assassination scene in the real Albert Hall. As other critics said, it was not directed, it was choreographed. You'll be stuck in your seats right now. <br /> <br /> This was a remake that's worth it.
