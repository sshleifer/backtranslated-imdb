>>>> Author: msgreen-1 from Canada >>>> The big problem was the claim "China syndrome". If the reactor failure occurred and radioactive waste leaked, it could burn directly through the earth to China. Many people have made fun of it and if the filmmakers meant it, then it should be funny too. The overflow would not make it near the center of the earth or even the molten rock. Even if it were the center of the earth, how would it come out in China? It would have to flow the rest of the way against gravity! Even China is not the other side of the world, the Indian Ocean. <<<<< ......... ......... ........... ............. ... ............. ..................... ................ .. .............. ............ ...... .......... <br /> <br /> This point is addressed by the characters of the film and explains that this of course could not happen because the core would hit the groundwater and trigger a radio -active cloud that rains on the population. <br /> <br /> Before you try to find a weak point in the movie, you should first watch it !!!! Do not judge a book by its title ...
