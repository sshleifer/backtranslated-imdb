that's more than a Sat. afternoon special. Very well written, if very reserved, here is a lot, if you are looking for it. Catch, for example, the cat companion / scout. It could not have been just a comic, it should have been a comic. The comic industry (as well as the publicists of the film) missed the boat. One of the least known really great movies. A great script by John Sayles is a strong point, but the acting is good too. Probably the best "superhero" movie I've ever seen. Short for special effects, but for credibility. This is a guardian. I've never seen a DVD of this movie before, but I used to have a VHS version. Good Hunt
