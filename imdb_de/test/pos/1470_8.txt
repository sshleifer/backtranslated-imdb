Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, are finally leaving their grueling schedule to talk to the cameras while drinking champagne in their hot tub. When I saw this, at first I did not feel so much sarcasm as in this one. I knew they were joking when they complained about various actors on the show and when Trey said he would not give his mother any money, but there is so much sarcasm that this documentary is more of a mock-up piece full of insider stuff. jokes. <br /> <br /> This "documentary" shows everything about South Park (except the second season). It shows what goes on behind the scenes of the animation and the recording. There are interviews, many of which are fake interviews, but some give insight into the show among all the factories. Shown are clips from the two Trey Parker shorts Spirit of Christmas as well as many good clips from the show. If you were a fan of South Park, this would have quenched your thirst for show knowledge in 1998 when this happened. Of course, the show has changed, but that's still interesting. <br /> <br /> What we have here is an amusing documentary in which Trey Parker (especially) and Matt Stone act as arrogant idiots, and that's exactly what it wanted to go for. They may be like that in real life, but here it was a joke, a 51 minute revealing joke. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** from ****. 51 min. Not rated, contains language and sexual content.
