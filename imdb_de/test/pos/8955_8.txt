There are, as many reviews have stated, a strong dark streak in this movie. The director he most remembers is John Landis (yes, go ahead and howl, what a peasant I am). Arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a grim, gray way, then turning around and exploring the horrors of life with a carefree touch. <br/> <br /> The cast is invariably above average. As a david, Thomas Gibson is superb as an atmospheric and self-deceptive center around which the other characters revolve. He speaks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he wants to admit. Gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993. It was difficult to look at him and see Greg Montgomery, let alone Agent Hotchner of Criminal Minds. Perhaps not the best scene, but the ones I enjoy Most, my "retreat scene", is the section where Candy is expecting one visitor, and one uninvited person after another appears at the door. As Candy's interpersonal environment gets more and more out of control, David becomes more and more snappy, spirited, and enthusiastic, like a gaunt Gen-X "Tigger."
