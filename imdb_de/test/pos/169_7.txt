This movie is great. 80's Slasher movie about three children born during a solar eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. The reason they kill makes virtually no sense, but it only adds to the charm of this film. Dang, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie, you know who I'm talking about. The child is ready! Although the movie does not have much gore, it's entertaining and for some reason, somehow, it's about the characters. It also has a nice nudity. Also has a decent acting, really a decent 80s Slasher movie. It's worth a look if you ever get a chance to see it. You'll have nightmares about those damn kids, I guarantee you!
