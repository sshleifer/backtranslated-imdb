This movie set the standard for all rock biopics. This was achieved through the energetic achievements of the leads, the steadfastness of the camera work (avoidance of "rock video" clich√©s, which were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), taut editing and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as a human and not as a symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot and random details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be a debate between the families of the person involved about specifics. But here, as in the much younger "I Walk the Line" or Carpenter's famous TV Elvis biopic from the same period, it's about whether the life of the actor in his time and place is a catalyst for the ideals of the fans and Appreciation manifests itself in performance, and this is clearly the case here. We get rid of this movie and not only understand how Buddy Holly became a star, but why. I do not see what else to expect from the movie.
