Human Traffic is an insight into an average weekend for a group of friends. It's a flying look into their lives (and their heads) that shows you how this group of friends relate to each other. There are many moments when everyone can relate to something, like talking about the trash at parties and talking about trash with strangers. The characters are all the people you can identify with, and they are believable in the roles they play in the movie. The situations in which they find themselves are all situations in which we have all found each other, and here this film is successful. The topics of sex and drugs are treated excellently so as not to hinder the relationships between the characters. The story of the movie is not everything, but that's not a criticism. This is a movie about people. This is a well-written movie with a soundtrack to die for. Pete Tong from D.J has put together a great selection of tracks for this file, making it all one of the best movies I've seen in 1999. After watching this movie, I felt like I had been celebrating all weekend. Fantastic movie! Jo Brand as the voice of reality - I have to say more! <br /> <br />
