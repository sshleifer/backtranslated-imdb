It is always interesting to see a line in a movie that is somewhat prophetic for the future of an actor. In that case, I was intrigued by Edward G. Robinson's statement to Barbara Stanwyck - "I promised you the Valley" as he discusses the lonely inhibitions of his attempt to control the entire country in Logasa. Ten years later, Stanwyck starred as the Barkley family matriarch in The Big Valley. Somehow, I thought she could have looked older in the previous picture; I think all those bright dresses and fancy riding outfits have a way to highlight its youthful side. <br /> <br /> As for my summary, Lee Wilkison's assessment of John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of those just-mentioned outbreaks shortly after Parrish used his knowledge of military tactics, is a series of Wilkison's To throw out their hands after raiding his ranch and setting fire to his house. I liked the way the movie explored its character, starting with the foreman Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) in a calculated showdown. Preparing for the ambush was also a skilful maneuver that diametrically opposes the strategy of battling the bad guys against both while both sides fight to the last man. Parrish also had something to say about that - "Never meet the enemy on his terms." <br /> <br /> "The Violent Men" is a good title for this film and was probably at the top of its class in the mid-fifties, though by today's standards it does not come close to the blood you get in a "tombstone." "or" Open Range "will find where the balls make a nasty wildness. But it's marked by outstanding performances by the Principals, with a subplot that investigates infidelity that seemed almost ironic, considering that Stanwyck's character was cheating.
