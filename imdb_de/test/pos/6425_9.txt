A very revealing psychological thriller! Footprints is a stylish example of the 70s of Italian filmmaking. And Luigi Bazzoni, a falsely underrated director and visually amazing author. The film develops its unusual plot with an incredibly exciting atmosphere and does not disappoint, especially in its sad and dramatic finale! Florinda Bolkan delivers an excellent performance, rich in nuances and touching sensibility. She can be a dark lady who is not only fascinating, but also painfully real and tragically lonely. But the cast is also a pleasure! Purple Kedrova, Nicoletta Elmi (the mysterious kid on the beach), the Italian screen legend Caterina Boratto and the stunningly beautiful B-movie queen Evelyn Stewart in the protagonist's girlfriend's short but powerful role! And Klaus Kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo! It's strange to see how incredibly well made movies like Footprints were! Vittorio Storaro's atmospheric and creepy cinematography, stylized film locations and sets, Nicola Piovani's haunting film music and, above all, the story, so intense and disturbing, so intelligently coordinated and structured! A thriller with fantastic elements, but above all with soul and personal vision. I wish films like Footprints would not be forgotten! I wish the films were more enlightening and personal today than in the 60s / 70s! And yes, I wish someone would soon make a digitally remastered widescreen DVD from this little masterpiece!
