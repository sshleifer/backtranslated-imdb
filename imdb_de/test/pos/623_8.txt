Well-crafted low-budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake off a stick, and on the way also a lot of scary humor. <br /> <br /> The cast is playing it very well, although Richard's centered film director is sometimes a bit hard to take. The tiny, two-scene cameo of Sir Alec Guinness, who is a threat from Moscow as a crime czar, is simply the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> It's always worth seeing, but not alone in dark nights!
