After reading all of Sarah Waters' books, I was looking forward to a BBC adaptation of Fingersmith. Especially since Tipping the Velvet had been done so well by old, trusted Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the results. I think that this could be comparable to TTV; both romantic and entertaining. And not so many ignorant people would make you believe, a senseless lesbian move. I've been a fan of Elaine Cassidys ever since she saw Felicia's Journey's innocent turn. I thought she embodied both hard deception and a growing fragility as Maud. Her transformation was believable and impressive. I recognized Sally Hawkins as Zena Blake of Tipping the Velvet, a small role, so I did not have that much expectations, but she was amazing in the role of Sue Trinder. Her eyes were fascinating, transporting everything from anger to absolute despair. The two, who worked together and combined these talents, made this drama unavoidable. Of course, Imelda Staunton was, as always, amazing, she is clearly a national treasure and the minor castes were all at a high level. Even the direction of the somewhat unknown Aisling Walsh used contrasting, but beautiful blues for Briar and Brown for London. <br /> <br /> However, scriptwriter Ransley has to receive so much praise. Making a 600-page book in which each line is of the highest quality, making it a three-hour extravaganza is a tremendous achievement. He highlighted the key revelations at a steady pace while giving us a lot of background story and character development. He has my full admiration. <br /> <br /> In summary, a brilliant adaptation in which everyone involved gave 100%, making it one of the best BBC dramas I've ever seen.
