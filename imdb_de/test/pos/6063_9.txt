This production, which is based on real Danish crime stories, is an experience of excellent governance, acting on all levels and has a nerve that is not often seen in crime series. Every episode is exciting because it looks like the whole team believes that "this is my life now - these murders or murders are my responsibility to solve" and the output is brilliant. <br /> <br /> As a spectator, you just have this wonderful abundance of entertainment, because it feels like it's focused on you, intentionally or not. Lie down that you DO NOT decide to have a good time ...: o) Do not miss this one, it's just right under 'Band of Brothers' quality and an experience you have to see - what for a wonderful time!
