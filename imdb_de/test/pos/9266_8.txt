This movie is so different from anything you've seen before. It is an honest and frightening account of the struggle of a whole family with a deadly disease. <br /> <br /> "The Closer She Gets" is shot in a unique style. Craig Oulette films in a different way ... with different angles and perspectives, which I find very striking (perhaps because of his experience with photographic work). <br /> <br /> His style gives such a clear picture of what is not only the patient herself, but also with which beloved loved ones she is nearby. <br /> <br /> A very sad but extremely interesting and unique movie. I would definitely suggest one.
