Dirty Dancing tells the story of Frances 'baby' Houseman (Jennifer Gray) and her family spending the summer at Kellerman Family Summer Camp. We see her discovering herself when she falls in love with the dance teacher Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). <br /> <br /> The movie is full of wonderful dances (hence the title!), great music and grandiose scenery. It deals with some difficult dignity and grace issues and of course has (shocking spoiler here!) A happy, wonderful ending that feels good! You know how it will end right from the start, but that's not really the point here. The point is the journey, a journey that touches every family member. <br /> <br /> It's one of the movies I need to see when he's on TV ... no matter that I've already memorized them!
