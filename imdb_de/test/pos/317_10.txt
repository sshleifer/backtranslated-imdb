As I browse through the hundreds of comments that true readers of the IMDB have posted in this movie, I find it very interesting how few comments are "in the middle of the road." Everyone loves it or he hates it. After watching Apocalypse Now about 30 times and recently breaking it down to DVD (how have we ever lived without these magical digital machines?), I can say without hesitation that I'm one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this movie. "Why do you want a movie that is so confusing?" Ask many of my employees. The answer is: forget the war, forget the brutality ... This is a classic history of society that protects itself from those who refuse to agree with the status quo. Brando stands for the individual who does his own work. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the work, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted "standards" of death and destruction (am I the only one who worries that we are "standards "have for death and destruction ????), so that they send the" conformity police "to turn off the person. Hmmmmmm .... Do you draw any parallels between this and the things you see every day? With the deepest respect for Mr. Coppola, whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time, he has surpassed his original intention of the film and probably did not even realize it until the film was released. The subtle subtext that pervades the entire film has far too much to offer, rather than being planned and presented. Instead, she seems to have "grown" like a wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. I have to repeat it again: I think FF Coppola has completed the entire production as well as Cast and Crew, but the sum of the film exceeds the individual effort tenfold. So if you have not seen the movie yet, lend it, look at it, look at it again and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then will you judge the quality of the film. Those of you who have seen it, look at it again with the mindset described above. I think you may have a whole new appreciation for the movie. Or maybe not! Whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give Coppola recognition for its masterful narrative style!
