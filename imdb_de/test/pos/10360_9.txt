I saw it for the first time at 5am on January 1st, 2009, and after one day I saw it again and I would like to see it again. Love everything (well, almost 9 stars) about it. No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, camerawork, music. Sometimes you just want to hear a little longer and the music just stops. But that's not a musical. I like Anna's acting, this naive wannabe gangster girl, how she talks, holding the gun, everything makes me smile. No, it's not so funny, though sometimes I laugh, it's just so subtle. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Although 3D Nouvelle seems to be weaker, they are also gangsters, maybe even worse, because they are stealing ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. Feels so warm and romantic. Yes, I would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a fondness for such Art Housish movies. And I do not agree with those who compare it to Pulp Fiction. It's not about action and twisted story, although all the vignettes intersect. It's quiet and maybe too slow for most people. It's about characters, their feelings, very subtle. Anyway, this review is probably not of much help to anyone (my first). I just wanted to express my appreciation. No wonder nobody noticed this hand in the second half when the kidnappers decided to go home? Looks like part of the crew, hehe. I know that I should post this better in forums, but I do not agree with some guidelines here.
