A touching story told with tenderness: The awkward young Jewish girl in World War II makes friends with a German prisoner of war who escapes from her clubhouse. They talk about their life and their beliefs (he is against Hitler), she sneaks food for him, he becomes their only friend and ally. It all reminded me of the much better movie "Whistle Down The Wind", in which Hayley Mills has made friends with Alan Bates, but the direction that is smooth or the performances that are sterling can not be doubted. Kristy McNichol, who was mature in her early years, wears most of the image and never hits a false mark. When the prisoner is discovered (and Kristy is also found), the movie suddenly becomes very hard. Her father, shocked and ashamed that his child would band together with "this Nazi," attacks her with a quiet rage that I've rarely seen before (he tells her "you're dead to me"), what a small one Girl must be devastating). The last scenes are not copied. There are no big reunions, no highlights. The girl has to face the world and learns a bitter lesson about neighbors, friends and family. An amazing movie.
