A dreamy, breathtakingly atmospheric film takes place in 1955 in a small town in Northfork, Montana. The government officials come to evacuate the city before it is flooded by a new water dam. There are the other visitors in the city, the angels from another time, but they were only seen by a dying boy Irvin. A local priest (Nick Nolte in a quiet, heartrending performance) looks after the boy. Irvin asks the angels to leave the place with them ... <br /> <br /> There is some weird quality in the movie, some dignified sorrow and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of everything - the human and the their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know them. Death and birth have something in common - we go through it in the last solitude. <br /> <br /> I can not remember the movie that touched me as much and as deep as "Northfork", the movie so beautiful and so tender, so quiet and so powerful, so heartbreaking and moving. Even now, after a few weeks since I saw it, tears are coming to my eyes, just thinking about it. <br /> <br /> After I saw it, I had to talk to someone about it. I sent a PM to one of my friends and asked, "Please tell me what I just saw." And my friend replied, "You've just seen one of the greatest films of modern times, and someday others will see the light."
