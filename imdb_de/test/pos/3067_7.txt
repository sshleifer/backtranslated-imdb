Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but sometimes he even has a clinker. The beginning of it almost begins essentially only with one character after another. They have Cary Elwes, who is charming and talented, but can not make a comedy. His expressions in the camera show that even he can not believe the inconspicuousness in the script. Richard Lewis looks bored and distracted without much to do, and Amy Yasbeck is in high school drama. Dave Chapelle shows great comedy series that invade and bang for the camera, and Mark Blankfield is mostly strangled in the role of the blind man, but still manages to show a great comedy series. Eric Allen Kramer does not have much to do, but the few scenes he has are authentic. The best roles are those of Roger Rees, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks when he appears. Dom DeLuise has a fun twist on Mafia Don with a look by Clint Eastwood, but on the downside, some of the jokes are not very funny, while some of the really funny ones from Mel's other films seem to be stolen.
