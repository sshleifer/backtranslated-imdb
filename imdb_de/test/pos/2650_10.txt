Of course, as a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange, there was "no question" that I had to see this one. However, I've given it up way too long, because some of my friends dismissed it as "a total waste of time" with comments like "extremely boring" or "nothing happened". But when I saw pictures of the mysterious black monolith on the Internet, I was allowed to see an impression of the exquisite experience of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I had no doubt that I would rent this movie that same evening. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be the biggest visual experience of my life. Of course it can be wonderful to see a very good painting or a very good picture, but when you see a movie that is built with the same virtuosity in every frame, it takes on a whole new dimension. My God ... I like my friends a lot, but it is a pity that I can not share with them what makes my heart rise with excitement and makes my mind fly like a bird in the sky. That thing, my friends, is beauty. As this film will show, beauty is terribly underestimated in our technologically advanced, intellectually flat and consumer-driven Western fast food societies. However, that does not mean that I reject or look down on these fast-moving societies (and not Kubrick either), only that they can be so much more if only people paused for a moment and took some time to absorb the beauty the world in which we live. And what is the better opportunity to do this? Then slow down the elegant tempo of this movie and let yourself be transported to this place between awakening and dreaming. <br /> <br /> When we go to this place, it is possible to get a so-called "natural high". It is something that our mind can do when we meet pure and limitless beauty. And never before in my life was this "natural high" or "spiritual orgasm", as it is called by some or "samaddhi" by others, been more intense. Yes, it is more intense than a normal orgasm ... actually several times more intense. Many religions have claimed that feeling proves that they are right. Are you right For me, a direct answer to such a question would only affect the impenetrable, fascinating mystery of the universe. In my opinion, the film tries to convey the same riddle through the depiction of the black monolith and the following considerations: "With the exception of one very strong radio emission directed at Jupiter, the four-million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inactive, origin and purpose are always another mystery. "The trance that Bowman is experiencing is the same that I experience while looking at these beautiful pictures. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that the mystery can be frustrating for those who need direct, fast-food answers to big ontological issues. Instead of comforting us, the awareness of the simplifications contained in these answers constantly irritates us. The doubt and discomfort later evoked makes us refer to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all these difficulties, while in fact we have only our simple answers to blame. However, this film shows us that if quick ontological statements only raise doubts, we can always rely on phenomena to make sense of the world. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can really be presented to us only as a phenomenon, and never as a "thing in itself," the mysterious black monolith is no longer annoying, frightening, or irritating, but rather intriguing , adorable and maybe even comforting. We do not need an answer to what's really out there to come in contact with one of the greatest forces of our lives. If we can leave the mystery as it is, even hug ... we can finally bring our souls to rest. I'm pretty sure that a movie that has so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be surpassed. Especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us.
