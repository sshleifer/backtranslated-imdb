The story in this movie is a pretty implausible B-class stuff, but the script called for a scary guy to star in, and in 1940 this meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is the most terrible in this matter, as the island owner Stephen Danel, who is released prisoners in his custody to work in his diamond mine. On arrival, the probation officers discover that they are slave laborers who can be beaten or killed by Danel as the mood takes them. <br /> <br /> Only two things seem to be worse than the slaves. Danel's wife and monkeys. Monkeys make him so frightening that his violence against them probably leads to the only flesh the slaves get. <br /> <br /> Lorre is perfect in his role here and sneaks up to the canvas in an industrially capable way. Although the script is not a Casablanca caliber, the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. This is a very interesting story, but I'm not sure which niche this movie filled. Too long for a short topic and too short for a full-length movie, I'm not sure how this was marketed in theaters. <br /> <br /> I just got it for the first time on a late night / early morning morning TCM shows. Lorre fans will not want to miss it if they have not seen it.
