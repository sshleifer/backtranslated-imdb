Gray can let the English language jump through tires like no other. He tells a series of events linked by writing a manuscript (the "monster" of the title). Some of them are sad, some excitingly funny, all in their characteristic, sarcastic way. If you like swimming in Cambodia you will love this one. I actually thought that would be a bit more interesting and better than swimming in Cambodia. A true masterpiece.
