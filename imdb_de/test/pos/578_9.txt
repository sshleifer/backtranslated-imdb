First of all, before reading my review, I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can not believe anyone could rate a movie like this negatively. (Luckily, there was only one.) I mean, I can understand that somebody does not like "Star Wars" because of the whole sci-fi genre, but no movie with some of the loveliest puppets in human history is almost sad br /> <br /> Okay, I will now leave my soap box and go through this movie. <br /> <br /> 'The Muppet Movie' came out at the age of seven. All my friends wanted to see this movie as a birthday movie. I think I saw it in cinemas about four times in the first month. <br /> <br /> As a kid, many things attracted me to this and all the other Muppet movies and TV shows. The singing was probably the most important. Most songs in 'The Muppet Movie' are classics. From "Rainbow Connection" to "I'll go back someday," they're entertaining and thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I almost see 'The Muppet Movie' in a very different light picture. Yes, the things that have thrilled me as a child are still there, but it's the little jokes and those that are just funny. I mean, if you think about it, Jim Henson is a sick man. <br /> <br /> Kermit is a frog and falls in love with a cute pig wearing purple gloves and could cut karate in two. Fozzie is a stand up comedian bear. Gonzo is a "whatsoever" infatuated with chickens. Then there are two old men who pant, a piano-playing dog, a rock band with a crazy drummer, a Swedish cook you can not understand, and a bunch of other characters that are just eccentric. <br /> <br But for these and other reasons, Henson entertained millions of children and adults and gave us all something special to watch. <br /> <br /> "The Muppet movie" will always be in my heart for many reasons, but the biggest one is because it's a movie that feels good to me unlike many current children's films In addition, I'm not bored with jokes that have come down to the level of my children. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie that will be remembered forever.
