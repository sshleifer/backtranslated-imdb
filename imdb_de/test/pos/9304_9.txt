There have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb. The Robert Taylor movie ABOVE AND BEYOND (If you think so, believe that the Army Air Corps in the person of Paul W. Tibbits ran the entire show!) Produced by NBC ENOLA GAY (probably Much closer to the brand) and the BBC TV series OPPENHEIMER with Sam Waterston in the title role. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY follow the same approach as the BBC series, but make it wider; It avoids the "Gee Whiz" technology of the Manhattan Project and focuses on human aspects. the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide range of mythical but rather typical people involved in it. With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, presenting a dreamy academic from the Ivory Tower who strives to relate his contributions as a physicist to his propensities to look at the world in a broader social and moral context ... just to fight this win by an overwhelming greed for personal power and honor. The day after the Trinity, it was made clear that Oppenheimer considered himself a "superior being" because of his vast, far-reaching intellectual ability. In the end, that was the fall of Robert Oppenheimer; He saw himself as a kind of "philosopher / king," a moral and intellectual superior who (rightly so to speak) could prescribe "wise," which was best for the rest of the world. Development and use of nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, wisdom does not determine the actions of nations or the direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom lends no temporal power. When he tries to exert such a non-existent force (as Oppie found, when he rejected the development of "The Super", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have the power. <br /> <br /> I found that I accused the Schultz character in some way; His oppie, despite the doubts and fears ripped from his intellectual base, is too close and personal to the Manhattan project. The real Oppenheimer should have chosen a different approach; At the beginning, he would have had to make a firm decision that the project would eventually lead to success. The ugliness that developed along the way would be a random price that must be paid to achieve this ultimate good, and it must be ignored ... at least until the project is completed, when it's time to evaluate the profits and There were losses. Oppie did so clearly, and in his controversial post-war statements, this led to science now knowing sin, and this was a knowledge that it could never lose. <br /> <br /> As the project progressed, such considerations had to be set aside if he wanted to maintain his sanity. <br /> <br /> Schultz's character is weak due to this ambiguity. A frightened little boy who NEVER could have acted as a "Rapid Rupture Coordinator" when Oppenheimer unofficially dubbed his post. Paul Newman's attitude to Gen. Leslie R. Groves is intriguing and a bravura performance, albeit possibly a small bite above the roof. <br /> <br /> Groves was a civil engineer but first and foremost he was a SOLDIER and a general! He is used to things going in his direction ... intensely driven, a spoiled, bad-tempered child who has tantrums, who reveres his country and is not too proud to fall to his knees and pray. In other words, very similar to REAL (ie NOT Civil Engineer) soldiers, also known as George Patton! Not only does Grove's MISSION come first, it's his ONLY consideration ... feelings and egos are damned, except for his OWN course! <br /> <br /> Groves could not admit it, but he knew he needed Oppenheimer; Military rank meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had in between. <br /> <br /> Again ... I have to criticize the script for that reason, for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In reality, Groves already obsessed Oppie; Otherwise, Oppie would never have been selected for the post. The story tells of MANY cases in which other scientists, some as outstanding as Oppenheimer, have moved away from Grove's recruiting efforts. At one point, Groves was so desperate that he suggested DESIGNING the physicists he needed. <br /> <br /> Grove's attempts to maneuver and control the movie were UNNECESSARY ... they exist only as a dramatic instrument that actually helps make the atmosphere of the movie pretty ugly. <br /> <br /> Kusak's "Michael Merriman" is made up of several real characters, but from a different time frame. In the POSTWAR weapons research, several research accidents similar to those presented occurred. <br /> <br /> Merriman's overdose of radiation causes another ugliness in the film, which, in my opinion, is necessary and fairly accurate. People with weak stomachs will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences. They are all too real. <br /> <br /> The main idea, but not strong enough, IMHO, is the great truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists involved were young, idealistic, naive and talented. Most were on their first excursion from the shelter of the campus. For them, the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budget or "excessive" bureaucratic oversight. <br /> <br /> It was not only her brilliance, but her youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. <br /> <br /> There is enough to worry the thoughtful viewer about this movie. However, if you filter out the Hollywood BS (there's not really much of it), this is probably a pretty close look at the interior of Manhattan Project.
