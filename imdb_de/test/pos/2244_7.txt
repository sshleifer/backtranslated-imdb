Age of Steel follows the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some ways and lacking in others. RotC had some positive elements, of which Tennant was most important to the doctor's outstanding portrayal. In fact, his kind of feeble-minded dizziness still carries his own restraint in superiority to this writer, the shadow of Tom Baker's Doctor, with his kind of subconscious mind (as in ticking off periods of time when Mickey holds the button in the Tardis) a la McCoy's doctor, as he blends the events around him. Some critics and fans whose plays I've read seem a bit dismayed that such a young actor portrays someone over 1000, but I can not agree with that. Tennant's doctor actually carries "the weight of the world on his shoulders," as he points out in this episode, and you can tell by his almost complacent characterization when confronted with Lumic / The Cybercontroller at its peak. His world-weary, open-minded "anothermaniacherewegoagain" attitude is refreshing, especially after Eccleston's excellent pseudo-working class, bada ** interpretation of the character, more of the man of action than Tennant's fresh-faced pseudo-doofus. Tennant's best moment may be to the end when he restores the Tardis with his big, stupid baker grin as the Tardis start over. Here we begin to get a feel for this new doctor, a character that is little more than the different personality traits of the average person, divided into 13 different people. some contradictory, others more sympathetic than others, but all part of a whole. Besides, those two episodes were passable but weak. The concept of reviving the Cybermen is very much welcomed, and they look awesome, but the conspiracy involving a parallel Earth on which this action takes place does not seem to work properly. Although the allegory of man is excellent on technology and its need to serve it, as the doctor makes clear, this could easily be on or near Earth today. Some other weaknesses, as others have already highlighted, are the ease with which the physician and his staff come out of the bottlenecks, viz. the death ray from the Tardis component, the seemingly endless uses of the Sonic screwdriver (my wife laughed as they used it to burn through the rope ladder at the end, barely observing who, so I had to explain that.) traditionally used as a plotter to get the characters out of situations that have no other escape! Acting was lacking, especially Mickey, who really needs his guilt and a few minor crews. Lumic was scary, as it had to be, his voice even sounded like a cyberman. The score, however, was terrible, with the volume of music often flooding the scene. Overall, I found Rise of the Cyberman more entertaining, though the second half was passable. The construction of what we knew was inevitable is going well, but the resolution was disappointing. Too many unlikely escape routes, no development of side occupation and not enough tennant in my opinion. This new show is superb and Davies is moving in a good direction, but the dialogue (outside the doctor) needs to be tightened, as Mickey's farewell ham was.
