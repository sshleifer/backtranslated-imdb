Former reviewer Claudio Carvalho has rendered the details of the plot much better than me. Most of all, I remember that it was so beautiful in every way - emotionally, visually, editorially - just great. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content I think you'll be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual piece of art. <br /> <br /> On a scale of 1 to 10, I would call it about 8.75. The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it's a sentiment. If you're in the mood for a really artistic, very romantic movie, it's a 10's. I definitely think it's a must, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so a total of 8, 75th
