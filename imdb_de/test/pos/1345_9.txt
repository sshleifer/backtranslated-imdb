Oh my God!!! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my liveliest childhood memories of the 70s. Two hippie chicks with ponytails, Carole and Paula, swung on swings, told jokes they had pulled off the giggling stain, dressing up in costumes found in a huge chest called The Storybox, arguing with a pesky pink squirrel called Sherlock, who lived in one of their trees. You could also play a base acoustic guitar and sing a nice tune. This was a great childhood show. Very 70s feeling. But that's the problem: they do not do such shows anymore. Too bad that. You could say that these two girls really had golden hearts and loved children, they were really cute. MAGIC GARDEN is one of the shows that people would buy if they came out with a box set, because it's such a MILD thing to go down the Memory Lane.
