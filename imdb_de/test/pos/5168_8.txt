The joy and tragedy of the Christmas season lies in the fact that it is mainly about the family. That is why some people call it "children's vacation". With age, natural signs of wear and progress remove the people and the things that have made us special memories. John Denver plays George Billings, a successful New York architect and new widower, who lost his wife about a year earlier in one of his sweetest roles. His life focuses on his 9-year-old daughter Alex; Both are still grieving for their loss. George tries his best to make his daughter a special Christmas. Enter his boss, Thomas Renfield (mischievously played by the wonderful Colonel Flagg of M * A * S * H, Edward Winters), who sends George to Georgetown, CO, to explore a potential real estate deal. George and Alex prove that the purpose of the journey is more of a vacation than a job, and they fly into the city, where they are immediately struck by a group of loving but slightly eccentric characters whose biggest eccentricity is that they all believe in Santa Claus. Georgetown is a picture-book community we would all like to live in and we would love people for neighbors. George soon finds a love interest in Susan (Jane Kazmarek.). If not the Grinch (Renfield), it would be an ideal time. However, the fact is that he is in town to develop Renfield, and there is a beautiful ranch near the city to be ruled out, and the dark edges of the film revolve around the imminent foreclosure and reactions of the city Townies Rancher and the outsiders. I will not spoil the people who have never seen the movie before. It's a typical Happy Christmas ending, but it's handled in a rather subtle and believable way that shows the best in the human mind without being too syrupy. All in all, this is a very enjoyable way to spend some of your Christmas TV hours. John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have good chemistry and Gennie James as Alex does a really good job. I've always loved the work of Mary Wickes, a recognizable character actress, and all the other performers work well with less meaty parts. This is a normal Christmas dinner for my family. I rate it 4/5.
