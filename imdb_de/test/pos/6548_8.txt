After discovering the Ring trilogy, I greedily devoured all the other Japanese and Korean films that were on or off the train. I've certainly pressed some of my buttons, though I can not say the movie has much Make sense. I'm squeamish, so there were several points in the movie where I just did not want to see what was happening on the screen. The movie made me nervous, and I was worried to see things that I thought I would see. <br /> <br /> It's an imaginative movie that offers a lot of visuals. There are also food for thought. And a lot of stuff to argue about when the movie is over. <br /> <br /> The characters are, to say the least, well defined. Could you make such films in the West? <br /> <br /> So it makes no sense in the end, but if you have an appetite for the occult, the supernatural, the bizarre, the otherworld, then no. The film will provide a final, all-explanatory reward.
