When I saw a secular modern movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (22), she asked me, "Since you saw movies in 1938, what's the best movie of your life?" Boy! What a choice that is! I needed the whole summer of reflection and changed a few times before making my decision. It is "THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE". This movie has no defects. It's a movie in which each of the supporting characters and dialogue is essential to the story as a whole. There is not a single part in the film that could be left out. The fixation of the young girl with his brothers, hands missing, the man comes home to young adult children, who grew up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man who is responsible as a soda shaker and the leader of a young boy Mann is a group of men and received medals for his action. A woman who now has to adapt to the husband who has not been alive for a long time. The realization of the people who were in the safety of their safe victims of ordinary men there. A look into the life of loving and living together with a man without hands. A first look and a reaction of the parents to the new deformities of their son. A man accustomed to making a life-and-death decision immediately, and had to return through the conservative banking credit structure. This is not a sympathetic, chapped, heartbreaking act. THAT WAS THE REAL LIFE! It could not have been shown differently. This, my friends, is how it was !! This can easily be considered documentation. Please do not switch off black and white on this day of color film, as this is one of the best black and white shots you can shoot, edit, and direct. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would compel anyone to study and report on this great example of the filmmaker's art to anyone studying history, filmmaking, creative writing, sociology, family counseling, or psychology.
