I have heard about this documentary for so long that I knew that I had to take the time to look at it. As a documentary, it is very well done, as it has a neutral, attentive view of their experience. There is no voice output or interviews. It's honest. It's true. It is also humiliating. After the movie was finished, two comments stayed with me. For one thing, the boys were told that they should not be like the American boys who wear the big pants, and there's time in Africa, but no money, but there's money in America, but no time. The biggest impact was how the boys hungered for education and how one of the boys completely relocated to go to school. I saw this movie with a high school graduate who said it bothered him to see the boys brought to their new lives with no real orientation to America. He also said he knows so many American teenagers who just can not understand how blessed their lives are in America. I would agree with him on both counts. A strong movie where someone has to think about many things.
