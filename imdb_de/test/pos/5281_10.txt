Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless, soulless CGI movies. The pastel and crayon backgrounds were a surprise after Sen Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) and Hauru no Ugoku Shiro (Howl's Moving Castle) were so stylistically similar. The style worked well for the movie and was done exceptionally well. The time and effort required to animate this is greatly appreciated as it gives the characters so much more life and the details and care it requires make the movie so much better. There are several great scenes in the movie that offer a lot of movement and action. The biggest thing for me to be a scene was Ponyo's sisters, who turn like fish into massive waves while she walks on them. The story is simple but pretty well written and played through. The plot continued to focus on character relations and while not as well played as in Tonari no Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro), it is still great. I felt that every character had adequate screen time, unlike Spirited Away, which had so many distinctive characters that it could have spread to a whole series. My only real problem with the movie was the end. The way he is formulated in the English version, at least gives the impression as if S≈çsuke get a big test, which is only about him, the ponyo's mother promises that he will love Ponyo. But when I think more about it, I think that the translation may not be so specific to the actual meaning that the test is the promise and that it really means deep. The movie, however, seemed to end abruptly. Besides, the movie was great and I highly recommend it.
