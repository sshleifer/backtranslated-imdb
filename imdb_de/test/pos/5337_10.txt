A great animated film that reaches the level of oldies like "The Lion King". <br /> <br /> I saw this with one of my best Belgian friends, who also saw the show on TV. I was lucky because I did not know that people in Belgium knew "Wallace and Gromit". <br /> <br /> When it started and started this good old theme it brought back memories when I saw it when I was 5 years old. <br /> <br /> The humor itself was very funny. Some nice scenes in sitcom style, some wordplay or just jokes. The animation is not that impressive when you know the series, but it's still fun to see how it's done. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: Not only can I be happy and entertaining, some humor can easily appeal to older people, so I say go and see "Curse of the Were-Rabbit".
