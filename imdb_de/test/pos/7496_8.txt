OK, so this movie is NOT well known and has not been released very well. I've discovered that this pretty brutal gangster was created by a random accident in one of Sky's millions of movie channels late on a boring evening, but I'm glad the launch sequence for this movie is fantastically weird in a very dark way. This is indeed what I think is the general tone of the movie. I think a lot of critics and movie fans who have actually seen this movie are a bit unfair, just denying it as a low budget gangster movie in the vein of Reservoir Dogs.OK. So, there are undeniable similarities between Thursday and some other genre films it was compared to, but in all fairness, I think: The movie takes a much darker comic look at this kind of movie, and the end result is a captivating, well-made, funny, if not completely original movie. Tom Jane is good at it and deserves the recognition he hopes to thank The Punisher. His performance as a bad guy went well is realistic, funny and just cold enough to make you believe that Casey was really a bad ass before he reformed. That's another thing that highlights this movie for me, the characters. In Nick's gang, you get the strangest trio of criminals ever assembled. a smooth, charismatic, but very cold leader (Nick), a triggering, happy, blood-loving, sexually predatory bitch of a woman (Dallas) and a psychotic hillside pub with brains with a love for torture (Billy Hill) ever seen on screen, beautiful played by Mickey Rourke, and you have a recipe for ... well for Thursday, really. Sometimes it is a dark comic, sometimes brutal, sometimes unoriginal, but always captivating and always worth watching
