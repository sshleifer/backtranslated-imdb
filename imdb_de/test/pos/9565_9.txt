I saw this film open-minded and did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was written, directed and played so that every minute of it is a delightful watch. People do not seem to act like actors, more like real people who really train dogs and lead the lives depicted in this movie. There are some wonderful moments when you laugh or giggle, some jokes are dry, but presented in a highly visible way. Highly recommended!
