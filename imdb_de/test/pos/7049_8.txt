I know, that was a silly movie, but I really enjoyed it. It's one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says "Bill Murray." I almost always like underdog movies and this movie has more outsiders than you can count. It's a friendly movie overall - some of the adults are not packed tight, but the laughter is more acceptable than brutal like so many teen movies these days. The rich kids on the other side of the lake are beaten, but no one I know agrees. I never went to camp, but I did some things that were a bit parallel, and most of the "bits" and tricks were true. They were sometimes understated, but I'm sure this was an accident. The cast did well, and Bill Murray showed what he would become. It's not Groundhog Day or Broken Flowers, but hey, a good silly laugh should be appreciated these days, but then ... it just does not matter ................. ... ...........
