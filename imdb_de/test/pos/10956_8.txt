Hello; Belmondo! Look, there's Anna Karina! Great American improvised New Wave (or Independent want to call it that), not as good as Godard or Truffaut and not flawless, but hey, realism, style, warmth and humor. I love this NY accent. "They know nothing!" "Forget it". Just like the French New Wave are young people. celebrate, fall in love or just hang out. Lelia Goldoni is so cute; She is adorable; wonderful. Ben Carruthers' also good, reminds me of Belmondo. A movie you will not forget. <br /> <br /> A consistent 26.5 of 31 ;-)
