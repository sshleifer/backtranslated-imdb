Look ... I'm expecting that level of acting from William Macy ... the guy keeps showing great performances ... but MEAT LOAF? When did His Loafness decide to leave behind Jim Steinman and throw his much lower weight into the wonderful world of Stanislavsky? Well, what can I say? I am very impressed. To put it in the old adage, "It's not the flesh, it's the emotion" ... and the loaf is calmly polishing his acting skills of late. Laura Dern brings the 40s look to perfection here ... great work from the costume and hair department ... David Paymer is typed but just right. Solid camera work throughout the movie. The plot is reminiscent of "Gentleman's Agreement" (anti-Semitism after the Second World War). Your time is worth it ... especially for the growing legions of Bill Macy acolytes. <br /> <br />
