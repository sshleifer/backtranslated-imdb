This film was really different from what I had imagined, but still exceeded my expectations. This film has the right mix of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). Without patronizing or Wisenheimer, he reveals the open and subtle problems of our capitalist, democratic high technology society. It immediately makes you laugh and then stays in thought. For those of you who "wag the dog" and wish to have humane and human-like politicians, this movie should definitely be your choice! <br /> <br /> "Politicians are very similar to diapers: they should be changed frequently for the same reasons."
