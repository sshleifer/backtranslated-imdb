Although I'm a bit older than the recommended age group, I really liked this movie. It's a small break from reality and every little girl has to dream about making friends with a pop star. I know it was mine, to be sure! The first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the bad girls said a few things that were also a bit cheesy. Once you've overcome that, you can really enjoy it. I loved the relationship between JD and Jane - it was really cute and you could see how much they liked each other in the beginning. The soundtrack is perfect and fits in very well with the movie. I also liked the family that was set up for Jane. Her sisters seemed to be lovely. Very well made movie.
