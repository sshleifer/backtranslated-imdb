Carly Jones (Elisha Curtberth), her bad brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki), her friends Paige (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Blake (Robert Richard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) travel to another City to see an important game. They decide to camp halfway in a field and continue the next day. However, the V-belt breaks from Wade's car and he stays with Carly to buy a new one in a nearby town where there is a wax house. When they arrive, they realize it's a ghost town, and two confused former Siamese brothers have turned people into wax figures. <br /> <br /> I really liked this "House of Wax" and it's worth the youthful horror movie. The story follows the standards of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and other Slash movies, and it's well done, has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects, and the death scenes are amazing. Although the movie was not good, it's worth seeing the sexy and delicious Paris Hilton. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa de Cera" ("The House of Wax")
