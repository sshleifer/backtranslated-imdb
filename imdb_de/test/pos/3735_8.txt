As a middle-aged mother, I appreciated being able to see a romance between adult people dealing with the many issues that affect us. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane portrays Adrienne and the victim and conflict a mother is going through. She wants to do what is right for her children but lead a happy life herself. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Richard Gere, but he's always doing a good job with the guy who's kind of an idiot but is learning something about himself. <br /> <br /> Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is barely justified compared to most other romantic films. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fall in love with each other in Australia and barely talk to each other, this is considered a high romanticism. We get a lot more with Rodanthe here. She redeems him. He frees her. It is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity, fans to a blaze of passion. How long it takes is irrelevant. Maybe the film was a bit too subtle in the point that it was the letters they shared the following year to deepen their relationship - another real way to get to know a person. <br /> <br /> As much as I liked the plot and the themes, the dialogue was not consistent in quality. Some lines sounded right and other lines were embarrassingly banal and flat. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the relationship with Adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend, reminding us that there are many kinds of love, not just romantic love. <br /> <br /> This is not a carefree being romantic comedy, more of a romantic drama. It has a very relaxed pace that some people think is too slow. <br /> <br /> The beach house is a true work of art. Look for the driftwood bench on the front porch in the first pan above the house - very nice. I also enjoyed the music and the scenery, which together formed the third main character of the place. It was this place beyond normal life that allowed them to see each other and themselves in a different light. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to appreciate these themes and in the mood for a good cry, get the Kleenex and enjoy this movie.
