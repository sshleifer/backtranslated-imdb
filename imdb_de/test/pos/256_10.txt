This Gundam series only follows the Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory. The story takes place in the same period as the original Gundam in the year U.C. 0079 was the time of the one-year war, but the mobile suits are designed as new models and therefore seem more agile. The hero of the story is a young Lt. Shiro Amada, who does not lack real combat experience, but he is made up for it with creativity and effort. <br /> <br /> His life becomes complicated when he meets Aina Sahalin, a Jion ace, pilot (the enemy) to fall in love and change her attitude towards the war around her. The other characters in the story are not meant to be background either, everyone in this story has a story. <br /> <br /> There is also another Ace pilot in this series who can be added to the Pantheon by Ace Mobile Suit Pilots. With Char Aznable and Anavel Gato, Norris Packard is not the top villain in this series, but his presence gives the 8th Mobile Suit team a tough fight. 3 of them against Norris and his only MS-07B Gouf Custom Mobile Suit. <br /> <br /> In summary, this Gundam together with Stardust Memory is a must !! <br /> <br />
