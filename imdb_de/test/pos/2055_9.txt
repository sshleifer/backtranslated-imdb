There is a serious scene in this film. A scene that lets you know that his movie does not cause many cheap punches. It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by automatic weapon assassins. They take a break and manage to get out of a gun hurdle. The main hall of the station is now filled with bodies of innocent people caught in the crossfire. Some would call this too sad and / or grim to integrate into an action movie that is supposed to be fun. I call it honesty. Most action films tend to lean on the "safe side" of violence and plot elements. This usually means that innocent people do not die or at least do not die despite massive shootings. Violence is all good for the bad guys, especially the bad guys. A little common sense clearly shows that this is absurd. <br /> <br /> Renny Harlin has shown this in his first (and unfortunately only single) hit The Hard 2. The bad guys intentionally overthrow a plane full of people to get their point. The scene was also shot with a backup scene of a cargo plane with few people aboard, but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario was used. To live up to the spirit of the first movie, Die Hard 2 was mostly a "funny action movie". Here, this slenderer and more convincing edge is omnipresent. The violence is bloody. The One-Liner are funny, but with a certain style reminiscent of natural human sarcasm rather than clich√©d film-wise cracks at important moments of the action. The plot is also full of malicious intentions than most action movies. The villain is not just a villain looking for revenge or a crazy power rush. It is less ridiculous, but also scary. From the latest films, the "Bourne" trilogy almost goes with their less cheesy action-movie style, but this movie dates back to 1996 and 7 years before "The Bourne Identity" with Matt Damon put it on the big screen. <Br /> <br /> Another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a hero. And this is long before the movie version of "Tomb Raider" became a hit. In addition, this heroine really looks like she could tear down John McClane and then take his still lit cigarette. In this film, Geena Davis is the second action heroine role, and she still has not managed to score. While Angelina Jolie years later plays in "Tomb Raider" and scored a hit. The reasons are not mine. Completely. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is not all dark. There are many incredible and spectacular set pieces that you can only see in an action movie. The chemical explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of film pyrotechnics, in which more than one physical law makes a comfortable break. So here's a formula, but it's the anti-formula for the everyday Hollywood Action Movie formula. 9/10 <br /> <br /> BsCDb Classification: 13+ violence, obscenity
