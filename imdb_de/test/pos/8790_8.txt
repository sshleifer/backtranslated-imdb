Hitchcock made at least eleven films about the ordinary man who had been wrongfully accused (sometimes really running, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control. The first was "The 39 Steps", which really made him a favorite in the UK. It really is his signature topic. Others include "Young and Innocent", "Saboteur", "Spellbound", "Stage Fright", "Strangers on the Train", "I confess", "To catch a thief", "The Wrong Man", "North by Northwest Robert Cummings begins as "Baroteur" as Barry Kane, an aircraft worker during the war who was accused of murdering his colleague and best friend during a sabotage at the factory and meets with model Patricia Martin , played by the actress Priscilla Lane, during his run before the law and later, of course, the various Nazi / Fascist sympathizers along the way. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is mainly like "The 39 Steps", though similar plot devices are included as handcuffs, the blonde, who at first does not trust the main character, runs a race across the country (in one case London to Scotland and the other California to New York) and the "colorful" locals along the way And like "The Man Who Knew Too Much," I believe this is an American remake of an earlier work by Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he is very ordinary American, a kind of "anyone" that the audience can identify with. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is more involved in the action than Madeline Carroll in The 39 Steps and Ruth Roman in Strangers on a Train. As mentioned elsewhere, Otto Kruger steals the show as a villain. I also liked the performance of Vaughan Glaser as a blind uncle. his lines are great. Along the way there are some funny accents for comic reliefs, like street signs with Priscilla Lane's character, circus sideshow performer and truck driver Murray Alper. Unlike other opinions, there are not too many characters who immediately believe in Barry Kane's innocence. <br /> <br /> There are some slow parts, especially when the action moves to New York first, but it quickly becomes noticeable, as the fifth act is in full swing. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite Hitchcock films (I put it in my top 5), especially in the days of the new war on terrorism. I think it hits home. <br /> <br /> It makes you think, "Could my colleague be involved in something bad?" In fact, one of the movie posters for "Saboteur" has proclaimed "Watch Out for the Man Behind Your Back." Imagine how it played during adulthood in World War II.
