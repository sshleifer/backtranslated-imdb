There are so many positive reviews of Return to Me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique film. Bonnie Hunt has proved that she is not only an extraordinary actress, but also a wonderful director and screenwriter. This movie has everything and is full of humanity, tenderness, humor ... Do not miss it, do not wait any longer. And in terms of bad reviews, you pay no attention. Some viewers forget that these kinds of films have to be seen with your heart and not just your eyes. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill, or you have mail, that's their mistake. Return to Me is a real gem for me, an unforgettable movie.
