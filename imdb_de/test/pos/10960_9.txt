"Shadows" is often hailed as the breakthrough for American independent cinema. Whether that's true or not, it's an undeniably important movie whose influence can be tracked down to today's Sundance feed. Here's a movie that picks up on controversial issues of the day (namely, racism) and refuses to give simple answers and show them in a manipulative way. It's also an open-ended sex that Hollywood would not even discuss until The Graduate. <br /> <br /> However, the question remains whether it is as powerful today as it was when it was originally published. The answer is yes. While many important films are hard to see and dated these days, "Shadows" keeps every ounce of emotional resonance when you look at it now. It's about racism as a personal issue and not about politics, so it's still relevant. It's also a great time capsule that captures the beat generation of the 1950s and the New York art scene in a way that no other movie has. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, admittedly, it is uneven. Cassavetes did not have complete faith as a director and the jarring style reflects the film's low budget. Nevertheless, the story of the film remains powerful. In addition, the spectacle is phenomenal in view of the inexperience of the cast and the improvisational nature. Around them, the actors create realistic characters who, despite their often less admirable actions, remain sympathetic. "Shadow" is absolutely obligatory for movie lovers. (9/10)
