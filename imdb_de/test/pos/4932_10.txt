When I was a kid I loved "Tiny Toons". I especially loved "Tiny Toons: How did I spend my summer vacation?" I thought it was funny on the floor. A few years later, my friend had the video. And I thought I would see it for the good old days. I was still on the floor and laughing. In my opinion, the sketch of Plucky and Hampton is the best. You choose "Happy World Land". And in the end they have a crazy adventure to get there. All skits are funny. I'm still looking for the video. So if someone has any tips. Please write me. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest cartoons I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
