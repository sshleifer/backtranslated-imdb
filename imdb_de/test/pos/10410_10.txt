An excellent TV series that should be recorded on DVD. This was a show I rarely missed. I found a petition to bring back to DVD. I remember a show in which this obese woman wore glasses that made her talk to her. Needless to say that she could not eat her friends, so she starved to death. Another episode had an accountant who visited an underground sewer and subway security department. The accountant wanted to stop funding the project. It turned out that the security arm for combating dark-rooted cannibalism was understaffed. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
