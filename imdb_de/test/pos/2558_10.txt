My friend, as we go for a walk in Leicester Square on the cold London night, says: If you did not speak English and did not show the stadium, you might have thought these were the slums of a South American city or somewhere in one other slum in the world, not in Queens in New York. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani is my official hero right now because he seems to have done his job not showing the other face of the American but the REAL face of America. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani's films are like Ladri di biciclette or Germania anno zero or Roma citta 'aperta. Chop Shop is reality, which is turned into a movie, is more realistic than a documentary. I think Ramin Bahrani's films are more realistic than documentary films. This is a great movie, but do not expect any chases or recordings. This film is about tragic life on the edge of the richest and richest country in the world.
