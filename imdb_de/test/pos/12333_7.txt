As part of an initiation coup, Julie (Meg Tilly of Psycho 2) has to spend the night in a mausoleum, but Karl Rhamarevich, a master of telekinesis, has recently died and been used there. As Julie's sisters and sisters profane from the school, where the real horror takes place, the real terror begins. <br /> <br /> This little movie had a lot of atmosphere and I enjoyed the setup, and the last twenty minutes are just great. If you are looking for a lost jewel from a horror film of the 80s, you do not have to search any further. Very underrated. Plus Elizabeth Daily is adorable. <br /> <br /> My Note: B <br /> <br /> Media Blaster DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary with director Tom McLoughlin and co-author Michael Hawes; and Trailer for Being, Frankish Bloody Terror, Just Before Dawn, and Devil Dog Disc 2) Alternate Director's Cut (which is almost unbeatable due to a bad imprint) and Behind the Scenes
