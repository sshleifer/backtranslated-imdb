David Cronenberg films are easy to spot or at least elements of the movie stand out as a trademark. Fetishism, the blurring between organic and inorganic, muddy throbbing that should not be mushy and throbbing. "eXistenZ" is the classic Cronenberg. In short, this is a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, you are provided with visual representations. The game is plugged directly into a "bio-port" at the base of your spine. While the game is running, the player can not distinguish reality from the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game's developer and guides novitiate marketer Jude Law through the steps of the game. During the game, they uncover strange events and possible crimes. But are they really or is it the game? Not even the author of the game knows it. <br /> <br /> The film is quite a treat that keeps the audience busy, but until the last minute in the dark. Another thing I like about "eXistenZ" is that it does not rely heavily on special effects, but history itself drives the movie. Recommended for the Saturday night, when Science Fiction is announced.
