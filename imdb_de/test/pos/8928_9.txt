This movie was incredible! It looked very expensive, but it felt warm and original like an indie. The most amazing thing about this film was the amazing performances by David Beazely, Mark Hildreth and Paul Anthony, who plays the lead role. He wore this film with ease, humor and balance in a great depth. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was really beautiful, though some of the themes were pretty ugly. That was not very realistic in this way, but it did not have to be to present a bigger point. It was really great to see Alan Cumming with you. The script was tight and very good with some of the best acting I've seen in a long time.
