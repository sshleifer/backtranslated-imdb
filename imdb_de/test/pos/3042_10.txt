I saw this movie on TV in the UK about 25 years ago, and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest was sparked recently when I visited Hilton Head - the next island of "Yamacraw" (actually Daufuskie) and Pat Conroy's great "The Water Is Wide". With knowledge I have revised Conrack and considered a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some precision - a Hollywood rarity. <br /> <br /> There are three things that still strike me in this story: 1. The issues of educating the poor and the disinherited and of inclusiveness remain the same. 2. Education means more than reading and writing. 3. These kids were my peers, I was 6 years old in 1969 when Pat Conroy spent his year on Daufuskie. Why has not this been done on DVD yet?
