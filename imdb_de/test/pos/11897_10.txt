This movie was a modern scar. He had me on tiptoe. This movie is one of those rare epic movies that you want to whet your appetite. I really liked Damian Chapa's blood in blood. The only thing I did not like was behind the scenes, because it did not show the intensity of the movie, and I would have liked to see less told scenes. But the movie has been great in my top ten films of all time. Besides, the acting was great, there was not a bad scene in the movie, I loved it, Jennifer Tilly was perfect, as was the whole cast. I can not see how someone would like it I do not like this movie, it was great. An absolute must.
