First of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users who commented on this film (from Belgium) had to add that Lumumba was "communist". If this user actually saw the movie, the message was that he was not a communist, but a "communist" leader for other individuals, businesses, and countries (from none other than Belgium, the US, the UN, and so on) in a drawer Political and economic gains were made. Even if one decides to accept that the film participates in the "revisionist history," it would be naive to assume that Lumumba was Communist, especially from the country that "granted" the independence of the Congo, and there Lumumba Minister was elected to his seat as Premier. <br /> <br /> On the movie ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important and powerful movies I have seen for some time. The struggles of the African freedom fighter and the fights of ELECTED Prime Minister as first leader, Mr. Peck, are quite a commendable work of putting all the pieces together into one work. And that must have been quite a task. Due to the fact that most people outside Congo and Belgium are unlikely to know the history of Lumumba and the Congo, it is not possible (hopefully) to have African imperialism in one of their high school / secondary (or perhaps college / college level ) History lessons, he had done his work for him. <br /> <br /> And to think that "JFK" by Oliver Stone lasted more than 3 hours, "Lumumba" runs under 2 hours. And it was an extremely exciting 115 minutes when we realized that his desire to compromise with the Western powers (whom he held responsible for the atrocities against his people, especially Belgium) does not compromise, while apparently trying to fights within his own borders Even with some of his friends, it is amazing that the man lived as long as he did. <br /> <br /> This is a MUST for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics and true freedom. You will not be disappointed.
