I just saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival in the beautiful Elgin Theater. I was overwhelmed by the beautiful camera, the brilliant adaptation of a very tricky piece, and last but not least the bravura performance of Al Pacino, who was born to play that role, which was perfectly balanced by equally strong performance by Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> The film cleverly explores the themes of love versus loyalty, justice versus justice and passion against reason. Some may protest that the content is inherently anti-Semitic, but they should consider the historical context of the story and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is narrated in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
