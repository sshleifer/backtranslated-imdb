Like most other reviewers, I really enjoyed this TV miniseries. I did not see it when it first came out, but my grandfather - a big fan of mystery and war movies - recorded it in 1989! It has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama, romance and espionage. I've seen a lot of films shot during World War II, but none with such a twist! Fortunately, I was able to make a VHS copy of the movie a few years ago. I have watched it several times since then and still enjoy it. I would be happy, if this film appears on DVD. It would be so much easier to look at the chapters.
