This is a great movie you can see with a good friend, a friend or a family or a family. Basically, one of these films is a good movie that you want to share with your loved ones. This movie is carefree, but it makes you think and laugh. <br /> <br /> Just a really simple but universal act. I think most people could somehow refer to this movie. The characters in the movie are awesome and the actors do a great job to get you into the movie. Rounding out the movie all the way with hilarious-Jewish humor. I saw the movie for the first time last night and I want to own it now. :)
