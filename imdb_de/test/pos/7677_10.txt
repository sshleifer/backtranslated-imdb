I saw this movie when I was very young. It's my everlasting favorite. I had not received a copy until recently and the reputation brought back so many fond memories. I loved Sidney Poiter's portrayal of Porgy, he is his character with so much power and courage. Pearl Bailey's part was small but not unlike many family members. My favorite songs were and still are "Bess You Is My Women", "Porgy, do not let him treat me" and of course "Summertime" According to the guidelines, if I interpret them correctly, I can not post where I could get my copy , Sorry.
