Far too many Christian films focus on the fear of the court and therefore seem condescending and rude cheesy. "Second Glance" does it right. This is a near-perfect evangelical tool. It's about the real reason why so many young people do not want to have anything to do with Christianity. It assures viewers that one has to give up their sin - not their fun - to succeed in the Christian way of life. "Second Glance" even works as a movie. The filmmakers obviously worked on a very low budget, but managed to write a sufficiently dynamic script to distract viewers' attention from this obvious fact. This movie brought me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to Christian stations everywhere it's being shown, it has certainly affected more people than just me.
