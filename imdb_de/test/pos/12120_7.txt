One of Fuller's (a combat veteran himself) early works of average quality, however, precisely matches the many contradictory aspects of post-war Germany. The main character begins the film in April 45 as Sgt with C Co, 157th Inf, 45th Div, who has really ended the war in Munich as well as in the movie. (The same unit in the previous month had fought violently in Aschaffenburg and then freed part of the Dachau plant). For the uninformed, the film may seem confusing, fluttering between the good and the bad of the German population. But anyone who has been there or at least has read well knows that what is portrayed in the film is most things that have actually happened in Germany. The only inaccuracy I noticed was minor: during a boat trip on the Rhine, past the remnants of the Remagen Bridge, he commented that he had crossed there. But his unit crossed really well south - north of Worms Germany.
