This is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made. You stay from the beginning to the end of the film. Although there are some storylines, it remains exciting until the final showdown. Besides "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom" this is one of the best films about "Snuff Movies", a taboo subject of our culture. If you like the SCREAM trilogy, you will probably love it.
