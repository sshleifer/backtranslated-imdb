I can not believe that anyone rated this movie 1! and it's just a 3rd average ... what's not to love about this movie? It's original, it has many horror scenes that really made me jump out of my seat, and it has some great special effects. The story is fresh, there is some nudity and it is very campy. The killer was scary in his own way and the end is very unexpected. I have to admit that I really love this movie, one of the best horror films in Spain. If you consider yourself a true horror fanatic, you must go out and try to find this movie. You will be pleasantly surprised to do so.
