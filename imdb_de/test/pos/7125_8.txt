There are only a few films where I had to wait more than this. This is the latest film by the group The Dead Gentlemen, which is responsible for the original Gamers movie and the Demon Hunter movies. This group has not been particularly active in recent years, but this film is a clear reason to keep track of things in their progress. <br /> <br /> This film follows a group of players trying to end the game a campaign led by a GM who is frustrated because his group disregards his story. With the help of new blood, they try the campaign again with the hope of coping this time. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fresh breeze in the movie community and a big improvement over the original. The film shows respect for the game, as does the original film, but it also shows a dramatic improvement in the special effects that go beyond the simplicity of college films. Acting is pretty decent and the jokes are pretty funny. Unfortunately, many jokes are jokes. So if you are not a player, you may not find the movie as funny as others. That's why I give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that I originally thought of. In any case, if you are a player or knowledgeable about games, you should find out. You will enjoy it.
