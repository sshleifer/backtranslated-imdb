Driving Lessons is a British variant of Harold and Maude and features a targeted Rupert Grint and a towering Julie Walters. While it's true that Grint looks like a redheaded Benjamin Braddock with a stony face in the first half of the movie, he does not let the bizarre family movie scare him off - there are things that come from his character's experience and a movie lead shell-shocked reaction. The chemistry between Walters and Grint carries the film, though Laura Linney's hard work of making her written stereotype a human is remarkable. These performances, combined with a fun Poppy soundtrack featuring artists such as Sufjan Stevens, John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica, make this children's popcorn movie on Saturday afternoon worthwhile.
