I've been like an idiot for the last ten minutes of this extraordinary piece of television. I have to say that the idea of ​​sitting down to watch 90 minutes, which was pretty depressing on a Sunday, was not a welcome idea. The thought of another, very worthy, BAFTA winning opportunity did not inspire me ... But the end result beat me by 6. For years, I had the impression that all originality had left the BBC acting section. Our friends in the north were the last production that really blew me away, and that was ten years ago. But faith is restored and honor is fulfilled. David Tenant was incredible! So many actors I can imagine would have gone to town in such a place, but I never saw Mr. Tenant as an actor or a doctor, all I saw was Alan Hamilton. Since Daniel Craigs's appearance as Geordie Peacock all those years ago, my heart has not hurt so much. Sarah Parish was also amazing and I really hope that role will bring her better roles in the future. All the actors were great, but the director who really put us in Alan's head needs to be mentioned. Especially the Toasterszene made me quite queasy.
