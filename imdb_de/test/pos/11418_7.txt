After seeing the original at 13 (and yes, I was stupid enough to watch it babysitting!), I was excited to see this remake. <br /> <br /> Camilla Bell has done a great job as Jill Johnson. And the fact that a teenage horror film was made in 2006 without tremendous vulgarity and blemishes made him even stronger than a movie. I had a great time trying not to chew my fingernails! <br /> <br /> This movie will not win anyone an Oscar, but it's entertaining and worth the Matin√©e Prize ticket I bought to see it. I think girls around the world should see the original and the remake ... and then decide never to babysit again. <br /> <br /> I can only say that I am glad that I am too old to babysit! It's just something in a dark, scary house with sleeping children that makes this movie a classic. No blood, no blood ... just a good psychological fun! WINNER!
