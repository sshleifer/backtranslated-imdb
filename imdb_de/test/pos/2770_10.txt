I am absolutely disgusted that this movie is not sold. Everyone who loves this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. You would have to sell it sometime. I would buy copies for everyone I know. Everything and everyone in this movie has done a good job and I have not figured out why Disney did not put this film on DVD or on VHS in rental outlets. At least I have not seen any copies. This is a bad movie and should be seen by everyone. The children of the new generation do not see it and I think they should do it. It should at least be put back in the channel. This movie does not deserve a cheap download. It deserves the right thing. I'll mail you now. This movie will be on DVD.
