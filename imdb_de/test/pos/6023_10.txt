This is the best version of Gypsy that was filmed. The bed Midler is just great, as Mama Rose. She has the voice, the gestures, the looks and, above all, an outstanding acting ability to take on the role and make her character alive. Your singing is simply said: MAGNIFICENT! It shines above all in two numbers - "Everything's Coming Up Roses" and "Rose's Turn". The other actors are also doing well, especially Christine Ebersoll as Tessie. Also good is Peter Riegert, his portrayal of Herbie works with great style and credibility. The direction of this movie is very, very good. There is no wrong note or The film is a huge improvement over the Roz Russell version, which was shot in 1962. Since watching it again, I can say that the three biggest mom Roses: Ethel Merman, Bette Midler and Angela Lansbury. Watch this movie. You'll be glad you did.
