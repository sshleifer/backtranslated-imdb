This film is about a young Indian who comes home one day and gets engaged to a woman. The problem is that he is gay. To end the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until it gets out of control. <br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious and has made me laugh many times. Sally Bankes' acting is great and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The plot is also excellent. I find the storyline very realistic and I can completely identify with Jimi's feeling of being scared, worried and annoyed. On the other hand, Jimi's boyfriend Jack gets much less attention in the movie. I would have wished him to be given more lines in the movie and to develop more character. However, I think that the director wants to develop this mainstream film. The love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in this film. <br /> <br /> It's great to see a gay affirmative movie. In addition, this film teaches that we meet the differences of other people, be it sexuality, culture or lifestyle. This movie lets the audience think. <br /> <br /> We need films like this to increase us. Thanks for this movie!
