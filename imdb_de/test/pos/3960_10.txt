Let me make that clear. This is not a "good movie," but I'm so glad it's out there, I'm so glad I saw it, and it's great for the role he plays in my DVD collection. It's the ultimate PG-13 romp, it's a college as we imagine it when we start high school. It takes so much fuss of incredulity that it can just as well take place on Mars. It's so healthy that it does not even make your grandmother uncomfortable when she tries to get dirty. Watching requires so much refinement (in fact, if I think too much about what happens, it will stand in the way of your appreciation for this work), I feel like I'm 12 again. And that kind of experience is worth more than $ 9.99.
