Young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are outstanding in this excellent film about two boys who have promised to "take care of their mother" and how they cope when their new stepfather beats the younger boy. The support of the boys is also first class. The script really goes into the head and heart of a fanciful child. It's hard to believe that Wood could grow up with Tom Hanks, but that's nothing new in Hollywood. That's honestly my only criticism of the movie.
