"Queen of the Damned" is one of the best vampire movies I have ever seen! The film had tension, action and blood. The combination of the Queen's strict demand and the rocky mood of our star, which is played very well by Stuart Townsend, makes for a wonderfully made movie that only this combination can create. I'm always the one who gives advice to my friends and family in which movies it's worth renting and if they ask me if "Queen of the Damned" is worthy, I'll tell them it's worth buying. This movie is certainly a must in all houses of horror movies!
