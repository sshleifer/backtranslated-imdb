With the Prime Minister's conviction to support the totally inappropriate Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, evil chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit the current leader of his party, allowing him to take power. To his surprise, however, the plan bounces back, Ali is embraced by the nation and Carlton needs to find other ways to guarantee his political future. <br /> <br /> Puerile, gross, misogynist and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the debut on big screen film for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all these things and more. That means it's my kind of movie !! Of course, none of them are the ones who just will not get the joke, and there will definitely be people who find the jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, drug use, hardcore pornography, and the queen's nether regions extremely offensive (needless to say) should stay away !), but if you find such juvenile humor side by side, you're generally a fan of Baron Cohen, or you just want to see the hot Rhona Mitra in her underwear (and you shit because she fits well!). ), then I fully recommend spending one and a half hours in the company of Ali G and the West S taines Massive. <br /> <br /> You are angry!
