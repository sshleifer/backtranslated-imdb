This almost documentary look at an enterprising boy living outside of New York in coachbuilding is all the way. Real lighting. Real sound. Less editing throughout the movie than most movies in a minute. And although there is very little script, there is a story. In primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we have a real sense of the life of a boy who does nothing. He has a place where he can live, do a good job, and try to get his sister into his little universe. The people in the chop shop area also give us an insight into this culture, of which I knew nothing. They tend to be decent most of the time and pay a daily amount of ale, really worried about his well-being. The actor (I think) playing ale says more with a facial expression than you can imagine. It reminded me of what a real little movie can do. It shows what children are capable of, even without much support and love. Definitely recommend.
