Yes, I give a 10 because I compare it not only with others of its kind, but also with the filth with which one is bombarded daily, what is today called "popular culture". Apart from that, the movie is, as stated elsewhere, beautifully set and gives us a good insight into the popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th centuries. It is no coincidence that many of the plays in which Olcott was involved involved a similar conspiracy: boy meets girl, someone contradicts, (usually the father or another authority figure). This was actually known as the "Chauncey Olcott Act" at the time. No coincidence that John Ford has addressed one. He called it "The Silent Man". And "My Wild Irish Rose" is in itself a "Chauncey Olcott Act". Great stuff, no? Anyway, great songs, great stuff. Have fun. <br /> <br /> PS - After watching the movie, I want to know more about Bill Scanlan. I found an obit who said he had left Mauvorneen for madness (as replaced in the movie by Chauncey Olcott) and died a few years later in an asylum. But he was obviously a very big star who wrote songs and plays and had written pieces for him. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know more?
