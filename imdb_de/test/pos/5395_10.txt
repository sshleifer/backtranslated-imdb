This movie was great! I love the way dark humor is mixed with drama. There are times when you think there is no way to laugh about the situation, and yet you experience a surprising giggle. It is wonderfully played, with great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels and Emile Hirsch. It's well written with a stylish, surprising ending. I can not say that everyone will like it as much as I do, but give it a chance and rent it. The DVD features some great features, including extensive commentaries by director Dan Harris and Emile Hirsch and one by Sigourney Weaver, which will give you interesting information about the film. I hope that my comment is helpful and that you like the movie!
