The movie John Waters gave us is one of the funniest movies ever. Yes, it may be crude, but it's filled with hysterical moments that nobody has done since. The infamous dog scene must be one of the highlights of the cinema. not a movie for the slightly insulted, it's one of those movies where you always see something new. Divine's performance is worth the call. Mink stole is hysterical. This is the film that is responsible for the Farrely brothers and the entire comedy genre Gross-out. I know that sounds a bit extreme, but think about it. Previously, the comedies of the mill were very similar and almost identical. After this movie, comedies became strange and funny, but in a good way. I would give it 15 out of 10 if I could.
