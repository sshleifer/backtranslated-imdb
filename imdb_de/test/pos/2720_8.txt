exquisite !! in simple terms ... Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen seem to get along very well, or they are both too good. This could only be her best performance as an actor and Aparna's best performance as a director. Yes, maybe better than Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, Mithi's older sister (Konkona Sen). Shabana Azmi made the best of Anjali's character by having to play a strong, responsible, arrogant role of an older sister who had the full responsibility of her family. Aparna Sen has beautifully designed the character of Anjali, a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life, her love for her family. Mithis behavior was not at all youthful, because you can expect that from most Indian directors for this role. It seems that a lot of research has been done to understand the role of Mitiz, a schizophrenic. When Mithi is sometimes a normal, cute college girl, she also scares you when she's shown ill .. Both sides have been beautifully judged and played the scary though .. Overall..Marvelous work by Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ...
