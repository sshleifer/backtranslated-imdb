I was a bit worried about actors and acting in Italy, then "Le conseguenze dell'amore" and Toni Servillo came. It was a long time since I saw such a charismatic actor on the screen. Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has created one of the most memorable characters in recent years that can be seen in movies. The film is not quite perfect, but "Titta Di Girolamo" will stay with you for a long time after the movie's vision. Toni continues to play in movies, you're certainly the coolest actor there is today (and not only in Italy deserves international recognition). I rate this movie at 9/10.
