I am surprised with the number of negative reviews for this film. If you do not like this movie as it is - a stupid, exaggerated mob story - then just read too much about it. This film is a classic story of a woman trying to escape the "life" and problems that follow her. Michelle Pfeiffer is a fantastic jersey of the 80's. She is an insecure, uncomfortable mob woman while Matthew Modine is an anal Remanent-like mob police who falls in love with her. The plot is largely predictable and Cutesy and Mercedes Ruel steals the show as Queen of Mob Wives. Unless you're looking for something too dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely entertaining and a cult classic from the 80s. You can not stop watching when you start.
