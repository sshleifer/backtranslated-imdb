One of my favorite westerns and in my opinion one of the best of John Ford. No main stars, but Ben Johnson shines in almost everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead role as a title character. To him Ward Bond fits as the encrusted Mormon elder, who leads his people to the west. John Ford's character actors, including Harry Carey Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide just as much support as the eerily quiet James Arness, a member of the clawg clan who joins the wagon train. The Mormon road to Utah was one of the toughest and most demanding companies ever undertaken. We can not really understand that, but we see suffering that had to be overcome by pioneers on the way west; River crossings, long stretches of dry, waterless desert, encounters with Indians and the like, all to a glorious song of the sons of the pioneers. The Mormons actually dug portions of the path with picks and shovels as shown in the movie. My biggest regret is that it was not made in color, but I believe that there is a colored version. Incidentally, these rugged rocks shown in various scenes are called Fisher Towers, which are near Moab. We recommend.
