Fun bad movie that should be fun. One of Joan Crawford's recent gigs as a drafts editor against all the young, beautiful, eager beaver who come from the elite Seven Sister colleges. Great 50s atmosphere in New York. Wonderful costumes and hairstyles. Great art direction. A modest story, but noisy tearmaker. Interesting Cameo by Robert Evans as a rich Kad.
