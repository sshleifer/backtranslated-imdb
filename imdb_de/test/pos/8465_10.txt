The fact that this film was shown in London's Barbican suggests that the pressure for such a performance must have been acceptable. Now the question arises: Why is this long lost and important movie not available on DVD (or even on VHS)? Many people in Europe and the USA hoped for many years to see this film, if only from the wonderful music that Sergei Prokofiev has written for it. What do you have to do to get such a wonderful production that is available to a wider audience, not just the Barbican in London? PLEASE has been an avid listener to Prokofiev's music for many years and is aware of this movie. Someone out there is doing the right thing and releasing it as a DVD.
