Mike Judges Idiocracy is an interesting movie that his fans will undoubtedly detect. <br /> <br /> Before I start the review, I'd like to say that if you have a chance to see them, definitely, as it's worth to be seen, and it's not the easiest movie of the world World you can locate. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the premise - Luke Wilson is the private librarian Joe Bauer, who is considered a librarian to have absolutely no outstanding qualities or blatant mistakes, which makes him totally average in every way. This, together with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him an outstanding candidate for an experimental cryogenic process. Also frozen with Joe is a prostitute named Rita who was pimped by Upgrayedd, her abusive pimp, for the project. Unfortunately, the top-secret project is abandoned and forgotten a few days after freezing. <br /> <br /> You wake up in the year 2505 and notice that society is following the trends of lately, every human is just a little bit smarter than a chimpanzee. The way in which "Everyman" Joe Bauer speaks is considered "faggy", just as someone who spoke like Shakespeare would now ridicule, and a former wrestler is the President of the United States (in fact, this is not so disgusting Yes, really). The best broadcast on TV is called "Ow! My Balls!", Which sounds pretty good and not only is everything misspelled but the signs for the wording seemingly empty so they end up in the TV show. <br /> <br /> It's a funny premise for the movie, but that's the problem - apart from the original premise, not much in the movie is really funny. I mean, the ideas that come from reading the premise of the movie are probably just as funny as the movie itself. Obviously it's not that bad, but it could probably have been funnier. <br /> <br /> There are some winners in the script, such as Starbucks, who now offer "Happy Endings," and people who blindly place in the universally misunderstood trust "electrolytes," but they are just too few and far between unless you laugh hysterically each time, when one of the idiots of the future erodes a limp, profane phrase with little to no logic and / or intelligence, then the laugh may be quite far apart. <br /> <br /> It's unfair that anyone compares it to Office Space because it's a completely different movie, but as a movie, regardless of what came before, Idiocracy is a weird concept you're probably into first 15-20 minutes will make much more laugh than in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I give 5 out of 10 points because it's fun but not enough to lift it across the middle of the road.
