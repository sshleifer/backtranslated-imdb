It worked! Director Christian Duguay has created a very clever action / espionage thriller. The actors Donald Sutherland and especially Aidan Quinn gave a top performance. What a pity we have not seen Aidan Quinn in other films like this one. He was simply the best in the role of Ramirez / Carlos for what he deserved the Oscar. The picture was very nice. The scenes are fast from start to finish and history will not leave you bored. The film is too undervalued and I recommend it to anyone, otherwise you will miss something great. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. That's why I give it 9/10.
