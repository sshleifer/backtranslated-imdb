What can I say, this movie is amazing. It has its weaknesses like any film shaky gravestones in a cemetery, a clearly visible slide plate during the penguin's death scene, Max Shreck loses his heavy coat between shots in the frame-up scene within seconds, and Batman loses his blue eye suddenly between the shots -up, so he can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman, dialogues are recorded but played back and spoken differently than when first spoken, and finally Catwoman suddenly knows how to use a bullwhip without any training at all. These flaws are minor compared to some that you would see forever in Batman, for example, where the puzzler obviously waits for his cue or waits for Val Kilmer's hair to switch between beats. What makes this movie so valuable? 8/10 is the great spectacle, because the performances are absolutely amazing. Michael Keaton repeats his role as Batman and has much more to do in this film. He looks in the role for the second time more comfortable and is with the achievements of the bad guys at eye level. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I like the transformation of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non-threatening figure from the comics or the television series, because the character now has more depth and a much more interesting story that emerges from the basic needs of the family and the feeling assumed and wanted. This gives us a bad character, for whom we feel pity because he was rejected because he is what he is not. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. She is sleek and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because she is a victim. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and such an interesting character, even though he is not even in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is much better than the first and Danny Elfman gets a bigger chance to show off his musical talents this time around. The sets are incredible. They are detailed, eye-catching, eerie, gothic, unique, dark and so many other adjectives can describe how great they look. The costumes and make-up are great and obviously a lot of work has gone into making it, and the work pays off as the batsuit is better, the cat suit is awesome to look at and the penguin does its effects perfectly. The animatronic penguins look very realistic and are well played. The script is really good and the storyline is in my opinion plausible. Overall, this movie deserves an 8/10 for all of these factors and is my favorite among all Batman movies
