This is not a "direct Cinéma" but the opposite. The second part of the filmmaker Gatlif's French gypsy trilogy produced by Michèle Ray-Gavras is a masterpiece of the film, not a mere documentary, not a fiction. Instead, Gatlif has selected various locations along the route from India to Spain, wherever the population of Rome is present. With the help of Art Directors, he has staged several musical numbers telling us how Gypsies live, sing, dance, fight and survive. The film may have strong resistance from those who question the hypothesis that the tribe of Romas is of Indian origin, mostly those who see a direct connection to the Hebrews (in a sense, it is not surprising that they are persecuted as well but above any anthropological argument, this is a work of great beauty, rich colors, and wonderful song and dance.
