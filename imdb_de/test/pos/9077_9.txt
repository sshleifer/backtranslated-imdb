* Flat SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Five medical students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio, Rachel Mannus, Joe Baldwin and Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) decide Try to kill the experiment for exactly 5 minutes (it's the maximum amount of time someone can do this before there's a threat of brain damage). <br /> <br /> Almost everyone does this experiment, Randy is the only exception, but they are starting to have unwanted visitors; David sees a little black girl nudging brutal insults, Joe sees all the women he had sex with (which he recorded on video) and asks him why Rachel resuscitated her father's suicide on the TV screen and Nelson a murderous boy sees. <br /> <br /> Why are you here? And how are they freed from them? This exciting and interesting film, set in a hallucinated city and gothic med school, is for both the story and the characters the experience played by rising stars like Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt and Kevin Bacon Will and William Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The director is Joel Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland in Lost Boys, and this second collaboration is even better than the first one. <br /> <br /> For psycho-thriller horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and reappraisal of past abuses), this is one of the lesser 80's classics that still find respect today, such as the mention of Rebecca Gayheart in 'Scream 2' or the Tru Calling episode, which used the premise of the movie. <br /> <br /> Flatliners: 9/10.
