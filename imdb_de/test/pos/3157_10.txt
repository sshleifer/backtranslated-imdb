It's funny because I read all the reviews on this site after getting this movie. It's either a love or I hate the reaction. You will probably love it or hate it. I think the best films are those that separate people because they obviously have some effect. I'm in the five-star camp because this movie was a real number for me and I wanted to come back and learn more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was fairly balanced when it all happened. Especially Afghanistan and I feel guilty. The music through the movie was beautiful. I have lost myself in it again and again, especially during some historical flashbacks. Personally, I thought the sound was great. It seemed to me that the soundtrack with speeches, music, and radio was put together to make you feel like Jim, the main character, or in your head, like in your motorhome. Everything that was not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. Anyway, this is a very amazing DVD that made me cry.
