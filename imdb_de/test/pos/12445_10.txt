Slipknot is a heavy metal band from the great city of Des Moines, Iowa, where the rockers wear their own distinctive mask (I know someone has already said that, but I have to fill some space for this review). The band members are Joey, Mick, 133, Sid, Clown, James, Corey, Chris and Paul. This band is in my opinion one of the best new heavy metal bands and should be heard by anyone who loves hardcore rock. Another good movie is called "DISASTERPIECES", which shows the band's performance in the London Arena. The "My Plague" video was recorded there and is included on the DVD. The kick-ass song they made is there too (sic). So if you love the band, you have to see that and if you love heavy metal then you have to listen to this band.
