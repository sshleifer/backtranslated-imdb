"Dead Man Walking" is a piece of incredible filmmaking. All the plays are first-rate and realistic, and the script examines the question of the death penalty from both sides, with both equally honored. Above all, this is a deeply moving story of salvation, death with dignity and ego loss. Any movie that bravely and maturely deals with such incredibly difficult topics deserves a rating of 10/10. Thank you, Tim Robbins!
