Werner Herzog again explores the psyche of a man. In "Little Dieter ..." we meet a foaming, brilliant man who survived the war in Bavaria when he saw hunger and strange sights, moved to the US and fulfilled his dream of flying. War, food, death, survival, hoarding, planes, heads out ... how an American is born. Duke sees again the madness as a level of existence and the surreal mingles with the poignant Duke himself. He tells of this psychic travelogue of an American flying propeller planes in a late 20th-century war in which the pinnacle of technology is pilgrimages and food is made from garbage cans with spoons are fused with constant optimism into a man redefined in America. As always with Herzog, we are faced with insane madness, splendor and what man is in the face of his own social and personal excesses. We laugh and twitch and marvel at this man. Where else for this man besides America?
