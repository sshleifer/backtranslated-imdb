I have been a fan of Larry King's show for some time. I think he does a great job overall and I do not think he's ever "messed up" as so many people seem to think. He's a subtle scorpion who gets his zings when he has to, just as he did last night with Paris Hilton during their first television interview after the prison. <br /> <br /> The case with this whole case That really amazed me that Hilton apparently has no idea why Judge Sauer told her what she considered too harsh a ruling (and MADE you serve it), you have agreed. Throughout her time in prison, allegedly alone in her cell for 23 hours a day, she has never once again rewound the events that led to her being sentenced to a sentence that Judge Sauer judged her to be suffering. She had never once realized that she might have put a big red flag when she (1) appeared late for the trial and (2) informed him when he asked her if she did not know her license was there was suspended, she did not get the papers in the post, that "I have people who have read such a thing for me." <br /> <br /> Throughout her time in her cell, she never came to the realization that this act (appearing too late) and that statement - and more importantly - the attitude - the court's absolute cavalry disregard System and the law in general, and in particular their driving privileges, which led them - could judge Sauer (pardon the pun) just pissed off. <br /> <br /> Yesterday evening, on King's Show, after giving lip service on how she changed her traumatic experience forever, how she "learned" her lesson, she responded to his question: "Do you think so?" have a rough deal? "with a clear yes, and during the conversation (if you can call it that) she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her." King more than once gently asked if she does not feel that she is creating the situations in her life where she "finds herself", and she is staring at him rather blankly, she basically believes in the conscious belief that she has fallen prey to this situation She does not understand how she caused it in court that day, by her combative attitude towards the judge, which I find very sad - even tragic, considering what a huge "role model" Hilton is for some people and it does everything she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state into the realms of total and utter ignorance, contradiction and hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> During the interview, Hilt played on spending a lot of time in their cell reading the bible. At the end of the interview, King scored important points when she asked her what her favorite bible site was. She responded by puzzling over her miserable notes (utterly superficial non-disclosure she had read in the air as if she were Nelson Mandella or something), and finally she grunted, "I have no favorite passage." <br /> <br /> Judge Sauer is a hero in my book, and after last night Larry King subtly exposes Hilton to what she really is.
