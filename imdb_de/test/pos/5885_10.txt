The film shows another extraordinary collaboration between director William Wyler and cinematographer Gregg Toland, the first after Toland had worked on Citizen Kane. The talent of these two men, however, focused on producing a perfectly crafted film that is considered a great story in the good old American sense. The technical aspects of the film are treated so that the viewer is absorbed by the action that takes place on the screen without embracing the image. The technique is seen as a representation instrument, unlike in Citizen Kane, where Welles' Baroque style drew attention almost from the story to the way the story was told. One of my favorite moves with a deep focus in this film is the drama conveyed by the return home of Homer and Al. When Homer's girl, Wilma, comes to him perfectly, Al goes to his wife, who is also perfectly in focus. This is an ingenious move because it shows the nature of these relationships only through the use of the image, as we will see throughout the film: Wilma loves Homer and she accepts him the way he is. As a woman, she loves him too, but she feels do not be prepared to welcome him at home. Later in the movie, we find that her marriage was not always a bed of roses. <br /> <br/> Wyler is a director whose power is to be true to his work without praise. He wanted to show his audience how hard it was for American soldiers returning from the war to fit into a society they either did not understand or treated with contempt. With a perfect cast and great dialogues, Goldwin and Wyler have produced a movie that will forever be the inspiration for any other homecoming movie. The three hours that coincide with the "rough cut" because at that time the test audience never felt for a moment that the action was slow and in fact every scene in the movie seemed perfectly justified. The whole thing is beautifully constructed, each character is pretty exposed, nothing is left to chance and it's pretty pathetic that Hollywood never brings so much character conflict to the screen these days. TBYOOL explores the depth of American lifestyle, the American family and society to an extent where other films are acting like the "Children's Hour".
