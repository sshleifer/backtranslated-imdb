Treading Water is a very nice movie. I would put it right under the wonderful short film: Cosa bella by Fiona MacKenzie. It's not just about coming out, it's about tolerance and acceptance in general. I look forward to seeing more of Laurel Himmel in the future. The actors, Angie Redman and Nina Landey, are pretty good. The relationship between the main characters may have been strengthened somewhat, as we understand that there is a very strong bond between them, but perhaps this has been explained somewhat. I am surprised that Angie Redman does not appear much in other films. A great first step as a director for Laurel Himmel. I am sure that there is more to see.
