This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialogue is crisp, the pace is fast. This is not just a clever comedy, but also an interesting look at what's going on behind the scenes of the television news business. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny lines ... a few of my favorites: <br /> Ernie Merriman: (sarcastic) It must be nice to always believe that you know better to always believe that you are the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, that's not terrible !! <br/> <br/> Aaron: He must look good Jane: How do you know that? Aaron: No one invites a bad-looking idiot to his room! <br /> <br /> The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hurt were absolutely awesome! Years later, I remember this movie well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny Joan Cusack! I love the scene where Newsroom staff are fighting for a deadline. There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. I highly recommend this movie.
