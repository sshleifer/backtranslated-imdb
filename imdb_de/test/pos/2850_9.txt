Sister Betty impressed me all the way. It has a great ensemble of characters, an original storyline and an end that I should have seen coming, but not and pulling the strings at your heart Most of all it was the interplay of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. These two are awesome and it warms my heart to see Rock for the rest of his life do not do fucking Big Hollywood stuff like Lethal Weapon 4. Freeman is the man, as always, really should not be necessary to criticize his work. Hell, Kiss the Girls was with him. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellwegger does the best she can with her role and Kinnear is good as an obsession a nice touch of unfounded violence to satisfy the man's bloodlust. 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
