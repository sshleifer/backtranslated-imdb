Alfred Hitchcock's safer narration of a film shot twenty-one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original. Hitchcock himself said that his first version was the work of an amateur, and although it is certainly not a bad movie, he seems to be right. The remake is definitely better, but still not among the best works of Hitchcock. Certainly not to say it's not good, it's more than a little overly forgiving and that pulls it down. Hitchcock seems to be too eager to extract certain elements, and these are parts of the film that are not completely relevant to the plot, which can be annoying. Some of these drawn-out sequences, such as James Stewart and Doris Day eating in a Moroccan restaurant, are good because they help establish the diverse culture in which our American protagonists reside, but for every restaurant scene there is an opera sequence and the latter make the movie even worse. <br /> <br /> The story follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife's holiday with their young son in Morocco. There they meet a Frenchman on the bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. However, it goes awry when the Frenchman dies with a knife in the back, shortly after he has whispered something to the doctor. The holiday turns into a nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, which causes the holiday to be shortened and he goes to London to find him. The film has a very high degree of paranoia and can do it. I would even say that this is the most paranoid movie Hitchcock has ever made. Like most of Hitchcock's films, this movie is very exciting and will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat almost the entire length of time. Only the opera sequence mentioned above is a moment in which the tension is spreading. There is also more than a little humor in the film, which gives the morbid processes carefree relief and actually works quite well. <br /> <br /> The original version of this story was superbly supported by the fabulous Peter Lorre This film does not benefit from its presence, but this is offset by the performances of James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man who will always be a contender for the crown of the "greatest actor of all time". His collaborations with Hitchcock are fascinating, and this is no different. (Although his best performance is that of Mr Smith to Washington). Stewart conveys all the courage, conviction and lifeblood of a man who has lost his child and would do anything to bring it back in style. This is indeed one of the best things about this movie. They really are able to feel the loss of the couple, and that makes it even more exciting. Doris Day, on the other hand, is a pretty weird casting choice for this movie. She's definitely a good actress, but she's more involved in musicals, and it's very strange to see her in a thriller. (Even if she lets her vocal cords play a bit). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned before; This is not Hitchcock's best movie, but there's a lot to enjoy, and although I would recommend many Hitchcock films before recommending the movie, I'll definitely give it two thumbs.
