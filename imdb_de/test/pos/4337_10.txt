Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible spectacle Unplausible sceneries! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, vicious villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie are perhaps the best 30 minutes ever shot, especially in the scene where the decent, hard-working citizens drag chains across the street, knock down the evil motorcyclists and then shoot just to join them celebrate the neighborhood children (!!!). And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She sweeps the scum out! And if that's not enough, let's not forget how quickly the punks give up after Fraker's been killed. I just laugh about it. <br /> <br /> I also love the death scene of Kersey's girlfriend. He just leaves * after blowing her up. It's little things like these that make Death Wish 3 such a bad movie. And I do not even mention the bizarre soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie because of Martin Balsam, of whom I seriously believe he is one of the best character actors (and whose own is "beaten" by the movie "scum" scene is weird) and I left with a new favorite movie. Thank you, Death Wish 3, for making me laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> Some other things I forgot to mention: 1. Kersey's weird sound effect says "Cash!" when buying his used car. Ha! It sounds so bad. 2. MANDY Fraker. Mandy! Do not the authors have any more harsh names? 3. The fact that the gangs apparently have an exchange program for "loan and lease": "I need a few more people." And this Mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building. 4. At the end of the film, after Kersey blew Fraker up, is it just me, or does it look as if the street gangs break into the choreography when they give up? Just look how in sync they are after the female punk gives the "stop" signal. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Nothing encourages me like Death Wish 3!
