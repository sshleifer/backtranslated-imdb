So porn was earlier, that's a real classic. I mean, it's an x-rated musical based on a recent book! There is a real story and how many x-rated movies can boast these days? This is one of an exclusive selection list of pornographic classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with "pornographic films" nowadays is that it's all about "pornographic" and not "movie". Although Alice in Wonderland offers graphic depictions of sex, it does tell a story at the same time. No typical plot "Oh, Mr. Police Man, do not write me a ticket", that goes one step further and makes it a musical! Fabulous! If you want to see an example of "good" porn, this is one of the best.
