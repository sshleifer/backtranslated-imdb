The BBC and HBO jointly developed "Dirty War," a 90-minute TV movie about a terrorist attack on "dirty bombs" in London. The film sets to work quickly as it puts both the terrorist and terrorist efforts of the government in the film and has little room for people's interest. On the terrorist side, we are following the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive material through the assembly to the detonation. On the state side, PR and training exercises, information gathering and analysis, prohibition, reaction after detonation and follow-up are observed. The film also gives a sense of how al-Qaeda terrorist cells are organized, the radical Islamist terrorist mentality, and terrorist strategies. A kind of "dirty bombing" anatomy, "Dirty War," will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public increasingly aware of this insidious threat. (B)
