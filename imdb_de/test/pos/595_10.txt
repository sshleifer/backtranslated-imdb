I have always loved the Muppets. Although most children's entertainment was not so likeable at the time, The Muppet was. The Muppets are very, very funny. They are probably the most likeable child figures of all time. <br /> <br /> The Muppets did not just have their own show. You have also played in many films. from The Muppet's Christmas Carol to Muppet's Treasure Island. The first Muppet movie, the Muppet movie, was just as excellent as the show and the other films. <br /> <br /> The Muppet movie is all about how everyone started. Kermit the frog used to live in a swamp. Until one day a movie manager tells him that there are auditions for frogs in Hollywood. So Kermit moves to Hollywood. Along the way, he meets many people like Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the Great and Miss Piggy. In addition, a bad man tries to capture Kermit. <br /> <br /> All Muppet films are extremely enjoyable. I mean, they are all very funny. This movie has many movie appearances. Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, Richard Pryor and Orson Welles. The Muppet films are all very enjoyable. I've heard that Jason Segel will soon star in a lead role. I can not wait to see it.
