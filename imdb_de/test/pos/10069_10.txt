I love this movie!! Sure, I love it because of Madonna, but who cares - it's so damn funny !!! * ALANiS Rocks *. When I saw this movie for the first time in cinemas in 1987, I thought it was funny! Madonna is so funny and I love her synchronized accent and her crazy / funky look. The funniest part of all time is when Madonna (Nikki) shouts at a man who just wants to get into a taxi. And even if Griffin Dunne (Louden) stumbles and falls into the apartment interview scene. ** ALANiS Rocks **. Madonna's character Nikki steals / lifts people throughout the movie - and her witty antics suffice to keep you down all the time. "Nothing robbed, if you rob a store, hold up the cashier, we opened some cassettes, there is a small difference" I love that !!! It is classic. *** ALANiS Rocks ***. I do not know why this movie was so struck. I do not see anything wrong - of course, if you're a big Madonna fan, then what she does is just great. If you're in the mood for classic entertainment out there, you can "Who's That Girl?" And another very important fact that everyone, or at least everyone that exists, should know about, will always rock ALANiS to the very end! Madonna in this movie too and only totally! Your acting is great!
