This is one of the films that you have to start looking with an open mind. You know, it's about a mute, you could look forward to many feelings or be afraid. <br /> <br /> Well, forget it. The movie starts with a little black humor and then starts. From there you will be taken on an ever-frightening journey through the dark centers of Moscow. All right, it has to be said: The unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is used primarily as a plot tool or as a fear builder. But this movie will not let you go. <br /> <br /> It's like the old gangster movies, but then without any glamor and in Russia. And that is one of the most important aspects of this film: It is located in Russia. This has a big impact on the movie, in my opinion it makes the movie better. Everything becomes simple and basic, life is without nonsense. This could be a great potential for more films in the future, gangster films about the Russian mafia. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful and scary movie. It's a horror, but you can only feel sorry for the little damper. One last tip: Do not look too late if you want to sleep well.
