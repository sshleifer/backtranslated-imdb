I just came back when I saw this awesome funny movie. <br /> <br /> Part of the reason I loved him so much was that I was able to draw attention to the people and places I knew ("I go there every day!" I work there! ", "I've been drinking there!", "Hey! This is our postman!" Etc ...) But if you're looking forward to a feeling of well-being with some seasoning (sorry for the pun), this is just the answer. Culture and, above all, love are woven together within the plot. <br /> <br /> With Preston (where the movie plays), which has recently been turned into a city, it is good to see this work characterizing the place and add the feeling of surprise. It is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north. <br /> <br /> Fabulous!
