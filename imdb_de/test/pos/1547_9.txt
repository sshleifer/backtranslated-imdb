One of the best of the 'kitchen sinks'. Fantastic views of London and valuable insights into the life of the working class of the 60s. Loach's eye seems to capture everything, but does not judge - a taste of what's to come. As with "Kes", "Riff-Raff" and "Sweet Sixteen", it serves as a cinematic social history of Britain. Carol White is totally convinced that you love her, you want her, you want to take care of her, but you stick your head to her self-destructive decisions and still follow her in vain hope. Well supported by Terence Stamp (fresh from "The Collector", also "The Hit") and a wealth of English faces (all look very young). Perfectly adjusted to Donovan's Dulcet tones. Stamp sings "Yellow is the color" in a beautiful scene and ends with the saying: "Always better, is not it?" (Song also in "The Rules of Attraction" - I think) 'go out and get a guy', their wrong ones Put eyelashes on the sound of 'Rosie' on the radio - priceless. A treasure for everyone who was there at the time, and a reminder of how good life is in England now. By the way, Soderburgh has used clips from 'Poor Cow' in 'The Limey'.
