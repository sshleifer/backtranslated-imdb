That was a nice movie. It had an interesting storyline that was pretty well done in the later part of the movie. The story somehow reminded me of the city of God. But this is nicely done by comparison. It had what I really loved: a touch of surrealism. Some pretty interesting cinematographs (through the wooden camera) I'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but it definitely extends your view of South Africa. The actors were good (for the first time visitors, most of them anyway), I particularly liked the character of Estelle, which made this movie very enjoyable. It is interesting, however, that one asks oneself about one's own life. Are you really doing what you really love? Or do you agree with the norm, the conventionalism around you. Definitely worth a watch.
