Camp North Star and his exceptional camp advisor, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray), certainly wants to end a decades-long defeat at Camp Mohawk, a place only the wealthy kids can attend. Meanwhile, we observe how Tripper tries to love himself by flirting aimlessly with female adviser Roxanne (Kate Lynch), while other adolescent counselors mate and fall headfirst. The film comes to the top of the camp Olympics as rivals compete in sports competitions. Tripper almost realized that her fate would be another year off. The film also shows the growing connection between gonorrhea and a quietly lonely, doggy-eyed Rudy (Chris Makepeace of "Vamp"), whose father is often constantly away. Rudy does not seem to fit in with his other kids of his age and spends most of his time either jogging in the morning with gonorrhea or taking his peanuts at blackjack. The film mostly contains hi-jinx from other teenage parents who cut and run around. <br /> <br /> They have hot advisers, totally Nerd Spaz (Jack Blum) with his glued glasses and bad acne, nose of a beak. "Hardware" (Matt Craven), who likes to blow things up, the fat boy Fink (Keith Knight), who often stuffs his face, including in the movie. There is a basketball game in which poor Spaz can barely bounce off the rival Camp Mohawk, much less to shoot a precise shot. Poor Fink hurls the back wall with his flies beating under his knees. There is a camp fire clutch (with a spirited scary story of gonorrhea about a killer with hooked hooks) and boys drooling over the pretty ladies. Yes, I know, it is sometimes desperately trying to express any laughter. I can occasionally accept failures of sentimentality (like the scenes with a sad Makepeace and Murray), but just as with this last contemplation, I giggled away. I'm licked and just can not help but love that. It's a summer camp movie you just want to talk through. I can not explain, or stress enough, that the overwhelming joy that flows out when I see a sleepy Murray's hand reach from the ceiling for the alarm clock loudly announcing a summer camp movie is just beginning. Especially funny are his intercom jokes. But the strip is, to be honest, a series of comic vignettes in which Murray pangs endlessly. Not that there is anything wrong with that. The movie could not quite survive without him, right? Hardly to think about this film, without Murray at the top. It's a happier time, and I think the nostalgia of this summer camp experience plays a big part in why we adults are still warmly linked to meatballs. And, poor Morty (Harvey Atkin), the camp head who wants so much that everything runs smoothly and defeats Camp Mohawk for a change, is the constant source of gonorrhea and Ganges pleasure, as they often play gags on him, especially when he does sleep on his bed! A big enthusiastic cast that seems to have as much as we have.
