This movie is not considered for an Academy Award, but if you enjoy a movie that does not take itself seriously and the viewer only wants to enjoy 90 minutes, this is not a disappointment. You will enjoy Darth Vader for the bad guy (the breather), a female Batman for the heroine (but much nicer with a lot less costume), and a joke about cigarettes and the police captain, which is very funny. Not a great movie performance. But if you enjoy camping, it is worth a visit. God help me, I liked it.
