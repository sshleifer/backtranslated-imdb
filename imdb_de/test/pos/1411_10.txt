The title song often comes to mind after all these years. I've never been a big TV attendant, probably because I just entered my busy teenage years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became part of my life. But since the first episode of Lawman, I've been addicted and it's the only TV program I've scheduled in my week is still the most beautiful man I've ever seen. (Peter Brown was not a dog either: o) <br /> <br /> I agree that this is one of the most underrated TV series of all time. I hope I can find some episodes for my grandchildren.
