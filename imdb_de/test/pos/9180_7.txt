When you see romantic comedies, you know what to expect; We have seen many, many years to know how they are doing. There is a formula that almost always produces films that are popular with the genre's audiences ... not always in terms of their actual quality. How can you play with it and make it more interesting? This movie has a suggestion ... and works pretty well. Instead of just following a trail, we follow it skillfully to help the unlucky men, those who lack the attractive fa√ßade that would enable them, the unseen good qualities that they have for the women they fall in love with , The action follows Smith as he works on his self-proclaimed most difficult case; Kevin James In addition to James' help, we also follow Mendes, who is tired of having men lying to get what they want (a scene that earns great respect for Smith's character is that he meets such an idiot and put him in his place). After seeing Smith help with the James disaster, we see him with Mendes ... and despite his talent for helping others, he messes up ... bad with her. A wonderful argument about love and how falling in love affects us. For a romantic comedy, this usually avoids the pitfalls of one (sometimes almost like the feeling of being a parody of the genre), though the final scenes have the sweetness and the emotion of that type of movie. Whether they follow the formula or not will not be revealed in this review. The pace is pretty good, it never really slows down and rarely moves too fast. Acting is great, pretty much everyone goes. The characters are well-developed and seem like real people. The humor does not always work ... there are occasional gags that are executed less fortunately, and one or two jokes that seem forced. In most cases, the movie was funny. I would recommend it to anyone who loves romantic comedies and everyone in love. Those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the final scenes. 10.7
