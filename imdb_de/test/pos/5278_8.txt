Ponyo At The Cliff is decorated in beautiful watercolor colors and is definitely worth seeing. He vaguely remembers the trailer that I did not find so impressive. I was surprised how beautiful and detailed he was. This movie has flooded me with its purity. <br /> <br /> In the middle stands a little boy, who comes in contact with a sea creature and whose relationship carries the film. Miyazaki is a master at creating memorable images as well as showing how young people interact credibly with their little idiosyncrasies. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that do not suit me well. It would be an understatement to say that the music "resembled" Ride Of The Valkyrians during a particular scene, which is a pity, because such a precious movie like this one can not afford to take liberties and an otherwise really great scene injured. The antagonist and his background story have never interested me either, but I think it served more as a background than anything else. <br /> <br /> Definitely a great movie. I highlighted the boat trip scenario with all its pictures and marine life. Pure and magical. And yes, hand-drawn artworks are more intimate than computer animations. I'm really excited about Princes And The Frog now.
