I've never seen anything of this darling of lovers, much less a production of a merchant from Venice. I can not say how faithful it is to the previous adaptations of the piece, so I'll treat it as yet another movie trying to be more. Novocaine for the eye MoV is an immediately gripping movie about a young lover Bassanio (Fiennes) and his trade friend Antonio (iron) and a Jewish money lender (Pacino). <br /> <br /> <br /> <Bassiano is bankrupt and needs money to woo the beautiful Portia (Collins), he goes to his friend Antonio, who is hypnotizing with his friends, so he borrows some money from Shylock, not now As Jews in general and Shylock in particular, and Shylock, who is bitter and twisted by the abuses, he has agreed in particular to antonio and Christians in general to lend Antonio the money unless antonio repay the loan within the agreed time limit can cut a pound of meat from Antonio's body <br /> <br /> Comment <br /> <br /> The film is breathtakingly beautiful and is acted and spoken in such a way that it compels you to think about what each line means. This, in turn, causes the viewer to gain insights into the characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> It seems to me a movie about the decisions that Shylock makes and how wrong decisions lead to Shylock's ruins The moment Shylock demands his pound of meat, he is doomed to fail, for the rest of the world is against him and he finds it difficult to bring about his doom, revenge on those who have harmed him, either succeed the victim or the villain succeeds Sees fault of his ways, which leads to a big hug. <br /> <br /> Not in MoV, the victim is quickly perceived as a villain and deprives him of happiness and faith <br /> <br /> This film is a powerful and subtle depiction of random anti-Semitism that shows how a whole Society can turn itself on minority and make it look as if the victim is really the culprit. <br /> <br /> I was blown away from this 10/10 movie
