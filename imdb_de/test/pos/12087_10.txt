I may be a good old boy from Virginia in the Confederate States of America, but this man does it for me. This mustache turns me upside down. I remember seeing a video of him for the first time. The girl he hit was incredible. The depth of his acting as they moved to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity. It reminds me of the granite sculptures of our mountain. Rushmore If I could ask him a question, it would say, "If you were a hot dog, would you eat yourself?" Will Orhan do a reunion tour? Note the sizes like Gordon Lightfoot. True music from the heart never fades. Vive La John Denver. Gracias my friend, O.F.F.L. (Orhan Fan for Life)
