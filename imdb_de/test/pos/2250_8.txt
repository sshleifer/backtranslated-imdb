Let me first say that Liev earned a lot of respect from me after his directorial debut "Everything Is Illuminated". Anyone who has read the book knows how satisfying the story is with nonsensical and witty vocabulary by Alex along with countless flashback scenes and crazy, dreamlike sequences. Liev took all that and made it work. The movie itself is great - the soundtrack, the performances, the camera - everything works. There's a lot of history missing about the city and its inhabitants, but with an indie you can only do so much that this part did not bother me too much. It's just disappointing that not many people will see this movie or even know it exists because of a lack of promotion. I did not know it was in the cinemas. I did not know when the DVD came out. Since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters, you would think that SOMEBODY had at least one commercial advertised for it. I had to watch the trailer on my "Paradise Now" DVD (released on DVD in the spring of '06) to even know that there was a theatrical release "Fall 2005". Haha - really sad. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you come across this review, somehow because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and recommend that you see it - take my advice and have a look to it. It is a very good experience. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
