For once a sequel to "The Karate Kid" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did an excellent job playing the orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi, worked very differently with Julie than Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie preferred karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most surly person Miyagi had ever challenged. And there was no tournament to attend. And there will also be humor in this movie. I liked the part where Miyagi, when Julie came home from school, looked for her and saw her change. That was very funny. Also the classic scene "Wax on, Wax off" was different. It was funny when Miyagi says to Julie, "Oh, missed job". The set in Boston was far from California. The militant group in this group was like the Cobra Kai in Boston. And Michael Ironsides Colonel Dugan was not John Kreese. His group practically left him when Julie kicked a serious butt. They all paid the price when they blew up that classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they will find relief from Dugan's poison. This karate kid sets some manners, unlike the last three who spoke of "honor" and "respect." Hilary Swank is exceptionally hot in every movie and everything else she does. Movie 9, Hilary Swank 10!
