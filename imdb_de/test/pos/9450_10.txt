Well, I'm not a movie critic or anything like that. But I have my opinion about this movie. I think the best part of this movie was Amanda Bynes. She played her litter very well for my look. Movies, that's what I liked most! If you watch this movie, you can just relax, come down and watch it. You do not have to search for subtext or something similar. You just look at it. Movie is really great. Maybe I liked it for the actress, maybe for the whole landscape, but I liked it. The whole atmosphere that was created. In a moment I just felt like I was in this university, Oscar made in this room, it's just a nice movie that you can see in your spare time.
