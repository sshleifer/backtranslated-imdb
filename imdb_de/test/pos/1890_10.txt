The man with the screaming brain, which was shot entirely on site in Bulgaria, is a funny love story between two rich, ugly American guys and a murderous hotel girl. <br /> <br /> William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive on a business trip in Bulgaria and take a taxi driven by the mugger Yegor. Things go awry when Tatoya, the maid, murderer Yegor and William and a mad scientist implant a piece of Yegor's brain in Williams' head. Robots eventually get involved, as well as broken-fingered Gypsies, head injuries, Bruce Campbell riding a pink Vespa with tiny little streamers, and an all-of-me-style physical comedy at war with one voice in the air Head is located, which controls half of his body. <br /> <br /> The man with the screaming brain is an incredibly funny movie. It has the funniest tracking shot I've ever seen (as Bruce Campbell's character, fresh from the lab, complete with a huge forehead scar and a blue hospital pajama bumping into a square and terrifying a crowd) and a falling guy - murder scenes involving that entire test audience had to scream with laughter. The whole thing is a bloody uprising from start to finish, and I would recommend it to any fan of comedy, Bruce Campbell, or B-movies in general.
