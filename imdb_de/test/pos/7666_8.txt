This show was incredible, but too esoteric for most people. If you had never really seen a European variety show in the 70s or 80s (or at least a Mexican one), the entire show would probably be lost to you. If you did, this show was a dead impulsive satire of spurious spectacle and superficiality, in which these shows dip in the worst case. "Viva Variety" is a variety show supported by an incisive wannabe with a pencil mustache and his ultra-glamorous and intrusive Harridan EX wife. This is a variety show that tries to get on the ground in each episode, but is always involved in the fight and looks very wrong. The hosts are accompanied by "Johnny Bluejeans", a modest sidekick named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and the kids will like him, which of course they do not like. <br /> <br /> The result was generally a funny parody of variety shows. Imagine the argument that BACKSTAGE probably happened in the last days of the "Sonny & Cher Show". Now imagine, it happens ONSTAGE in front of you and the stars are trying to keep their composure. Add cheesy acts and a Euro-Riche mentality (tuxedos, dresses, liquor, accents and smoke). NOW you have "Viva Variety". <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard a musician whose music was written for other musicians? Too conceptual? Viva Variety did this for comedians. Far too esoteric for the American standard audience. It was funny as hell. And doomed to failure.
