How I spend my holidays concludes the television series, which aired from 1990 to 1992. I've always liked the show as it is. I have never compared the series to the Looney Tunes of yesteryear. The video was split into four or five episodes (I can not remember watching TV) and is included in the episode list of the series. The good thing about this series is that all the main characters of the show play an important role in the story. We see what they all do in their summer vacation in different parts of the world. Elmyra is on a safari with his parents, Plucky and Hampton are crossing the country with Hamptons parents, Fifi is on some beaches, etc. The highlight is very good and in the end all Tiny Toon characters meet at the beginning of a new year in the " Looniversity ", so that the good run of this TV program is practically over.
