This Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle comedy is best known for introducing a young Buster Keaton who has just emerged from his family debut with his family's vaudeville act in his film debut. Buster gets a significant role in this movie and is pretty funny overall. "The Butcher Boy" has a lot to laugh about and is an example of pure old-fashioned slapstick that was well done, even though he seemed to come from the short time of two-role comedies, as filmmakers are still in single-role segments presented of course. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie takes place in a grocery store, with Arbuckle the butcher of the title. It's an excuse to work out the many opportunities for quick physical humor that a general store offers, and Arbuckle really shows up as a 300-pound acrobat, demonstrating subtlety, dexterity, and grace in his performance of inconspicuous slapstick routines take it to another level. In a running gag, he happens to turn a big butcher knife into the right position on the chopping board, and I'm still stunned that Arbuckle really seems to be doing it every time. There is also a really nice gag that supports him on his scales and is confused why his pieces of meat are so heavy. Buster Keaton is a boy who buys molasses and skilfully plays in a foot-to-floor routine that follows. Apart from the strange and almost disturbing half-smile, his idiosyncratic posture and body language immediately make him recognizable as the Buster we know. He even destroyed his once defended flattened hat - here for the first time, of course, when he is filled with molasses. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film moves into more situational comedy and Arbuckle, and its rival Al St. John is dressing to infiltrate Fatty's girlfriend's boarding school. Much of the humor also comes from the generally surreal and mysteriously laughing sight of these two strange guys wearing drag and trying to be "girls". Buster is also in this segment but is mostly in the occasional cutaway helping St. John. <br /> <br /> The ending of "The Butcher Boy" becomes a little empty frenetic, but on the whole and beyond it Historical Curiosity, it's a well-done comedy that only gets the laugh it expects.
