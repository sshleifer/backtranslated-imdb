This mystery / psycho-thriller is, in my opinion, one of the best I've ever seen. All the actors do a wonderful job, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who initially changes to the cool star by the strange events she belongs to. In this film, you will learn a lot about the true inner feelings of the people and much about the film business. Fascinating is the film in film situations at the beginning and by the game that plays the "acting coach" with her. The music of Mark Snow is probably the best score I've ever heard. You will not forget this movie!
