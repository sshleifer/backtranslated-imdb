I've seen this movie a long time ago, but I've always loved it. The story is about a young girl, Sally O'Moyne, who learns from an early age that her prayers are answered when she prays to St. Anne, hence her missing lunch bucket and a mean neighbor who nudges her and she Pray that someone should give him a black eye to saddle. A minute later something hits him and he has a black eye. Sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for the better. She is well known and loved in the neighborhood as she has filled pamphlets with all the pleas of her friends. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a local boy returns home from college (I believe) and Sally is awesome about how much he is grown up. Sally has a crush on him but is so shy. Should she use her holy prayer power for St. Anne for her selfish desire or just watch the most popular girls in school try to catch the man off her dreams? This is an entertaining film with a grandfather so charming and Irish, brother annoying, and a sworn neighbor of the Irish neighbor who spends the day with Grand-Pop. He has his own story that he wanted to buy the O'Moynes estate, a small house in the middle of two large apartment complexes (his own). In other words, the O'Moynes house is a wonder for its beautiful buildings. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth a watch and is good enough and rare enough to add to your movie collection. I hope you like it!
