In my opinion, National Velvet is one of the top family classics of all time. It features Mickey Rooney as (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). Velvet wins a racehorse, which is called in a raffle (pie). She immediately falls in love with her. With the help of Mi, a former jockey, they train to drive to the Grand National. After the jockey, who was scheduled to hit Pie at the last moment, pulled out, Mi convinces that Velvet can take his place. Fine plot and first-class spectacle. The inner game between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family picture sent by Clarence Brown. The photography is stunning. This is a movie you will enjoy for a long time. <br /> <br /> This image has made Elizabeth Taylor a household name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth remained close after the movie. They still send postcards after all those years. <br /> <br /> A side note. Elizabeth loved the horse "Pie" so much that the studio gave it.
