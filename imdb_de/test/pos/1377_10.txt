OK, maybe that's because I'm from the northeast of Scotland and I speak the same way as the guys in this movie, but I thought that was very funny. Cheap fun to be sure, but there has been a lot of effort to make the movie look awesome and the actors give it their all. I was actually pretty affected when they died. Especially when the captain finally fell. The script Well, it's a game of 2 halves. The first half of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not great, many questions remain unanswered. This will undoubtedly annoy others, as it annoys me. But still a lot of fun and a very smart first feature of Sturton.
