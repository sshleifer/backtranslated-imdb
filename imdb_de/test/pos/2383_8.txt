Scooby Doo and the Mexican monster were undoubtedly the weakest of Scooby Doo's modern animations. Loch Ness Monster is a significant improvement. <br /> <br /> This time, the gang goes to Scotland to see the Highland Games and visits Blake Castle, Daphne's parent company. And do not you know that the castle happens to be in the "picturesque" fishing village of Drumnadrochit on the shores of Loch Ness? During their stay, they meet some interesting people. First, there is Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who has drowned all her money to find the Loch Ness monster. Sir Ian Locksley, head of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland, is a staunch non-believer of Nessie. <br /> <br /> The Haggarts, your own a cozy inn on the banks of the Loch. The sons are a few native jokers, always in mischief. Del Chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie guy who is convinced that the monster is out there and will not do anything to find her. <BR /> <br /> And finally, Duncan MacGubbin, the dockmaster who has seen Nessie too many times to count. <br /> <br /> Most of these characters are stereotypes, which gets a little annoying as this younger crowd teaches a load of crap and the wrong impression. If you can make yourself immune to it, you are fine. Being from Scotland, I can not help but flinch at the terribly imitated Scottish accents. Fact: We do not sound that way. <br /> <br /> Soon, Nessie, who looks more demonic than usual, shows chaos. Looks like the gang has another secret in their hands. The usual chase scenes, clues and Shaggys crazy disguises follow. There are many laughs. The animation is great with some atmospheric scenes and places. And the plot is much better than Monster of Mexico. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing this time is the music. I miss the record of Louis Febre and the songs here are pretty lazy too. Where are the Hex Girls when you need them? <br /> <br /> The Region 2 DVD is in crystal clear 1.78: 1 anamorphic widescreen (the Region 1 is not) with Dolby 5.0 sound. Some okay extras are included. Definitely worth a visit.
