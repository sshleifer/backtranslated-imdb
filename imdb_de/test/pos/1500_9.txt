The three short films from this compilation, published in 1959, are timeless Chaplin classics that do not do anything wrong and are not objectionable. Chaplin's score for these films and the frame added as a bridge between the short films have also been well done. The problem with this compilation is minor, but annoying. The shorts were on the 24 frame ps. Speed ​​of contemporary films, while the short films themselves with 20 frames p.s. These results are jerky movements that do not look very attractive, yet this was an excusing solution given the limitations of optical printing technology. It is simply not to apologize that the current DVD version is not restored. The films look just as dirty in 1959 and are still stretch printed. There are separate recovery versions of these classics, even on DVD, and it would not be a problem to restore the image, but this has not been done yet. <br /> <br /> A small mistake took up a lot of space in my article, but once again I say a little problem, it should not distract so much from the experience, though it distracted one point from my rating. The shorts are still worth '10'.
