Jewel Thief is one of the thrilling thrillers, with viewers guessing who the villain will be until the very end. The excitement builds on the first scene when the Jewel Thief becomes a national issue and the film cleverly contains hidden clues so you can guess who the Jewel Thief is. The story shows that Dev Anand (Vinay in the movie) and the Jewel Thief have identical faces. But you get a shock of 1000 watts when you meet the villain. There are many surprises and lots of fishy stuff, but there is time for romance and six melodic, everlasting songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafi. This movie was also talking for the videos of his song. Consider the excitement and counter-challenge in Asman Ke Neeche. Or the blocking of the Dev Anand road as Tanuja goes out with her friends in Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara. Or the romantic Dil Pukare Are in beautiful Sikkim. Or the wonderful dance of Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you will never forget this movie for some reason. <br /> <br /> He can be directed by Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Tanuja and Vyjantimala and directed by Vijay Anand (Dev Anand's younger brother) making this one of the most popular Hindi films of all time to date.
