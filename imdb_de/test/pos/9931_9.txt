Beware of the Scottish game! In his captivating and shattering opera, Dario Argento returns to classic form, regaining the mastery he lost during the filming of confused and delirious psycho-shockers like Tenebre and Phenomena. In fact, based on a simple narrative enhanced by opulent set pieces, imaginatively brutal murder sequences, and refined photography, the film feels like the Argento we once knew. The only real infringement of the Opera is the lack of a score by Goblin that provided unusual, iconic and timeless music for many of Argento's biggest films (the opera selections used here are wonderful though). <br /> <br /> The production is completed by several competent actors. While she is not Jessica Harper, Annabella Sciorra's resemblance to Cristina Marsillach creates enough anger and compassion to realize the role of the tortured heroine. Ian Charleson is interesting as a horror movie director Marco. And Daria Nicolodi is as always fantastic, even in her relatively short role (check out the making of featurette on the DVD for a fun interview with Nicolodi about her role - clearly gruff and annoying about the end of her relationship with Argento !) Stage Fright (another excellent Giallo from 1987 directed by Michele Soavi, who served as second director for Opera) will barely recognize the last girl in this film, Barbara Cupisti, as a stage manager <br /> <br / > For me it's often the little things that matter, and Argento's fascination / obsession with lonely nightmare images makes him my ideal filmmaker. Opera is full of little details that made me smile. For example, I love that we never see the face of the "Great" Mara Czekova. I also love the scene where the killer scratches the tip of his deadly sharp dagger on a TV screen and shows Betty's performance as Lady Macbeth. Finally, I resist even the most gruesome Slasher veterans so as not to waver, as the "pin burrs" are placed over Betty's eyes. <br /> <br /> In short, Opera is a pure, tense and tight thriller. With his solid performances, clear focus and educated cinematography he wants to be in the same league as Deep Red and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage. Could Opera be the last big Giallo?
