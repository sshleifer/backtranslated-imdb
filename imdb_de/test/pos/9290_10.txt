This show is not a stop-merriment. The first joke makes you wet in your pants. And that's probably the weakest joke of all. I started watching it when the second half of the second season aired. and so on. I am addicted. Only 2 weeks after I started to look. I downloaded episodes and bought the DVDs. Repeated clips like "Ad-Road-Test" and "News" are pretty weird. Then there is the advertisement they take off. "Use Emo Use your own tears for more effective use". Nothing is wrong when they do that. it's funny. Any Australian who does not find that funny. Do not complain and do not look. All Australian TUNE IN Wednesday at 9 on ABC
