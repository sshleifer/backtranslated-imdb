I recently bought "The Big Trail" {1930}. It's a great, amazing movie. I knew it because of the good reputation but never expected it to be so great. My version is the only recording in 35mm and I will talk about it later. When you think about Western myth in the movie, John Ford and John Wayne come to mind. Well, you only have half of the team here, but the whole myth is present. Raoul Walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the true conspiracy is the struggle for the nation's western expansion. <br /> <br /> There is an action centered around a romance between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron {Margaret Churchill}, with the main villain, Red Flack, being memorably played by Tyrone Power, Sr. Random quality like the wagon train fights against incredible obstacles - both natural and humane. Examples are the crossing of the river, the Indian battle and the crossing of the burning desert. The aftermath of the battle receives a bleak note when a doll is placed on the grave of a dead child, while a faithful dog lies on his master's grave. <br /> <br /> Great panoramas are full of energy and activity. The opening scene, where the wagon train prepares for the descent, the Square Dance Interlude and the big buffalo herds are some that come to mind. Filming with locations is used wonderfully. Another feature of this great film is the fact that men and women are equally respected for their role in the big fight to the west. Women work, fight and confront the terrible hardships with the same strength and strength as their male counterparts. The finale has an impressive experience as Coleman and Cameron meet in the gigantic, towering Sequoia forest to start their new lives. <br /> <br /> Acting is acceptable everywhere. I've already talked about Tyrone Power's scene-robbing performance. Tully Marshall excellently qualifies as Coleman's buddy, and Marguerite Churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops an inner power when she encounters both her own problems and her own problems. The comic relief is the weakest aspect of this film, but these scenes are not common and are swallowed up in the film's sweeping momentum. <br /> <br /> I've read a lot of criticism of Wayne's performance. He even went so far as to blame his "playing the wood" for the film's failure at the box office. I think that's unfair. Wayne was in his first lead role and certainly had not developed the charisma of his performance in "Stagecoach". But he still does a useful job in a role that will no doubt be behind the big issue. After "The Big Trail," Wayne starred in a large number of low-budget B Westerns. I have some of them and you can see the developing actor in them. When "Stagecoach" came, he was ready for it and "The Big Trail" was an integral part of this training. <br /> <br /> I already mentioned that my version is the only 35mm recording. It's still impressive, but to get an idea of ​​the effect of the 70mm version, I set the screen to 16: 9, which does not cause any distortion. The grandeur version did not have the full effect but was good enough to force me to get the latter. {In addition, the film, shot in 70mm, contains some extra scenes that are not in the shape intended for normal theatrical performances. <br/> <br /> All in all, this movie deserves to be in one of the best Lists of westerns ever made.
