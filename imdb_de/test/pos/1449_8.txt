I've never been so surprised by a movie that was so old. Only "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" holds this well in terms of performance. As someone who saw heroin addiction first-hand, I was shocked at how realistic this movie was. Frank Sinatra's performance is absolutely uncompromising, realistic and heartbreaking. Otto Premingers directing is perfect for the movie, with long shots and a very mobile camera. Kim Novak's performance is good, as is Eleanor Parker. In fact, the entire minor cast works very well with unobtrusive performances that match the style of this film. The documentary style is part of what keeps this movie up to date. We recommend. <br /> <br /> 8,0 out of 10
