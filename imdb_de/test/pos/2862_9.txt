Honestly, when I attended this movie at the Rave Theater in Plainfield, Indiana, I did not expect much. I just went to this movie because I thought, hey, it's a WWE movie that will be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and saw it and saw why they had selected Glen Jacobs (Kane) for Jacob Goodnight. He's probably one of the craziest guys on the big screen (in my opinion, much worse than Freddy or Jason) and has a big advantage over other movies that attracts me to a horror movie. It shows Jacob Goodnight as someone who is human. He has a heart, no matter how twisted and scary it is. He feels pain, something that Jason never does or seems to show. He feels sadness and pleasure, though both are crazy again, what you'll notice when you watch the movie. All in all a different experience in my opinion than many slashers, and it surprised me in some ways how lived in the end.
