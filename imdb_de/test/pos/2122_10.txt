Grand Champion is a bit old-fashioned at first glance. Andrew Morton of Fort Worth Star Telegram said it was best. "If Walt Disney had come from Texas, he would have Grand Champion." Soul. The kids are great and the number of stars is incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see Tubb. Take your children with you, take your children, take Grandma with you. You will enjoy it all and you will too.
