The portrayal of marital fidelity depicted in the film seems outdated today, but it is precisely the adherence of the main characters to this idea that makes the whole story so touchingly tragic. It is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to be different from their spouses, "not like them". <br /> <br /> As Tony Leung said in the movie, love just happens. There does not have to be any rational explanation for how this happens, it just does it. Although they did not want to go to the level of their respective spouses, it happened. Loyalty, social customs and timing have all prevailed against the realization of this relationship. Simply being in love is far from enough. <br /> <br /> I had the misfortune to sit next to a young couple (still in the university because of the short snippets of conversation that they have kindly shared with me throughout the movie and who are not interested Pain of lost love and missed opportunities). Her gross inability to digest the subtlety and the deeper emotions made me realize how much a film like this and other works by Wong Kar Wei are wasted on the local audience.
