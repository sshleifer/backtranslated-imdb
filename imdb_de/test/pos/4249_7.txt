Sure, the movie is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of the time. In that sense, the film is actually dated. But as a satirical view of America's most popular parasitic industry, advertising, this is still the goal. But equally important is the counter message, namely the impact of big money on those who would make the industry socially responsible. Consider, for example, how Putney's clothes suddenly change to resemble the Third World revolution of Fidel just before he leaves the company. For a moment, it looks like Swope's mini-revolution has been successful among his staff, and he keeps going, maybe to spread the movement. Then the former fighters succumb to the thrill of big money and he shakes his head, perhaps to take a plane to Cuba. Downey's last word, however, is an ironic word, as the Arab (I believe) burns down the money tower and leaves behind the metaphorical structure (advertising, capitalism) of a smoking ruin. For me it looks like change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a reform process - a message that corresponds to the radical zeitgeist has some really funny moments, especially with the commercials that are now running just as well as they did then. Those who compare the anarchic style with the Marx-Bros make a good point. The disposable lines fly with the outrageous lineups quickly and quickly. Forty years later, it's still a tough movie to get a consistent view. Despite the atrocities, however, the film remains a work of daring originality with some truly enlightening moments.
