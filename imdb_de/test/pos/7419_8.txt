This movie has one of the best club scenes, a very good soundtrack (if you like techno / trance music). <br /> <br /> Some situations (as the main character Carl, for example, begins to take drugs) are a bit removed from reality, but the plot is entertaining, but the characters are all a bit flat ... <br / > <br /> I would not recommend you to watch this movie if you do not like techno music. <br /> <br /> For the plot / drama alone, this movie is a 4/10, with the really cool special effects and the club scenes and soundtrack it's a 7/10, but if you want to go to the movies, only to hear beautiful tracks grab a little club feel, it's a 10/10. <br /> <br /> the special effects are sometimes hidden, sometimes clearly visible. (ie fast-moving clouds / sun / moon, morphing background, morphing cuts) <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it, too bad there was no dance floor in the cinema;)
