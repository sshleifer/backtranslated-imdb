If you are looking for a movie that has a quick mind and does not bore you then you are in the right place. It's fast and funny with some decent spectacles coming from the characters. It's always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as something other than Marky Mark. This picture has been burned forever in my head. As an actor, he is pretty good. This movie is a must for action fans who want to see some twists and turns. I'll have to pick up this movie one day and buy it.
