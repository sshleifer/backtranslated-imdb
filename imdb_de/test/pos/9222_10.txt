When I was a kid, that was the movie I saw. I think it's a great movie for the kids, and the parents do not have to be afraid of violence or obscene pictures. rainbow brite is a happy young girl and she tries to scare off the winter. She finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it to herself. I love this movie and I think that adults too can enjoy this movie.
