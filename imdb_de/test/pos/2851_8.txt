If I had seen the poster just for Sister Betty, I probably would not have touched it with a three-meter pole. But after hearing something positive and knowing it was making some noise in Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a really enjoyable movie based on a very entertaining storyline. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as? Nurse 'Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode after a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by the disgusting comedian Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> The movie is constantly moving between comedy, drama, romance and thriller. Despite this obvious identity crisis, she is doing quite well. I saw my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end, always waiting for the next twist in the story. The entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who caused a sensation a few years ago with the very impressive and dark movie in the Company of Men) is too focused on many clich√© conventions in Hollywood instructed. The mood-creating musical effects he pushed into our throat in every sentimental scene were unbearable! And he has the usual old "Take some of the minor characters and end up in an illogical and unnecessary romance novel" just to make sure everyone goes home with a smile on their face. Why do directors and authors have to treat their audience like idiots? <br /> <br /> But the movie is still way too enjoyable to be pulled down very far by those annoying irritations. In a very under-average year for movies, "Nurse Betty" is one of the pleasanter surprises of the year 2000. 8 out of 10 points.
