I saw a part of this movie on the sci-fi channel, but missed the end. I bought the DVD to watch the whole movie, and I'm glad I did that. A young mother and her two daughters move to a house in a backwoods that they inherited from their husband died of an illness. It is very run-down, but the three women make the most of it. The teenage daughter (Scout Taylor-Compton) is warned by a local boy about the zombies coming out at night. She ignores him, but since he has a nice girlfriend, she joins his group. Meanwhile, the younger daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) makes a friend in a zombie girl named Mary named Mary. It turned out that Mary and several other children died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor. Now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who is not a blood relative. <br /> <br /> This film was made by J.S. Cardone, whose previous films included The Slayer (1981) and Shadowzone (1990), two films I did not like in the least. That's why I was surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. The movie is intentionally clocked, which I liked. So you can get to know the main characters, most of whom are sympathetic. Children's zombies have been used since at least George Romero's classic Night Of The Living Dead (1968). Nevertheless, I found the tool that uses child zombies in this film interesting. It seems that Cardone has finally found the right script and cast. I was bored only the stereotypical scenes in which the teenagers smoked, drank and in a parked car rumliefen. Taylor Compton also appears in the Halloween remake. Moretz appeared in The Amityville Horror (2005) and in the horror film Room 6 (2006).
