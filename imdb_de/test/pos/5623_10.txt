Let's face it, there are a lot of bad movies being shot all the time. For those who work in the film, you've probably invested a lot of time and effort into many of these plans that mean fewer wonders. Sometimes, and that's my opinion, it's important for us to just do the film. To tell a story (no matter how simple and unrealistic). The collaborative process is also an essential feature that is unique to film and theater. To produce a production of any caliber, the talents of a varying number of people, depending on their size, must bring their story to life. The most intriguing part of American Movie, however, is not the movie that is filmed. It is the filmmaker himself, as a sign of his own life, that requires our attention. None of them serves as a model of the filmmakers we know and work with. But I say they are archetypes of small parts of us trying to be part of this cult activity of independent filmmaking. (Alright, a very small part of us) These are the people who live under the rocks of their own lives and are accidentally captured by the romance of the cinema. This leads me to my next argument. American Movie captures the raw spirit of independent filmmaking. Bad stories told on (nowadays) digital movies with sloppy effects and terrible performances - because that's the best thing they can do with a budget of several thousand dollars instead of a multi-million dollar studio budget per day. That's the difference between low-end low-end productions and studio productions. The independent filmmaker only wants to create a linear or even a non-linear story in order to shoot as well as possible the money he puts into himself and the resources around him to see a finished product on his rundown television. Robust individualism materializes in every art form. I find this film a brilliant document of truth for many filmmakers. And no, I'm not full of me. Man, these people are weird. Their problems are funny, their features are funny. Best line of the film: "It's alright! ... It's okay! ... There is something to live! ... Jesus told me !!!" Millions of times said by a funny old man. Hats off to Tom Beach. Chicago Rules.
