It took me years to capture this gem of a movie and it was worth it to wait. In almost all his films Clint always plays the hero. Be it a hero, an antihero or a revenge hero. In this movie he is a pure villain and he plays it well. As a wounded union soldier, he is taken by the students and teachers to an allied girls' school to heal. Soon after, he begins to seduce the ladies regardless of their age, and some are quite young. He also plays on their jealousy and sets them against each other. In the end, you're never so happy to let Clint die a terrible death. <br /> <br /> This makes this movie a gem. Clint has never done another movie like this, and after watching this movie, he wishes he had done it. He plays the role of the bad guy so well that you'll wonder why he's never made such films. It also explains why the movie is not seen often. Most people do not want to see Clint as a villain, and after Dirty Harry was released shortly after this movie, he has become a hidden gem. If you're a Clint Eastwood fan, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. You may not like what you will see, but you will not forget it so soon.
