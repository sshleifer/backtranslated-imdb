In 1953, I went through a boot camp on MCRD Parris Island. This movie is just as accurate a representation of what boots have been through during this time, even the burial of this sand flea. Many of the "actors" in the movie were Marines. This movie may be more entertaining for Marines than others, but I think the movie itself is very well done, and Jack Webb has made a "good DI". Semper Fi!
