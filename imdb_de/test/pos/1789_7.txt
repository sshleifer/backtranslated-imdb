What do I say to this movie? Good for a start, I thought that this movie is okay, not the biggest, not the worst. I said that because I thought the script was great and original, really different and refreshing. Now I would not say that it is the best movie I have seen because of acting. The actors, who played every role, seem to have played them without emotion, as if they had killed them. For some reason, when the woman laughed or cried, it did not look real to me, that's just one example, but truly, all the characters did not really respond at all. I wish I could say more positive things about this movie so you can at least see it once. I borrowed this film in the library of my school without hearing anything about the movie itself or the director. I used a chance because the story described on the back page sounded really interesting and was really.
