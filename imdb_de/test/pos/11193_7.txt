"Distant" is a piece of Turkish life that tracks the worldly activities of two adult male cousins. one is a photographer and the other an unemployed underachiever. There is no doubt that author Nuri Bilge Ceylan is a work of great talent. However, this small alien, minimalist drama of art is so full of empty pens and so free of stories or attractions or provocations that it is likely to address only the most zealous supporters of the cinema and address a different audience. Personally, I quickly became bored with the slow pace of the movie and found myself quickly through the empty spaces - and there are many - between dialogue, plot development, and dissolution. "Distant" is a beautifully made piece of esotericism. (B-)
