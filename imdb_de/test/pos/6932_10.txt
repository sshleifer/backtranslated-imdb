Todd Sheets has created one of the best LOW BUDGET zombie movies ever. The story is great, the gore is great, the psychos are evil! Nevertheless, the film is flawed because of its small dialogue and its slow imaging. Despite this ZB2, he delivers what every zombie movie should be, Gore, good action, fast adventure game in the Macarbe. If only MR Sheets had been allocated a budget of $ 100,000, this movie would do EVERY zombie movie even with the almighty dawn of the dead. <br /> <br /> But in time he gets better and the more money he gets comes in the bag So allow this modern genius to better his vision. <br /> <br /> Remember that Zombie Bloodbath 2 was just one of his big stepping stones when he was on Gore Mountain
