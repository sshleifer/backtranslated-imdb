so. I was totally in love with this movie. gaga for that, in spite of all his conspiracies ... but the only thing that really bothered me was the connection between the two best friends in Tim and Kyle. While the author of the film gave us such a poignant moment between the two and their sexual experiments / confusion, does he then conspire with us to make them half-brothers?!?! (Although the theme was not discussed in the film ... and was left inexplicable and unconsidered) I just thought it was tasteless and the fact that it was not even discussed is even worse. (Oops, we've created a taboo ... now we do not want to deal with the situation, because that would not really be P.C.) Otherwise, a spectacular movie
