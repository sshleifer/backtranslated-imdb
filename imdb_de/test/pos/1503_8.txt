To be honest, A CAT IN THE BRAIN is one of the funniest and most unintentionally funny movies I've ever seen. This film is packed with stupid dialogues, ridiculous scenes and an action that includes legendary horror director Lucio Fulci himself. <br /> <br /> The threadbare story is about an aging director (Fulci, who was also named Lucio Fulci in the movie ...) because of all the vicious things he's left in the movie in recent years , crazy and hallucinated. He goes to a diminutive who hypnotizes Fulci and tells him he thinks he's a murderer, but the diminutive will actually be the one to kill. The rest of the film consists of footage from the "film" that Fulci stages throughout this action, scenes in which people are shrinking, killing people all the time, like an idiot, and some of Fulci's hallucination sequences. Oh yes, and a few tits thrown for a good measure ... <br /> <br /> A cat in the brain is completely exaggerated - and ridiculous in every way. The Gore is a classic fulci - fies and strong with some really decent scenes. The chainsaw section of a female corpse is pretty cool, as well as the chainsaw beheaded by a little boy. Many stabbing, gouging and other cool kill scenes make this a perennial bloodbath. The ridiculous dialogue (LICK IT !!!! LICK IT !!!) as well as some of the insanely silly scenes (the Nazi orgy, the opera singing slap festival and the running down of an innocent hippie) easily come to mind. ..) make this fun as hell. Not nearly as dark as some of Fulci's other films - CAT is more of a selfish horror / comedy, which, if not funny, is somehow sad. I say, grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in this. I saw CAT with some friends and we laughed the whole time. THIS is the feel-good film of the summer ... Recommended 8/10
