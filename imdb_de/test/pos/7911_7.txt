Considered by many to be a strangely overlooked Chabrol, the reason why he was cold-shouldered seems to me to be the sleaze factor. Not as strikingly sexy, violent or bloody as many films of that time, it does start quite surprisingly, and although measuring more and more causes an unpleasant odor. Mrs. Audran, not the Eismaid, but a drunken mother, Donald Pleasence makes a cameo as child molester, David Hemmings has underage sex and the central theme is the relationship between a brother, a sister and a niece. No, not very nice and Chabrol treats it all as if it were normal (like in a small French village!), Instead of Ed McBains New York City. If handled in a more sensational way, it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film. Here we really have to choose between the probability of various unpleasant options before the final resolution. Very good to see
