I seem to notice that many people have never seen this movie before, and those who usually dismissed it as garbage ... that's really pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie for the first time, I admitted to being almost one of those people ... Thank God I'm patient otherwise I would never have found such a classic. <br /> <br /> As stupid as this movie is, it's also a must for anyone who is either a fan of 80's films or just a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I know that there are a lot of people who will tell you that this movie is a kind of derivative of Better Off's Dead ... well, and if so? They were both excellent films! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius! 10/10
