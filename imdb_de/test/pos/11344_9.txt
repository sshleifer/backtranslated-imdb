The dialogue is usually completely unimportant. <br /> <br /> The story resembles a childishly in love with a beautiful woman and a sad man whose suffering is palpable but helpless. "In The Mood For Love" is narrated from the perspective of a child, but the child never appears as a narrator. The aesthetics of the film are developed through extreme light and color dramaturgy, hard cuts, a non-fixed, almost documentary camera and a complex, unobtrusive sound. <br /> <br /> Nat King Coles' ingenious use, perhaps "Maybe", whose mysterious power is repeated more and more, and the melancholy waltz helps with the graceful choreography of the two protagonists, Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses Brilliant, the perfect counterpart to handsome, stylish Tony Leung, the audience suspect a romance between them, but Wong sees only a sad resignation, the two potential lovers spinning around each other like satellites, knowing they'll never have the same orbit They will not find it, and the emotional power of their non-love-sex relationship makes the movie immensely mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> It's about broken happiness and unspoken love, in all the movies from Wong these are the leitmotifs, love, whether it comes too early or too late to take the one and not the other, the longing of the character e, which will never be satisfied, their loneliness, the grief and the happiness they experience when it is too late.
