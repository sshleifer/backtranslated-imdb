It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It is reminiscent of the New York city feel of the time, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, who is pulled up by his own petard and finally retires to the bed of his adoptive parents. Completely absurd it is the life that you see through the magical glasses, see things as they are "real" ... I do not think they will ever be shown anymore. If so, surely someone would make Tivo the thing and bring it out there. A kidnapping goes awry: mixed in a rainstorm, back and forth, or fa√ßades, our hero throws a raincoat over his prey and throws it into his bicycle-powered ice cream truck spirit, which takes her to his basement apartment in the village. He is amazed, surprised and incredibly disappointed when the wrappers leave: instead of a luscious woman he has caught a medieval suburban house woman who speaks and talks and talks. The movie is full of vignettes of commuter life, suburban life, city officials, and all such loving attitudes. It pushes the boundaries of comedy, for example, magical reality may drive a drama, just as Daffy Duck is able to use imaginative scenes to demonstrate his plight or desires, all on the verge of plausibility. Everything is humorous, nobody is mean.
