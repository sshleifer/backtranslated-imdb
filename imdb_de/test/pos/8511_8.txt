Although Never Say Never Again (NSNA) has a weak soundtrack, it is far superior to "Octopussy". Never Say Never Again is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (Connery's Disliked Bond). Rich in clever dialogue, wit, wisdom, sex appeal and one of the best and most compelling villains in the entire Bond series. In addition, NSNA has a very talented young and beautiful Kim Basinger. British comedy fans will also spot actor (Attwood), known as "Mr. Bean." I would not trade any of the Moore images for this image. However, the previous Connery / Bond efforts (with the exception of "Thunderball") are superior. <br /> <br />
