I recently rented The China Syndrome, mainly because I read that ABC inspired the movie to do The Day After. "Syndrome", however, is more of a thriller than a drama. The film is quite political, but I strongly agree with its message - nuclear power is extremely efficient, but far too dangerous for general use. The risks are just too high. Hopefully those responsible for real nuclear power plants are far more responsible and ethical than those shown in the film. However, the fact that the real catastrophe on Three Mile Island happened just months after the release of the film puts the question into question. (To be fair, this case was probably more a case of incompetence than corruption.) "Syndrome" not only affects nuclear power, but also modern news media, much like "Network." only much more serious. I am a print journalist myself and I know how people perceive the media. But it was a bit frightening to see that the television news had been sold out by the 1970s. If the character of Jane Fonda tries to convince her boss that she allows real news instead of fluff, she is advised not to try the change, since "research" finds that people prefer a pretty girl to fluff , no hard news. <Br /> <br /> What makes the movie truly memorable is the unbelievable tension created in its last third. During this time, the viewer constantly fears for the lives of the protagonists, whether the risk of hired thugs or the possible collapse of the nuclear power plant exists. And this very last scene - I will not tell you, of course - but it will advise you. <br /> <br /> In the end, I got a distinct feeling when I look at the film, in which it seemed more like a TV movie than a real theatrical film. This could be more due to the fact that the strap I was looking at was quite old and not formatted for TV screens as it is today for videos and DVDs.
