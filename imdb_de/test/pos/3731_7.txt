I saw this today with little background in history. I go to the movies as an escape to leave everything behind and enjoy a "story". I thought that was a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :) Diane Lane was as always wonderful, Richard Gere is not an over-actor. He has held on and has a certain presence that we always expect. He brings his own style to the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was a love story that is not always told. It was messy and they had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and wait for each other. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it!
