Warning: Duke is a filmmaker and as such a bit too dramatic. Obsessions in closing doors may be a real part of the character's life, but the dramatic beautification of a filmmaker - or both agreed at the San Francisco premiere. But Herzog's usual fascination with character, dreams, and stamina goes well with this story, first published in Soldier of Fortune, and now a full-length autobiographical book. (The Soldier of Fortune comment loudly produced the politically correct SF audience, and both the filmmaker and the main character had to assure the audience that had just watched the film that SOF's interest was out of place - so warns Rambo not only survival.)
