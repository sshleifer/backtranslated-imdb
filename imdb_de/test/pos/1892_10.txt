I do not know what some people thought when they said this movie was bad. It was great. Classical Bruce Campbell, yes, it was a low budget and the special effect has shown that, but that's not what you see in a Bruce movie when you look at it for Bruce. Ted Rami was also excellent. I found this movie funny and entertaining. I still have to pull myself together when I remember Bruce on the pink moped. Well, I admit that this movie is not for everyone. If you do not like B movies, you probably will not like them if you want big budget effects and control the actors clearly. But if you like slap stick and sci-fi plots off the wall, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Hail the King Baby!
