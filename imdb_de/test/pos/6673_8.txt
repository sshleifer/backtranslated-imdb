If you like movies that make you think, this is definitely one of the good ones. I always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg. You have always made high quality films. <br /> <br /> Iain Softley has done a great job of staging K-PAX. The film tears feelings and philosophy of mind and the world. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges both provide outstanding acting skills. It got me, I did not look away from the screen during the movie. On the other hand, if you hope for a sci-fi movie with special effects, this is not for you. The story is dragged a little bit, which can be a bit boring, but also serves to build the theme of the film.
