I just happened to catch this little gem in 1980 or 1981. I was in a revival theater to see two old stupid sci-fi movies. The theater was full and there was (without warning) a lot of sci-fi short acting (to get us in the mood). Most were a bit amusing, but THIS came on and within seconds the audience was hysterical! The biggest laugh came when they showed that "Princess Laia" had huge cinnamon buns instead of pigtails. She looks at the camera, smiles grimly and nods. That made it even funnier! You have to see "Chewabacca" played by a Muppet! It was extremely stupid and stupid ... but I could not stop laughing. Most of the dialogue was drowned out because of all the laughter. Even if you know Star Wars pretty well, it's even funnier - they're deliberately fun in some conversations. This really works with an audience! A definite 10!
