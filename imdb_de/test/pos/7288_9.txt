OK ... you have to settle down! This movie is not that bad. I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love! I have to admit that I've never been a fan of LeeLee Sobieski before, but she took me along in this movie. I think Josh Hartnett looks good, but come on .. Chris Klein is the greatest man I've ever met !!! He has made this movie better for me. Come on, girls ... if he does not have a shirt and brings water, I know your mouth has fallen. Yes, I know in the beginning that he is an idiot, but in the end he realizes how he has acted and is learning to be a great guy. If he had not come in the end ... then I would have been angry. I think a few lines did not have to be said, but all in all, it was a great movie! I would definitely recommend it!
