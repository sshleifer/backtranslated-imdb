This animated short is a remake of Tex Avery's early short for Fred Quimby on M-G-M (Dog Gone Tired). An escaped convict (just known here as Joe) who just broke out of the 'Alka Fizz Prison' tries to be a step ahead of Droopy (known here as the Sgt.McPoodle of the Mounties), but always manages to do it in a way meet or another. This is undoubtedly one of the most divisive, funny shorts rolling out of the M-G-M animation studio. It manages to get the most out of the shocked reactions that Joe has when he encounters McPoodle (including some equally disturbed sound effects - ie car horns, screaming, elephants, etc.) Like any Avery MGM is, with a short, raging to anticipate kinetic tempo (along with some surreal gags - ie Joe, who tries to run away from McPoodle and actually walk off the side of the movie). Put this in your DVD player and laugh silly.
