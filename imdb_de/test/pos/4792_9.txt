Nazarin, a black comic book story of a run-down priest, shows the economy that Luis Bunuel was able to achieve by telling a deeply humanistic fable with little effort. As a result of his Mexican film career, it was an invaluable talent with little money and extremely tight schedules. However, Nazarin surpasses many of Bunuel's earlier Mexican films in terms of acting (Francisco Rabal is excellent), the narrative and the theme. Interestingly, the theme is something that was re-themed in Viridiana three years later in Spain. It is about the struggle of the individual for humanity and altruism in a society that rejects any idea of ​​virtue. However, Father Nazarin is portrayed more sympathetically than Sister Viridiana. While the latter seems to choose charity because she wants to atone for her (perceived) sins, the whole existence of Nazarin seems to be the reason for helping others, whether they (or we) like it or not. The final scenes of the film, in which he casts doubt on his behavior and must split in a split second between the life he has led and the conventional life expected of a priest, are so emotional because they are his moral integrity and we are never quite sure if it stays intact or not. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable movie, and I would encourage anyone interested in classical cinema to find out. It is one of Bunuel's most moving films and sums up many of his obsessions: frustrated longing, crazy love, religious hypocrisy, etc. In my eyes, Nazarin is only behind "The Exterminating Angel" in terms of his Mexican films and is certainly at the top of the list List of the entire filmic production of Bunuel.
