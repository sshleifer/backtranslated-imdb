Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, Addams Family Values) wrote this frothy story of a reckless schoolteacher (Kevin Kline), who is being advertised by a former student actor (Matt Dillon) at the Academy Awards. The remainder of the film deals with the absurdities that surround this set-up - the impact on the city, its fiancée (Joan Cusack), itself - and its climaxes with a loved one everyman finale. <br /> <br /> If you are an angry homosexual rights activist or a naïve teenager looking for an accurate account of a man's struggle or a "true" representation of gay life. Then save yourself the trouble and rent something else (maybe Beautiful Thing) or read a book book (Giovanni's room). If you can understand that this film was inspired by the piety of Tom Hanks 'speech about the Academy Awards when he won for Philadelphia and makes fun of Hollywood culture and small town ignorance, then you have a penchant for the' 30s Screwball Comedy (Bringing Up.) Baby, Holiday, The Palm Beach Story) Then Enjoy! Far from being a snappy satire, the film tries to surpass the fullness of a Preston Sturges farce. No, it is not "deep" or "powerful" - Romy & Michelle (9 to 5) or Young Frankenstein - and that does not pretend; it holds his tongue tight in the cheek. It gets too preachy and maudlin towards his own best towards the end and sure that some of the jokes are a little bit stale (there's also a locker scene that could have been cut), but after she's scanned countless comedies with this misfire, it's like a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck are a wonderful match, while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley offer good support. The excellent Joan Cusack award-winning performance is outstanding, and the great Bob Newhart is Bob Newhart. <br /> <br /> The fact that many have been insulted by In & Out is as absurd as the mentality of the city dwellers they enjoy. Personally, I was more offended by Philadelphia. I'll always take harmless fluff over holiness.
