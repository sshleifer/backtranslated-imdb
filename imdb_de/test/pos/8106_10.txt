Before I saw this movie, I did not really expect much, although my friend recommended it differently. Because of this request of my friend, I decided to really watch this movie. The moment I sat down to watch the movie, I was absolutely overwhelmed. From the credits, I fell from my place; I just could not contain myself. The film is about Hitler in all the splendor of comedy. Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish barber who has returned from the war. Through the exploits of the barber, he manages to save one of the Germans, and thus he gets a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the fight of the Jews. But it went awry and pride was arrested, but only to flee to the borders of the Jewish suburb "The Ghetto". Because of this escape, the German army began to search, which meant that Barber and Pride were arrested, but they fled again, but were mistaken for Hynkel and put up with his whip. ***** THE LANGUAGE THAT MAKES CHAPLIN AT THE END IS FANTASTIC, IT FULFILLS THE MORALS WHICH DREAMS THE SOCIETY ONLY DREAM. IN LANGUAGE IT LEVES THE WHOLE IMPORTANCE OF THE FILM, BECAUSE THE TREATMENT IT CREATES AND IT FINALLY WORKS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THOSE PRESENT AS THE WAR.
