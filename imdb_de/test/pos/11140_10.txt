I'm impressed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her great ability as an action star! This movie is powered by her wonderful acting and great action ability. I'm a fan of science fiction, but I have to say that this movie surpasses most sci-fi movies in its cinematography, and most often uses an actress whose presence makes the plot superfluous. Although it looks like this movie was made for television, I believe it is better than most theatrically released films of its kind.
