I remember that BBC1 has shown this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video several years ago and watched it again. The movie was slow and a bit strange (the miners look very strange) the atmosphere was incredibly effective. It's one of my favorite Slasher movies, and I have no idea where to find an uncut version. Currently deleted everywhere (except in the US, where a horror compilation was created by mistake!). It's a shame you can not get this movie because it should be seen. Wrong Turn (the recently produced by Stan Winston movie) owes Just Before Dawn a lot. One of the better 80s Slasher movies and deserves to be seen by a larger audience.
