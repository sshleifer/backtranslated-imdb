Over the past 30 years, there have been many attempts (well, certainly more than a few) to create a film that has an "otherworldly" performance. Assuming this is a movie director's desire to distance himself from other films, or simply gloss over the cheap and shabby look, begging is at the top of the pack. <br /> <br /> Apart from the incomparable "Eraserhead" anyway. <br /> <br /> The painstaking process of artificially degrading his film completely alters its structure (imagine what this film would have looked like in quiet, standard technicolor) an artifact from another, unknown culture. Some images are so far removed from what we see on the screen, they are mostly annoying when they are moved. This is not a "Last House On The Left" disorder, more like leaving the first cave and seeing the sun. <br /> <br /> Watch this Fever dream if you get the chance and enjoy it. Remember that they produce different standard films every day. You can wait.
