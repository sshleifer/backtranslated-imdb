As far as the Christian movie is concerned, that is typical. If you miss a mega-budget, you try to do your best. Sometimes times are running out, sometimes the goal hits. This almost met, great spectacle can carry so far only a film. A combination of H.P. Lovecraft, and Frank Peretti was a good idea. All it took was a better backstory and better character development to make a great movie. The visuals are not so bad as warding off the demons until the last few minutes keep up the tension at a good pace. Could use a better end. Not a bad premise that terrorist experiments go wrong. Much better than a typical Hollywood treatment of the demonic empire. Maybe somebody will finally do "this present darkness" as a movie.
