I was looking at it originally because I thought it would be the sequel to the League of EXTRAORDINARY Gentlemen, and this movie is something completely different here - a comedy! I loved it anyway! <br /> <br /> The League of Gentlemen seems to be a British TV series with some weird characters and some humor. This is a British comedy, so it's about being very stupid, dressing up in costumes and making fun of German and French homosexual references - in short, it's very funny! <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the writer of the television program decided to break off some of the characters and the characters who came from their dimension into the dimension of the author to prevent this. It's a fun twist and there are many great scenes in this idiotic adventure. I laughed out loud many times and applauded the brazen style of humor. This makes Mr Bean look like the diluted pennant he is. (Rowan is much better in the Black Adder series) <br /> <br /> This is not Monty Python, but you can never shirk the comparison if you speak British humor, and there are a few similarities, but not so many that it's his thing and stays fresh. It tends more to the boys and Guest House Paradiso in its "weird style". If you like this, check out the series The Young Ones and the Guest House Paradiso movie, and of course I accept the TV series League of Gentlemen also has to be pretty funny.
