Nostalgia is not always the best reason to watch a movie. Most of the time the movies that you loved as a kid will disappoint you as an adult. While there are exceptions to this rule, it is difficult to justify having a DVD by Krull, regardless of how many insightful comments the director may contain. But stay tuned to Gen X / Y'ers, for the dozens of disappointments that characterize your journey back in time can prevent you from stumbling upon something worth revisiting. <br /> <br /> A surprise movie that's worth a look is Joel Schumacher's Flatliners, the supernatural thriller starring 80s popcorn heavyweights Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin. You'd think a stew from this cast, the extravagant flair of Schumacher, and the overly-eyed cameraman Jan De Bont would lead to some foul-smelling results, but apart from the calories ... flatliners are not half as bad. Although the production design is inexplicably exaggerated and the photograph painstakingly overstyled (filled with neon-drenched streets rinsing endless swathes of steam), Flatliners still manages to be an extremely dark and captivating thriller. If there's an explanation for why Flatliners was forgotten, it could be because in 1990 another, far superior, supernatural thriller was released: Jacob's Ladder. If Flatliners had released Jacob's Ladder a year or two later, that's the case. Probably Schumacher's flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a weakened, commercialized rip-off of Adrian Lyne's nightmarish masterpiece. When these films were released in the same year, flatliners had a different fate and tripled JL's at the box office, though they were a watered-down version of a similar premise. Timing was not so friendly to Flatliners as it was lost on a dated pile of Brat Pack dirt of the 80s, while JL has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic. Aside from fate, JL is seamlessly frightening and manages to guess the audience until the last frame, while Flatliner's victims become oversimplifications and Hollywood comforts that bring the final act into predictable order. Comparisons between the two films are unfair and eventually overlook Flatliners' ability to portray the 80s in their best form. Flatliners were released at the end of a decade of shallow excess and are always dated by their hairstyles and clothing styles, but in fairness the film should also be remembered as a well-executed movie at (or at least near) its particular pile of filth for purposes and Purposes make it a fun walk into the past.
