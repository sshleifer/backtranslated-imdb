Cheezy Yes. Badly filmed? You can bet on it. Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Brillant anyway (or therefore)? For sure. <br /> <br /> This film celebrates (and ridicules) everything that was so classic in the horror genre of the '80s: Characters with absolutely no depth, who fit into a stereotypical role, never take them away for a moment , Teenagers who try to survive a murder with a mysterious force that has disturbed them by something lame adolescent; completely unfounded nudity; impossible amounts of blood escaping from victims; slow-moving zombies; great one-liners ... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket! <br /> <br /> This is not a parody like Scary Movie, but rather a tribute film to the lost innocence of 80s horror movies ... when it is frightened and exhausted, it could also be fun, stupid, sexy and silly good time!
