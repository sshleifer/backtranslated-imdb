This was a great show ... I do not remember much, but remember to have seen and loved her. I remember the mother and the father. I really like the grandmother. She was like a grandmother you really could not appreciate until you grew up. She was very knowledgeable and no nonsense. My favorite song on the show was Sardines in the Morning. (this may not be the title) I remember seeing this show and hearing that song when I went to Cleveland Ohio to visit my cousins, and my sister and I sang that song so much that we all left my little cousins ​​singing it too. I would also like to find it on DVD.
