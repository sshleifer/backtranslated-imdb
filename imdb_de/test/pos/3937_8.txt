I never understood what a fantastic dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and beautiful. What a pleasure to see her dancing with George Murphy. The story was typical of the day, but the dancing was really special. I do not get tired of seeing Fred and Ginger, but Lana Turner in this movie was just as great. I always thought of Lana as such an acting actress, who acted rather too much. She should have been dancing more and less playing the roles of Maddam X and Peyton Place. I had a new appreciation for her after watching this movie and her wonderful dance. Too bad that the "Academy" does not give an "Oscar" to dance.
