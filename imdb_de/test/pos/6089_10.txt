TEP is like a long, cool water drink after slipping through the Sahara to classic movie fans who have been robbed of cinematic magic for too long! It is not only beautifully photographed, but also the figures are perfectly represented. If you want to see the movie as a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed. Instead, it's an excellent "companion" to the book, and I think that's what Anthony Minghella was up to. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world. not to mention a brilliant actor. Juliette Binoche is the figurehead for vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm. And of course, I'll see every movie that shows Kristin Scott Thomas. She just has to be the best actress since Deborah Kerr. So much has been promised with this film and so much is being delivered!
