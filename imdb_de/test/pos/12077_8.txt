I was still living with my parents when they sent this on Dutch television. Usually I was the one who watched movies and the other one did not care. But somehow we all sat down and watched this movie. This movie was aired on Wednesday night. It is the story of a woman who will die soon. But before she dies, she wants to make sure that her (many) children have the best possible foster parents. So we looked at it and my dad (the most emotional of us four) started to cry. I followed almost immediately and soon my sister and mother were torn as well. We were completely moved by this simple but heartbreaking story. If you want a good cry, this is the one for you!
