"Cooley High" is one of my favorite movies ever !!! I think I saw this movie years ago on late-night TV with my mom when I was little and I thought it was so funny. This movie was also called "black American graffiti". Glynn Turman is wonderful as a preacher and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs is great as Preach's friend Cochise. There are also some other great characters, and there's a lot of humor in this movie. From the beginning of the film, where Cochise goes home to Preach to prepare for school, to the sad end of Cochise's funeral, this movie will make you laugh. There are many scenes in this movie that I like very much. The scene in which Pooter (another friend of Preach and Cochise) goes with them to the zoo and throws the gorilla on his shirt (very disgusting, but also funny), the first scene in the street corner cafeteria, the quarter party in this Girl house, which has been catastrophic through a fight, and some others are wonderful to look at. This movie even has a wonderful accompaniment soundtrack album that includes many wonderful motown hits and artists from the early '60s (only 6 songs on the soundtrack were made in '75 while the rest came from the' 60s). The film is mainly about two friends who dream of freeing themselves from their impoverished and harsh neighborhood after graduation, but their future seems almost unreachable to Peach's relationship because of their innocent joy in a stolen car for which two other hoods were responsible to his girlfriend Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis) is almost in danger. Go out and lend or buy this movie and be ready for a lot of weird entertainment !!! Get the soundtrack too. It's also a lot of fun !!!
