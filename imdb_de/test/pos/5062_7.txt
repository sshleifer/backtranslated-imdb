I came out of Rendition with a list of errors for a mile. How is it that my overall impression is a pretty decent movie? It's definitely a movie whose sum is better than its parts. <br /> <br /> These parts contain a cast of stars of great name, none of which will bring any memorable performance (Omar Metwally, a relatively unknown person, is the one who is you will remember); functional, if undefined, direction; and a script that is too complicated and too simple at the same time. Metwally is an Egyptian-born American citizen abducted by the US government's rendition program, also known as the process by which America tortures suspected terrorists to disclose information about whether it is remotely true or not. Reese Witherspoon plays his pregnant wife, who talks to an old college friend (Peter Saarsgard) who works for a senator (Alan Arkin) and helps find her husband. Meryl Streep takes over the management of the replay program. Jake Gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way. Meanwhile, a whole parallel plot follows the daughter of an Egyptian top official allied with the American rendition program, and her boyfriend who is just training to become a suicide bomber. Ay-yi-yi that's a lot of conspiracy to get into a two-hour movie, and I just wanted to wash my whole hands, especially the Egyptian Romeo and Juliet, which felt like a distraction. Near the movie's finale, a turn of the chronology brings together all the storylines so that you want to reevaluate everything you knew about the motives of the different characters and make "Rendition" a much more interesting movie then it seems. <br /> <br /> Witherspoon, Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard all look like students playing adults that are twenty years older than they are - especially Gyllenhaal, usually a good actor, looks so bored that you wonder whether he will muster the energy to deliver his lines. And the scriptwriter was to be arrested because he had such a good actress as Meryl Streep and nothing else but this one-dimensional dragon lady. The film, of course, seeks relevance, but instead of focusing on the confusing network of arguments surrounding the national security issue, it is forcibly charged in the midst of the debate. There are times when you think the movie may be distracting in an interesting direction - what if Witherspoon actually began to question her husband's past? What if Metwally had actually had contact with terrorists, as his respondents accuse? But no, the movie takes the path of least resistance. <br /> <br /> But like I said, I recommend this movie. I know I've just listed a bunch of bugs, but he has his head in the right place and is entertaining or at least as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation. <br /> <br /> Note: B +
