I recently posted to IMDb on this series and provided a mailing address to the BBD's commercial branch to write to complain about. I wrote to this address, mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity prominently. I just got the following answer: <br /> <br /> From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006, 13:44:00 PM MDT To: kk2840@earthlink.net <br / > <Dear Kate, I work for the BBFC, the British counterpart to the MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as films in this country. In any case, I am currently in the process of issuing a certificate for the 1980 miniseries "Oppenheimer". While researching the work on the IMDb, I noticed your post and thought you might want to know that the work is about to be published (therefore a certificate is required). <br /> <br /> I do not know which company sells it, but keep your eyes open! <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> Emily +++++++++++++++++ <br /> <br /> hooray! <br /> <br /> I would also like to contact Netflix to buy this product. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew <br /> <br /> kk2840@earthlink.net I recently sent an email to the BBC asking if the Oppenheimer series was ever released on video or DVD. I could not find it. I have received the following answer. When writing the BBC, be sure to mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the US. You can also enter "Oppenheimer (1980)" on amazon.com. There you'll find a checkbox where you can request the owner's approval (BBC) and receive a notification when it's released. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Here is the BBC response: <br /> <br /> Dear Kate <br /> <br /> Thank you very much for your e-mail regarding 'Oppenheimer'. <br /> <br /> I was interested to read that you want a copy of this program that you liked. I have reviewed the BBC shop and the online retailers and can not find any documentation that it is available. Currently we are not aware of publishing this program on DVD. However, if you would like to make a suggestion, I would suggest that you write to the BBC's Commercial Branch: <br /> <br /> Representative BBC Worldwide Ltd Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT <br /> <br / > May I thank you again for taking the time to contact the BBC. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Elaine Hunter BBC Information ______________________________________ <br /> <br /> - ---- Original Message ----- <br /> <br /> {Comments:} Me try to find a copy of the terrific BBC production "Oppenheimer", a six-part series written in 1980 by Sam Waterston by Sam Waterston, a book / script by Peter Prince.
