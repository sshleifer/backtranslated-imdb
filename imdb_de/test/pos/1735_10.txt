The year 2005 will go down in the Dr.Who story as the most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; A first-rate new doctor and companion, a large audience (10 million for the first episode and the Christmas special), major awards, critical acclaim, and those idiots who for years were accustomed to the Daleks' apparent inability to negotiate stairs were really silenced brought. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bomb and left after only one series. It looked like the honeymoon was over. Fortunately, the public seems to have adopted its successor, the excellent David Tennant. In addition, the show features fine S.F.X., such as the spacecraft that crashed into 'Big Ben' in 'Aliens Of London', and great stories like 'Tooth & Claw', 'Army Of Ghosts / Doomsday'. The new "Dr.Who" is essentially the same as the old one and has only been updated for the 21st century. Some fans have accused Russell T.Davies of "ruining" the show. You must remember that for 16 years there was no show until he came.
