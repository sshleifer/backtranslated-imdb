I saw this movie for the first time this evening (November 5, 2005). I wanted to see it because I saw the basketball diaries (Leonardo Di Caprio), and I loved that, but that was a lot harder. I think that to a certain extent there was a good representation of drugs. I usually agree with Nick Stahl's character, probably because if I had someone I was crazy for, I wanted to work with that stuff, I'd want to help them deal with it. A promising student and athlete who spends all his time training and studying. Well, it's understandable that he wants to try teenage life (the crazy side of it). In his efforts, he begins to help his friend he is addicted to because he becomes addicted to see what this is about and because of his terrible family situation that leads to his most tragic death. A really sad movie, but one mistake I found is that you do not get enough insight into the damage it does to families, but apart from that, it's great performances in a really heartbreaking movie.
