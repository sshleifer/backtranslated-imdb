Director and co-author Alejandro Amenabar did not make it easy for viewers to make his taut, somewhat overlong but very disturbing story, based precisely on a Spanish man's fight for assisted suicide. "Mar Adentro" ("The sea from the inside") is thrilling and its effects far exceed the time in the theater. <br /> <br /> With the award-winning Canadian movie "The Barbarian Invasions", people came to see a family, along with a group of dedicated friends, bring the desire of a beloved, though irresistible, man to an end puts. In this film, the focus of attention suffered from progressive, incurable cancer and his descent to a terminal stage was rapid. As emotional as the scenes were, death was inevitable - the question was how gentle it could be made by soliciting intervention. Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly played by Javier Bardem) is another story. For more than two decades he was a quadriplegic because of a diving accident. (Very keen onlookers can find a horrible irony of why he ended up in that state because of his careless dive.) As a world traveler and lover of beautiful women, he now lies in a immovable body that fulfills all his needs of a truly devoted family, willing to do a lot from their privacy and giving up time to maintain their beloved relationship. Rosa (Lola Duenas), a single mother of two little boys, enters Sampedro's household out of what might have been Curiosity to find out about the plight of the paralyzed man, however, becomes an emotionally supportive centerpiece for Ramon and at the same time an amusing but occasionally aggravating presence. A nice performance by Duenas. <br /> <br /> The problem is, of course, that Sampedro is not ill in the normal sense. He could live decades with the right care. His softly but persistently expressed desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives that does not surprisingly respond from various ethical and religious points of view. Ramon is the figurehead of a group dedicated to amending Spanish laws on assisted suicide. "Death with dignity" is her buzzword. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who seeks the help of Pro Bono Publico Counsel Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health problems that have an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. Happily married to a loyal spouse, she emotionally connects with her client. <br /> <br /> What follows is an extremely sensitive interplay of values ​​and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and his wife, their tech-savvy teenage son, not with the intellectual Ramon, and his old father, who can not stop grieving over his son's catastrophic descent into absolute helplessness. The moral and the legal The themes are played by excellent acting and short vignettes, including a court scene in which formalism triumphs over any legal interpretation that could consider Ramon's feelings and views. It may be Spain, but the problems are alive in most countries, including the United States. Especially amusing is a scream from the first floor to the bedroom, a debate between Ramon with a drop-in, a lecture by the Jesuit priest, also a four-legged friend whose hidden dogma casually conceals the absence of a soul. <br /> <br /> Special tribute to Mabel Rivera, Ramon's sister-in-law Manuela, for a recklessly authentic depiction of a strong woman who holds the family together. And the same compliment goes to Belen Rueda, Julia, who differs from an objective advocate to a close friend to a woman who gets into a dark fate. The director does not set value judgments that give each character the full range of his or her emotions effectively and sometimes moving. Like "Dead Man Walking," this film can support any view of its deadly theme. <br /> <br /> Nobody can stop someone from suicide if he / she is determined, but the universal tragedy of the Ramons of the world is Without help, life is in a body where only the heart beats and only the head can move, a sentence that no court can pronounce the most degenerate criminals. The cinematography is well adapted to the film The story and the beautiful Galician scenes are an intentional contrast to the limited views that Ramon once experienced in his special bed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
