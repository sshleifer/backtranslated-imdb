I loved the movie "Eddie Monroe". The film had all the components that interested me in watching. Above all, I loved the twists of action and the surprising ending. Craig Morris has Brad Pitt's potential in both looks and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newmans. Fred Carpenter has taken this movie to a new level. I was thrilled with the cast. The music score, the cinematography, the talent, the locations and the script were fantastic. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and talented director. He gives his work 200%. The movie has a great texture. I hope there will be an Eddie Monroe 2. I would like to see how Nicolette turns out to be on her bill. Eddie Monroe by Fred Carpenter is Hollywood-style.
