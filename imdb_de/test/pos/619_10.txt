If you want to see a real thriller, rent this !!! It's not from the director or scriptwriter of "Scream," has no over-current, overpaid "TV" actors who broadcast as "stars," and is not a run of the special effects bonanza. Instead, you get a first-rate, nervous, very strong (violent) and yet exciting nail-biter.
