This is a true gem of the stupid sci-fi! Peter Cushing gives this Midnite movie classic a great personality. <br /> <br /> I really like the sound design. The weird, choppy voices of creatures and rhinoceros creatures create a bizarre backdrop (of course, even the lightly clad baby does not hurt!). <br /> <br />
