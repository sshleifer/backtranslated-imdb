Earth Final Conflict started like a new world, a new vision of the creator of Star Trek, something new and unique, full of great elements. A very good cast with a very credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone. A former police officer begins to work as a guardian of an ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons) after his wife died under unusual circumstances. But soon the character of Kilner joins a group whose job it is to find out what the true intentions of the aliens are, why they seem so kind and caring for humanity. Soon, this resistance group begins to discover the sinister plans of the claws humans use in their own problems to survive their destruction. As I said, the show started great, everything was almost perfect, including characters like Da'an. The original Da'an was a big mystery because it seems to be a nice creature, but at the same time it has its own evil plans manipulating some people on Earth. Soon Zo'or came, who was not bad, but ... marks the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first great enemy of humans, the incarnation of evil and the killing, which could be something bigger in Da'an , The first season ends in a great way with the dead of Boone and the second shows a new main character (Liam), a hybrid of humans and Kimera (another alien race) with some very interesting powers. He replaces the character of Kilner in a good way, so that it is improved by other actions, including the conflict with the Jaridians and the Atavus. But as I said before the wickedness of Zo'or gains in importance, the new conflicts are less realistic than the same talons. Over time, Liam's entire great history of alien roots has been almost completely wiped out with other things from previous seasons. When the final season began, the original Earth Final conflict was just an almost forgotten dream. All the magic was missing, just to have some vain intentions to keep the show alive, including the return of Kilner and Liam for a few episodes. The last episode was just proof of how bad the show was with so many bad changes (to think that the authors of some episodes knew nothing about the first stories), it was one of the worst endings I've ever had in a movie have watched TV broadcast. A real shame, because Earth Final Conflict started out as something unique, fresh, the stories the performers watched after so many shows from the US, something from Canada from the head of the creator of Star Trek was wonderful, but in the end everything changed , I hope that someday somebody does a remake of this show, of course nothing from the fourth and fifth season (except the cast were all perfect in his work). I can still dream in better things.
