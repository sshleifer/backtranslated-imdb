As a Frenchman, I found it very enjoyable to be able to laugh at the old stereotype that is made up of such French, some foreigners from the West, spy movies, etc., and many other things ... I've seen it three times and every time I discovered something new and laughed to tears ... Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, Aure Atika, the director and all the cast, the whole crew did a fantastic job. This movie is funny, but it is much more than that: it has many levels. They laugh for simple jokes, critics joked about (the movie is brave enough to be critical), for physical comedy, because you believe in the characters, etc. Aesthetically and musically it's also a success , Take a look at it, if you can.
