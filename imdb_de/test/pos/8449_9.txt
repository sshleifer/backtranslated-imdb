Great movie from the late 70s. Says a lot about corruption in the business at the expense of the ordinary person, so that the powerful can make big profits and ignore the environment and safety of others. Nearly 30 years later, this movie is convincing of the power of certain companies that have increased their control capability tenfold since the release of the films; It shows the need to regulate the public against powerful business interests whose primary goal is profit. Jack Lemmon is brilliant - Jane Fonda and Micheal Douglas are equally convincing in their roles. The frivolous 70s were a damn lot, this movie will take over the decade. <br /> <br /> A movie that gets better after every watching.
