Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any movie maker should consider. Sure, you could spend a lot of time checking the classics from Hitchcock to Scorsese. But let us follow the modern generation and study half-heartedly. <br /> <br /> Where to start, you might just consider the movie as a story, maybe even a docudrama focused on the late 1970s porn industry - and what an industry that was! The other half could focus on the incredible detail that a brilliant filmmaker can achieve through the use of polyester and * Ahem * rubber. But honestly, Boogie Nights brings the pure, non-bul! Shi $ in your face, which I have not experienced since the movie greats of the 70s ... ironically ... or a stroke of genius. The story is full of highly detailed characters, from which you can either tell, love or hate everything. But the effects are clear - you feel something for them. Among the characters are the two appearances: Burt Reynolds as director Jack Horner and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is as brilliant as Heather Graham ... but if I focus on an actor, it would have to be John C. Reilly. John's performance is a perfect balance of comic timing and emotion driven by the characters. I'm a fan of the line "Have you ever seen the movie Star Wars? ... People say I look like Han Solo." Anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the cameraman and the director / writer / producer have developed a vivid color and eye-catching style comparable to Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick (in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with its own unique look and with the longest single shot I've ever seen, pushing the edge ... that's the party sequence of the New Year. The music, as in any great movie, is a character of its own. Sometimes it consumes sadness or sadness ... but mostly it's all about fun, dancing and having fun. the spirit of the 70s. OK, back to the performances. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of "film" means to his genre. The terrible transition from shooting to recording on magnetic tape. The loss of his art, so to speak ... and the mentality changes of the people he works with. Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocence and sexual prowess to the character. For those who have seen Burton's Planet of the Apes, pay no attention to Wahlberg's performance in this film. Rent Boogie Nights and see what a difference a good script can make! Julianne Moore plays the would-be mother for all, and with it comes the torment and torment she experiences when life imitates art; and she loses all who are close to her. Heather Graham is a feast for the eyes, but later keeps herself and steals even some scenes from the great Mr. Reynolds. Each character is multi-dimensional, full of life and performed by actors who appear to be the perfect picture. The film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting and offers an uncompromising look into the Turblulant lifestyle of the '70s. It makes no apologies and tells no lies; and offers the audience a journey back. But more importantly, the film gives us a great example of how movies should be made. and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in the film.
