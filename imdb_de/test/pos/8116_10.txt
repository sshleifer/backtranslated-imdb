I have never seen such a movie. I did not intend to see it, but it paid off the TV station. I'm mostly a scifi movie watcher, but I'd be happy to add it to my collection. It starts off as a one-sided movie with a simple love triangle, then it changed a bit (I can not talk about it anymore, but there are two men and one girl involved.) In this movie, Hugo Weaving from "MATRIX" and "THE LORD OF THE RINGS "in a role I did not expect ... a very funny guy, this movie is on HERE TV, but if you do not have a satellite, it's worth the rent, so give it a try and you will not be disappointed his.
