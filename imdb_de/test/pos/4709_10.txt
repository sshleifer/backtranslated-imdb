This undoubtedly proves that Patricia Arquette is what she's promoted for: an actress! This is undoubtedly her finest moment of acting and she undoubtedly deserves recognition for her work. Never in her other films, with the possible exception of the Sacred Marriage, was she absolutely credible and authentic. Plot: A young woman is in Southeast Asia and is suddenly plunged into the political chaos of the landscape. She is witness to mass murder and totalitarianism and flees. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you MUST see, or you have not seen all of Hollywood's most beautiful. I rank 58th in the top 100 films. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Bob
