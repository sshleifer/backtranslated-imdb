I really enjoyed this movie. I've probably seen it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old Navy guy, I was still excited by the rousing rendition of Anchor's Away! I also love the "McHales Navy" pirate atmosphere. I could have done without the diving officer, but I think it's old-fashioned. She was still good looking, especially after the crew did their laundry. The cook, the son and the electrician made the film. Loved the salty old engineer and his first class PO. And indeed, Grammer has done a very commendable job being an inappropriate officer. I loved the "driving scene" as they passed the course on the way to the harbor, lol. Pure Navy! And I swear, I had an XO that was just like this little weasel ... I'm so glad it's on DVD, over damn time. : 0)
