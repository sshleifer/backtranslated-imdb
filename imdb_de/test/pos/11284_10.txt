A warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: The nature of the images and the effects are such that this is one of the types of films that should really be seen on a projected film. The pixelation generated by digital transmissions absorbs a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to the already abstract and grainy film. However, since this film is not available in any format, you must get along with what you can. Anyway, this outstanding artistic endeavor comes from the man who would eventually do it Give us the shadow of the vampire. It's a dark and dirty movie about the genesis of the elements (as far as I can tell from the character names) through a terrible and surreal process. A very good example of what is called "unloved art," a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the gut more than the thematic, is natives. <br /> <br /> And Visceral describes it. Technically not much happens in the movie, but the emotions you get through are countless. The repeatability of some images creates a fascinating impression of the senses. Above all, the soundtrack and the film music are immaculate and serve the visual language incredibly well. Fans of this film should watch the short film collections published on Other Cinema DVD, Experiments in Terror I, II and III. Movies like these make me more and more sure that the realm of true horror lies in the abstract, inappropriate, and non-narrative, rather than in gruesome stories of ghosts and ax murderers. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
