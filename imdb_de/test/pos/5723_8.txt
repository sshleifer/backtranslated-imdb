Silent films have always fascinated me. There is something to see actors and actresses 100 years ago. Disturbed by today's high-tech special effects, I always try to imagine what it was like to watch a particular movie at the time of its original release. It helps to appreciate the cruelty of early cinema. <br /> <br /> "The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ" is a very charming production of Pathe, originally filmed in 1902 but expanded in 1905 and finally published. Imagine, a series of famous religious paintings separated by title cards, and you'll have a pretty good idea of ​​what this movie looks like. For example, the scene in which Mary and Joseph rest on their flight to Egypt is almost identical to the 1879 painting of Luc Olivier Merson's "Rest on the Flight to Egypt" to Mary sitting on the famous Sphinx , While some of these "living paintings" could be thought of as unimaginative, I found them very charming and very nostalgic. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes seem straight out of a stage production of the life of Christ possibly elaborated and elaborated Passion Play of the day. The make-up of the cast is very theatrical, so a close-up of Jesus is almost funny. Where others could be disturbed by their wisdom, I was pretty enchanted. <br /> <br /> After shooting for over 3 years, continuity is not so bad. The biggest flaws are the casting changes made during that time. The characters of John the Apostle and the 12 year old Jesus are changing in the scene, much to the surprise of the audience! <br /> <br /> The best unintentional humor of the film can be seen in the Birth of Jesus scene. The baby literally magically appears in the manger between Mary and Joseph. Maybe it was just my attitude at the time when I saw it, but I laughed out loud! If only the birth of a child would be so easy !!!! To top it off, the actress who plays Mary looks bored through the entire scene (actually through the entire movie) as if this happens every day! My, how times have changed! <br /> <br /> As simple as this movie is, it really is a wonderful window into the past compared to today. I recommend it! <br /> <br />
