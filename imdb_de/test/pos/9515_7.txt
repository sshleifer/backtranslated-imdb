Another "end of the world" movie that calls for a comparison with the abysmal "Day After Tomorrow". Following the same structure as DAT but with a distinctively Japanese style. How are you? That depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I found that the little human touches are what fascinates this movie for most of its 2+ hours. Also, the frequent title cards explain some of the science. The effects are probably the best I've seen in a Japanese movie, and they compare very well to Hollywood. Many of the catastrophic scenes are truly dreadful, even though the human carnage is usually off the screen. And that is one of the disadvantages. While the horrors of thousands of deaths on screen, as in the recent War of the Worlds, could be too overwhelming, we do not really feel that the chaos of a whole nation is breaking in the sea. Some scenes speak of The Chaos, but for the most part this part of the story is hardly touched. Nevertheless, this film works on many levels and is much more realistic than DAT, that is, to the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately The story depends on a clich√© device and another plot that would be at home in the 60s of the Japanese earth movie "Gorath". After the pretty good and mostly realistic attitude of the disaster this makes a disappointment The sudden stopping of the film for a Pop-Love song does not help either (unless you like the song). This made the "exciting" ending a bit inhibitive for me. <br /> <br /> All in all the direction is good and the art design is excellent, the acting is also good, recommended.
