During the filming of this film, I once made a statement on TV. Something like: "Is Killinggänget now deducted from National Socialism?" <br /> <br /> My understanding of this film was from the beginning to get an idea of ​​Nazism. When I recently saw this movie in the TV version, I had this filter in front of me and it was not hard to see. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, I have not known this way of interpreting the film since I first heard it. <br /> <br /> These are the things I found in "Four shades of brown". In all four stories, lack of empathy leads to catastrophe: <br /> <br /> 1. The cremator does not show any real compassion for the dead animals or those who had to say goodbye to them. In the crematorium dealing with death and fire it is almost a cheerful game for him. The seriousness of death and fire is not adequately underlined by the father and his boy, pushing in ignorance a button that leads to the catastrophe that severely injured his father. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: The importance of showing the boy appropriate emotions. When they grow up, they need to know which behavior leads to disaster and which emotions lead to good. 2. The magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer. Just when she thinks she has cut the strings of Master's hand and is looking for personality, integrity and joy, he pulls hard and she is back in despair and despair. Her son has been trying to riot his own life with perfection and "good" taste, as opposed to his "bad" taste. The real problem he carries is anything but understandable to him: his father's behavior continues when he suffocates his own wife in his immaculate surroundings. Possible Lesson: Suppression creates bondage. <br /> <br /> 3. The father, who was abused as a child, gives his children the sadism if he cheats on their heritage. He deprives her of her childhood and in the end even of her heritage. <br /> <br /> Possible Lesson: If no love is given, one can not give one. <br /> <br /> 4.The fathers abusive daughter creates in her a ruthless avenger with sadistic aggression. Here the icy Nazi sadism in physical violence becomes very clear. There is a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation for the behavior of young "head-nose" Nazis when others are oppressed. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson? : Can National Socialism be born in a perverted house? <br /> <br /> Can the disgraceful consequence of ignoring empathy in family life be in the long run to give room to sadistic Nazism? <br /> <br /> Very rarely does a movie contain so much. It gradually reveals itself as I meditate on it. I think it's brilliantly "painted" and the actors are outstanding. Especially the good-looking guy of Ulf Brunnberg, who proves to be the worst of them all.
