The only problem with Married to the Mob is that it is not funny. It dresses just like a romantic comedy, but almost everything that happens is funny. But if you can see it as a movie that has almost nothing funny happening, you have a really good time. It's also a dazzling mob movie, according to the title. Extremely iridescent. Director Jonathan Demme, however, is one of the few predominant cult directors who have fully embraced the 1980s of this decade in his work, rather than understandably acting as if they were still in their seventies. <br /> <br /> The introductory combinations unite The animations of the 1980s, the Italian-Americanism and the production foamed at the same time. From there it feels right despite the 80's. The lighting of Demme's frequent cinematographer Tak Fujimoto and the jukebox soundtrack line up with very different pop and alternative jam effects and is colorful. Demme lends itself well to colorful instant characterizations in his visual and sometimes seemingly impetuous composition of a witty mix of styles, an action that could have gone any where a smooth FBI agent, played by a very mean Matthew Modine, tries A mafia family sees a chance when a minor played by comedic Michelle Pfeiffer tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her husband with the guy is exactly what she is in Alec Baldwin performance would hope <br/> <br /> This is how it works for a while, because Demme seems to have a firm grip on the steering wheel. He knows how important it is to show us the very subjective and reliable life-at-home scenes with Pfeiffer, as well as her worries and longings as a morally conflictive mother, though her relationship with son Joey is a matter of course. Which gangster son listens to the party pooper mother, as the father's boss, played with Dean Stockwell's trademark of naturalness, and by far the scene-stealing standouts from the cast, gives him such great gifts? On the whole, however, Demme's frothy stylization is easily seen as a novel approach to a crime story. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, however, we believe that we have taken the wrong path because inevitably Modine and Pfeiffer must fall in love. This is not inherently bad and is actually tolerable here and there, but as a romantic subplot, it is not handled interestingly or well, and barely because it hops over various clich√©s that meet the initial expectations of a cheesy eighties date film, and for this audience, I think it has just the right effect. But for someone who was really interested in the story and the aesthetic approach, this is a disappointment in the state of boredom. <br /> <br /> So it's a decent movie with big missteps at certain points, but as a date movie or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the 80s, maybe in the 80s they saw a lot of date films. The entertainment value is likely to fluctuate less, aside from the deficit of real laughs. There may be a few scoffers, and that is very broad, but I would not leave the comedy gang with the high hopes I would have initially entered. Anyway, there are extra delights in bit roles of great character actors who are beginning to fade, like Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt.
