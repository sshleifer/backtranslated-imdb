One of the benefits of my job is that when things are slow, I can watch the movie in the theater downstairs (I work in a small theater with two screens) in the drawing room and still keep an eye on the concession stand. I've probably seen Italian Job 20 times and I'm still not tired. The atmosphere reminds me of Ocean's Eleven, though the acting is not so good. Mark Wahlberg is alright, Charlize Theron addresses the boys, but Seth Green is AWESOME in this movie. I thought Edward Norton did a very good job playing a Dirtbag, although many people disagree. I also liked Mos Def as an explosives expert, who is afraid of dogs. I highly recommend this movie and will always watch it whenever I can!
