This is a really funny movie that I have seen many times. Drew Barrymore is brilliant as Josie Geller and David Arquette as her brother. They are afraid of embarrassment at the thought of their return to high school because the film is a reminder of how high school really was! Her outfits are crazy and weird and bring back memories of those who dressed a little differently! The great Michael Vartan was adorable as a teacher (I wish there had been teachers when I was in high school!) And Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a movie that you can see again and again, with a fabulous soundtrack! One for all, who are in the 90s in the school to see!
