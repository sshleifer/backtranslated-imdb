It can not be denied. Sci-fi on TV is difficult. There are so many problems that the genre brings with it. Such as the need for a good budget, solid writing and decent action. Maybe the budget and the script are the departments where I believe most attempts failed. So "Surface" succeeds? Not complete, but more than most. <br /> <br /> A good science fiction show does not need a lot of CGI to work, and it does not need much money. What it takes is the ability to create a feeling of life larger than life. The feeling that there is more than what appears at first glance is something that makes me curious and ready to find out how it will end. Add the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes say "Aha!" is what makes or breaks a show like this. <br /> <br /> "Surface" had a few bugs. At first, the basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been, nor is the revealed story as exciting (or daring) as I hoped in the beginning. The TV feeling is usually very present. From the crappy CGI (which ranges from decent to horrible) to the more variable quality in the drama department. Sometimes it feels a bit too family oriented that sometimes it takes the edge and becomes almost vile. Apart from these shortcomings, it is a pleasing show. Maybe not as spectacular as some of the other sci-fi shows out there. But it manages to interest me all season, and there are also some nice cliffhangers between the shows. The end is not so appealing to me. I do not like shows that end without ending so to speak and leaving the story unresolved. This is particularly unfavorable in this case as the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it's not decided yet). <br /> <br /> HBO is the benchmark for quality television for me. Their series have the best performers, the best production values ​​and above all the solid writing. This is not HBO quality, but it's good for what it is. Good enough to want another season without a doubt.
