Pitch Black is a surprisingly good movie. I was not a fan of Vin Diesel before I saw Pitch Black, but after seeing Pitch Black my respect for Vin Diesel has risen. He did a great job playing Riddick, a man who was wanted for many murders. His character is cold and he makes many decisions that surprise me, as if Riddick got on the boat shortly before the end and saved his own ass, leaving everyone behind to die. I like this movie and how it deals with human instinct. This movie has a low budget, but this movie shows you do not need amazing special effects and a lot of money to make a good movie. I give this movie 8 out of 10;)
