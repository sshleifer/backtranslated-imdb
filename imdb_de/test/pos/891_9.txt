Designed by Dennis Spooner, "Department S" was a brilliant thriller show about a Geneva-based spin-off of Interpol created to solve mysterious secrets that the police could not handle. When a plane with no one on board lands at Heathrow, when a man roams around in a space suit in London, when the passenger of a Rolls Royce suddenly turns into a skeleton when a train enters a subway station? They contained dead commuters. They called on 'Division S' to fix things. <br /> <br /> Peter Wyngarde played "Jason King," an extravagant mystery writer whose fertile imagination helped solve many of the bizarre cases. King was enthusiastic about the public and was later honored with a spin-off show. He was supported by the American Stuart Sullivan (Joel Fabiani) and the delicious Annabelle Hurst (Rosemary Nicols). Unusually for a show from the 60s, the department was headed by a black man - "Sir Curtis Seretse" (Dennis Alaba Peters). If the show looked very similar to "The Avengers," it was hardly surprising. It shared many of the same authors and directors! The colorful titles were designed by Chambers & Partners and are worth a vote alone. Like so many I.T.C. Series, the music was composed by Edwin Astley. His theme for "Department S" must be one of the best television topics of all time. <br /> <br /> The show is likely to look a bit sexist and outdated, but do not let that discourage you Imagine a mix of "Jonathan Creek" and the "Austin Powers" movies, and you have "Department S "! <br /> <br /> Trivia Note: The episode "A Small War Of Nerves" a young Sir Anthony Hopkins in a lead role!
