Great little short film that was aired on SBS here in Aus some time ago. Get a copy if you can - probably good for a few sightseeing only, as you will remember the script - and it's the twists that make this movie so funny. Well-directed and with interesting scripts this is an example of how well short films can look on a low budget.
