Finally a worth watching gangster movie! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily was to be fatally nominated for her role as the deadly murder of Femme! <br /> <br /> This movie flies like a bird, just a fast-paced nonstop gangster Mayhem! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily is just so beautiful and bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to find Faye Dunaway still! The actors in this movie are so adapted to their roles. <br /> <br /> A really cool soundtrack accompanies the site and you will be swept away by the Spanish soul of this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is deep and poetic. <br /> <br /> This patch has a lot of substance and never rests. <br /> <br /> The gang of Spanish Fire has brought everything to the screen. Damian Chapa is a pleasure to watch and a movie star. <br /> <br /> Sit back and enjoy the ride.
