This film received less attention than "League of Owners", possibly because it has only one "star of names". While women's professional baseball was only eight years old and exists in the city's Midwest, Japanese baseball is a much larger entity in terms of both financial underwriting and popular support. That alone would make him a better movie. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Baseball" shows the facts of the life of the Japan Ball: the regiment cheering, the deference to referees, the pressure of business owners on managers, the extreme game conservatism - and no hot dog Players welcome. <br /> <br /> It also touches on the isolation in which every Gai-jin - especially an American jock, not the most foreignized people - feels at home in Dai Nippon. And the Japanese do not feel well about foreigners and show it in various ways ("The Gai-Jin attack zone," complains an American player, "bigger than a Buick."). <br /> <br /> The script may not have won any prizes and is back on the theme of "redemption through improved play," but I found it much more enjoyable to see it than the Pokey "League." Definitely recommended for those who want to see a different perspective on this great sport.
