I can not explain it, but I find this movie not only funny, but also so enjoyable, I feel compelled to watch it over and over again, or at least when I had cable TV. I've always thought it was a really bad movie, but maybe that's because I saw it on cable. I plan to get a DVD of this movie to get a really honest look, but more importantly, just look good. I liked the plot and the idea of ​​the film and especially the cast. I always wonder if the performers enjoyed watching the movies they are in, and this is no exception. This film deserved a better fate than it had received, and Kelsey Grammar earned at least one love scene with Mrs. Holly. Who would not The characters in this movie were the types I could identify with when I was in the military and the zaniness was accurate. Beautiful walking troops.
