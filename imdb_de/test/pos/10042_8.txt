The salvation of this film is its humor. Commenting on her star's strengths, Warner Brothers cast her version of General Custer as a cocky, dashing, irreverent jester with a romantic touch and an unexpected effort of idealism; It was Robin Hood again, and Flynn blossomed in the role. All his best action images took advantage of his talent for mischief and comic timing, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> It also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland despite a previous agreement to break the partnership; The part of the strong-minded Libby Custer is a better role than the sweet love-interest types she'd gotten tired of in Flynn's later films, and after seeing the script, he'd explicitly asked De Havilland to work so that she could Meet part. In this final collaboration, she puts all her considerable acting skills into an essentially raging adventure movie and rekindles screen chemistry - for once she and Flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the original romance into an old couple, to one as well successful effect. <br /> <br /> The Flynn / de Havilland pairing and the comedy are what has given this film durability, as most of Flynn's other westerns have been held in such affection by the contemporary American public, though allegedly not by her star - are long forgotten. The action scenes are fairly sketchy (though, ironically, the death of one of the offenders' killings has died), and the villains of the play turn out to be like the schoolboy and are the same people who were terrible for Our Hero on his very first day in West Point, and therefore frustrated him throughout his career. It's limited to the cast list, but it's a trifle that's too morally cheap. <br /> <br /> However, these issues are largely irrelevant to a movie that should never be more than a rousing piece of entertainment. Supported and supported by a large group of supportive players (memorable including Anthony Quinn in a less than wordless role as Sioux leader), Errol Flynn gallops through the plot thanks to his usual arsenal: charming mischievous looks, unexpected sweetness, mischievous Sparkling, flash point armor, cheerful community and sheer high octane charisma. He is a reckless showman, but you can not help but like him. And it's hard to leave without the tune of "Garryowen" passing through your ears for many days. <br /> <br /> This is one of Flynn's long-lasting hits; It also contains a surprising amount of good acting and is a movie that deserves to be remembered.
