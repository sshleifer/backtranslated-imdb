It is now clear that the true golden age of American film was from the mid-60s until shortly before the release of Star Wars. Until then, there were too many Hays codes. Star Wars has given the green light to most films to target kids and idiots, a practice that continues today. THE SEVEN-UPS, to be honest, contains a few hackneyed lines of dialogue - "We can do that easily, or we can do it the hard way," is one - but I'm damned if I can find something wrong with it , (In fact, this line may not have been outdated when this movie was filmed.) THE SEVEN-UPS shows what was right with the best films of the Golden Age: sparing dialogue, realistic drama, real locales (winter in filthy New York never has better / worse looking), driving stories and, yes, the best chase ever filmed. Bill Hickman is the driver Scheider chases (you know him from Bullitt), and the structure of the chase is quite similar to McQueen's, but I prefer Scheider's facial intensity here, the pace, the terrific close-ups of the schoolchildren, and the shattering conclusion. (This VW Beetle, which lasts about 2 km / h, always bothers me in the hunt for Bullitt.) A strict, screeching score by Don Ellis ensures the perfect mood. THE SEVEN UPS: dark, gloomy, action-oriented, grown-up. This is a movie that could not be shot today; There is no "gimmick" for the children or the absurd end. Thank you, Philip D'Antoni, Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco: As long as movies are seen about the police, THE SEVEN-UPS and their 70s brothers (like THE FRENCH CONNECTION) will set the standard.
