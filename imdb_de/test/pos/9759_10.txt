Jean Paget, Joe Harman and Noel Strachan - all are unlikely heroes and survivors. The petite but strong Jean, whose strength and determination save lives, march hundreds of kilometers and are with calm self-discipline and persuasiveness, Joe Harman ("oh my word"), who took risks for Jean and the other prisoners, only the worst to suffer pain, and Noel Strahan, who trusted Jean regardless of adversity. Her good humor and harshness inspire everyone around her, and those who have the courage to go with her are rewarded. The beautiful landscape and the music score add to the adventure. Despite the length, I never got bored. These ordinary people have done extraordinary things and are based on a true story. Someone loaned my VHS to me several years ago, and I never saw her or her again. I have learned my lesson, friends and buy another copy if it can be found. It's a shame the miniseries are not on DVD.
