I really liked that. <br /> <br /> The camera angles are cool, it's not all like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the sound when we saw things from Kane's point of view. Have fun. Many people shouted at the screen! <br /> <br /> Kane has done a great job with his different mental feelings. He is much less one-dimensional than most horror heroes. <br /> <br /> Kane is less scary and believable than most movie psychos. I did not know how he would react to different situations. There are not many twists here, but it's clever and original in its own way. Good, scary B-Movie Slasher fare.
