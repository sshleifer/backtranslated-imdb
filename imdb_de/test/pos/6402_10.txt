Agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show. I remember the show when I was in the Florida Keys when the show debuted. I reviewed old VCR tapes that were "keepers" and found two that had about eight episodes. I spent part of Christmas night (and the next one) to see these shows. The singer was Bankie Banx - he saw his name in the credits. He comes from Anguilla and owns a beach bar called The Dune Preserve. He is a longtime friend of Jimmy Buffett and Bankie's classic song "Still In Paradise," which is featured in Buffett's latest CD / DVD combo called "Live In Anguilla." I would also like to see how this short-lived series appears on DVD. Keep faith!
