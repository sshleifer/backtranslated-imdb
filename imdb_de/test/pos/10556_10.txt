What a great movie that is. I found it full of delightful unexpected pain to be a single parent of a teenage girl. And it's in a tropical island paradise. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardeiux brings his special European flair to this story about a divorced father of a teenage girl. They are on holiday together and it unexpectedly starts to increase the excitement on the island. But you have to watch the movie for yourself to see all the funny situations that you find for yourself. <br /> <br /> There are some cult classics that every teenager should see. This movie should be added to the list. Besides Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House, My Father the Hero should be a film study. Look at it like you have a teenage daughter and you'll roll with laughter. Watch it with your teenage daughter and get ready to be laughed at for months on end.
