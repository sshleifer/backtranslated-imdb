Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) was transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is terribly burned by an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) takes care of him, body and mind because she rightly fears that he may be a very restless soul. During his care, Count Hana tells of his recent past. It appears that he has worked in a government function in Africa, where he met a beautiful married woman named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine announced that the count had been abandoned. Nevertheless, the two would meet again under heartbreaking circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana falls in love with a British man in the British bomb squad. Nevertheless, the war rages relentlessly. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a great movie based on an equally fine but complex novel. The plot has many storylines that are beautifully interwoven, and each one is indescribable. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is great, both as a burnt-offering and as a man who took love for a myth. Scott Thomas is also doing well as a woman fighting against her passions. With respect to Binoche, she had amply earned the Oscar she presented, for her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation. The landscape is absolutely beautiful, as are the costumes, the direction and the production. If you've failed to watch this movie, correct it soon, very soon. The English patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in the film for centuries.
