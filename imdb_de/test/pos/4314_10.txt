This is a good series for me. I am somehow disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby have died, but still annoyed that Micheal has lied to anyone who killed her. And if anyone can answer that, which was the name of this guy who was supposed to be "Henry Gale," anyway, he was like the leader of the others (or was that Mrs. Clue ??), if you know his name cool. Now try to think about what can happen next after you have not pressed the button. Did that mess up the whole thing with the DARMA project, and I personally thought it was cool how they had the key element in the underground in which Desmond turned off the magnet thing, yes, and what was that? I'm just glad they did not press the button, but what happens to the people in the hatch? As Mr. Echo, John, Charlie and Desmond probably died, but what about the others? I think they survived, I forget? Well, that's just my little thing to what I thought about this season's finale !!!
