I have to say that I know the documentations of Mr. Ã–rnek and therefore I knew that I would receive a very well made film documentary. I was not disappointed. As a nerd of history I saw hundreds of documentary films and liked the different approach of this work. The director and his 17 advisers (historians, veteran families) tried the reality of Gallipoli through the soldiers' letters from both sides. British, Australian and Turkish soldiers follow the story. Narrated is this document by Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill - both add to the intensity and emotionality of this documentary about their great voices. <Br /> <br /> I saw this movie in a cinema in Italy in Dolby Surround. I bought the DVD last year and will again wait 3-7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries. <br /> <br /> Summary: Well done. Violently. Story with emotions - packed in a war documentary with great narrators
