I did not have very high expectations for Just Before Dawn. I do not know why I always buy these Slasher movies when I know it's the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a small group of teenagers going into the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they are gradually being killed by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magical! It's one of the best experiences I've had on a Slasher movie. The places where it was filmed are so wonderful. You see mountains, waterfalls, Rockies. It's just amazing. It takes a long time (except for the opening scene) for the killer to start killing, but I did not care! It was nice enough to see, not to worry about. I mean, you will not sit there waiting for the murders to start, because everything that happens is nice because of the beauty of the movie. The end is a bit weird, but I will not tell you more about it. You will know what I mean. Another thing I enjoyed: they are interested in the characters. Not only are they a bunch of idiots who spend their time complaining each other. Sure, they are pure stereotypes of common Slasher characters, but they have something special. Anyway, it's a great horror movie and I hope you have a pretty good time because I really did!
