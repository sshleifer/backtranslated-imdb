If I know that Walter will never decorate another film. I was in my 30s when I saw this sweet, loveable and unobtrusive romantic movie for the first time. I loved it from the first scene to the end of the usual stupid self; Glenda met Walter in the joke patterns step by step, and Richard Benjamin provided the sarcastic voice of reason he does so well. There are a few lines in the movie that my SO and I have used over the years, but I will not comment here. I'm pretty sure you know which two of them I'm talking about. Just get this movie. Make some popcorn, grab your squeeze (if he's as sappy as me, which I'm grateful for), and enjoy this 70's romantic comedy. You will not be disappointed. However, I have the feeling that I am preaching to the choir, because who loves Walter, it will already own. I am very happy that it finally appears on DVD.
