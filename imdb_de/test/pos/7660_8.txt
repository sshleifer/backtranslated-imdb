Hercules' son is severely wounded in a lion-hunt that goes awry. Hercules (a solid and captivating feat of the beefy Reg Park) has to go into an eerie and dangerous alternative dimension, fought over by the evil and vindictive Gia, the Earth Goddess (a delicately evil depiction of Gia Sandri), and various monsters, to save the soul of his son Meanwhile, Gia's equally disgusting son Antaius (a hated twist of Giovanni Cianfriglia) poses as Hercules and takes on an entire city as cruel and ruthless tyrant. Director Maurizo Lucidi tells the gripping story at a steady pace and maintains a thoroughly serious tone. This movie starts a bit slow but really starts to boil as soon as Hercules enters the foggy and dangerous underground spirit world: Hercules's exciting highlights include fighting a humanoid beast, Hercules climbing a giant, gnarled tree, and Hercules Zombies Better still, the bizarre spirit world only stinks of a scary atmosphere (I have to love this stubborn, swirling fog!). The exhausting rough, inhuman physical confrontation between Hercules and Antaius is also immense. Of course we also get a big Mondo Destructo volcano eruption. Allvaro Mancori's crisp wide-screen cinematography gives the film an impressively wide-ranging feel. Ugo Filippini's rugged, rousing score has an elegant majestic swing. Okay, this strip is an obvious cheap 'Cute'n'paste job that uses plenty of footage from both Hercules in the Haunted World and Hercules and the Captive Women. Nevertheless, it is an extremely lively and entertaining gaming experience.
