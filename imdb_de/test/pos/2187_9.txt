Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: On March 1, 1979, the Demonic barber of Fleet Street opened with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury the lead roles. Although it swept virtually every imaginable award, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended with 557 performances. Fortunately, the piece then went on tour - and on the way it was recorded on film. The result is a remarkable recording of the play, which replaces George Hern replacing Cariou and Lansbury in close proximity to the original Broadway staging. <br /> <br /> But there is a mistake. To put it simply, plays do not film very well, because a performance that works well on stage has to fill the theater and is therefore very, very big - and when it is shown on film, such performances often seem a bit static, oppressively aggressive or both . SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Seen in the movie, it has a "stand and sing" quality, and while both Hern and Lansbury seem to modulate their performance for the camera, Betsy Joslyn does not do so for Joanna; Her larger-than-life performance reads as uncomfortably hectic in the movie, and her extremely operatic voice does not feel like the overall cast. <br /> <br /> Take on this stage effect However, this is an extraordinary performance of a unique and gritty comic operetta-style musical. Lansbury is amazing, a mix of stupidity, stupidity and cunning malice, while Hern really plays the role of the psychotic hairdresser whose clients "walk in immaculately shaved tombs". Overall, the cast is pretty good and although the movie does not let us see enough of the set, there is enough to see to be impressive. And the music! Who can argue with what most of Sondheim think is the best work? The story itself is very well known in England. In 1846, Thomas Peckett Perst combined several urban myths for a short story he called A STRING OF PEARLS. Within a year, she was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET - and in a time that did not know the copyright, variations of the piece soon played throughout England. However, each of them was more or less the same: Sweeney Todd, a barber, kills the men who come to him to shave; Mrs. Lovett, his co-worker, bakes them into pies and feeds them to an unsuspecting audience. The Sondheim version is based specifically on a 1973 version of Christopher Bond. <br /> <br /> The story is very grand Guignol, with lots of blood, bodies falling down slides, and grotesque humor. At the same time, however, the music, the lyrics and the subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open the subject to numerous lyrical charms that one would not expect. Sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but never like this; Along the way, he combines a lot of evil satire for industry and capitalism, and certainly one can not fault the strange, yet Victorian-elegant of his complex music. <br /> <br /> Like the "Concert Version" with Hern and Patti LuPone, this movie also offers us some choices cut out of the Tim Burton movie version of 2007, especially the opening "Attend the Tale of Sweeney Todd" that runs like a thread through the game. In my opinion, it's also a lot weirder than the movie, which tends to underestimate the comedy in favor of even more bloodshed. Whatever the case, if you're a fan of history, this is the legendary Broadway show on tour, and it's a knock-out. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
