Okay, that's thanks to Pulp Fiction, but in my opinion it has its own voice and identity, mainly because of the music-video directional style, the sketchy narration, and great performances. Thomas Jane delivers great (the drug dealdown is extraordinary), as does Aaron Eckhart. James LeGros has a short and bubbly appearance - great humor - "they got the Wong house". The interrogation and rape scene of Porzikova is memorable, as is Mickey Rourke's performance - "Make a climax". <br /> <br /> Big Hollywood Popcorn B production with strong performances by A-level aspirants and renegades (Rourke). <br /> <br /> Well, take a summit, it's worth it.
