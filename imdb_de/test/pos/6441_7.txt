This is a movie that I saw as a young girl and never forgot. It's certainly not the best movie ever made, but it's something very special that I can not quite pin down. I love it. I'm the guy who likes everything I've been told, and that's why this movie makes me crazy. <br /> <br /> Exactly what / Who is this mysterious witchwoman and how does she relate to Tom? WHY and HOW did he become a water baby ... why was he raised on earth? These are questions like these that just eat me! I thought if I read the book, I would get answers, but I've just read an article that says the book on which this story is based is very different. So I think, I'll never know what the author thought! <br /> <br /> I still love this movie and have recently seen it with my two-year-old niece. She also loves it, though she insists on calling it "baby water" for unknown reasons. She loves the part in which he jumps into the water and then explains: "I'm very clean." (You must understand that my niece is the cleanest 2-year-old in the world!) We've watched this scene over and over again. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad we can enjoy this movie together! There should be more films like this. (But what's wrong with the gay seahorse? !!)
