One of the better musical bios. Dennis Morgan is great as singer / composer Chauncey Olcutt. The side cast is very good, especially Andrea King as the glamorous Lillian Russell. The atmosphere of the turn of the century is the perfect setting. The Technicolor is excellent. A simple storyline, but the movie just makes you feel good. Morgan was always underestimated as an actor and singer.
