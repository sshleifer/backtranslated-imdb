"Plots With A View" from 2002 is a delightful little comedy, as only the British could do. The humor of the film is both morbid and black, yet very lovable and sometimes very slapsticky. It's the only film by director Nick Hurran I've ever seen, and although I have no plans to watch one of his other films (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedy), this movie is very enjoyable and very funny. The film takes place in a small town in Wales, where Betty Rhys-Jones is married to the town's drunken Major (Robert Pugh). Local mortician Boris (Alfred Molina) has been in love with Betty since childhood, but he has always been too shy to tell him about his love. In addition to being desperately in love, Boris has a few other problems, as eccentric American mortician Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken) has opened a bustling funeral home in the same city, and the story is sometimes quite bizarre. "Plots With A View" also benefits from a wonderful cast. Brenda Bethlyn, who turned out to be a fun lady in 2000 as the "Saving Grace", plays the lead role and she is once again very funny and very adorable in her role. Alfred Molina, who plays her shy admirer, delivers as always a great performance, and Robert Pugh fits perfectly into the role of Betty's sloppy husband. Beautiful Naomi Watts is also great as the man's "secretary". I become a bigger fan with every movie I see them in. The biggest role, however, is played by the incomparable Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actors). Walk is brilliant, for he is always in the role of the eccentric Mortician who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox. Overall, "Plots With A View" is an extremely entertaining little British comedy that I highly recommend!
