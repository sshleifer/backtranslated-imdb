A real surprise. Not just family entertainment from "Disney". Some violence, many tense moments and a great story based on facts. The theme "Night Crossing" is: Determination wins. Never losing sight of the goal, two East German families risk everything to escape into freedom in their daring balloon. The story is both shocking and heartwarming. Time is not on your side. The GDR police closes and the result is anything but safe until the end. If you are looking for a good evening entertainment that contains no nudity and limited violence, then I recommend "Night Crossing". It's pure entertainment. - MERK
