Even if you do not normally enjoy documentary film, you will probably be fascinated by it. It not only has a well-planned plot that is easy to follow, but also contains interesting detours. it also has a very strong emotional resonance and none that relies on a simple specific tone. Instead, the emotions here are as deep and turbulent as the seas. <br /> <br /> If you do not know about Donald Crowhurst and the one-hand boat race of 1968 around the world ... that was the case for me ... please stop reading and rent this movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOLLOW <br /> <br /> My friend Brian recommended this at the same time that my aunt had sent me a clip that combined this movie with Antonioni's work. In 2007 I was fascinated by some Antonioni's films are still! To connect this movie with Antonioni, I think it is a bit boring. The person most likely to be seen in a Michaelangelo film is Francoise Moitessier de Cazalet. It's funny on the main IMDb site, it's not even listed as "yourself," which is probably a function of its long name, as opposed to its self-realization / renunciation. Since Moitessier sails straight out of the race, this could be considered a bit like Anna in L'Avventura. A pretty important minor character. <br /> <br /> Although there are many things to love about this film: the actual material of that time, the stoic best friend, the sheer power of the Roaring Forties, I have with a simple connection. A man, really at sea. There were times in my life when I wondered how I got to such a point, trapped between dream and reality, that I felt like a stowaway in my own skin. Maybe I'm reading too much into this documentary, and the directors are reading too much about Crowhurst, but I found that sense as compelling as the other secrets in this film. <br /> <br At the strange chance that Crowhurst's wife (who seemed a remarkable study in restraint with understandably conflicting overtones) and his children (so young in the find material) and at that late date still young in terms of their pain and pride on her father), I'm sure the comments here and the movie itself can not catch the man who was your dad. In his death, however, he has given the world something of a lost myth, he is a pre-GPS Odysseus. Never finding his body adds to the fragile immortality of air, if not the stature of a cosmic being of whom he wrote. This movie will stay with you after looking at you as if you were expecting a different turn out of the deep water. Or at least you hope for the continuation of Moitessier. <br /> <br /> Thurston hungry 8/10
