Harry Langdon's "Saturday Afternoon" is often ranked among the biggest silent comedies, at least for short subjects, and may therefore be a little disappointing for some. Unlike some of the other well-known classics like Keaton's "Cops" or Chaplin's "The Immigrant," this movie is, in a sense, a well-known, conventional sitcom and does not offer a lot of guts. One may even wonder if Langdon belongs in such a sophisticated society. In my opinion, it's an extremely charming minor-kind comedy, and Harry is mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> For a modern television viewer who is being raised on TV sitcoms, the action of "Saturday Afternoon" might suggest the honeymoon or its many spin-offs: two stupid guys, one of whom is married and very much under the His wife's thumb is up, trying to sneak up with some good girls for a fun afternoon. But everything goes awry and they have to defend themselves against the hard girlfriends of the girls. Does this sound familiar to you? And maybe a bit bleak? Well, the premise was already over when this movie was shot, but beyond that, nothing was typical of Langdon. He was strange, starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged baby half asleep. All Freudians catching "Saturday Afternoon" will have a field day with the scenes between this shy, chubby baby man and his stern, gently dominant mommy wife. If Harry tries to hide money under the carpet but gets caught and forced to surrender, you would swear that you are seeing an interaction between a 6-year-old boy and his mother. , , and maybe that's why Harry Langdon has frightened some people and still does. <br /> <br /> But he's a captivating screen character, and it's not how he does it, but the way he does it. In this scene with the coins under the carpet, for example, Harry finds the coins by placing one foot in front of the other, as cautiously as a tightrope walker counting down his steps until he finds the right spot and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon moved like no one else. Whether he makes you laugh or not, the guy is intriguing, seemingly in a world of his own. As far as the plot of his films is concerned, Harry is curiously passive and almost never drives the story himself. In the finale of "Saturday Afternoon," when the big fistfight takes place, Harry's co-star Vernon Dent is in the thick of it, but Harry is in dizziness most of the time, lighting a kind of punch drunk between two cars (sitting on the running board) but with your feet on the other) as they race through the streets. It's a memorable image, and as the critic Walter Kerr wrote, it embodies Langdon's film personality perfectly: he's a passive character in the midst of hectic action, blinking sleepily as the world rushes by. It is also noteworthy that Langdon and Dent, who have worked together frequently, have a connection to this film, suggesting that a design by Laurel & Hardy will follow when they unite a year later. Langdon's style probably had an impact on Stan Laurel, especially here. <br /> <br /> "Saturday Afternnon" and his star may not be for everyone, but the movie is worth a look and you'll find that Langdon makes an impression that's hard to shake.
