This movie is pretty good, but the unpublished Producer's Cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original. Jamie's story is handled differently, the death scenes are made ten times better, there is more stuff with ritual stuff that tells more about Micheal, Jamie and her baby. There is also an alternative ending, which is better too. Why you did not release this version, I have no fucking idea. If you can find this version, read it.
