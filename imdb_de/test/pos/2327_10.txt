The scenario of the subtle comedy has not been surpassed in recent years by any film. The characters are interesting, albeit a bit predictable. The comedy timing written in the script is more than enough to compensate for a well-worn underdog plot. If you are sure that you know the end ... SURPRISE! Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set probably does not appreciate some of the more subtle references, you'll most certainly appreciate a galley scene! Great movie!
