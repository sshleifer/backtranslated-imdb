"L'Ossessa" (released in English under many titles and the scariest among them is certainly "The Eerie Midnight Horrorshow") is one of the best Italian rip-offs of "The Exorcist". To really appreciate this movie, you should have a sense of humor. "L'Ossessa" is sloppy (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even moving. Danila (Stella Carnacina), an art student, goes to an old church to see the statue she is going to restore. It is a wooden statue of Christ, a demonic Christ who may already be overwhelmed by evil or fighting it or planning dark deeds. The face shows endless agony. The statue dates from the 15th century. Danila is impressed by the mastery of the sculptor - the statue seems almost alive! She lives with her parents. Her mother, Luisa (Lucretia Love), lives a dissolute life and does not care much about preserving appearances. Her father Mario (Chris Avram) watches everything with disappointed eyes. <br /> <br /> The wooden statue will soon take on a human form (Ivan Rassimov) and possess Danila in the fleshly and spiritual sense. A great scene! Poor Danila will suffer from the torments of hell from now on. <br /> <br /> Danila (the lovely Stella Carnacina) was devastated, injured, possessed by the devil and now, following his orders, tries to seduce others. Is not she emulating her slender mother Luisa (Lucretia Love), who is very happy when her lover beats her with a bouquet of roses? There is a scene that is so ridiculous as to be sublime and moving as Stella Carnacina desperately runs through the narrow streets (obsessed with the devil, remember?) An Italian town that cries out to her heart. Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. His performance is intense as always. The exorcism scenes (especially the last fight) are very, very amateurish, but this only adds to the fun (and / or the emotion?), If you really have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Stella Carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and that's one factor that adds to her pleasure when she's naked, but I think the movie could have been more about her natural beauty , Lucretia Love is a very good companion (her nude scene with the roses ... well.) Other Italian exorcist rip-offs I would recommend for you are: <br /> <Malabimba (very dark and published uncut and digitally restored) "Evil Eye" (Malocchio) - "The Exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "Evil Eye," but other films, such as "Rosemary's Baby" should also be taken into account. "Evil Eye" is completely overkill. Not so sloppy, but with many beautiful Italian and Spanish actresses. You're going to drool the whole movie. The film is ridiculous, history does not make sense, but if you see it in the right mood, you may feel moved! - a devilish sect, possessions, murders, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women. A wild ride! <br /> <br /> If you liked "Evil Eye", see also "Ring of Darkness" (Un'Ombra nell'ombra). This film can be found in the alternative market. Look for this title in the IMDb. There are good reviews about it. <br /> <br /> P.S. - "L'Ossessa" has many faces. It is exploitative, but it can also be serious and moving. It's cheap, cheesy, ... dirty (but not so much) and has a "moral" message behind it. This strange brew can sometimes be very funny. We all already know that "L'Ossessa" is a rip-off of the "exorcist". Why can not we see her under her own conditions? Yes, Mario Gariazzo has been trying to make quick money, but he has been able to get the most out of a tight budget. The story is well told, the film is atmospheric and the actors are committed to their roles. Watch the movie open-minded and discover two or three new things.
