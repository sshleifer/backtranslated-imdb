I'm not a big fan of Lucio Fulcis films. Most of his 80s Gore films had their moments, but often came as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining "Zombi" (an imitation of George Romero) I did not really enjoy them. I know that Italian horror often ignores the storyline, but the storyline and the characters in its films were too bland even for the standards. That's why "Do not Torture a Duckling" surprised me. It's actually a very well made movie with a gripping murder mystery. It's possibly the best giallo ever made, just serious with Dario Argento's entry into the genre. And unlike Fulci's earlier Giallo, "A lizard in a woman's skin," this never goes away. <br /> <br /> Fulcis direction here is pretty good. He keeps the story at a good pace and maintains the viewer's interest throughout. The conclusion of the puzzle also surprises the audience. He also adds some clever accents, such as the happy soul music during a particularly disturbing sequence of the cemetery. Overall, the violence here is reserved and is only used if necessary for the story. The acting is for the most part also good, full of familiar faces of the Italian exploitation cinema of the 70s. Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are super cool throughout. The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan, whose performance is far surpassed. It's the only ridiculous aspect of the movie. "Do not Torture a Duckling" definitely comes with my recommendation and can be a good introduction to the Giallo subgenre as a whole. (8/10)
