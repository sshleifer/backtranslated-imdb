With these words came one of the major advertising campaigns for films to the conclusion. "Garbo Talks" and she spoke those words in her first sound film, an adaptation of the Eugene O'Neil play Anna Christie. <br /> <br /> Unlike some other players and some other studios, MGM has taken great care to find the right vehicle for Greta Garbo. Many players, who did well in the universal medium of silent film, would lose their careers due to conversation. Their strong native accents would get in the way, some could not speak English. <br /> <br /> It was no coincidence that Anna Christie was selected for Garbo. First of all, it was written by one of America's leading playwrights. It was the literary property she had addressed. Second, since the title role was someone who was Swedish, the accent could be explained. After all, many tricks had been clarified from the early talkies, even though Anna Christie still used title cards. <br /> <br /> Like most of O'Neil's work, the action is short but long and deep characterization. The story takes place on the New York Coast, where Garbo moved to Anna with her father George Marion. Marion went to sea years ago when Anna was a baby and Marion let his wife down. Anna had to do what she could to survive in the adult world, and that includes prostitution. Marion, of course, is happy to see her, even kicking Marie Dressler, the old port city he lives, out of the way for years to make room for his flesh and blood. Of course, both Marion and Garbo have trouble adjusting to each other, not easy, if they accommodate a sailor from Charles Bickford who is interested in Garbo. Marion repeats his role from the original Broadway production. The role of Anna on stage was taken over by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie ran in the season 1921/22 on Broadway for 177 performances. It is one of O'Neil's best known works and one that is often revived. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo's performance was celebrated with perfect diction, also with a Swedish accent, and secured her future in sound films. Greta Garbo received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and the film also received nominations for Clarence Brown for Best Director and William Daniels for Cinematography. Daniels was to receive a lot of praise especially for the way he photographed the Waterfront scenes. And Brown created the mood on the waterfront where the movie plays. <br/> <br/> Eugene O'Neil's work is timeless, so even with many circumcisions of the early sound films, Anna Christie does not look like many films from that era do. Garbo also shows that she masters the subtlety needed to work with the sound medium. Anna Christie is a classic all around.
