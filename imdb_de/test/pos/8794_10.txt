This movie is too good for words. It's so incredibly great and funny and lifelike. You just know from watching that the person who wrote this, DEFIANTIE felt the way Jip and his friends are doing through the movie. It was my life at some point and I would count on me coming home every night to see Human Traffic before I even thought about going to bed. I think you are just so loved with the characters and their lifestyle. Of course, this film would not be more for older people aged 16 to 22 years, I think. Nevertheless, there is nothing wrong with this movie, and you will be stitched all the way through. It has no specific action. The general idea is a weekend in the life of older teens in London and what they are up to. The places they go, the people they meet, the drugs they take, and the experiences they have. You have to get this movie on DVD, it does not matter to just look at it, you have to have it !!!
