This review was written by someone who has read (several times) and knows what they are talking about! First, I read others' comments and found that some objections were really pretty stupid. People who have read the book and other Jane Austen or a good book will know that sticking to the book is crucial if you have to trust an author to do what he does. If the viewer does not like it BECAUSE it holds on to the book, it shows that they do not understand Jane Austen and are obviously not a real fan. <br /> <br /> First, if the viewer really loved the book or Jane Austen In general, it should not be difficult to watch for four hours. Secondly, their society was very much about aesthetics, and such great, offbeat hairstyles would show how wealthy you were, which in their day was a key factor in coping with a "good" society. I have to confess that the female costumes were not brilliant, but there were only a few bad ones and the male men made up for it, also this prejudice for the navy men who are not in their uniform is, in beautiful words, very stupid ! Today, people do not go away from school or work with their uniform because they have casual wear and were the same in the 19th century. Even though the drama is very good, it is subtle, as Jayne Austen writes! and the scene in the end is beautiful. You can not compare the shooting with those of the 1995 version, because the technology has improved so much, because it's ridiculous to compare them. The actress Ann plays is too old, but her acting and how she does it makes up for it. <br /> <br /> People seem to favor the 1995 version for some reason I can not understand! It does not stick to the book at all and is flat, the ending is sentimental, important scenes change, the only good actors are the lead actors, and I give you that you have done a good job of what has been given to them. Obviously, the people who really, really like it, (I'm sorry) are stupid because they do not understand persuasion and therefore need it to be exaggerated. The 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, written by an excellent scriptwriter (who also did Inspector Morse), had very good actors and it's really a movie you can see a lot, and you can look forward to it anytime.
