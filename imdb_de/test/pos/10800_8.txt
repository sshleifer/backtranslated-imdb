Not a bad movie, but could have gotten along in one of the opening scenes without the full frontal nudity of a 10 year old boy. This film has an excellent dialogue; This is certainly common in foreign films. Foreign actors still know how to behave unlike American actors who do the CGI, stunts and special effects for themselves. This movie is just good old fashion drama. Gerarde DePardieux did a great job as usual. The costumes and sceneries are accurate over time. My only complaint is that they should skip the English words over the French instead of using subtitles. That could just be because I hate reading subtitles.
