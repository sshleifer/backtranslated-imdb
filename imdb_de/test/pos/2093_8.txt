Finally! Happy for the third time. This movie was always in my mind, but on my first visit, I forgot about it and only caught the second half of the movie. Only a few months later I had my second chance to see it, so I decided to record it. Just to find out that my timer was running late and I missed the first half of the strip again. I would not let it happen again. So when it came back on TV, I thought it was bad, I'll wait until it opens, then I'll record it. And it was a good choice. I would have just watched the movie, but at midnight they kept putting it on. <br /> <br /> After discovering a hole in their overcrowded cell, nine prisoners escaped their confinement to find the key of the universe that a fellow inmate known as a fake king had hidden , They believe that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of fake bills. On this journey, of course, they see this as an opportunity to win their lives before being tortured. Although things are not going the way they were intended, most of the crime plans are going astray. <br /> <br /> "9 Souls" is a cheeky spiritual journey by Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, who hurled his audience into a movie of two completely different halves. The first half of the story is more akin to a psychic comedy with the criminals' crimes and the situations in which they see themselves as a selling point, but all of this paves the way for a morally and dramatically shaped second half, in which the real trouble begins quite a bit Wicked and bloody moments replaced the riff-off sound he'd begun with. While the first half is pretty exciting, she's on the road, the spiraling doodle and the funky joke. But it really is the really exciting last half with its peculiar twists that have hit you so hard with some surprising touches that you really sympathize with these very human characters. Although they are not really innocent of their crimes, in the first half of these carnal characters you become so entrenched that when you see them sinking, you know it's an effective drama when you're in the dramatist shock be shocked change. The nine characters have plenty of time to really understand their personal story and what weakness they would eventually bring to a standstill. The plot looks like Michiru and Torakichi are the main characters and we see them mostly from their perspective. The escapism story is an undeniably appealing character study whose goal is clear. It asks you many questions about the society and the path you choose to escape from life and get rid of these restrictions. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told. The visual element does not go unnoticed, because there is only a dreamy and trance-like atmosphere that introduces into the unique atmosphere. What HIGHLY contributed to this factor and has revived the film was the rousing, atmospheric instrumental rock soundtrack. The mild atmospheric gel that could create it in many scenes left me quite breathless with the everlasting emotions that it could produce. Simply beautiful and downright powerful control on this front. The pace of such a long movie (2 hours) seems to be slowing down and editing is done quickly because we're so involved in everything. The hypnotic photography is sharp in the details. While the portrayals of the cast as a weird group of criminals are of high quality, each of them offers enough personality and qualities to separate. <br /> <br /> I found that "9 Souls" is a pleasant and quite amazing surreal movie that stirs up the emotions and then smears you with an almighty blow when it changes direction. Highly recommended.
