As you may know, Norway is the most developed country in the world (in terms of HDI, Human Development Index). This film cleverly shows us our future. Our future would be that of Norway as we all paddle to achieve the best and to offer the least. The life shown may have been exaggerated, but comparing today's concerns with those of our ancestors, it is not far from reality. <br /> <br /> If we look at this film free from all our predictions, we can see both of our faces; The one who laughs at the brilliant scene in which Andreas drops her friend, and the one who spends hours searching for magazines to choose a stupid chair among stupid collections. The idea of ​​the hole with the hope of lightness was another great idea of ​​the film. The easy glory; But the only one, and the effort we have made to reach us, makes us feel closer to Andreas. <br /> <br /> Although I was mainly attracted to the idea and production of the film, Trond Fausa Aurvaag played quite well. The atmosphere of the film was quite fitting.
