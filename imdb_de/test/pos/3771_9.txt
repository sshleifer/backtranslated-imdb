This is one of those rare comedies that you can try, you can not help but giggle, giggle, laugh and yes, even laugh loudly. The performance of the main character as Hyde is a purely manic genius. See if you can keep a straight face as he performs his transformation. Good luck. :) The disadvantage is that the movie is sometimes bad. It seemed longer than 90 minutes.
