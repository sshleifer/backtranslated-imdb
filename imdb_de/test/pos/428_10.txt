"Hey, I did not order a taxi!" "Yes, well, you have one ..." What can I say about hack ... what a man among men. He was an emboldened former cop who had a taxi driver with a golden heart. If you (and fortunately for America's television viewers ... one person a week) were able to penetrate the cold, hard surface of Hack's outdoor area, you saw a caring man dedicated to vengeful justice. The show was great, I laughed, I cried, I smiled ... all in the same episode. My arms broke into goosebumps when our dear friend Hack left his taxi in another dark alley ... with nothing but his fists ... ready to avenge an uninvited civilian. A smile would erupt on my face as the screen showed me a criminal in the face of a dark alley as the Taxi of Justice's headlights fell on his face. Week after week, I've given up my duties as President of the Klingon Association to bask in the warm glow of Hack's shine. I have never seen a better show, and I regretted the loss of one of America's greatest treasures when the show was canceled. In other news related to hack, I'd like to tell the world that my wife and I expect Hack Koen to be born in about three weeks.
