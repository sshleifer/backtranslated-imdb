Yes, let's get this out of the way before we start: * This is the one to which Sean Connery returned in 1983 after Roger Moore's stay. * It's Connery's last movie. * And JA is a remake of Thunderball, but more of a movie inspired by it. If you all think bond purists out there, I'll be contentious, you're right. Bond is one of the greatest movie series of all time, but that does not mean that a series should go on forever. I think this is one of two films in which they did a great favor and ended the Bond saga. Not offended yet? Then I'll go on ... Hey, if you think I'm indifferent to Bondflicks, you're wrong. I grew up with my mother, who was OBSERVED with them. Every free moment, Bond and his antics would be on TV. Bond rules and "Never Say Never Again" (by Irvin "Empire Strikes Back" Kershner) are one of the best. It can not be "Goldfinger" or "From Russia ..." and may not have been made by the same production house as all the others (which I hear, why they refuse to accept it was ever done !?), but still stands Head and Shoulders over recent Brosnan outings ... (if you have not spat on the screen, read on). CHARACTERIZATION!!!!! Something that so many blockbuster films forget today, but something that is essential to telling a good story. "Never" played a great hand by treating 007 as if he had grown older. "Dr. No." He is "a little bit on the way" and has to do something like a health farm - a direct order of "M" (!). Yes, if you have not seen this movie, I will not be too busy with that Giving offense because A) Burdens and B) Obviously I want you to see it for yourself Do not let my 'old bond' revelation scare you Connery still has a lot of great set pieces to recharge, Swimming, throbbing, tempo, crushing and smooching - the man is a legend and this movie is one of Bond's finest outings - hi-tech gadgets aplenty, some great baddies and a superb minor cast (including a fantastic rowan cameo Atkinson) makes this movie beyond the expectations of the audience. <br /> <br /> This could have been the last Bond movie of all time and it would have been a party to remember playing as someone about to retire was a refreshing stroke of genius - the last scene did a perfect job of doing the show ... ... but we still had more, and then more and more, and one more Moore. However, if you want to find out what Fatima Blush is all about, then get this movie. Then at least you can pretend that 007 spent his last moments as a cunning secret agent in the arms of Kim Basinger and let Mr. Bean grin. (P.S. * The other movie that I think he could have done anything with? The shitty "license to kill"
