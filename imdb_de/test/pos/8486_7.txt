I saw Ray when it first came out. Why? Partly because of the advertising hype, secondly, because I just loved the music of Ray Charles. But when I was not there when his greatest things happened in music and in his life, I wanted to know more about the man's life. And in this movie I did. His drug addiction was something I did not know, and the movie let us know. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing, while this was a decent autobiographical movie ... I can not say it was "great" movie. I saw "Malcolm X" and was blown away Likewise, "What love has to do with it" and "Bird." The accomplishments of each of these films have been outstanding, and I have attracted not only the main characters in these films, who have done incredible work, but also those around them. This helps me to take a picture for myself. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film was flat and cumbersome in some places to be emotional, and yes, I do appear in certain parts of the movie I almost fell asleep, and the movie was too long, and the movie left out some "other" important details of Ray Charles' life that would have improved the film flow, and the film was "chopped off" in certain parts for me. And the movie seemed to end with a whimper, not a bang - b certain parts, including the end that was played for me like a "lifetime" cable network movie. I expect more cinema. <br /> <br /> Where does my ambivalence come from? With the performance of Jamie Foxx. Overall he did - okay. Not Denzel Washington's Malcolm X or Angela Bassett's Tina Turner is spectacular, but ... okay. <br /> <br /> Sorry folks, but for me there were several points in the movie where I saw Jamie Foxx's interpretation of Ray Charles, and in others, he "saw" thanks to wonderful camera settings and lighting like Ray Charles , But I paid attention to the ... acting. An actor must make you believe that he is the character he plays. Do not make a cartoon of the figure. Did I believe that Jamie Foxx Ray was on the screen? Sometimes yes sometimes no. <br /> <br /> Has Jamie Foxx earned a Golden Globe? You can bet on it. Does he deserve an Oscar ...? Depends on who he is dealing with. He has a few major competitors, and he could just take them out. But then again ... maybe not. If Jamie Foxx does not win, I will not get up and say "he was robbed". I do not really feel like he was. <br /> <br /> This was a decent movie with decent performances and a decent story. A "big" autobiographical film by the late Ray Charles? Somewhere out there, I feel there's a great movie about Ray Charles just waiting to be filmed, and an actor who's going to blow you away.
