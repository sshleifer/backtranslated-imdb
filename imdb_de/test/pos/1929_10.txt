I remember the events of this film, the unfortunate cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968 at the Golden Globe, which was running around a yacht race all over the world. I was 13 years old and lived in England. Last year Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis, knighted for his deeds) had completed the first round-the-world tour of solos. I remember that, especially because we had time to see him return (on a grainy black-and-white TV!) And then his knight with the queen. It triggered a huge burst of patriotic fervor in Britain. It all seems so funny now. Chichester became a national hero, but he was stopped halfway in Australia to rebuild his yacht. The next logical step for sailors was to try the journey without stopping. <br /> <br /> It's important to remember that this was a world before GPS, when communication on land was still pretty unpredictable, no matter in the middle of the ocean. With GPS receivers that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a meter anywhere on Earth, it's hard to remember a time when you could go to sea and literally disappear. Like Donald Crowhurst. <br /> <br /> A number of yachtsmen signed up (all men at that time), including the mystery man Crowhurst. Essentially a weekend sailor, Crowhurst was a spectacular success in no previous venture, including careers in the British Army, the Air Force, and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids. He wanted to achieve something big with his life, and he saw the Â£ 5,000 first prize (well over $ 100,000 in today's funds) and the subsequent publicity as a means to start his business. He signed a contract with a sponsor who proved to be more watertight than his boat, which bankrupted him, and he soon found himself among the journalists as popular as he prepared for the race. Now the British always love the idea that the brave amateur accepts the 'pros'. (Remember, Eddie the Eagle lost endless Olympic ski jumps and the amateurs who regularly run the Grand National Horse Races.) The public lined up to get him off the ground, but his boat was not ready yet (the last competitor to leave the UK) Crowhurst must have known that he did not have a serious chance. But there was too much pressure on him to stop. <br /> <br /> In the wonderful archive footage we see doubts in the face of his poor wife. Left behind with her four children, she is interviewed during the film with one of Crowhurst's sons. She was in no situation. Had she tried to stop him, she would have been considered a spoiler, but then she doubted if she could have saved his life by stopping him. With the certainty that his boat was leaking and could never make it through the southern oceans, and could not turn around and make fun of mockery, bankruptcy and shame, Crowhurst devised a plan to cheat. Off the coast of Argentina and Brazil, he had no radio contact. He waited for the leaders to circle Cape Horn and drive back up the Atlantic. He thought he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed the whole world. He lavishly faked his logs and made 16mm films and audio recordings to secure his plan. As the other competitors retired one by one, he realized that he would actually take 2nd place and his minutes would be scrutinized. Unable to face a particular discovery, his journal suggests that he lost reality and eventually committed suicide. His yacht was found. He never was. <br /> <br /> This beautifully edited film also follows the journey of Bernard Moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic French sailor, who was in second place and was sure of the fastest travel value when he could not finish the race The noise and the public he knew he would see her sailed into the vast blue sky and finally retreated to Tahiti ten months later. Having worked at sea for seven years (though on very different ships than these), I understand well the ocean's pull. Standing on the deck, seeing water in all directions to the horizon, knowing that there are a few miles of water beneath you, nothing between you and oblivion beyond a thin metal shell, with no easy access to TV or radio (even on the most functioning ships, one feels rather isolated), it is possible to escape the obligations of everyday life for some time. There is a thoughtful analysis of what drives people to undertake this kind of long, lonely journey, and what effect it has on the human mind. Most people would think that trying to raise 4 children is an adventure, but you need a lot of self-discovery in distress at sea, looking for yourself. <br /> <br /> I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston, the ex-Marine guy who won the race (and many since then), probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off, which is why he not only managed to win the race but also put his sanity up the way. Those in search of something profound may not have liked what they found. <br /> <br /> Great Britain's wonderful archival footage in the late '60s is almost enough reason to look at it (did it really look that bad?) I do not remember it looking so stupid, but maybe we're puking out the worst aspects of the past?), but overall it is a very well made and captivating film. Highly recommended.
