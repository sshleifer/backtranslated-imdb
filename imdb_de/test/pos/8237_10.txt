It is well known that Irene Dunne could sing more than a little bit. And I think that her talent as a comedienne can only really be understood when you have struggled with a sonata by Haydn or a song by Debussy and made a success of it. Her instrument is her voice and her handling is pure musicality. She could tackle any part. The only thing she could not do was not succeed. This movie is a perfect example. In it she channels Ruth Gordon (because the game is the thing), is feminine, charming, stubborn, selfish, generous, protective and combative, but never overbearing. She manages to remain as credible as Alexander Knox in another difficult role he occupies with sovereignty. The viewer believes in what he sees and takes care of it. It's refreshing to see a movie that's both entertaining and intellectually sophisticated, with all the right patriotic buttons on it. I sincerely hope that the entire Dunne work will eventually make it to DVD because it's really hard to keep such a secret among just a few insiders.
