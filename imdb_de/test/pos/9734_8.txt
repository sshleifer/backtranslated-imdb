Six Shooter, Tunnel Sergeant, Dr. Death, Pinhead, Cyclops, and Blade help young Andre Toulon turn off Sutek's Egyption henchman in the best sequel in the series. Retro Puppet Master is atmospherically many sets, high quality drama and some funny puppet effects. What he lacks in the blood makes up for it with an interesting, well-made story. <br /> <br /> Best quote: dr. Death: "Do not you know, my friends, smell the sulfur, see the smoke ..." <br /> <br /> This is by far the best Dave DeCoteau movie I've ever seen. The actors do a more than credible job: Jack Donner as "Azfel" presents himself in an inspired performance, and the young Toulon is good with the puppets. Oh, and the ring needle is cool. <br /> <br /> John Massari's score is a symphonic interpretation of the original Puppet Master pieces by Richard Band, which make the movie playful and sinister. It's rare for a Full Moon score to actually add anything to a movie, and it does. Unfortunately, Dave Allen was not affordable enough for band and Co. in the late '90s and beyond, so the entire puppet action is done with staff and cord. There is no stop-motion, like the famous and funny scene in the original, where Pinhead searches for his pinhead. And as with all full moon fares of that time, RPM was filmed in and around Castel Studios in Bucharest, and most of the parts were cast by Romanians: hearing the "Parisian" accents was a bit annoying. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is probably one of the ten best Full Moon movies. It is certainly the most inventive of the Puppet Master sequels.
