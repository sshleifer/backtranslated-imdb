A beautiful, magical, thought-provoking and heartwarming story. Excellent direction, perfect cast, wonderful script, excellent score, beautifully lit ...... Do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> If you love movies that will not only make you think, but also warm your heart (some This spring, 'Contact', 'Field of Dreams' and 'Groundhog Day' are meant). Then you will love K-PAX for sure. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
