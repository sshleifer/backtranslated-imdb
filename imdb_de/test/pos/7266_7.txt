A very worth seeing movie that was eagerly awaited after seeing the trailer several times. <br /> <br /> The whole thing looks great, from the ridiculous efforts of the worn out upper class to distance themselves from mediocrity. The film, which only tries to keep its head above the dirt, captures the spirit of the 18th century in a brilliant way. Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean very well, though the role does not stretch him out, and Robert Carlyle seems to be a bit wasted on Plunkett, Miller's street mate. The real star of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr. Chance (a kind of police chief of 1740) with a bad guy that has highlighted him from the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> A great movie, and who likes the color and style of Peter Greenaway's films, will love the look of this movie, even if the plot gets thin before the 2 hours have passed. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit.
