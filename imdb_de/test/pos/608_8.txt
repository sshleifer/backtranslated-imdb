Naruse is usually regarded as one of the three founders of Japanese film. The other two are Ozu and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest film about the life of retired geishas. What happens when a woman ages and loses her charm and mystique? Well, for those who are interested in watching this movie. One: Okin, successful as a financier, but the other two have to borrow from her and are annoying. Okin has no children, but the others do. Okin learns that her old love is coming to visit her and is excited. Naruse masters subtle studies of the characters of his female protagonists. Finally, Bangiku draws the viewer into the study of questions of one's own happiness and one's own life value. Very good movie.
