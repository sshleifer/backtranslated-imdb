This is an incredible movie that starts slowly. It takes you further, if you think of it as a typical maudlines family drama. Then, in the second half, there is a twist that transforms this action into a profound, global-scale story. <br /> <br /> If you have not got used to films from India, with vocal and dance routines that seem to work, no reason to stay with this movie. Especially from the second half, this movie will be an amazing experience. <br /> <br /> *********** Minor Spoiler Here ************ * I only have a complaint with the movie. The dialogue at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to use the war as a force that changes people's lives. It was implied all the time, but it should have something to do with the importance of fighting for MDS.
