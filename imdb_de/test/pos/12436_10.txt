This movie was filmed thirteen years before I was born, but I still think this is the funniest, shabbiest, and most harmless piece ever made. It can not go wrong with the cast of great British character actors. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? Alastair Sim-incomparable; Margaret Rutherford-dito, the wonderfully accomplished, innocent Gossage played to perfection by the imperious Joyce Grenfell. The caddish Victor Hyde-Brown (a specialist of Guy Middleton) and the rest of the staff summarize the post-war England at a discount. <br /> <br /> The humor is sometimes obvious, but that's also the case of "Ealing" specialty and is never offensive. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie more often than I remember, and still laugh like a drain on the antics. The storming of the dorm rooms of the girls' school, the splendidly planned but ultimately doomed double tours of the school and the chaotic ending that comes with the arrival of a third school to anarchy are priceless. <br /> <br /> I know it's an old clich√©, but they really do not make it that way anymore. How I wish they had done it. If you have not seen it yet, you will not be disappointed.
