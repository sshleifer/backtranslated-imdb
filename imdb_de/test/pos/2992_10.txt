I loved this movie! OH MY GOD! This movie rocked so hard! I found it under some old cassettes and did not know what it was, and after reading the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say (which incidentally mentioned the fact that Elton John was the soundtrack for the song) Film provided more than it was mentioned, what the movie was about.) I found it interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older movie. <br /> <br /> "What controversy?" I thought to myself, as I put the tape in the player, I was curious. And my expectations were certainly fulfilled. I loved it! I think it's a really girlish movie, but it was so cute and adorable! It was a beautiful romance, though the director sometimes reminded me of the camera work in 'The Graduate', which I thought the director had to look at with a few close-ups when he saw them /> <br /> OK, so it was not completely imaginable that these two kids would run away and live alone ... but it could happen ... in a fantasy ... <br /> <br /> But the end just hit me honest! I was so mad at how they stopped it ... it somehow hangs you, and I think they may talk to you about what's actually going on in the sequel ... but at the same time, I'm almost reluctant to see that, since sequels almost never are as good as the first ones. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie to anyone who is at least 16 years old! It's a fantastic movie ... great!
