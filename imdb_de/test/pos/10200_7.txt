This Western was established in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines, which were relocated by Western Union. While the nice guy Dean Jagger (with lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo it for his own selfish reasons. So it's up to Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the better 1940s Westerns I've ever seen, and it nearly got an 8 - that was so good. For my life, however, I have no idea why Fritz Lang had this film as a director - after all, he knew nothing about Western. His strength was drama - and I think this movie is a kind of drama - especially in the Old West. Strange, yes, but it all seemed fine, though I wonder how this great German director felt when he got this job. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is extraordinary - with vivid colors, great shooting and very good acting. As usual, Randolph Scott gave another relaxed and realistic performance. However, I was surprised when Robert Young was also cast in the film, but it was a good casting decision - he was supposed to be a Harvard trained Easterner. When I saw Barton MacLane in the movie, I had pretty much assumed he would be the "bad guy," and my thoughts were well founded, since he made a fool of a career! As far as the script was concerned, it seemed mostly normal, but the last showdown between Scott and Barton MacLane was a lot better than I had hoped - the movie ended on a very high note.
