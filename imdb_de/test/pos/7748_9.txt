I found this movie pretty good. It was at three o'clock in the morning on TCM (Turner Classic Movies), and his unusual humor stopped me until five o'clock. Kelly plays a wonderful role in this role, especially with the grandma (whose joke almost made me laugh). The lead actress was fine, but the father kept his character isolated from the marriage conflict and did not let go of the humor. If you like a good offbeat older movie, I would recommend it. Unlike the other comment, I like Gene Kelly. He was the perfect lead actor for many of the early musicals and I think in this role he radiates his charisma. One downside is that the dance scenes get a bit lengthy, but if you go through them, you're in the clear.
