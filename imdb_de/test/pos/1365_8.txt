Golden Boy is ecchi humor (bordering on hentai) in the guise of "education moments". The main character, Kintaro, wanders around to face the stupidest situations with women ... It's just that he's shy on the surface, but analyzes everything until he can learn something about it. The most striking feature of the series are the circumstances of its "training", which are absolutely embarrassing and fun at the same time.
