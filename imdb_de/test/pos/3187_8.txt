I'm trying to buy a DVD / VHS copy of the movie somewhere, "Is not it shocking?" I was 7 years old when I saw this movie and I lived in the city where it was filmed. A few items from my family were used in the movie as props, and some of my friend's homes were used in some scenes. The shooting was pretty good in the city and the surrounding community. Originally, I only saw the movie once, and I would like to get a copy of it so I can show the movie to my family. I did extensive online searches without luck and wondered if anyone could have an idea to get a copy of this movie.
