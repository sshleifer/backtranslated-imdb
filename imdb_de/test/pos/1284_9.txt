Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspirational author who has not published anything yet. Bill also has a strange and strange habit, he likes to follow people. <br /> <br /> Bill looks for a stranger in the street, on the subway or in the subway and follows them as if he were her shadow. Maybe Bill does that to inspire himself, to write the great novel he dreamed of, or to print an article about his work in a large magazine? Maybe it's because it serves Bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by paying attention to him or her? Or is there perhaps someone who cares for Bill and cares for him and is responsible for it? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone: If you follow him to his home or workplace, stop. <br /> <br /> One day, Bill Cobb follows Alex Haw home, and instead of following his stop rule, he still follows Cobb. Bill will soon realize how right he was to the rule he had taken to follow people, and how wrong he was by breaking it. <br /> <br /> Amazingly good low budget movie by Christopher Noland from 1998, before he played a major role in cult film with his groundbreaking and original movie classic "Momento," which established itself two years later in Hollywood , <br /> <br /> "Follow" is actually a much better movie than "Momento" because it's a conventional and easy-to-follow story. Compared to "Momento's" that was confusing at first and then, when you realize what the movie tells you in its back story, it's very complicated. What makes "consequences" so much better is just because it's simple, but at the same time clever in its impact on those who watch it. The movie is much more direct and devastating, and you do not have to see it again and again to know exactly what it wanted, like "Momento" did. "Following" is a story within a story with one of the most surprising and easily manipulated endpoints as you review the movie and notice the clues you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> With an unbelievably small budget of $ 6,000.00, that's less than what most Hollywood movies claim for coffee breaks, with a no-name cast in black and white and just over an hour , 71 minutes. Hollywood as well as the film industry outside of Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland, as one who has no more than talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can not. Make a smart, yet penetrating film with virtually no money and no big name.
