This is a beautifully made film that balances the fragile human stories (both before and after 1945) and the indiscriminate fight against war. The use of outtakes from the Battle of Britain (a movie that does not look nearly as good in the '40s!) Does not improve or complicate the whole thing. A deeply impressive work that has been in my memory for the past two years, and I just bought it to explore the making-of-extras. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Like "Aces High," it switches between exciting (or spooky) aerial combat sequences in which the viewer actually experiences a loss of characters that he would be interested in, as well as unpredictable local interactions, where skilled writers and real life experiences inform some involved and moving events. This is also underlined by the fact that 1945 meant for many people not only the end of a conflict, but also the beginning of another conflict, and even today we still do not recognize, or even worship, the loss, bravery, and sacrifice of so many unnamed heroes Remotely, without admitting them as human beings with all the emotional weaknesses associated with it - and make your victims all the more valiant. <br /> <br /> As you watch this movie, you will rise from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy and back to love, which will last beyond death. If all war films were like that, we would never have to fight again. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that it is worth to see? ;-) <br /> <br /> 10/10
