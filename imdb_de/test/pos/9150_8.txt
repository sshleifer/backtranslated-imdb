Fran√ßois Villon was a real poet and villain who lived in Paris in the 15th century. However, most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually fiction - one piece created at the beginning of the 20th century. While meeting Louis XI and making friends with him in the film, he died in his thirties and was never involved in all the intrigue he was in that movie. In fact, he wrote some beautiful verses and was often on the wrong side of the law - not the combination of patriot and Robin Hood-like character, as he is in the movie. Assuming you know that the movie is almost 100% fiction, it's worth a visit - but do not assume it's a good history lesson. In The BELOVED ROGUE Villon is played with wild effort John Barrymore. I was also quite excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto, the brave dwarf, has played in countless films over the years and has had a very long career. Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to movies. Mack Swain is known in many short films by Chaplin as a silent movie and played in THE GOLD RUSH. All four men have done a good job and have no complaints - even with Barrymore's rather exaggerated treatment, more reminiscent of Douglas Fairbanks performance. However, the performance with which I had a serious problem was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. To call this "indeterminate" would be a gross understatement. He played the role as a high school student who believed the stereotyped Richard III. To be, who scolded and behaved like a demonic caricature. Veidt was wonderful in many, many films (both mute and toneless), but here he is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, it is full of lustful adventure and action - like a washed-out movie without the sailing ships. The sets worked well as they were used the previous year for THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. Both films were played during the same period. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the last great silent films. There's a lot to like and the movie is a nice combination of romance, comedy and action. Worth seeing though it loses some points for Veidt's transcription as well as the way the movie plays fast and easy with the story. By the way, this movie was also made twice as often as IF I WERE KING (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are closest to the original piece. In total, six films dealt with Villon and tell more or less variations of the same story!
