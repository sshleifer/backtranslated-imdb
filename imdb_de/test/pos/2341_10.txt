A really accurate and unglamorous insight into modern day life. It could be set in any city in the UK. <br /> <br /> I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can relate very well to this film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the situations and characters are all too realistic, but unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The actors are incredibly believable, I felt like spying on my neighbors. It was an intimate introduction to the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes. <br /> <br /> I loved the way this movie was made. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a must.
