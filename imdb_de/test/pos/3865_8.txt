No, I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest critic for Entertainment Weekly and gave this film positive marks. And who can accuse him? This is a charming, upbeat and funny Disney movie. Who does not love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody wants to be a cat. It makes me want to grab my fingers or something. Only a few years later, when Cats Do not Dance came out, I saw a movie that was so musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story is what makes it so special. In addition, everything moves at a relaxed pace, and even the villain is not so scary. It's perfect for the younger set, though it's not so juicy that adults do not like it. If Snoop were here, he would surely say the same thing. Yes. Dig these crazy cats, man.
