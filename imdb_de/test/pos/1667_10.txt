To make a job like this caper in Rififi (like The Score and his opinion), you have to have nerves of steel. He claims and orders it. Jules Dassin is the champion. <br /> <br /> I was consistently at the edge of my seat. It deserves to be better known, even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954, it is believed that the director was blacklisted in the hypocritical Hollywood of his time. I would recommend this movie for anyone who does not have the pleasure of seeing him. I can not give him enough stars.
