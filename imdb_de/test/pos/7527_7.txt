And so was born the loveliest skunk that ever graced the canvas. While the plot paints an abused cat who paints like a skunk and accidentally wears Pepe Le Pew (called Henry here), Pepe steals the show. No doubt, Chuck Jones realized that this love-seeking member of the genus Mephitis had the certain something to be a star himself, and so he put Pepe in "For Scent-imental Reasons" four years later, which made PLP sustainably established presence Screens everywhere. <br /> <br /> Although "Odour-Able Kitty" may otherwise be a placeholder, I try to imagine seeing it for the first time in 1945. Could anyone suspect that this is supported Character would soon switch to the ranks of Bugs, Daffy, Porky and the rest? No matter if someone did it or not, Pepe is still one of the most likable characters. C'est l'amour!
