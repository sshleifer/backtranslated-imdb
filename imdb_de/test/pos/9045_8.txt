It can not be 10 out of 10, but for me the jokes did not fail. I've seen it many times when I was younger and back on DVD, I think, and I laughed every time. The humor is simple and fun. This movie was just one of many little engravings that Disney threw out. I found the places where people outside the invisible loop saw people invisible. The expressions were invaluable. Great movie. If the opportunity arises to ever see this, I recommend it for a good modeling. My favorite character in the entire Dexter series would definitely be Dean Higgins. I love his voice. To hear how excited he was, especially because he saw his facial expression in the end, was hysterical for me.
