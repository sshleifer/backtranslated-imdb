This movie surprised me. The box is misleading, the slogan is misleading and the costumes and tone of the movie are misleading. The movie is pretty bloody, well played and beautifully filmed. The special effects are first-rate and seem to be ahead of their time until you realize that this movie came out in 1979 and not 1963, as it says in the tone. It is a unique version of Dr. Ing. Moreau story and one of the better versions. The first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the movie never really falls apart. Definitely worth watching if you're a fan of dramatic costume / horror classics and Gore festivals.
