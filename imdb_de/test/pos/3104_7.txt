I have this film in a collection of inexpensive B-movies. It has not been restored, in fact the sound was hard to discern in the first few minutes. <br /> <br /> At first he looked like a typical haunted house movie and feels very much like the precursor of Clue, Murder, of Death, House on Haunted Hill, and so on. <br /> <br /> About half an hour into the In the film, the plot takes a really interesting turn - and it turns the clich√© melodrama into something completely different and far more entertaining than I initially thought. Try it, it's a lot of fun, though the long clips and the wider settings (and almost the lack of music) make it a bit creaky today's standards.
