What a journey into the past. <br /> <br /> Do not look for great acting, credible action or something that resembles a quality movie. <br /> <br /> This is pure blaxploitation at its best. Outrageous outfits, unrepeatable dialogues, objectification of women and the most sloppy cop imaginable. This vanity piece by the "Godfather of Rap," Rudy Ray Moore, who left us last week, is the standard against which all blaxploitation is measured. <br /> <br /> Not only do you see Blaxploitation at its finest, but you also get insights into his comedy genius and see why his records were kept under the counter.
