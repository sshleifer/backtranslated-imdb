This is the latest Ghibli movie and it is also an important departure from the studio's established style. First, this film was obviously aimed at young children, much more than any of their previous films. It lacks the depth of the other films and offers a completely new, less realistic animation style. and yet it is always so entertaining. Although there is nothing that attracts adults, it still pulls me onto the screen and delves into the story. The secret of the film is brutal honesty about the plot and the characters. The story and the characters are very close to their feelings / intentions, etc., but that makes them all the more endearing. Special attention has also been paid to the soundtrack, which is absolutely amazing, although it differs significantly from earlier Ghibli soundtracks. I always sing the cute title song and everyone who sees this movie!
