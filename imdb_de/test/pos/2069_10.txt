I've looked at every version of this piece I can think of, including several on stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> He has the most wonderful voice for stage acting, and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions in this piece. The way he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through insanity. He (as Hamlet) can be affectionate, gentle and gentle in one instant and rage against the hell that is his life in another. You think he's in pain, you think he's angry, you think he's not a little crazy. They think he is Hamlet. Of course part of the gratitude goes to Shakespeare, of course :) but without a great actor putting the words on the stage, it does not really matter how well a piece is written. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, be sure to see this version. If you do not like Shakespeare, be sure to see this version. If you do, you will get a new appreciation for Shakespeare. The nuanced performance Sir Derek gives you will make you breathless.
