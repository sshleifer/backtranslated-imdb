I've always been a fan of the show, so I admit I'm biased. When the show ended, I felt that too many questions went unanswered. This movie felt like a graduation to me. It was very rewarding to see all the people I had seen together in the last few years. I understand that this is probably the only homicide movie we can expect. If so, this is the way to go out. This film is sometimes poignant, sometimes disturbing, but always satisfying. If you are or were a fan of the show, watch this movie.
