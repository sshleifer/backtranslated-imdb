"Medusa: Dare to Truthful" is a hilarious parody that is an excellent companion to the original: "Madonna: Truth or Dare". Julie Brown's brilliant creation spins Madonna's hugely entertaining documentary (though it's not daring, enlightening, open or honest), with attention to detail and packaging. I recommend it to Madonna fans, Julie Brown fans or anyone who likes sharp and clever parody.
