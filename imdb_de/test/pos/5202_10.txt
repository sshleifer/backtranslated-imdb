A movie like this does not happen often. I am surprised that it took 9 years to finally see it. Politicians and civil hawks should look at this before making decisions about how to destroy people's lives. I saw this the day after the TV version of "Uprising" about the Warsaw Ghetto. Despite this fresh spirit, I felt sorry for the German soldier. I felt sorry for all parties that this tragedy could happen. It will take a while for this to thaw. I'm surprised they did not make a movie based on "The Forgotten Soldier" by Buy Sajer. This movie shares the cold with the book. Both will persecute me for the rest of my life.
