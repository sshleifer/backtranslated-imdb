This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's scary. You will probably jump in some places and for some of them scratch your head to find out. Her secret is being solved by the main character Eve and her psychotic college project in a lunatic asylum, Don. He needs her to look for clues to justify his mother's assassination. When Eve agrees to help, she opens Pandora's box and opens some very strange things, including Malachi. I will not enter Maleachi, but I thought the way it was going was totally awesome. I know that movie lovers will not look at this movie in the same way as other classics, since there is no one who is very famous (Angelina Jolie's brother was excellent, but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face that way). Film might get some recognition), but I think the way Malachi's end works is something to talk about. I have recommended this to my friends, definitely worth the purchase or rental price.
