In Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's "Strangers On A Train," Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of ​​performing two murders. The more obtrusive Anthony suggests that he could murder Haines unfaithful wife and murder Haines Antonia's domineering father. The absence of any connection between the killer and the victim in any case should ensure that both offenses remain unresolved. The tenor of the conversation leaves the easier Haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious. Complications arise later when Anthony murders Haines wife in an amusement park and then pursues Haines to keep his side of the deal. <br /> <br /> The differences between the two men are clear from the beginning. Haines is a professional tennis player, respectable and modest about his achievements, while Anthony's life goes nowhere and he admits being thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling. Haines is in a relationship with a Senator daughter he wants to marry. Anthony interprets this characteristically as a cynical maneuver by Haines to give himself an acronym for a career. The character differences are also visually enhanced. Anthony often lives in shadowy areas and travels in a boat called "Pluto", while Haines is often viewed from the more heroic perspective offered by low camera angles. <br /> <br /> There are some eye-catching visual sequences like: - <br /> <br /> (1) The murder of Haines woman, who is shown by the reflection of her glasses falling to the ground as she therefore struggling to get rid of Anthony. <br /> <br /> (2) The image of Anthony alone, dressed in black and very small against the huge white building of the Jefferson Memorial. (3) The opportunity for all spectators to move their heads during a tennis match following the action of the action, while a head (Anthony) remains cool in a position looking at Haines. <br /> <br /> (4) The scene where the roundabout gets wild out of control and finally crashes spectacularly. <br /> <br /> Throughout history, "doubles" are often used, for example, Haines and Anthony are originally introduced as 2-p feet of feet get off their taxis and go to the train. When the train exits the station, there are two track groups, each offering two ways forward. The two men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order two double whiskeys. The Hitchcock cameo watches him fighting a double bass on board the train. Haines feels doubly crossed when his wife refuses a contract she has met for a lawyer to divorce. Haines' wife goes to the amusement park with two friends. When Anthony confronts them before the murder, he lights his lighter and creates two reflexes in the glasses. Anthony later gets very worried when he meets the senator's younger daughter, whom he sees as a double for Haines wife. Anthony also feels doubly crossed when Haines refuses to perform the second murder. When Haines rides alone on a train going to Metcalf, he sees two men in the same coach accidentally stepping on their feet in the same way he and Anthony do. <br /> <br /> The action throughout the film continues at a fast pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as the Senator's younger daughter) are particularly powerful.
