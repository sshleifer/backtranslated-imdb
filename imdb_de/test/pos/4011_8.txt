I often saw this show when I was grown up. When I think about it, I can remember it quite well. If you ask me, it was a pretty good show. When I think about it, I can not remember the opening sequence and the title song. In addition, all were ideally staffed. The writing was very strong too. The services were also first class. I hope a network brings it back so I can see every episode. Before I summarize, I would like to say that I will always remember this show, though I'm not sure I've seen every episode. Well, in the end, if a network ever returns it, I hope you catch it one day before it finally blows up.
