The debut taken from the darkness by one of the brighter stars of contemporary Noir is a sure, albeit limited, trick into the game and the obsession. Turned out to zero money, Nolan could not have given the missing funds a better subject than the dreary and devious underside of London could choose to do his trade. This short time (67 minutes) is best when playing with the expectations of the audience and the protagonist over who cheats whom, though the initial set-up sounds some alarm bells in the credibility section. The muddy cinematography (he frequently used natural light because of the budget) can usually be drawn up to the stylization of the Noir, even if the restrictions occasionally occur. Many of the same topics, such as blurred identity and expectations, are recurrent in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA. Not a masterpiece, but good and certainly worth a look for modern Noir and Nolan fans.
