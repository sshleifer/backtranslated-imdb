A fascinating behind-the-scenes look at how to make a really good movie when producers, directors and performers simply "refuse". These guys had encountered some serious obstacles during the two years of the project (low budget, script issues, and the scriptwriter), so the finished product was not what was expected first, but was probably more interesting than the movie They were ready to do what shows that the punk mentality of "Just do it" ... with or without backing, money or help ... works on the fly and does what you want. I really enjoyed this documentary and I know that viewers will see and learn things they did not know before. This movie is really "unique" ... it's hard to classify because it has pieces of "sci-fi" and "suspense" and also "how to make a movie". He tells the truth about how movies are made, what can go wrong and how to overcome them, especially I liked the music Ed Ivey wrote: These guys know how to make a good movie on a string because they do Being creative and building props, dollys, staging, lighting with whatever they can find ... pretty amazing stuff.
