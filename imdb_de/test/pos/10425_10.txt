I do not know which movie or version Jeff saw, but the whole movie was great, not just Poitier and Going. The story was exciting, exciting and captivating. And for the guy who complains about historical accuracy, you become real. Yes, there were some black deputies in Indian territory, but they had no authority to arrest whites outside the Indian territory. As a rule, they did not "patrol", but only train criminals. I found it strange that Corby did not seem to have "Indian friends." I know that their numbers were lower, but it still seems strange to me. Even as Corby returns to his people, his Indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless.
