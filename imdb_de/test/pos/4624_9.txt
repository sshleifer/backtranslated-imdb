2:37 is an intense and intriguing drama, similar in sound and subject to films like Bully, Elephant and Kids (although 2:37 in my opinion is superior to these three films). Before you look at it My expectations were neutral, but in the end I made a very good impression, thanks to the intelligent script, the perfect alignment of Murali K. Thalluri and the excellent performances of a group of young actors. <br /> <br /> The Sporadic Cases School violence around the world has inspired many films, television programs and books that purport to find and predict the outer or inner causes of these unbridled expressions of rebellion, dissatisfaction and especially insanity. Some people say that 2:37 is late for this artistic movement; However, I do not think so because this delay allowed the film to perform a more artistic analysis, focusing on the situation with more subtle and intelligent intelligence rather than the apparent reaction of cruelty and distress that impregnated other films with similar stories / > <br /> The characters from 2:37 am are clich√©s from youth cinema (from director and screenwriter John Hughes-RIP's films to teen horror films): the beautiful "princess", the awkwardness "nerd", the antipathic athletes, etc. It would have been very easy to turn them into hollow caricatures defined by their function in the script; However, it is somewhat admirable that the script transcends stereotypes to make them real people with credible issues that more or less anyone can find on their way to maturity. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is an excellent movie whose only failure is that the ending feels a little bit affected, but it is compensated by many positive elements. It will be very interesting to see Thalluri's next projects as he had a great debut with this film.
