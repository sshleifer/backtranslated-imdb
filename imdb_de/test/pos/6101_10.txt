*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Wow, what a predicament Joanna is in. After she accidentally ran over a small child, she calls for help, only to return in the midst of a group to the scene of very angry spectators. Understandably, that's too much for her, and she escapes from the scene. Fortunately, the child did not die but was seriously injured and is in a coma. So the biggest fight begins in Joanna's life: Should she remain silent or speak out? At first she does not, but eventually she realizes that it is torture to live with such a terrible secret. At some point, she even joins a search party to find the culprit. And gradually a detective begins questioning the behavior of this woman. She wants to tell the truth, and she never wanted to flee the scene, but is it worth the whole city hating you for it? <br /> <br /> The thing about this movie is that it's you. Do not choose pages. Joanna is a good role model, even if she made wrong decisions. You feel for her, even though you know that what she did was wrong. Your journey is a good representation of what a person would go through if something like this happened to them. Margaret Colin is an absolutely brilliant actress. She was fantastic on the television show Now and Again and great in movies like Independence Day and The Devil's Own. Her performance here is so realistic and informal that she carries us through the entire movie alone. In the end, I wanted to see more of her. Lisa Vidal also did a good supportive job as a gentle, resourceful detective. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, if you want to watch a movie that makes you think for a long time, one that will say, "That's the reality," you do not want to miss it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
