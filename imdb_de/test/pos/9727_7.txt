Apparently a B-movie ... B needs to stand for better action and a better message than we get today in big A-budget images. Modern films directed at young women are certainly not meant to promote the depth of character over flat, selfish behavior ... or to increase the self-esteem of young girls who do not adhere to "female" standards. (After all, as in this film, it will criticize counterfeiting and abnormalities, not helping to sell more products that are dependent on girls * not * being satisfied with their natural qualities or their inner beauty.) <Br / > <br /> Laraine The day is adorable as a mechanically inclined tomboy that "catches" in spaces and confesses the inability to flirt. She joins Robert Cummings with similar interests, a common sense of humor, and her honesty, loyalty, and good friendship, which he gradually appreciates over the superficial "charms" of her selfish glamor-girl sister (who only produces his daughter) own selfish, reckless playboy tendencies). <br /> <br /> Although Laraine is also outwardly beautiful, it is refreshing to appreciate the inner beauty more and the representation of true friendship that leads to a fulfilling romantic relationship. I wish young girls (and boys) got this grassroots message today. <br /> <br /> Maybe when Hollywood is shooting "B" movies again, with modest budgets and trying to be content with modest profits ... what am I saying? Sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to do something righteous on a smaller scale would be like expecting a man to give up the shallow sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares about him. This is crazy conversation. <br /> <br /> Please, someone already invents a time machine! I'm from 1940. <br /> <br /> I'd rate this movie higher, but the ending is a bit too abrupt, and perhaps there was a lack of sufficient evidence to change the heart of Robert Cummings. (I like the fact that B - movies are short and snappy, not bloated and selfish, but this movie might have needed more than 70 minutes.) Also, it was somewhat unrealistic for a widow and young children to be so untouched by a movie stay abrupt death in their family ... or so to forgive the one who caused it I mean, I think it's * nice * but a little more grief or bitterness would have been natural. Perhaps a deliberate decision to be carefree in behaving this family because of their loss, to lessen the impact of the tragedy, and to ensure that we forgive those involved in death - since it's just a plotter anyway, not the point of the movie itself. Still weird.
