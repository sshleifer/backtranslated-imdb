What is bear paw, elephant's trunk or monkey brain for dinner? Let Tsui Hark tell you about the art of cooking the traditional (?) Chinese art in this wonderful and lighthearted comedy. <br /> <br /> This film shares the common structure of an American sports movie, but does not focus on baseball. Cooking is the focus, which makes it all the more interesting. I even think that Leslie Cheung's character in the Major League looks a lot like Charlie Sheen ... <br /> <br /> This film also contains a bit of Zhao Wen Zhao vs Xiong Xin Xin (you're welcome to see more of them) The Blade) and a pretty funny joke about a Leon Lai pop song ... <br /> <br /> Maybe not the ideal movie for the vegan.
