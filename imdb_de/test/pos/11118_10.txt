This film tells the story of nine ambitious teenagers trying to pursue their dream at the notorious New York High School of Performing Arts: Coco, the singer Bruno, the modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hilary, the dancer Ralph, the comedian, and Doris and Montgomery, the actors. They all think they have what it takes to truly achieve their goals, but they need much more than their talent. They have to deal with rejection, heartache, education, pain and love to achieve their glory. "Fame" is one of the most entertaining, classic and inspirational films of all time. It has everything a teen drama / musical should have: extremely catchy, entertaining songs played by the amazing Irene Cara, breathtaking dance numbers, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in the characters, and a great story, including the heartbreaking scene when Coco hits the video camera. <br /> <br /> As I said, the cast is fantastic. Irene Cara can really act, and not only her vocals make her shine here as Coco. Lee Curreri is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller brings Ralph a lot of humor. Maureen Teefy is great as the expelled Doris, and if you look closely, you'll see Paul McCrane of "ER" as Montgomery. <br /> <br /> This is really an amazing movie. "Fame" really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer. Every film that moves me like that is a winner in my book. Something you must have seen! The movie really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.
