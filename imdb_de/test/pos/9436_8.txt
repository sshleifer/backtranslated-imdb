Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) begins this story disguised and helps to smuggle the famous physicist "Dr. Franz Tobel" (William Post) from Switzeralnad and under the watchful eye of the Nazis who want to have his bomb sight plans. The Allies obviously want it too and Sherlock is there to help. Dr. Tobel invented an instrument that significantly improves the accuracy of aerial bombardment. <br /> <br /> Holmes and dr. Tobel arrive safely on Baker Street, but the scientist would rather be alone for mysterious reasons, though he had promised the English to help them, not the Germans. He remains true to this promise, but there are some desperate moments for Holmes and the English. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining movie and one in which our famous detective uses not just one but three different disguises. He needs all the help he can get when he goes against his archrival Professor Moriarity. A complaint: If Moriarity were that evil, he would have renounced Holmes without batting an eyelid, instead of giving him openings to flee. It's also pretty sad when the usual fool Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) has to save his boss from certain death a few times! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some credibility issues in this story But if you can put your brain on ice a couple of times, it's a funny movie you can watch ... and thanks to great restoration work This DVD looks beautiful. The old print comes alive with wonderful pictures, especially at night shots. <br /> <br /> Another note: Those who did the English subtitles here have mis-spelled or misinterpreted at least half a dozen words. It's a very sloppy job and not the first time I saw the whole series on the restored DVD set.
