Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I've seen in a long time. It has an original script, a talented cast, and delivers an hour and a half of pure, unadulterated fun. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby "B" (Justin Long), who is not. In one of the collages he applied, he accepted, leaving him to the disappointment of his parents to avoid creating a fictional collage. In an attempt to completely deceive his parents, he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric clinic into a school. Everything runs smoothly until many other "accepted" students show up at their doorstep. Now he and his friend have to find out the collage thing not only for themselves, but also for the others. <br /> <br /> Justin Long as Lead Man is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as he can be The accompanying acts are outstanding - Jonah Hill as Sherman Schrader, Columbus Short as Hands, Maria Thayer as Rory, Adam Herschman as Glen and Lewis Black as Uncle Ben. <br /> <br /> The humor is fresh and simple and most importantly funny, from the beginning until after the credits. The plot develops so easily that when you stop laughing at the last joke, you begin to giggle with the next one. Along with all the fun, the movie is a very common topic, namely collage making. If the students in the film are usually united against the school government, they are united in this case by the common desire to go to school and learn. <br /> <br /> However, the movie does not call all other schools wrong, it just shows that there is another way. They say what they say "If there is a will, there is a way, and sometimes the children know better what they need than their parents. <br /> <br /> This film is an inevitable little story about the great Possibilities packed in life in the best format.
