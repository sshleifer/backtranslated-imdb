Our Toronto reviewer told you what you need to know about this movie (except for the fact that it has to be edited - the handheld technology is getting really old, very fast). I saw this movie last night in Menerbes, France - we are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered with vineyards and, of course, winemakers. They were all there in the Salle de Polyvalente to present themselves. Polite, patient, brilliant. My French is crazy, but I got to the core of the film, but found that the audience loved the "old" terrorists interviewed. from a communist village in Languedoc. He laughed a lot. This is unusual in France - loud laughter. It is not a question on which side of the terror-globalization war they are! SM
