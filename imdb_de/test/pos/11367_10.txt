It was so long ago (1960), but I have never forgotten this series and often wished that it would reappear. I was so thrilled that I corresponded with Mr. Rathbun, then President of Standard Oil, who sponsored the presentation on PBS. He sent me a photo of the tapestry (actually a coal rendering) behind the credits. <br /> <br /> For the opening music of Bayco's "Elizabethan Masque," my family and I gathered to drink our black and white TV in Shakespeare's words, as it did by a group of outstanding but relatively unknown players (at least the American audience at that time) was spoken. <br /> <br /> We were introduced to actors like Sean Connery, Dame Judi Dench and Tom Flamen, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. I have enjoyed their achievements ever since. One of the most interesting things was the way in which actors continue to age in their respective roles, while Shakespeare's "King" games may have been presented in chronological order for the first time. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell these actors exactly how much this series meant to me. <br /> <br /> If "Age of Kings" could be revived on VHS and / or DVD, it would appeal to those of us who would like to see it again and those who missed it the first time. <br /> <br /> GOOD NEWS! PBS has just released a DVD of "A Age of Kings"! SEE YOUR CATALOG IN JULY 2009, PAGE 19, OR CALL IT FREE. I just ordered!
