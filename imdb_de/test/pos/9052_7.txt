Hey, it's great not to have to wait for the next Star Trek convention to see Hick Trek! It's a cheesy movie about a bunch of treckies without budget, but a great way to spend an hour. They had the most special effects right, the dialogue is a classic trek and it just feels right for a trek knockoff.
