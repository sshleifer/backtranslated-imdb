As a passionate lover of all Egyptian things, this is a classic from the '50s, along with my other darling, Land of the Pharaohs. "The sets and colors are just wonderful and everything looks" neat "in production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well staffed and Peter Ustinov is a real gem! The overall look of the movie (along with others from this era) has a charm that you just can not get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have not done that yet) Watch the movie " The Mummy 1999 ", but I'm sure I'll love it!). <br /> <br /> Top stuff!
