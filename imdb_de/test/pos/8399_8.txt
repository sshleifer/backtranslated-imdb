I have both read and seen Gone With The Wind and found it very difficult not to compare this movie to the original. Although I thought Scarlett, the novel, is great, the movie has not made a difference. It was a completely different story. Of course, there will never be another Scarlett and Rhett except Leigh and Gable, but the new actors have done a good job. I loved the way book and movie summarized the story of Gon With the Wind, because after I read it, I felt disappointed because it just stopped and the readers wondered what happened. Scarlett ends the story very well and Alexandra Ripley made the book great. I just wish the movie would follow the story more, even though it's great in itself.
