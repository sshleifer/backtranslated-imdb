Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is how smart the script is. It's not your average comedy show. There is no break after a joke that keeps it simple, if you missed it you missed it. And it's not like a soap opera drama because it uses no dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid, cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the best shows on TV shows of their time. It's fun because they talk so fast that you can not get everything the first time. It's nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes. They also have so many references, it's amazing how smart it is. <br /> <br /> And you can relate to the characters, even their real and local actors are great, from the funny Lorelai to the hermit Luke to the immature Kirk the Show is just amazing. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend some time with their family, this is definitely the show for them. There is only one word that Gilmore Girls can describe .... CLASSIC !!!!!!
