I know what most people will think about this movie without having seen it ... "The typical movie of a famous singer ... It's going to be a pink movie, a teenage movie, it's going to be stupid ..." and So, So ... And yes, it's ... I mean, it's a pink movie ... But do you know something? ... I loved it. Seriously ... It's a very romantic movie ... I think every girl in this world dreamed of something like the act of 'pop star' ... He met his favorite singer, know him as a person ... and even have a romance with him ... or? ^^ I really enjoyed seeing this ... Besides, it's really funny ... <br /> <br /> I think the actors did a great job ... There are many loving characters .. And, Aaron Carter (JD) is not the exception ... To be honest, I thought in the first five minutes that he would be terrible ... But then he really surprised me ... <br /> <br /> Also, I have to say that the music performances in the movie are great! I especially loved the role when JD (Aaron) sings without music (only with a guitar) a very nice song ... This guy is really talented ... Time will tell ... <br /> <br /> My advice to you? ... Do you see it! Do not make any prejudices ;-)
