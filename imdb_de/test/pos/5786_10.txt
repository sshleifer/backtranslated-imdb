I own a video library with hundreds of documentaries. I have seen many of them and love the great information out there. Only a handful even gets as close to information as important as this one. I have read the reviews of other people in this film and can not help but notice that the most important things that people criticize are irrelevant. Like "It's very one-sided". Such a pathetic criticism, everywhere in the society you are looking at, you will see the other side, and if you still need help, go to globalpublicmedia.com. "It's always the same people." One might think that these people are the experts. Maybe they are the best people to interview. "Film style is always the same, head shots with a few exceptions" If you want to flash and dazzle, look at Micheal Moore if you want to see real documents like these. As you can see clearly, none of these complaints has relevance to the information contained. My guess is that these people just miss the point and do not want to give up SUVs. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: Take care. Learn from it and educate yourself on such topics. It is very important for ALL.
