I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say that it is one of the few books I could not read. <br /> <br /> a lot of action, with a mysterious plot. In my opinion, Tom Hanks plays a much better role for Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> You do not have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code is all it was not. Much more interesting, more action, more excitement and less unnecessary controversy. If you have not read the book, you will still find it very interesting. And if you've read the book, you may be a little disappointed because I miss many scenes I was looking forward to. <br /> <br /> Overall, a pretty impressive movie for every movie viewer. But maybe not very special for Dan Brown fans.
