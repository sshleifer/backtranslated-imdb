Before I saw this movie from beginning to end, I just caught the last half hour. I usually do not watch a movie if I did not see it from the beginning, but a friend had it on and when I looked at it, I could not stop. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised This movie was not widely distributed. This is a pretty funny movie (often gallows humor), and the monster and monster truck in it are pretty threatening. The monster makes Leatherface look pretty, and the monster truck is like a mixture of a German WWI artillery vehicle and a huge coffin a long drive to keep the woman he loves from marrying. His former best friend is ticking and driving him constantly. They are threatened in the street by a black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck. They also take a hitchhiker who is played by the very sexy Aimee Brooks. <br /> <br /> I also saw the animated trailer with the commentary from the director and the electronic press kit. I found both interesting. I'd bet that the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is also pretty pleasing, but I've seen so many other films I've never seen before ...
