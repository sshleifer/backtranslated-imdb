Yes, the training show was great. Not only did many women get into shape, but many teenagers did a great workout. I'm not saying that the show was in any way suitable for family visits, but if you check out the show's other works, you'll find more adult themes in his work that are also excellent. Many spectators were looking forward to the show, both men and women received good information and a wonderful release from the workouts. The girls were perfect and beautiful, the show is a classic and should perform well in the syndication. The show should still be running, as there is never enough choice when it comes to health and beauty.
