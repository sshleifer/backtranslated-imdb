I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival. The microbudget-based digital black-and-white film is a very European film that succeeds brilliantly despite DV's limitations. The film works because it is in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues that are moved and relieved by a touch of unobtrusive humor. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other realistic UK films, and ordinary workers are referred to as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes. The performances are strong, especially Maureen Carr as mother, Trise. I understand that the movie was recently released on DVD, and I would definitely recommend it. The rating on this website is misleading, which is why I gave her a high score because filmmaker May Miles Thomas obviously puts her heart and soul into the company and earns more than 2.8 for her amazing performance.
