Thank goodness for this movie. It's a talent document that, three decades later, looks even more unique and rare in retrospect. <br /> <br /> The music is just extraordinary and packed with so much talent in writing, performance, arrangement and production that it is absolutely contagious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances of undervalued talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods increase my mind every time I hear them. Although the movie may differ from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which I find really scratchy and underdeveloped. Here the arrangements are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that could not have been produced in a set design. <br /> <br /> But the music is not the only thing that sets this movie apart. The juxtaposition of hyper-hyperrealistic dialogue scenes (reminiscent of Altman films) associated with overflowing music and dance numbers really works. All the talents in this film - directing, writing, photographing, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costuming and art direction - merge perfectly into one of the best music films I've ever seen. <br /> <br I find it amazing how much we know about the characters in "Hair", based on very few information or plots. They are not drawn as cartoons, but as realistic and very human people. We see little glimpses of where they are coming from, but the portrait is completed by vignettes that bring the characters to the surface through consummate acting, directing, and editing. There is a subordinate theme of misogyny by Berger and Hud that colors their characters by revealing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. The scene in Berg's life reveals important details about his psychology, and the brief glimpse of Claude's home gives us volume about his background through the simple, realistic and sincere interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father. <br /> <br /> I love the fashion in this movie. Still, he mixes the sixties ideas with VERY seventy looks (you have to go over the hair extensions from Treat Williams ...). It is a document of how chic many of the late seventies were, contrary to the popular belief that it was all about bad taste at that time. Claude's beige-knit tie was a hot trend from 1979, and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers (especially the white in the Central Park scene) blends the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the musical themes , These elements merge with Twyla Tharpe's extraordinary state-of-the-art choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of both. <br /> <br /> "Hair" is not a movie that rewards cynicism. If you come up with expectations, you will most likely be held captive by artists who are not bound by your rules. For me, it opened my eyes, ears, and mind to an insightful and passionate musical dialogue about war, friendship, and family that transcends its time and is meaningful and relevant to me to this day.
