"Back in the Day" is an interesting but erroneous effort. Ja Rule plays Reggie Cooper, an honest but sad man trying to cope with his father's death. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames), who tries to force Reggie into a crime life. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali), the daughter of the preacher. Now he has to choose: love or crime. <br /> <br /> Yes Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he tries to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as a J-bone. He brings a lot of energy and threat in the role. Joe Morton as a preacher is his usual excellent self, but he does not do much. The same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggies Dad. He needed more screen time. I do not want to say that, but Pam Grier is pretty dreadful as Mrs. Cooper. It overacts every scene and brings the movie down. Tia Carrere and Frank Langella are there, but do nothing essential for the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end: you should see it for the skilful performances of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and the grubbiness of writing and governing.
