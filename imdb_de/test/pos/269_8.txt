"Prime Suspect 4" continues the success of the inscrutable addiction to truth and justice, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three mini-series (PS4, PS5 & PS6) with the remarkable absence of founder Lynda La Plante from the credits. The second three-part series captures the same gritty reality as the first three series, countering the forces of evil as it deals with middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a variety of personal and professional issues, and sometimes less ideal solutions. PS4 conjures two stories, while PS5 and PS6 are each separate episodes in which Tennison seeks justice for brutal offenses while fighting institutions willing to sacrifice the interests of their victims for those of a greater good. In other words, to succeed, Tennison must overcome both evil and good. This makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series even grayer and the Tennison wars just as much as finding murderers. Very good stuff that only gets better from series to series. (B +)
