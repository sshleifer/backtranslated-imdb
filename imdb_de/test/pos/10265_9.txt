It could not come from another country or another time. This film simply radiates Psychedelia, influenced by the Italian cinema of the late 60s. So pseudo serious and sexually free. Gorgeous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and acoustic pleasure. In addition, we get the pretty Dagmar Lassander, which certainly looks very good. The confused processes make for a wild ride, and if the hustle and bustle in the midst of the Mimosa at the end of overlapping, this is just another sexy move of the time. It was probably expected that you would divide those few minutes between the screen and your friend, and of course this will reverse the process. It might have been better if Philippe Leroy had not looked so weird with his ragged red hair and twisted expression on his face. He does well and has many quiet moments in which Dagmar rages and he has to show a mixture of love and hate. Not ordinary storytelling, but for those who like it a bit different, this is certainly the case.
