Who won the best actress Oscar for 1933? It should have been Laura Hope Crewes for her great portrayal of the most monstrous mother. She is truly one of the great character actresses of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in "Camille" (1936) and her best-remembered role is Aunt Pittypat in "Gone with the Wind". Irene Dunne was the "official" star of the movie, but she scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite. <br /> <br /> David (Joel McCrea) is in Heidelberg when offered a job in New York. His wife Christine (Irene Dunne) can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Center. Her first stop in America is a visit to David's mother, Ms. Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates every scene is a sub-statement. From her first appearance - in a furious outburst to greet her "big boy", all attention is focused on her. Even if they sit at the tea table, when they forget Hester's existence and even forget how she drinks her tea, you know that something is wrong. (Hester has lived there for some time.) Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> Frances Dee is completely sweet and right in her role as the enchanting Hester. Her performance in this film, especially in the scene where she is hysterical, and the consequences prove she was undervalued as an actress. <br /> <br /> All young people are excellent. Eric Linden excels as Robert, the younger son, who realizes that his mother is terrible but can not do anything to escape his mother's magic. Joel McCrea says at some point "painting roses on bathtubs - that's more your style". In the movie of Robert's sexuality there is a very subtle suggestion. Irene Dunne is excellent in every movie or genre she has tried.
