Mani Sir brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal as usual. Such an amazing relationship between parent and child is beautifully produced. Mani Sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor (actually, this was the only film in which he has ever gone outside of India ... even only to Sri Lanka) in addition to ARR's music ... which is just unbelievable .. Vellai Pookal is one of my favorite songs of all time ... Maddy, who is what he is in the movie industry has also impressed a lot. From alaipayuthey to kannathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru. Mani ratnam has shown the world what a versatile actor Maddy is. Simran was really good too. She has shown that she can also play in non-glamorous roles. All in all, a great movie. Sad that the Tamil audience could not appreciate this gr8 movie and bombarded at the box office ...
