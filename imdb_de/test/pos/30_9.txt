"The Dresser" is one of those films that are so perfect that you really have trouble finding something you do not like. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser for the legendary Donald Wolfit), it sparkles behind the headlights with energy and true zest for life. <br /> <br /> As 'Sir', the arrogant actor and main focus of the play, Albert Finney is a joy to see - whether he's talking about the absence of a storm during the "Blow, the Wind ..." of " King Lear "or chatting with his trusty stage manager Madge (Eileen Atkins, as good as ever) about the old days. As Norman, his chest of drawers, Tom Courtenay makes a fabulous performance. He shakes the Lear, collects a bottle for the bar, or revolts the former fool, Mr. Davenport-Scott (often mentioned). But never seen!). <br /> <br /> In a dedicated cast, there is Edward Fox as Oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead), Zena Walker as her ladyship, Lockwood West as a substitute, and many others. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of energy, it brings some of the make-up of its stage origins, it's true, but you do not seem to be doing well. Very well done.
