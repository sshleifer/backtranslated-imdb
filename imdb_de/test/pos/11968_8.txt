When I visited this documentary about musical blocks from the communist block, I expected something completely dementes, similar to a communist "cop rock". Some scenes were provided, including a rousing clip from a Soviet film titled "Tractor Drivers." <br /> <br /> It would seem that filmmakers had the task of making ideologically correct musicals that would sing, dance and join the party line with insurmountable opportunities. However, one of the surprises of "East Side Story" is that some of the featured films were actually promising. One was an East German effort from the mid-50s titled "My Wife Wants to Sing," in which, as the title implies, an unfortunate housewife attempts to usher in a singing career over the objections of her traditionally minded husband. Another really interesting-looking movie , also from East Germany, was called "Midnight Revue". In this film, within a film, the producers falsify their own creative misery with the story of a group of filmmakers making a musical on behalf of the party. (The filmmakers on screen are making a musical number themselves to avoid "too hot" motifs, which are very reminiscent of the 1957 film "Silk Stockings.") <br /> <br /> The documentary is getting a little threadbare Stories tarnished, but it's still fun to watch. (Look for the completion dedication for the person who made everything possible.)
