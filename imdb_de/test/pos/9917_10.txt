The murders in Opera are not real murders, but they are symbols of past events and parts of Bettys own broken personality. In fact, Betty is the same person (a man) who is also Suzy Bannion in Suspiria, just a decade later (Suzy was a ten-year-old boy who had made friends with a ten-year-old with a milder version of his own background). <br /> It helps to consider Betty's luxury apartment as a military barracks bay. Most of the time she spends the night in her bedroom in bed next to her stereo, and other parts of her apartment seem somehow alien to her, as if other people live in those other rooms. Dario Argento's films are synchronized with a wide range of rock music as well as funk (Dario starts the synchronization right at the beginning of his films, the flash in Opera and the beginning of a drum roll in Suspiria). There are also standard movies that sync Opera (and Suspiria). For example, with a record album by Judas Priest called Priest ... Live (like Suspiria) and Suspiria, Opera syncs very well with a Kiss album called Kiss Alive II. Films like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Image and The Vampire Happening are sync films used by Argento that deal with the same topics as Argento films. Along with many others, these synchronizations show that Betty is a man who has suffered sexual torture from birth in his father's hands (even in the womb after a particular Anne Rice novel entitled Lasher). Anyway, big budget movies are occult works that pass on occult espionage information in a symbolic / alchemical way. Typically, the sync point in a movie is the beginning of the sound score or the first image of the movie beyond the entry of a movie company. Sometimes it is more creative. The Heavy Metal music used in Opera and Phenomena is simply music sync decrypted from other films syncing Argento's films, an intellectual game by the elite in the industry. Normally, she does not respond to the murders she witnesses because she has never seen a real person murder. "She herself" simply suffers a soul murder; she bears witness to her own "murder"; The father of this individual, at the age of four, in 1970, almost dropped him into an abandoned shaft in Arizon; he was about to fall off a wooden board on which his father balanced him before his father changed his mind and grabbed him and pulled him back; The boy felt nothing conscious. Memories of sexual torture are lost to this individual through extreme sexual repression, and the vague memories left behind are the vast, square, deep hole in the desert, and this memory is due to the lack of conscious trauma (the loss of the trauma, " also a "buried feature", featured in the 1975 film titled "The Picture." These sausages in the attic in Suspiria are each individual memories of the first three or so years of a lifetime (Toys In The Attic) /> <br /> The reason why Betty (or Suzy) is a female character is because Christina Marsillach's character mirror is a man who has been trained in a female role since birth (all DVDs of the Simpsons comics are in sync with Suspiria), whereby his nature was shaped to "queen" lines (dubbing the X-Files episodes with Opera), which has even changed his body to be "beautiful", as it is a woman. Behavior changes genetics. A recent movie called Death Proof deals with the same ideas and the same person. <br /> <br /> Practically the entire life of this person is reflected in large budget films, records and books since 1966 and in her father before 1966 and beyond. The Scorpions album titled Virgin Killer is a Suspiria Sync album. The original album cover serves as a symbolic reflection of the fall through the skylight.
