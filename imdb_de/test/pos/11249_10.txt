Key to the VIP is BS. Rob Cavaliere vs. Justin in season two. <br /> <br /> I went to school with Rob Cavaliere and Adriana Doria. You may remember her as the last girl he "picked up". This was when the "angry girlfriend" came by, leaving her and "leaving the club together." They were good friends with Father Bressani Chs at Woodbridge. <br /> <br /> Whether Rob planned it or asked him to, men should know that what they see is not real and the boys here are shower bags. especially this episode. <br /> <br /> another line to fill space.
