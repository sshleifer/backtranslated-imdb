Dirty Dancing one of my MOST favorite movies. I only saw it twice on ABC because I did not have the option to buy it or rent it at Blockbuster. I had no idea that Jennifer Gray was 27 years old at the time she made the film because she was very convincing as a teenager. She has a very flat chest compared to some women in Hollywood, so I was so easily deceived about her age. So, both physically and emotionally, Gray prefers to play a teen very well. I loved the dance too - who would not be? Both times, when I saw Dirty Dancing, I always want to look for dance lessons. I also love the soundtrack, and I know some of the songs when I was eight or nine. I would love it if I could see that in my acting class, and I'll eventually ask my teacher if there's a part of the film he can use for educational purposes. It's much better than the stuff he saw last year. And the end was absolutely fantastic. That's one of the best moments in the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I'm looking forward to Dirty Dancing on the first day of school! Who could expect a better influence from a movie with such a title?
