James L. Brook is one of those directors who always seem to see life as very weird. Not only is he the producer for "The Simpsons", he also has some classic comedies under his belt - "Broadcast News" is one of them. <br /> <br /> Though it does not fit his later efforts, "Good Broadcast News" is still a very smart, witty and witty film about a TV station and all the problems it suffers from - there is a great comedic Sequence of physical humor in which Joan Cusack walks around the building trying to plunge a news tape into the editing room within a few minutes before being televised live. This is not only very honest in terms of the way hectic broadcasters operate but also a skilful and honest portrayal of people that I do not always like) and the right direction.
