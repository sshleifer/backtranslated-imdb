I waited a long time to comment on this program and feel it is time to do some justice. This is one of Christie's darker, darker, and gripping works, not just someone killed for money. This is a dark and pervasive story of mystery, intrigue, love, and murder that gets better with the changes the adapter has made. The level of acting is absolutely outstanding. Joan Hickson is great as always in the role! The rest of the cast, including Liz Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry, are all very good, but in my opinion the show was stolen by Margaret Tyzack. The final scene between her and Joan Hickson is just magical. As good as it gets, chilling, moving and totally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Please let me know if you agree with my words. I'm really looking forward to the remake to see how good Geraldine McEwan's version is. Watch and enjoy.
