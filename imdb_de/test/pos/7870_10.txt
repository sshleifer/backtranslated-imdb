These are the most energetic and entertaining ten minutes of film I've seen in a long time. As a film student at NYU, where this short film has been screened several times, I welcome Jim Cox for his ingenious sense of style and pace for our generation. I'm sure> I'll see his name later on the big screen. Hopefully, this short> will find a market on television or anywhere else so that this inspiring work can get the widespread coverage it desires
