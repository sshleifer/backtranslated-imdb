I have always been fascinated by Ninjistsu, who would know that things will continue. In "Ninja III" it's fun, scary and fascinating. A Ninja is shot dead by the police and uses his mind for revenge. The victim, a pretty young woman named Christie (Lucinda Dickey). She falls in love with the policeman involved in the shooting. The love scene, in which she pours the V8 on her body, has killed me! The death of the ninja arouses the attention of another in Japan called Yamada (Sho Kosugi). He not only comes to America to save Christie, but also to bring the ninja back to his grave. Simply because he stretched out Yamada's left eye with a shuriken (throwing star). The fight scenes were excellent. I liked the role when the plywood fell on Yamada and he split it with his foot. And when he got caught, he tells the officer that Christie was involved in that everything will be fine. Rule of thumb: Never guess a ninja. He took out the other bulls without killing them. And he did his thing without worry. Of course, Chirstie did her best to try to put the ninja in his place, using them as a tool for revenge. It was a good movie, great for martial arts enthusiasts. 3 out of 5 stars!
