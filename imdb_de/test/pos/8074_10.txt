I have seen this film twice at the Transilvania International Film Festival (TIFF), the film is competing and I really hope that Esteban Sapir will receive one of the awards (at least the best image price). <br /> <br /> As a silent movie fan I am interested in contemporary films that quote or recreate the language of the past cinema. The previous reviewer emphasized the quotes by Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. As I see it, the film refers directly to Lang's Metropolis and the allegorical-parabolic character of his actions. But I did not see Murnau in it. However, there is a more obvious Melies homage: the moon with a human face (smoking here) and the mountains and cityscapes painted from paper. I enjoyed the movie mainly because of its visuals, and in the meantime, I found the story about dumbness and the creative means of communication of the inhabitants of the voiceless city very interesting. From this perspective, this film is a unique reflection on the silence of the silent film, because in the movies of the silent era you can hardly find stories with dumb characters. In this case, one may ask if the story about the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent movie form, or if one intends to play the silent films. Another example of this kind of reflection came in Guy Maddin's caution, where the inhabitants of a mountain village have limitations in how they use their voices. I intend to write a paper about it, if you know films related to this topic, please let me know !!! <br /> <br /> I can highly recommend Esteban Sapir's movie to every moviegoer (one of the critics called him: the jewel of the festival). PS: The winners were announced, and the film won the Best Camera Award!
