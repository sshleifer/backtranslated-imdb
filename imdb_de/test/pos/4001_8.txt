Chi-hwa-seong (Painted Fire) tells the story of the Korean painter Jang Seong-ub in the midst of the changing political landscape of late 19th-century Korea. <br /> <br /> The themes of this film, however, focus on the process of artistic creation through the fire of the artist's yearning and the expectations and demands of his audience and his society. Jang Seong-ub is masterfully played as a complex figure, moving from the innocent excitement of youth to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul. This characterization reflects the young, zealous artist, who finds it ever more difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation, without letting the creative work through drinks, erections and desire. <br /> <br /> Although this character development is progressing As the film progresses, Jang's emotional complexity is gradually oscillated to reach the final of the film. Interestingly enough, the film's montage runs parallel to this ever-changing and seemingly wild emotion or the artist's fire, as scenes seamlessly switch from time and place to another, without conventional "clues" coming to the audience that such a scene change takes place. For example, many scenes would seem to change during a conversation that takes place elsewhere. <br /> <br /> The film's visual scene is beautifully presented and varies from stark (and perhaps gloomy) black and white scenes to colorful and vibrant environments that parallel Jang's paintings in either plain black ink white paper or with added color. Color rainbows enter the film, while the artist observes nature and especially the women, which are then reflected in his paintings. The subject of the individual desire of an artist towards the expectations and demands of society emerges through various points, including class distinctions, the government's rule over the artist, the accepted norms of the artistic elite and the basic needs of the ordinary masses. Rather than creating his own, completely original works, Jang mainly recreates masterpieces by other artists throughout East Asia. The question then arises as to whether recreation itself deserves artistic value. I wish I had a better understanding of the political events of that time, to understand how they were involved in the story - but beyond any comparison with the present, the role of the Korean government in the past I can not comment on artistic expression and / or censorship. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very well-rehearsed movie and the cinematography is often breathtaking. A great movie to watch and think about.
