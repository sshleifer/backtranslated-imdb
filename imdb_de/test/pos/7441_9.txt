I generally like this movie a lot. The animation is outstanding: this means that they made an effort to animate hair and fur on animals and humans. And as an amateur in graphics and animation (self learning through books, for the curious, I use the program Gmax by Discreet, which is a high quality free program that can be downloaded from the internet) that the quality of the animation shown here is from high standard. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie is good. Although this film has no character development, this story is still understandable. In general, I believe that this movie should be seen primarily by people who are fans of the game as its plot follows the game. I do not play the games and so I do not have the overwhelming effect they probably have for fans of the game. <br /> <br /> For those who like the game, I recommend this movie and if you did not play the game, I would still recommend this movie to you.
