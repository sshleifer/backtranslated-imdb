I thought that the plot was very well done. I really liked this movie. If you dab a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought it would be a bad idea to clutter with movie stars. Apparently someone does not believe. I enjoyed the movie sooner. I even think about buying it. I want it to be my first DVD for my room. That's the way I like it. I'd rather not start an online confrontation with someone I do not know and have a movie about. If someone could kindly take back what he said about the story, I would be more than happy to withdraw my insult. However, if they feel that I have not earned a retreat, I could just feel that they are not worthy. But I can not control their actions, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hey, you do not have to retreat, but I would appreciate it.
