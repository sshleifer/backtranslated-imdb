Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider, in a fortuitous lead role) leads a secret covert police force called Seven-Ups, whose tactics do not necessarily follow the laws of the law. They do the job in their own way without anything getting into the press. This gives them the freedom to expand their possibilities to reach the criminals most detectives and police officers can not reach. Buddy has had a boyfriend named Vito (Tony Lo Bianco) since childhood, sharing information about mob types and Shyster traveling the streets of New York. What Buddy does not know is that Vito hatches a schema named from Buddy's "checklist" (he opened this book and noted notes from Vito, but does not know his friend copied exactly the names written in his) mind) to found mob families in a series of mob kidnappings made by two policemen, Moon (always rogue Richard Lynch) and Bo (Bill Hickman), who worked with him. If this plan goes awry and one of the Seven-Ups is killed, Vito becomes anxious because he knows how Buddy can be when he's looking for someone ... especially if one of his own is murdered. <br /> <br /> Extremely undervalued cop film has resulted in an exciting chase through New York City as Buddy follows the abducted police officer who tries to get her after he has killed his partner. The movie is not too complex after the plot is complete and we realize who the ringleader is with the gangsters. Scheider never received the honor he deserves as a good lead actor. He has an emotional reach and we see how he loses when he loses his policeman and boyfriend. The movie is brisk with good action sequences and sets up an interesting conspiracy tactic between friends, as greed comes before this childhood friendship and can kill cops like an apparent crime against evil mob families.
