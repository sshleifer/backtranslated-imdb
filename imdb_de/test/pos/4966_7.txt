I wish I had met Ida Lupino. When people ask who you ask if you could have 6 exceptional 20th century people for dinner? Well, for me, a person would be her. I think that she is now one of the great unsung and unprofiled personalities of the film industry. Your life story would make a great phone call (Hey, Mr. Bogdanovich ...). Ida Lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s. I remember being sad when I saw her reduced to a dreadful part in a terrible AIP movie in the late '70s. She was bitten by a big worm on the sink. Pooh. I should have contacted her then, as she did not die much later ... more of the role and the worm. From High Sierra, Roadhouse and the extraordinary RKO thriller On Dangerous Ground, Ida Lupino was often the producer and lead actress. Later, with her husband Howard Duff, they produced many timeless noir dramas that are still compelling today. One of them is JENNIFER, who in my opinion is the last movie copyrighted by Monogram Pictures. In 1953, Monogram officially changed the company name to Allied Artists, and JENNIFER has both company names in the appetizer. This is a towering Haunted House thriller as scary as The Innocents and The Haunting 8 years later. This tiny movie is really chilled and very scary. He is exactly the right film for which Ida Lupino was responsible. Try it and find it ... you will always remember and, I think, much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress / producer.
