This movie was one, if not the best, movie I've seen in the last year. I highly recommend him. It starts out as a very funny movie, but as the movie progress becomes a lot more. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. I have seen a screener of this film, but I will not only buy it for myself, but for some real movie fans I have the unfortunate feeling that this great movie is largely unrecognized, as is the case with so many other non-commercial films It will make you laugh It will make you cry It will make you think and yes, you'll think about it when it's over and it's not what a good movie is!
