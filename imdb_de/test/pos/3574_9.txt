An intelligent and well-preserved film worth exporting! <br /> <br /> In this sensational and genuinely intelligent movie, shot entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the meaning of the word "bluff" (although it's a Colombian film, the title is presented in English). ! <br /> <br /> The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who finds that his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) has an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine ; After that Nicolas stays without a girlfriend and without a job. Nicolas' revenge on Mallarino is to follow him and get photos of him with his new affair Alexandra (Carolina Gomez) to blackmail Mallarino to receive money for the change because he did not show Margarita the photos. <br /> <br /> The story The movie is really smart and well connected. To the point that you fully understand the meaning of the title, the film features a thriller with many comic scenes and characters, which is a real pleasure for someone who focuses on movies. A good script. <br /> <br /> I find out here that this film is different from the typical Colombian films that show a dark and violent image of our beautiful country, which is something really refreshing. Some critics say that this story does not show the typical Colombian way of life, so it could be held anywhere in the world. I do not agree with that: (1) the movie was completely shot in Bogotá so you can see streets and pictures of the real Colombian capital (I hope some Americans and movie producers see this to stop the jungle of the Amazons or to show Mexican towns in Bogota as in some Hollywood movies), except for Nicolas, who comes from Argentina) are from here complete, Rosemary (Veronica Orozco) has a typical Cali accent (3), you can also social and cultural differences recognize between the common people in Bogotá. I hope that all this and an English title will lead people from other countries to see this masterpiece by Martinez. <br /> <br /> Outstanding acting by Veronica Orozco, Luis Eduardo Arango (detective Wilson Montes) and Felipe Botero, outstanding as a detective Ricardo Perez and good acting by Mallarino, Catalina Aristizabal and Federico Lorusso. <br /> <br /> A movie worth exporting. People from all over the world will surely understand and enjoy this! Do not miss this movie. 9/10!
