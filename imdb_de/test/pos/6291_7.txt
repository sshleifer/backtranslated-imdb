I did not expect much when I decided to watch this movie, and I was surprised that I fully enjoyed it. For some scenes, I almost laughed uncontrollably. The characters were captivating (no pun intended); The story is predictable. The fun is watching Crawl (Shore's character), a sombre California buddy brought home by a country college girl for Thanksgiving, by trying his hand at being awkward (but lovable) to adapt to their lifestyle. I was also surprised that there was a message in all this. If you have a chance, watch this movie!
