One of the main aspects of "Malenkaya Vera" is that it was the first film from the Soviet Union that showed a sex scene, albeit a short one. The title is important: Vera is the Russian word for "faith" and indicates that Punk Vera (Natalya Negoda) has little faith in the Soviet system. And as the movie shows, there is not much faith in it. The opening scene shows the desolate industrial city Zhdanov, almost a hell on earth. If Vera's beloved Sergei (Andrey Sokolov) moves to his family, this leads to unexpected events. <br /> <br /> As in many Russian films, people's names describe their characters. For example, there is Viktor (remember that "winner" means winner). All in all, this is a good look at the Soviet Union as it collapsed - and we can see why it collapsed. Really good.
