Shia LaBeouf has already impressed me with his acting skills, but I can honestly say that I'm really looking forward to his next efforts ... his portrayal of Francis Ouimet, a 20-year-old caddy who ignores his father's persistence that golf not his is she plays in life and enters the US Open in 1913 in his hometown ... the beginning of the film draws a little, but it is necessary to build the underddog subplot that Shia works so well ... The entire cast is well chosen and they work very well together in a story that, based on the actual event, has an ending that anyone can discover before watching the movie ... but even knowing that the information is fun Do not spoil ... Josh Flitter is as sexy as Eddie Lowery, Francis 'Caddy, who keeps him on the ground and at the same time proves to be a priceless part of Francis' efforts ... Stephen Delane is outstanding ending as Harry Vardon, the legendary British golfer Francis still does not fear. ..and who knows the background from which Francis comes from. He also had modest beginnings ... Bill Paxton makes a formulaic film and makes it worthwhile ... Bravo Mr. Paxton and Bravo for the cast ... of the imagery about the story to the people who bring it to life, this is a movie to get, to enjoy and to enjoy ... it's nice to have films like this that feel good ...
