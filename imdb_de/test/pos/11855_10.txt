Intense, witty, funny and especially social comedy about the way of dating for adults and their results - be it good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are betrothed two months before a wedding date, when a bizarre incident at their engagement party forces Nicholson to reconsider the relationship and go out with other people, so she can not feel so unaffected when it comes to sexual experiences. This leads to a catastrophe of events after Mohr, Nicholson and their cohorts. Very intelligent and used in this time of awkward, condescending comedy, while containing the usual variety of weird, sexual and frustrated characters (especially Charles as a sexually frustrated sex-fiend ... very annoying) who seem to feel right themselves To this heart felt comments. <br /> <br /> The film is as films should be these days and shows that boys are sensitive in heart and have morality. Most male characters are the moralistic, righteous eyes, while the woman is the fresh-minded street connoisseur who stops at nothing to rejoice. Guys will appreciate the message for men with self-esteem, but it is easy to assume that most men watching this movie use their message of male sensitivity to hide any flaw or trait that a woman finds offensive could. Nevertheless, the writing formula uses this method to pave the way for the male leads, especially those of Mohr, Richter and the search for the director in a cameo as a salesman! <br /> <br /> The women are most promiscuous when they talk of nothing but pleasure and what it's like to be with someone else. However, they have friendly features, even though they are covered by the image of sex-controlled kittens. Very funny stuff. <br /> <br /> On another level, the film follows a part of its ensemble in different relationship work. Judge meets a stressed-out divorce (a very notable and noteworthy achievement from the ever-reliable Helen Slater) called Penelope, who divorces a son who hates her for his spanking with his father. As the two enter into a deeper relationship, people's interest becomes apparent, and both the comedy and the tragedy of divorce and new beginning are explored. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Mohr and Nicholson went too deep in their heads to see what's next, and it's up to what they've learned about themselves and decide for themselves what they want to come next It will be fitting and dramatic at the right time. <br /> <br /> Wallodorski's direction is very well replicated as the characters learn to meet after what has happened ... with the right ending. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie should have been released nationwide and I hope there are some Oscar awards ... maybe Helen Slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. Anyway, this movie is an absolute hit, do not miss it, give everything you have to a romantic sex farce, very mature and aesthetically portrayed. <br /> <br /> Great movie!
