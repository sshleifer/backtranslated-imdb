I can not understand that I have to jump back and forth to the scene set and hide the plot. To show that someone has a capacity before using it is, in my opinion, an insult to our intelligence. It starts to feel a little thoughtful, and as if they make up for being so vague for the first three series. A little disappointing for this episode. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is quite offensive to use past quirks, such as Locke's ability to know when a storm ends side of Locke? <br /> <br /> This episode was everywhere.
