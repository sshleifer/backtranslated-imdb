Some people think that this was a pretty bad TV series, with cheesy effects. (considering it was filmed between 1977 and 1979), but look at those years and think, "We did not have computers at the time." If you think about it, it's a pretty good TV series. <br /> <br /> I've always thought bad reviews killed the show, but no. the network did it. They picked up their theme as "The Superhero Network" and released a short-lived Spider-Man series. If it had continued, it would probably have gone well into the '80s, and if it was really lucky (and I'm really lucky), the early' 90s. <br /> <br /> And nobody wanted to pick this series up. <br /> <br /> However, the young (or young) Hammond boy of Hammond, called The Sound of Music Fame, is called Peter Parker brought to the screen, the secret identity of the amazing spider man. In the series peter deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country and a corrupt politician. <br /> <br /> while the series is out of line (since Peter has already graduated from university, and that's when he gets bitten and Uncle Ben is already dead.) The audience is filled with action, excitement, and the Attitude of the characters towards Peter and his alter ego, the Spider-Man, treated. <br /> <br /> While it's also a bit disappointing that Robert. F Simon does not look like JJ Jameson, it's not so disappointing that Betty Grant is not Betty Grant, but a hot African-American girl (reminding me of Halle Berry, who is one of the hottest women in the world) One thing was not so bad. <br /> <br /> But if you look at the time and how much drama they put into this piece, it somehow makes you guess what bad television is today. Either way, it's entertaining even today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
