This is the biggest show ever made near South Park. I love this program! It's so funny, and Peter's laugh is funny. You must watch this show right away for the few people who have never seen this show before. One of my favorite shows of all time. <br /> <br /> If you can, try out some of the later episodes like I Dream of Jesus or Third-Class Stories Nothing. But there never was an episode I did not like. All episodes are absolutely funny. It also has a great satire about it. You can find many clips on your tube. If you are near a computer or TV, you can see it immediately.
