The first reviewer is right - In this film, we see ourselves as we cuddle up to the majority, are pleasant, try to stay out of trouble, just live our lives, and we see how easily these very human traits are made for people are so basic The functioning of society can lead us to become involved in a great evil. <br /> <br /> The story takes place during World War II. Radio, newspapers and films remind us of Hitler's attacks on Jews to underline the irony of the same kind of violent anti-Semitism taking place in America. Sometimes it felt a bit cumbersome. <br /> <br /> It feels more like a play than a movie, but it makes one think that such quarrels mean little. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the entire plot depends on a small fact that seems to me to be implausible. Larry has lived an uneventful life until middle age; however, it is enough for him to wear glasses for all - ALL - to make him look Jewish at first sight. I voluntarily hung the disbelief because the conspiracy pushed me further, but the implausibility bothered me throughout the movie. (And frankly, I did not understand why his wife was also considered a Jew, Larry seemed to think that because her name was "hard.") When he married her later, I do not know why his neighbors assumed you was Jewish.) For the first part of the movie, I wondered if there would be elements of fantasy. Larry's inconspicuousness seemed exaggerated, almost grotesque. Why do not you call the police if you see the rape, even if the attacker was a neighbor? And I thought the lighting seemed a bit unreal - the red of the houses seemed too red, Gertrude's entrance seemed intentionally overlapping, in general the colors were almost chalk-like in their intensity. <br /> <br /> In credits I see it was filmed on Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto. I plan to drive down there (near Bloor & Dufferin) to check the colors. Really :) It was good to be reminded that the clergy of that time often cited the evil of racism. (Do you remember how the pope refused to speak out against Hitler just to seek protection for the church? It was the same Pope who, when Rome was to be liberated from American troops, requested the first soldiers enter the city not black Check your story I can not remember ever having heard of this movie It is a shame It is certainly of interest to every thinking person, anyone who is interested in American history or racism is one of the clearest illustrations I've ever seen of Bertrand Russell's dictum: "Do not go with a crowd to do the evil."
