Shirley Knight plays Sara Ravenna, a housewife on Long Island, who escapes from her marriage when she discovers she is pregnant. She plans to enter the heart of America and start over. On the way, she gets a friendly hitchhiker (James Caan), who calls himself "Killer". Soon she discovers that the good-natured "killer" actually has brain damage, and when he picked it up, she unknowingly took on a lot of responsibility. The two drive to Nebraska, where Sara Killer helps with a roadside reptile farm. This is where Sara Gordon, a local policeman, meets, and soon things will go horribly wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> This is a strong drama about people who are not affiliated with society, alienated from the choices they make or the limits imposed on them by others. With such a small budget and a very permissive attitude, the film can absorb everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complex, divergent role and there are moments when she performs awesome actions. One of my favorites is when she calls for the first time and calls her worried husband at home. It's such a tense scene at both ends, and in every little gesture and phrase of a word so much is said about them with so little. Then comes the character "Killer" by James Caan. This character is unlike any I've ever seen and he plays wonderfully. It is one of his best achievements as he is very reserved and moving. <br /> <br /> The way Coppola develops characters using short, dreamlike flashbacks is very clever and adds a fragmented view of the whole. The fast flashbacks, which are graphic and self-contained, contrast well with the longer settings in some key scenes. Since this film was filmed in the eastern US on the ground, he offers in the late 1960s, an interesting and authentic view of America. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many other films with Ms. Knight. I'm only familiar with her recent work on television, which usually plays a nagging mother-in-law or a dotty old woman. It was great to see her so young, beautiful and so wonderfully subtle in this movie. It's also a shame that James Caan has been called a "tough guy" for the rest of his career because this film proves he can do much more.
