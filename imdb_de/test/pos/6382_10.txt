I saw that about a week ago at a test screening in Chatsworth and went with some of my girlfriends. We all loved it very much. James Franco is amazing and so hot, I would just watch it for him !!!!!!! But Sienna Miller is also really good and plays a girl from the South who loves him so much that she can not let go. David Caradine, who was in Kill Bill, plays a cowboy, and he's perfect for that. The story is kind of strange, but if you believe in the power of love and magical things, you will love them !!! It's really original and it's also very funny and everybody laughed a lot, but in the end it gets more serious and we all cried. I'll see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out, it's really good !!!!!!!
