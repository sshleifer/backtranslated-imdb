I like the shepherd! Sure, the acting was not good, but the fight scenes were nice. Van Damme throws some nice kicks and Adkins too. The story was average. A Texas policeman is fighting smugglers. This movie has everything a Van Damme movie should do, namely martial arts and action. Van Damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van Dammme's last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar-winning performance, you will not get it here, but if you're looking for action and martial arts, this movie is for you. Scott Adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the crowd is fed up with martial arts superstars, but his films in this movie are great. Van Damme delivers strong kicks and it's nice to see him again martial arts as he has none in his last 4 or 5 films. This movie is definitely worth a visit if you're a fan of Van Damme.
