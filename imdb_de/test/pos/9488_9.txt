The only Zeppelin footage I've seen before this DVD is the movie "The Song Remains the Same" from 1976. We spent hours watching a friend's house, but I never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences. .. <br /> <br /> So, what about this DVD? I did not know it existed until I searched for the Physical Graffiti CD ... "When did that come out?" I thought <br /> <br /> For some reason, I thought Page was not a great live guitarist, but to say that watching this DVD changed my mind is a massive understatement. <br /> <br /> There is 'White Summer' from 1970 - 10 minutes of guitar magic. <br /> <br /> There is an acoustic set from 1975 - 'Bron-y-aur Stomp' has a brilliant finger picking improv section. <br /> <br /> The performances "In My Time of Death" and "Trampled Underground" (also from '75) are breathtaking - with Page and Bonham things are decomposed that no one else has. Demon possession of Rawk !! <br /> <br /> The magic goes into the Knebworth 1979 section. The rendering of 'Achillie's Last Stand', considering their various drug addicts are states, they do not believe. A song with complex guitar overdubs. Page arranged it so that he just has it live "punk" - the effect is absolutely mesmerizing. 'In the evening' - I never liked that on disc, but it moves here. 'Sick Again' - great piece of sleaze-rock. The footage from Knebworth is very interesting and cuts between big canvases, various rostrums and bootleg footage. <br /> <br /> Plant is amazing at all performances. Page, though painfully thin, looks like a six-year-old boy enjoying the most of his life at the Knebworth concert - and makes infectious television. <br /> <br /> One thing that puzzled me - The 'Black Dog' performance of 1973 sounds very "camping" !! Robert Plant always loved a little "mince" and these jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and would be so today It's all very different from the muscular Kick-a $$$ Studio version. <br /> <br /> I love this DVD, it reminded me how good Zeppelin was and still is.
