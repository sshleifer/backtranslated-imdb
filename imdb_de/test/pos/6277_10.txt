To be honest, this is probably the best version in my book as a sound movie version of the jazz singer. The version of 1927 is, despite the structure as the first talkie really a silent movie. Danny Thomas is a great comedian and he sings very well. He makes the Jewish stuff with feeling. Peggy Lee is great and every movie she has is always entertaining. Allan Joslyn is not too entertaining and we could have done without him. One question: since when do Cantors live in such luxurious houses ???
