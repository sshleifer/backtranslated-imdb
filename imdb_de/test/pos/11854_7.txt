This indie movie is worth a look because of the tremendous talent of its creators, Wallace Wolodarsky and Marsha Forbes. Mr. Wolodarsky led the young cast and he is to be praised for it. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is a cautionary tale about the danger of wanting something you can not have. Which is the story of Alice and Ed. After Alice has lived together for a while, she suddenly becomes restless, because she imagines that she has experience in the field of sex. While the relationship between Alice and Ed is not an example of ideal happiness, it does provide a convenient way to share their lives. Until the moment when Alice and Claire, her sister, happened upon a sexual meeting of another couple, who has no idea, to be watched. This incident causes Alice to reassess her own sex life with Ed; She thinks there is a lack of substance. When she suggests "seeing other people," Ed is shocked, to say the least, but not to contradict Alice, he decides to join. Next, Alice and Ed enter a world unknown to them. The people they meet in the end are not worth the effort. In the end, they saddened that they were made for each other. <br /> <br /> The film is well worth a visit to see the amazing Julianne Nicholson we liked in another indie movie "Tully". , Ms. Nicholson reminds us of a young Shirley McLaine. She projects such a brilliant quality over her that it is difficult for her to take her eyes off her when she is in a scene. This young actress proves that she is an accomplished performer who gets better with each new performance. Basically, she wears the movie. Your Alice is a study in contrasts. Alice is a decent woman who thinks she does not satisfy Ed because of her inexperience. Jay Mohr is an excellent addition to Ms. Nicholson. Both together work wonders. His Ed is absolutely believable. We knew people like him. Deep inside, he is a good person who suddenly finds himself in a situation he did not call for. However, he just goes on to find that he is too decent and not for a life without unnecessary sex with the willing women out. That has no problem with a fall in the hay, just for fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is wonderful. Lauren Graham does amazing work as Claire, Alice's yuppie sister. Andy Ritcher is also wonderful, as the down to earth Carl, the nerdy friend who finally finds fulfillment when he meets Penelope, a single mother. As Penelope Helen Slater makes a successful, albeit short appearance in the film. <br /> <br /> The director is enormously gifted, who will undoubtedly go there, because he shows that he is well suited to the job.
