I love this movie! <br /> <br /> This beautiful, charming love story immediately attracted me with its lovely characters and heartwarming romance. I was so attached to the characters throughout the movie that I felt I knew them personally. The plot is very enchanting and it moved me to tears in some touching moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very nice, chaste relationship that you do not need to get involved in. This is worth seeing more than once and showing it to all your friends. I'm just curious, why was not this a great success? <br /> <br /> I give 10 out of 10 points! Spectacular movie! (And that comes from a guy who thinks 9 out of 10 movies are not even worth seeing.)
