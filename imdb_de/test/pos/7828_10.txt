Undoubtedly a great all-round show, which would attract a large fan base on a performance today. Bodyguards consisted of only 6 episodes and a trailer, but deserves a few more series to really bring it up to date. Sean Pertwee and the dynamic Louise Lombard really did it with people like Proffesionals, The Sweeney and Thief Takers , The storylines are based on the Diplomatic Protection Services and with great storylines and scene locations it was I do not think it was also shown on terrestrial television, like Sky or Freeview, and it's a shame it would be shown to me today I hope one day the guys from Carlton TV decide to release it on DVD. Cheers, Nick.
