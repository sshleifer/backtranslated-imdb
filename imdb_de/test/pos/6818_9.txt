This shorts has all the elements of a great movie. Every time I show it to friends (on DVR), they love it too. The dialogue is so "real". The spectacle is great. The effects / props were not so convincing with everything else in the shot, but they are expertly used. The music is so haunting, perfect for this kind of 'moment' movie. People who uphold their beliefs and thoughts are shaken at their core about what they see in this film. Most go 'that's it?', But in the end they bloom with new understanding and leave the movie in a word to describe it: <br /> <br /> 'Beautiful'. The beauty of the film is also close up. I love the fact that there are no conflicting views, no other voices, and the voices you hear are the same. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And the end made me love more! The harsh reality is sometimes more movie-rich than any plot or twist. <br /> <br /> (was not Joshua Leonard the guy in the Blair Witch Project?) :) movie of a fictitious dead ... great!
