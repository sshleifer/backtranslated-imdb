Why did Ramón (Carlos Fuentes) take his five college colleagues to an eerie, deserted schoolhouse that formerly served the black sheep children of prosperity? This answer may be in a diary he allegedly wrote of his dying father. They actually come into contact with another group of six people, five of whom are believed to have met a fateful security guard (Paul Naschy) that happened 20 years ago a few years ago. However, as they seek a way to escape from this place, terror awaits them as that dreadful moment of time when the group runs for their lives, often in panic attacks, when the killer starts chasing them and turning them into one Series of bloody people destroys paths. Will Ramón and his friends survive this night of terror or become ghosts that repeat again and again on the same night as the one before them? <br /> <br /> Stylish Spanish Slasher has this professional glow and a powerful, shocking power. Some funny exchanges between the characters ... in their dialogue are allusions of pop culture to American horror movies that could annoy some viewers. A denied Naschy is really wild with the kids when he cheerfully attacks them. A bloodthirsty madman who performs his violent deeds with pleasure. I found the loud musical notes a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the movie to remind them of the audience. I do not think that these tricks are absolutely necessary, but the director wanted to deepen the viewer with the viewers regarding the use of hints and flashbacks. A slight distraction to the plot of this film remains in motion, and the camera follows the tempo of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them. Your enjoyment of this film may ultimately be due to your accepting the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. Moments experienced again and a murderer who apparently continues his work from the grave. The phrase seems to be shrill and abrupt, but this might (or may not) work, considering the story of why Ramón's father is shown among those ghosts who reenact these horrific events two decades ago. I would say this movie would probably not stand up to scrutiny, but as a Slasher movie it's a breath of fresh air.
