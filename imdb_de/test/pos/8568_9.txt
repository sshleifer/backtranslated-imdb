I remember this movie and how it was played in almost every drive-in theater here in Toronto. It's a group of girls who are not accepted by the other students at their college, so start their own and of course call it H.O.T.S. It's a funny movie that's bursting with drive-in nostalgia! Many fully equipped T-shirts, vans, fights and a football showdown like no other! It was compared to Animal House, which is a good movie in itself, but nothing compares to H.O.T.S. It has its own brand of fun and character. If you are looking for a classic T n'A movie, you are at H.O.T.S. Girls are to the rescue, boom boom shorts and everything!
