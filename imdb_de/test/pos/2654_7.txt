"2001: A Space Odyssey" takes place in 2001 and the main character is HAL. A computer. Right, a computer that speaks and thinks all by itself. This was done in 1968, and if you think until 2001, it's conceivable that talking computer is a joke. If this was 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be just as feeble-minded. There is nothing in this film that causes emotions. It provokes two reactions and one is called sleep. It starts with nothing, but a pitch-black shot for well over two minutes. The first shot we see, which has a kind of lighting, is "The Dawn of Man". So, if the blackness is in chronological order, is the world born? <br /> <br /> During the sequence "The Dawn of Man" from anywhere does a huge monolith come? From the ground, from the sky, we will never know where it comes from, but for some reason it is there. The monkeys go to Apesh! T, once you have found this monolith that only man could have done, but that's the catch? Man has not yet developed. Who made it and where did it come from? What is his job? The monkeys find a tool. The monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys. The monkeys with the weapons are now the dominant group because they used their minds to gain an advantage. The more advanced monkeys and, above all, the more intelligent and innovative monkeys are the dominant group since they have taken over the waterhole. We jump fast into space, millions of years later, where we find a bunch of spaceships floating to classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe, and for a 1968 movie, the visual effects are stunning but outdated. The score is legendary. The cinematography is spectacular. The editing is cruel. There are countless shots of boxy-looking spaceships floating in space for infinite time. Once we board, there is not much to discuss. In the next lesson, Kubrick will show different shots of life in space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we get the message completely. The spacecraft inside and out seem bulky and outdated. Do you remember what the first phone looked like? Me neither, but that's the future in 2001. All characters have clothes and hairstyles that are reminiscent of 1968. The chairs are held in bright red colors and have a strange shape because we all know that we will do it in the future sitting in strange-looking chairs. The computer screens look horrible, and this is obviously in front of HDTV, because the clarity is disgusting. All TVs look like they're from 1968, so that's not all that futuristic. Like all the films that have been set more than 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we should not say, "So you would think it looks like this." No, I would not. As if I would not believe that a computer would speak to me in 2047. It's not going to happen, and if somebody was doing a movie now, going 30 years in the right direction and having a self-paced computer, I'd laugh at the stupidity of it. Just as I did with "2001". <br /> <br /> HAL is the liveliest person, shoot ?? I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more lives than any of the movie's subdued characters and actually believes he lives. HAL is the only thing alive, and he sees the people as entertainers looking after him while he does all the work. HAL "reads" the lips of one of the few conversations between Dave and Frank and he "sees" that they intend to turn it off. This is where the only dramatic part of the movie occurs. A subsequent fight between a red light and a man in a spaceship trying to get into the larger spaceship. Oh, the drama. As soon as HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave goes back into the spaceship and proves the ingenuity of the man. Dave continues to finish HAL. HAL asks for his life as he slowly fades, which, like everything else, seems to last forever. <br /> <br /> The last act is just as boring as the first two. At the end the monolith, which the monkeys have found, reappears. It comes back from nowhere. Then an infant is born in a placental-like shield that surveys the earth from space. What does Kubrick say? Is it about transformation? Dave to a baby? Is man developing again? Does Kubrick say that this is the end of man and the beginning of ?? What is the foreign-looking thing? Maybe I'm going crazy and trying to figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think about it, the more I make sense of beginning and end. There are so many questions unanswered, especially for the monolith. If you make it through the movie, you should think about it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie is struggling to get where it wants to go. The first act and the third act are strong, but the second act winds around and floats in a place that seems like an eternity. There are some fascinating things in the movie that will give you food for thought if you give it a chance. As soon as the beginning of the movie makes sense, the ending works much better, even if you still do not do what Kubrick is trying to say, which I do not know.
