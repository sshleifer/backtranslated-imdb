Of course, Ponyo is not just another stupid animated movie a studio could give up for survival. It is far from it, and it can easily be described as a fascinating, beautiful movie experience. <br /> <br /> Miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece. Many are told that this is the least of his filmmaking successes, as he was in part out of his "certain disorientation factor". That's true - the morality and insights that are not so obvious in his previous films are at the forefront of this picture. Ponyo is not too difficult to understand or understand. I think his idea was to do a children's movie that's just as suitable for adults as it is for kids, and that it's not too complicated. He did that perfectly, and on the way he lost no substance, so he gets a 10. Besides, the movie itself is so intriguing from the start, and the beautiful it is presented, it has sometimes impressed me because I remember how they were all drawn by Miyazaki himself. I was not so enlightened and happy after seeing a movie since I saw it some time ago (another movie not to be missed). Everything about Ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking. Even the music for it was pure perfection. The only bad thing I have to say was the English dubbing. Do not get me wrong, they were good too, but I had seen Ponyo about two weeks before the national show, and I felt that in some areas I wished he had retained some of his Japanese dialogue (not all) but did also enjoyed the "English way"). All in all, everyone should see ponyo. It is absolutely flawless and in a different league of filmmaking together. Finally, and do not hold on to it, but I would not be surprised if Ponyo got a Best Picture nomination because there are now 10 films to be nominated for. It's just so good.
