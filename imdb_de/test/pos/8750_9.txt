What a great mini-series. The original TRAFFIK stole me completely from everything else. The original TRAFFIK is far more captivating than the American remake and offers a stunning cast that consists of lesser-known actors for the North American crowd. Juliette Binoche is the main recognizable actress who plays a drug addict, youthful daughter of a government official. But it's not the star power that carries this movie (though I liked the American version, I felt it was dimmed in the picture by the famous Americans). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw the American version before I found the original BBC mini series. Of course, there were no image filters, lush locations and the big stars / director. However, the dirt and grime of Europe (through the drug world) perfectly complements the looming sense of danger that runs through this film. The problems of drugging drug addicts, bad anti-drug campaigns, and the resistance of foreign governments to the destruction of their drug cultivators from within, makes TRAFFIK bold, immersive, and terrible! <br /> <br /> The really incredible parts of the movie are all from Pakistan. My God, I never knew how bad the problem really was in Europe ... even everywhere! In order to get a real education about the problems of drugs, you have to pay attention to this as well as to the American version. Everyone shows a very clear and indisputable fact. These countries, leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led many to die and suffer. <br /> <br /> Drugs are worse than war. They work in the shadows, the dark secrets of every "successful" society.
