I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone, but this imitates the reality of life in so many ways, and if you're truly honest with yourself, you'll at least agree with the movie in some scenes. <br /> <br /> The show is not only believable, but convinces in a way that appeals to the characters. In addition, it is funny without too much effort. <br /> <br /> And yes, I really think that a continuation is needed here. In the movie, you'll learn why. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, especially if you like movies that have a real message.
