I did not read the book "Scarlett" and when I saw this mini-series, I liked it a lot and thought it did not have to be compared to GWTW. The story may be different from the book, but who cares, is a movie. Also in the credits it is based on the book, not on the book. The film is clearly undervalued with the reviews that other people write, but it can not even spell out the names of the main characters correctly. <br /> <br /> The acting in Scarlett I found great. Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were excellent. They took the figures and gave them a touch there. Now that other people come by, compare them to the big Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. They were obviously fantastic, but the main roles in this film are completely different people, who have their own acting methods and should not be pressured by what people say. If you want certain actors to perform well, you should direct the movie. I'm sure other actors would not do so well with the chemistry and wisdom they brought to those roles. The understudy was characterized by her size, and Jean Smart steals the scenes that go along with her comedy genius. <br /> <br /> The filming locations were very nice and it was just great to see Scarlett at all of those spots in the movie as she caused trouble and other things. The scene in which Scarlett speaks to her father's grave was also very dramatic and I thought there were two great actresses who brought Scarlett O'Hara to life. Not only Vivian Leigh, but also Joanne Whalley. <br /> <br /> The film and the book may differ, but you must not take it to heart that this is a continuation of one of the best movies that was otherwise made, otherwise you will think that must be like "From Gone with the wind "and you will not like this movie. However, this is an underrated classic that, unlike GWTW, is a movie in its own right. Also remember that "tomorrow is another day" ...
