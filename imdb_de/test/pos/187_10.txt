I can not describe the beauty of "The Cranes are Flying", but I will still try to write about it. It is a powerful and tender love story that takes its place in World War II. It is the classic story of the lovers (Boris & Veronika) who were separated from the war and what is created between them. The images of the film are so great that you get carried away - the film technique is perfectly in line with the emotion. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that directly depict the war: A bombardment - wind, lightning explosions - this will have important consequences in the life of the protagonist Veronika, who is waiting for Boris to return; and there is another scene at the front where we are confronted with an emotional / visual hurricane showing the images that are played in Boris' head. Another scene serves as the leitmotif of the film and delivers its title - the cranes flying in the sky. This image symbolizes nature and its seasons and highlights the film's ultimate message: not giving up hope and fighting for a better future. Kalatozov is a great director, this movie is visually stunning and it touched me deeply. It's not just pure technology. <br /> <br /> Tatjana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika. What else can I say? The film transcends the time it was made - the action takes place during the Second World War. But it could have happened anytime, anywhere. As long as there are wars (big or small), the movie and its message remain relevant.
