Nice to see that I'm not the only person who remembers this great movie. I have very fond memories of this film - I remember it vaguely when I was about eight, and I would watch the children's television programs after school (Broom Cupboard?). This was the first and last movie that scared me - and the boy's pictures, surrounded by fog on a hill, will stay with me forever! Like most films of this era, it has a happy ending - intended for children, but with the definitive ability to attract the attention of an adult. The charming Cornish countryside makes the movie really stand out - and the "ghostly" scenes are simple, but very, very effective! I would like to try to find this movie again - if the movie is still at home!
