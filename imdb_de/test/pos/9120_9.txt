I have just seen it as a graduation film of the Austin Film Festival. When I walked in, a had seen some snippets of Alamo Drafthouse and thought the trailer was amusing, but I did not expect that there would be such an epic theme music. The use of tarot cards is awesome in the title sequence. Watch for cameos by Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins and the Dark Lord himself (who has a fetish for KG). Have fun and the songs are so catchy. The chase was by far my favorite scene. I know this will immediately reach cult status and win some new Tenacious D fans, just like me. I hope this works well in cinemas.
