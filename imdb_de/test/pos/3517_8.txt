Just before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it, because I was a more gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead, director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disturbing atmosphere for great movie segments. He keeps building up the tension until I was really unsure what would happen, but it was like a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave him a liberation, blended with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre ambience, and when the action really comes into action, it's really shocking and dramatic, without ever being really bloody. The characters are about equivalent to this type of film, albeit more personable than some and the villain memorably crazy. The photography and the excitement are the real winners in this movie and prevent it from becoming boring (as suggested). I recommend it serious horror fan. Do not expect Gore, expect a scary hillbilly story with some great moments and a great, dreamlike ambience.
