The minutiae associated with making a robbery make this movie one of the best of all robberies. Then there's the robbery, a wordless, thirty-minute nail that has never been surpassed before, followed by what is probably the most pronounced example of thieving cinema as things dissolve spectacularly, and we undoubtedly have the greatest of all heist films. <br /> <br /> This was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955, and today it's just as hard and unsentimental. (It shows some of the edgy brutality of Dassin's previous "brute force"). There is no fuzzy moment or duff in the entire film, and Dassin captures the milieu of dodgy clubs and Parisian back streets like no other, and the last ride of a dying man through Paris is one of the most iconic end sequences of any movie. A classic.
