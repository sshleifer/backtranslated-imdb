I had heard interesting critics in this movie. I thought it was a love story, but I was not sure what the story was about. When I finally saw it, I found myself in the middle of a love affair between ex-Con Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and junkie Rufo (Sebastián Haro). Well, a love story, but probably not what I expected. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Isabel as she struggles to return to society. She does not want to return to her neighborhood and finds herself neither at home nor anywhere. While she was experiencing these first hours of freedom after she was released from prison, she came across Rufo, an old acquaintance of hers who had become a junkie during her stay and lives on the streets. Since she did not have to go where she was, with no money or real revenue, she decides to sit down with Rufo: a covered area in a lonely street. <br /> <br /> The story itself is on the move. It explains how the impossible relationship between Isabel and Rufo deepens to the very last turn of the movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching the movie. Sebastián Haro is great in his role as a junkie. A person who is able to be both an innocent and a gentle giving person and an unscrupulous road surface. Only depending on who he is dealing with. I believe in his role. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I do not quite believe in Isabel Ampudia. Although the film tries to show the bitterness in her through several scenes, she is unable to believe me. She is too sweet and too honest in a way that could be expected from the same situation. <br /> <br /> The film tries to show love in a desperate situation. It is a pleasing movie. The feeling I get when the movie ends is that Isabel never got into this situation with her way of thinking and acting. Her role, partly because of the script, partly because of acting, is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really like the end, so I've raised my rating by one or two points. I liked to show his bittersweetness and the fact that sometimes the survival instinct is above the other spiritual considerations than love. ,
