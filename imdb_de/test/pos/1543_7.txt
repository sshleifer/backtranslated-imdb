The premise of the story is general enough; average family wants out of the rat race; want to find the simple life ... so they move from Sherman Oaks, California, to Lake Tomahawk; Children in tow. <br /> <br /> The lake is beautiful, they have leased an old house .... but wait; There may be something in the lake; People are being murdered, and nobody knows how (no matter why). Gerald McRaney is excellent, a familiar face for Lifetime viewers. Valerie Harper is good too; Since this movie was shot in '88, the author might want to produce a sequel. <br /> <br /> You'll also enjoy Barry Corbin as the city's eccentric and Darryl Anderson as the Bruce Dern lookalike / crazy military man. <br /> <br /> While the story plot is a bit over the top; If you're a movie fan, you're reminded of similar "psycho" scenarios. ""Liberation""; as well as other horror stories of this genre. Several camera shots and sequences convey a sense of Deja Vu. <br /> <br /> Sit back and enjoy; If you do not take it too seriously, it is very entertaining. and better than, for example, the newer movie: <br /> <br /> "" I know what you did last summer ""; It seems like they made better movies in the good 80s!
