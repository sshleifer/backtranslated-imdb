I just wanted to say that I really liked this movie, but I also want to ask for something. Does anyone know who plays the name of the song / song of the young man (who can not remember his name) on his CD player when his father and 2 men come and take the TV and the CD player ??? the song is so crazy cool, even though I can not understand a word, what they say ... do not hesitate to send me the artist / song name to hpn_x@hotmail.com. Thanks in advance !! =) --------------------- repetition -------------------------- I just wanted to say that I liked this movie very much, but I also want to ask for something CD player when his dad and 2 guys come and take the TV and the CD player ??? the song is so crazy cool, even though I can not understand a word, what they say ... do not hesitate to send me the artist / song name to hpn_x@hotmail.com.
