Enjoy every moment of this boring spectacle with matching music (Mahler's 5th is great, but listen to the vocal part of the 3rd Symphony, which is so beautifully used in this movie). There are many aspects of this film, but the main theme is the overwhelming power of beauty, its spontaneous nature, the lack of logic for love and worship. I am also an avid fan of Bogarde and believe that he was rarely so wonderful (try the "The Servant"). Note: I recommend several sightings.
