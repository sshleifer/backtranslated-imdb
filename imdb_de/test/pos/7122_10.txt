This film brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a D & D group. As I watched, I could not help but notice how lively characters reminded me and my playmates so much that they literally behaved like us. Including the quarrels, the struggles, the inner jokes that drive the DM nuts. EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> It has everything. Jokes that made me cry, action scenes that were filmed even in the low budget, I found incredibly great. The story is pretty straightforward and not surprising, but it does not matter because the best part of the movie is seeing the characters react and interacting with each other and the NPCs. I play D & D or a similar RPG. I can not stress that enough. WATCH THIS MOVIE, he miraculously captured the spirit of D & D.
