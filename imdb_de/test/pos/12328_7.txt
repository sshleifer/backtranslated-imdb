lightning; a spacious cemetery; the name of Adam 'Batman' West: All appear on screen before the opening balance and yet One Dark Night is not as cheesy as it may seem at first glance. <br /> <Meg Tilly (Jennifer's sister) plays the beautiful student Julie, who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum, as part of the exclusive high school clique The Sisters. What Julie does not understand is that the other sisters plan to annoy her with sinister strings, or that the youngest corpse buried in the mausoleum is that of the "psychic vampire" Raymar, who nourishes the life of frightened young women , <br /> <br /> Granted, this may not be the most original setup, but thankfully, there are enough imaginative elements to differentiate this film from the competition. My favorites are a macabre view of everyday objects set in the walls of Raymar's apartment, and the scary way in which moldy corpses float through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during the brilliant finale. The impressive Steadicam cinematography by Hal Trussell and the macabre special effects of Tom Burman also contribute to the cool atmosphere.
