From the beginning of the film, I laughed laughing and tried to stay quiet so I did not wake anyone in the house. This did not continue the rest of the movie so much, I did not find everything completely "laughing out loud". funny, but still I found certain things pretty funny. In the beginning I had to laugh when he left the very smart-looking hand grenade in his sleeve. Then there are scenes in which you only smile when, for example, the barber falls through a roof into an apartment. I can see it's pretty funny, but in today's days and times that has been pretty much done, but it did not feel original at the time I'm sure it was like that. I was thrilled with Hynkels (Hitler), who was exposed to angry German outbursts with the subtle English translation. <br /> <br /> The final scene is wildly discussed because it is absolutely true and very smartly designed. Although the film is sixty-eight years old, the final scene is still relevant today. If this does not show how great a writer Chaplin is, I do not know what he wants. The acting in this scene was particularly good, the Barber passed the message perfectly and lets you recognize the seriousness of the film, while enjoying the humorous side. <br /> <br /> Another element of this film is the fact that this was such a courageous film that almost feels like its own time. Of course, Chaplin did not know what would happen after 1940, he did not (obviously) know about the Holocaust, he also knew if he knew he had not made that film. The fact that this film is so anti-Hitler is interesting, it is more interesting that it was not anti-Germany, which would be easy to do then. Chaplin could easily make this into a propaganda film, but did something besides, he made an honest film. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone who is interested in watching this movie to see the movie, as well as those who have studied or studied Hitler to watch this movie. At least it's entertaining, it does not have an annoying outdated feel that some movies of the time did. In contrast to most "comedies," this film does indeed have a message that it tries to convey to you. Watch this movie. You will feel better if you have seen him.
