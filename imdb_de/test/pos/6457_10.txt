I saw this movie on cable for the first time in the 80s and it shook me to the core. It was shown again on TV about six months ago. <br /> <br /> The black-and-white cinematography filmed on location graphically depicts New York 1950s as a pithy "urban jungle" at a time when much more industry and industry were port activities in the city especially in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes has always given his acting a special intensity, and he's great in the role of the Army Dodger. His short television series "Johnny Staccato" from 1959 is also a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier and (later in the film) Ruby Dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. But it was Jack Warden's great performance as a vicious, brutal shift leader that grabbed my attention. Watch this movie and watch a series of the television series "Naked City" (1967) titled "Specter of the Rose Street Gang (available as video)". If you are a fan of Film Noir, this is a must. Enjoy!
