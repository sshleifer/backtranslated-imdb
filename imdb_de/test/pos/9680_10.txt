Since I'm a Russian myself, sometimes I find it difficult to get reference jokes about American television personalities or celebrities. Apart from that, Family Guy is the smartest, funniest and most politically incorrect show in the world. The voice output is excellent and sounds as clear to even a non-English speaker as I am. Animations are also good, maybe even too good for a TV show. Here's the equivalent of the Adult Swim Channel, but nothing is comparable to this gem. Not even Simpsons or South Park. I hope the creators will continue to entertain and amuse us. I do not want it to be in mediocre conversation.
