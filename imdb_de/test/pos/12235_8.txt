I can not argue with other comments that the plot is more focused on the romance between the characters of Mary Martin and Allan Jones as a "showboat" than on the life of Victor Herbert. But would that have been a ticket office in the thirties? Instead of the life of VH it might have been the music of VH. There is a wealth of it. <br /> <br /> For me, the thrill of the movie came towards the end of the film when Susanna Foster sings "Land of Romance". It's been over a decade since I captured this movie a second time in a local movie theater for old movies. At first the audience was stunned. then it broke out in spontaneous applause. I remember the shivers that ran up and down my back. My trivia memory reminded me of the information provided to a questioning audience by a local journalist when the film first came out in the late 1930s. "This note hit by Miss Foster was well above the high C." <br/> <br/> She may not have had four octaves a la Yma Sumac, but the teenage teenager at that time certainly had a reach!
