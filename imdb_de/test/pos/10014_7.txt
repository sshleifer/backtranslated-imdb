"Night of the Hunted" plays the French porn actress Brigitte Lahaie. In fact, many of the performers in this slow production were porn actresses at the time of their desperate shooting. This movie certainly differs from Rollin's usual lesbian vampire stripes, but it's not as catchy as "Lips of Blood" or "Fascination." Lahaie plays an amnesia hitchhiker who can not remember who she is or where she comes from. The majority of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex where Lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group that treats a number of people with a similar illness. In any case, she escapes from the monolithic office tower in which those affected are arrested. On a highway outside the city she meets a young man. "Night of the Hunted" offers a lot of nudity, unfortunately, the pace is extremely slow. The atmosphere is terribly sad and the relationship between Brigitte Lahaie and another asylum seeker Dominique Journet is well developed by th e Hunted "is too boring to be completely entertaining - just look if you're a fan of Jean Rollin's work.7 from 10 and that's nice.
