It's quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be so revealing about gay and bi-sexual relationships and their struggles! <br /> <br /> "Pool Days" is about the awkwardness of adolescence and the mutual attraction between an older and a younger one. A story about experience and vulnerability! <br /> <br /> "A friend of Dorothy" describes a common dilemma that many gay and bisexual people experience at some point in their lives: the strong attraction to someone who is heterosexual. Sensitively examined, this story has really moved me. <br /> <br /> "The Disco Years" shows another version of a no-win situation: getting involved with someone who is not just confused about his sexual orientation, but also afraid of being anything but straight to be exposed! A very empowering story for those of us who have been betrayed by a sexually confused and frightened person! <br /> <br /> While these three stories appeal to anyone with a bit of empathy for others, they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay, bi-sexual, or seeking. Every story rises in a unique way!
