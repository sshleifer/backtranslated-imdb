I just saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. Some of Neal Slavin's impressive cast include William Macy (seen in The Contender at last year's TIFF), Meat Loaf (aka Meat Loaf Aday, aka Michael Lee Aday), David Paymer and Laura Dern (also this year in Novocaine) festival). <br /> <br /> Based on Arthur Miller's novel of the same name, Focus follows the Christian but "Jewish-looking" Lawrence Newman (Macy) as he fights hatred and anti-Semitism in his neighborhood. Between the Jewish shopkeeper down the street (Paymer) and his anti-Semitic neighbor (Meat Loaf) carrying the card, Newman struggles to cope with internal conflicts and conflicts around him. Feel guilty because they know what's right but do not do anything to get together with the neighbors and keep peace. Things get more complex when he meets and marries Gertrude (Dern), who everyone thinks he is Jewish. Gertrude teaches her husband a few things on how to judge books by letter. <br /> <br /> Will Newman in the end stay for the Jewish man or will he flee? Look at it to find out. <br /> <br /> The acting was fantastic. The writing was incredible. The cinematography was excellent. The sound was well done. Technically amazing, the film was disturbing. Chilling Emotionally intense I used to put my knees into the fetal position a few times. I admire all who have worked on it. I have not seen such a good movie for a long time. It touched me. <br /> <br /> Wow.
