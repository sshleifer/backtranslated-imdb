This Aussie film, shot in 1999, is all right to portray a number of little crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young wannabe whose life is in danger after missing a job for her future boss. Very well played by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is quite believable with some very humorous moments in a scene revolving around a bank robbery. The establishment of various topics, which are at the heart of the story, is quite successful. For example, When a Crimea searches for bullets for his weapon. Personally, I have an aversion to unfounded violence in films, and in this regard, the film did not offend. It tried and we succeeded in showing the human side of the bad guys like Bryan Brown. The rest of the cast has done a good job without really outstanding points that I remember. The direction was very good, to create a credible movie with good entertainment. The main feature that makes this movie a good movie is the acting and directing of Heath Ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term gratification. He believes that he is indestructible and does not realize that scary people are waiting for an error. Director Gregor Jordan deserves a special mention. Review in my book - 7 (out of 10).
