I thought the interaction between Crystal and DeVito was great. The movie is off the beaten path, but there are some memorable lines. Ramsey as "Momma" is vulgar and exaggerated, but also very funny and effective. The character had to be pretty awful, why would anyone else think of killing his mother? Now Crystal's wife - she's a "bitch" everyone wants to be gifted with, so her role, even though she plays a minor role, is effective because she has to justify Crystal the ridiculous case of "writer's block". Although there are dark moments, the film is not depressing and despite the murderous impulses that the protagonists feel, they also have redeeming qualities. Overall, this is one of the funniest movies I can remember. one that I like to watch several times.
