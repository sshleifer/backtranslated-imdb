Honestly, I do not really understand why there was so much controversy on this show. It includes the elements of the original and extends them. Storytelling has been updated, and while some episodes seem a bit "fast," this is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role. Just as good as Tom Baker. <br /> <br /> Rose is one of the best companions, on par with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela. <br /> <br /> I like the concept that the timelords were destroyed - No more politics with the doctor as emeritus president. And it adds something to the character, just to be left over. <br /> <br /> The SFX are excellent - especially compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Take it from me (and I was a huge Dr Who geek - I actually took notes while watching the show from Dr Number 1 to Dr Number 8. I have the awful movie thrown out of the cannon, personally) ever. Watch the video and buy the DVD.
