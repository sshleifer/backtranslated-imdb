I had never read any of Sarah Waters's novels or seen Tipping the Velvet. I first heard about Fingersmith as I flipped through the "The L Word" websites. The story of Fingersmith interested me, but I died it and thought, "Lesbian in Victorian times, that never ends well I've had enough of these Lesbo series and movies that are not going there" Christmas gave my local DVD shop to Fingersmith Discount, I brought the DVD, and my life has never been so colorful. <br /> <br /> This mini-series deserves to be appreciated and praised. The spectacle is so great that I rarely name it. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton, and many more that I can not name all have brought light and darkness to their characters. Only by a small gesture, a small look, a small touch, they made their characters realizable and as a spectator, I could not help but bring her home and let her in the vicinity. <br /> <br/> Fingersmith, located in the Victorian Room, is a story of Sue-a thief who loves her "family" with her bags and lives with her. She did not know that her fate was related to Maud Lily - a somewhat timid, shy girl who can grow up in a mansion. Maud's mother left her a fortune, but Maud herself can not touch it, unless she's married. Worst of all, Maud's uncle makes sure she will never do it by keeping her in the house. <br /> <br /> Enter Mr. Gentlement, a charming, handsome thief with a heart as bad as any other. He wants Maud's fortune for himself, and to do that, he uses Sue as Maud Lily's maid and asks Sue to convince Maud to flee with him. Over time, it would be easy if Sue had not fallen in love with Maud. <br /> <br /> And things would be easy if the story was as I just told it. I do not want to be spoiled, so I want to stop there. But I can assure you that everything is twisted and twisted before you even know what happened. As soon as it happens, one wonders what would happen next. In addition, the story is filled with a passion that is different from all others. There is no selfish, questioning sexuality: "Oh my god, I like girls" moments, because the girls in Fingersmith are so deeply buried in their own darkness that they can hardly care. The story with such twisted action moves as smooth as water, running passionately, but strangely calm. <br /> <br /> Weeks have passed since I saw "Fingersmith", but Maud's eyes are still haunting me and Sue's words are warming my heart "You pearl, you pearl, you pearl," she said. And it is such a pearl.
