If you have not seen it yet, take care. It is available on DVD. It is a production of Channel 4 (UK), possibly in conjunction with German and Danish television. If you've seen the movie, it's basically the same action. The narcotics trade has linked a number of nested stories. The story jumps between the housewife (played by the eminent Lyndsay Duncan), who tries to make a deal on behalf of her husband, who to her surprise is an international drug dealer (and generally a dangerous man). <br /> <br /> A minister embedded in his job at the expense of his family is investigating the entire state of affairs in international drug trafficking. He gets a few eye-openers for the reality of heroin when it turns out his daughter has a "problem". Then he officially visits Pakistan, where he seems to be taught that abuse (not just the drug or occasional use) is the problem, and he can also try some products (an excellent scene where he also recognizes what the Attraction is and why it is and why it is such a problem). In Pakistan, we see the other side. The desperation of farmers who can barely survive if they commit to opium production and crime. The pointless subsidy attempts cause the system to become rich. And a country so drenched in drugs, but only a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the West. All around, a customs officer / Interpol agent attempts to capture the "Dutch" link in heroin smuggling. I seek justice for his murdered partner. This is really a masterpiece. Super, unobtrusive performances of all major players, as only the European cinema really can. <br /> <br /> A must. Above all, when you have seen the movie, they complement each other and present slightly different opinions / attitudes on both sides of the pond.
