This is one of the very few films with terrific acting, wonderful action and worth seeing. It's about changes in life. It's about how to be lucky if you are true to yourself. It's about accepting yourself and others. It's about challenges in life. It's about approaching reality. It's about courage. It's about love. Both actresses are very faithful to their role. The actresses had a very good chemistry in the film. This is the key to the movie the movie was made from. It is rare to see an independent movie like this one. You can see the hard work the film crew had to have in producing this film. I would like to see more movie from this producer / author. Watch the movie, you will love it.
