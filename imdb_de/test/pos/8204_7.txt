You could get into the basics of this movie and say how it could not happen, or how the main character could go into offices and use computers, etc. without anyone noticing and really cutting the movie to pieces ... or you could Just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and acting. Personally, I prefer the latter, I live the real life and watch the news with all their fate and gloom, and I would much rather be entertained with my films and see the bad guys get their reward. Do not take it too seriously and you can enjoy this movie.
