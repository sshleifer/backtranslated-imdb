Eh oui, impossible n'est pas gaulois. <br /> <br /> A well entertaining, very entertaining movie. Very good knowledge of the French language and knowledge of modern France (and history) are recommended. I do not think this movie really works in another language. The movie is so much better than the previous one (looking for ...). Apart from great actors and skillful camera conditions, it's the wit and fireworks of hints, puns, etc. that make a really great movie. The cartoon template is recognizable, but the movie is very emancipated. The costs of the film are well used. In fact, all the special effects "naturally" fit into the movie, you never feel swallowed by them. > <br /> A neighbor from the other side of the Rhine
