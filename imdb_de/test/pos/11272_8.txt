Begotten is one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. For me, it's more a study of sound, light and darkness and movement than a real story. The kind of thing you see as a video installation in the Museum of Modern Art is a movie that is enjoyed in the local theater. I will not try to interpret the images of Mother Nature, the animals in capes, the twisted and tormented body of her "child". Some things just resist interpretation.
