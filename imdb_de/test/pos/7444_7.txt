SOME IMPORTANT SPOILERS, YOU WERE WARNING <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Venice Film Festival, and I have to admit that as a fan, it really was REALLY IMPRESSIVE. Excellent graphics, excellent music, excellent synchronization, excellent action sequences and so on ... BUT there is a but. The entire movie was thought to be EXCLUSIVE of the gamer who loved it, and that can therefore enjoy any reference, character, inner joke (you should see a joke with winning music that's especially funny), and so on. A poor man who is not in the world of FF will obviously see the greatness of the technical part, but CAN NOT capture the inner satisfaction of seeing, eg. For example, when Barret shows up and shoots Bahamut TOTALLY OUT NOWHERE. He'll ask, "Who is this guy?", And I can not blame him. He can not even understand what a player feels when the opening music of the game is played in the opening sequence. Nanaki walks with his two boys in the gorge, howling at Midgar's ruins and "498 years ago ...". Almost all the characters made a gig or quote (including Reeve, Tseng, and Elena), and Reno & Rude were really stupid and weird to see, but the last thing the movie left for me was "the last dream of a hardcore Player, but far less. " a MOVIE fan ... ".
