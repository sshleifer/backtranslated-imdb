I know that many people have said that they should not deal with this movie because it is not a good fighting strip and the subtitles are not hard. That's a really lazy way to think about a movie. If you want to focus on this part of the film, you should look for something different and learn to respect the cinema as an art form. This is a masterful work. If you want to see that, it's not really about fighting. There are good fight scenes that are sometimes filmed well with good camera work, but the story itself keeps the story together and is the important part. This is not the basic kung fu movie. The story is really the main focus and not the fights, and the combination of the two makes for an excellent movie worth seeing and even better in the original language with subtitles.
