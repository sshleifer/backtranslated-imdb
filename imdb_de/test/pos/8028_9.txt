This film is about Carlos "The Jackal" (Quinn), an international terrorist who seems to be maimed by the description of CIA agent Henry Fields (Sutherland), women and children. At the very least, he says he has convicted US Naval Officer Annibal Ramirez (again Quinn) of taking on the job of posing as Carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB. Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos, but mentally he is his opponent. He is worn by order and Carlos by chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is not all just a shootout, and that's a good thing. In his first half, Ramirez is trained to act and think like Carlos, and this is where the film reaches its distinction from other action-action films. An Israeli agent (Kingsley) joins Fields to train Ramirez, and together they seem to take on the roles of parents in the birth of Ramirez's new character. Ramirez teaches that he dislikes the things Carlos does not like, behaving the way Carlos would do in the fraction of a second, and even loving Carlos (thanks to an ex-girlfriend of Carlos). Of course, everything he teaches will be well used in the later part of the movie. It's a bit resourceful, but Quinn gives a mesmerizing performance as Carlos wannabe. <br /> <br /> Another thing I liked about this movie was that it did not use the much exaggerated plot point in nasty twin movies - you know the one in which the evil twin gets into the good twin's family , Ramirez's family comes into play, but instead it shows how his new character destroys his family life. <br /> <br /> Good humor is injected into this movie. An exception is the overused and seemingly unsatisfactory joke with Ramirez's first name (Annibal, Annabelle, do you understand?). Also exaggerating was the constant harp of the duo about how powerful and smart and intelligent Carlos is. In my opinion, the payout during the last showdown could not keep up with the build. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of action movies, but this movie was smarter and more engaging than the average action movie and it caught my attention. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
