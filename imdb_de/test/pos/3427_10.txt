Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is rarely a favorite of mine, said everyone should watch this movie because it's something that can help heal the world ... <br /> <br /> It's one of the most poignant Movies That I Have I've Seen Many Comments From Tutu And Delivers ... I've read a lot of comments and they range from good to average to commentary on the choice of actors ... the fact is that this is one of the most extraordinary Events in our world. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ... for the first time, a country has decided to air its terrible history, find a way forward, and create a way for people to heal ... <br /> <br The film begins by giving the white police officer a chance to release themselves for brutal crimes, and the black man tries to make sure he can not get away, he enters humanity and the enormous need for healing that we have Need all need .... <br /> <br /> Definitely a thumbs up ..... To all concerned .... Once again I am proud to be South African ..... <br /> <br /> You can find an interesting comment here: http://www.biz-community.com/Article/196/97/5223.html
