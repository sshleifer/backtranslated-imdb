'Oldboy' director Park Chun-wook returns with one of the most itchiest and most serious vampire movies in film history. <br /> <br /> Trusting the Latest Hollywood Fashion, Vampires Should Be Nowadays Be rather non-violent, asexual, loving chevaliers instead of the wicked sexual bloodsucking, mind-manipulating human beasts of yore. This is the movie you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrill of the past ... Well, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> 'Thirst' begins with a long character show culminating in a slightly different love story. The vampire conversion of a priest has long been suppressed by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story, resulting in an awkward look. But the last 40 minutes are surprisingly bloody. Well, maybe not so surprising if you know "Oldboy" and "I'm a cyborg, but that's fine", but I think it's right to say that "thirst" is Park's earlier films in terms of violence trumps in the face. <br /> <br /> All in all, be warned that this is neither an art cinema nor a horror movie. For many it is too disgusting and for some too tame. "Thirsty" is original, entertaining and luckily a little less funny than Park Chun-wook's earlier efforts.
