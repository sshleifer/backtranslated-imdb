Sri Lanka ... no country I've been thinking about for a long time, I have to admit. I did not know that it was near India, let alone a bloody civil war there since 1983. It seems that the Tamil minority rebels are in ongoing conflict with the military regime that governs the country. Mani Ratman's latest film A PECK ON THE CHEEK tells the story of a young girl named Amudha, separated from her Sri Lanka parents by the War and reared by a young Indian couple. Amudha is a clever and mischievous girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child. Although her adopted parents love her as much as she could and raised her with her biological children without prejudice, Amudha can not help but learn more about her biological family. Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE, which hides a story about terrorism and politics in a love story (or is it the other way around?). A PECK ON THE CHEEK lives in a similar territory but may be more ambitious in the ground. The central theme that binds the film is the love between the various family members and especially between a child and their adoptive parents. It's a pretty honest and open look at feelings that can sometimes be very touching and heartwarming and painful in others. It's an emotionally complex movie with characters that are somewhat idealized but still very human. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the 9-year-old Amudha, who is the young actress P.S. played with charm and vivacity. Keerthana in her first and only acting role. She's a princess and a monster that's always in trouble, but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long. The young actress is perfectly attuned to the role and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes. <br/> <br /> A PECK ON THE CHEEK has such an innocent name, to which I was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience. Never before has such a small act been as enormously emotional as I may say. The film is a courageous and artistic effort to explore topics that are not often shown on screen. Mani Ratman's direction is superb, very self-confident and mature - the most demanding work I've ever seen director yet. The film is visually very stylish, with excellent camera work and pictures. A.R. Rahman delivers the soundtrack of the film, which is not as good as his classic DIL SE or BOMBAY music (at least based on the first impressions), but still shows his great musical talent. <br /> <br /> DVD release for the film yet - I saw it on Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, whose film was undoubtedly the highlight. The production is really a world-class job, and I am sure that it will be popular with the Western public as it gains wider publicity. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
