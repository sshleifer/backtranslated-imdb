If you want to see a brilliant performance by Mikado, which was perfectly played with professional timing and panache, you should not watch this version. If you want to see a hammam version of Eric Idle roaming the 1930s English gentleman's private club society, this is the one you should take a look at. It's a lot of fun and a good intro for Gilbert and Sullivan, but then you should take out and rent the Canadian Stratford version. You will see the difference between good and great. Nobody makes G & S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford Group.
