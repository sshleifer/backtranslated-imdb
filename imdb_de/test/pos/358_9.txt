Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's longest films, a skilful and surprisingly complex parody of the then-known "Prosper Merimee" story about "Carmen". I was a bit confused about the difference between the 1915 Burlesque IMDb listing on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on runtime, I assume that this is the 1915 version I've seen since Version of 1916 is a good 20 minutes longer, and what I've read is 20 unnecessary and inconspicuous minutes. <br /> <br /> It is clear from the beginning that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most complex and ambitious efforts, starting with a lengthy backstory narrated by Carmen about the tragic love story. <br /> <br /> Carmen is sent by a group of Gypsies ("A GYP gypsy gang") to seduce a Spanish officer to carry out his smuggling operation. It's a smart, chaplinesque group of criminals whose leader, Lillas Pastia, has "stolen for 50 years and believes he might be offered a job in politics." By the way, I have seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of the earlier Chaplin works, but probably none that are as open as in this one. At the beginning of the film, as the group of Gypsies is on their way, there is a scene where the mules and the women are loaded, and a subtitle declares that "the mules are those with long ears". If you could not know it, I think. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays the role of Don Jose, the luckless officer who is to be seduced by Carmen. He is described as "a brave soldier and lover of women". Not exactly a track for Chaplin, who a few years later dispelled doubts about his ability to play a compelling comic soldier in the brilliant shoulder arms. And of course he did not have to act as a lover of women. <br /> <br /> What's different, of course, is his polished military uniform and the straightforward disciplinary nature, of course, with some of his traditional baton movements. He seems to me a small man of authority who strives to uphold the respect of his subordinates by exercising a rugged, rigid appearance. Soon Carmen comes in ("Loved by all men under the age of 96 ??") and she immediately flirts with Charlie. I should mention that for a good majority of the movie, it surprisingly matches the original story, which was full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover who can create a jealous passion that I've never seen before. There is at least one scene where he is really a bit scary. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie, such as a hilarious table dance and some classic swordfights towards the end. And his boycotted charm and the role of a soldier are definitely a winning combination, though there's another weird stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door that was not very effective at first but simply just went on and on, always and still about five times longer than it was worth. Although it was interesting, it was revealed as a movie acquisition when it finally fell over. I always appreciate such insights into the old movie sets. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is the strongest part. It has a striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet, but just when you think Chaplin would do a significant thematic experiment by deviating from his traditional style, there is a hilarious twist as old as Chaplin as I have ever seen it have. Good work!
