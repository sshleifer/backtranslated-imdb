I give this film a score of 8, is relative to other feature films from 1930. According to the standards of films that were filmed only a few years later, this film might only get a score of 6 or 7 - mostly due to the sound quality like that poor. Now it is possible that the movie sounded better and the Fox Movie Channel had a reduced pressure (it had many lines and scratches), but I assume the sound problem was always a problem. That's because the sound in movies was still a novelty in 1930, and many of the Hollywood images from 1930 sounded terrible - with background characters that often drowned out the leads. as in the BISHOP MURDER CASE, HELL'S ANGELS and other films of the day). It all got a lot worse in THE BIG TRAIL, as most of the movie was filmed outside - something that was not known at the time. An innovation, but also something that really made the talents of sound engineers strong! Although the film was very hard to hear, I realized that he had to start somewhere, so I can forgive this - especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking - a major innovation for 1930. <br /> <br /> The storyline resembles CIMARRON - a western that came out the following year and earned the Oscar for Best Picture. Unfortunately, CIMARRON is not a big movie and I like THE BIG TRAIL more due to the size of the movie. While some may struggle at the slow pace of THE BIG TRAIL, I saw it as a great history lesson about the rigors of trains traveling west in wagons. Plus, the whole thing just looked so nice when director Raoul Walsh had a lot of trouble filming on the spot, and THE BIG TRAIL looks almost like a movie version of some Ansel Adams prints, it was pretty good. This was a big break for young John Wayne, as his previous screen appearances were at best minor and inconspicuous. Here he got the lead role and did a dandy job - although he was obviously young and a little less "John Wayne-ish" than in later films, as his film personality was not yet firmly established. Another interesting role was played by Tyrone Power II (the father of Tyrone Power). He did not look like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like Bluto from the Popeye cartoons! He has made only a few sound films - he died only a year after filmmaking - so it is a rare opportunity to see and hear this once-famous actor. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is well worth seeing, despite some movies, sound problems and a few too long scenes here and there. This was a remarkable achievement in 1930 - more than the much more famous and award-winning CIMARRON the following year. The reason why THE BIG TRAIL did not win an Oscar was most likely because ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT came out in the same year and he really is one of the great movies.
