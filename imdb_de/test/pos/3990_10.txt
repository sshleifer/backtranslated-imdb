First, I absolutely loved this movie. As a fan of Billy Crystal, I have to say that I expected more weird situations than I actually had. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and unique to him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was outstanding in his first film role. When Sammy visits his client on the ground, he has turned his world upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the only person who could change his life. The journey of Sammy and Max is unique and moving and sometimes even funny. The place in the Czech Republic where parts of the film were filmed was absolutely beautiful. I have to say, this dramatic comedy has felt a variety of emotions. I thought it was excellent and would recommend it to anyone.
