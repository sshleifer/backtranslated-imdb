This is probably one of the best Portuguese movies I have ever seen ... I absolutely enjoyed the plot, because the way the story evolved would make you more concerned with how your world really is There was only one thing that did not really fit in the film, namely the girl strip ... Nothing important is added to the story. It seems like it's just for a fun man. The end is a bit unexpected, albeit something expected at the same time. If you do not understand it, then follow me: After so many weird incidents, the viewer is so used to curiosities that ending the movie with completely unexpected relationships (like Mimoso and Susana) sounds completely natural after the rest of the movie. Above all, variety Nula is a movie in which you have to think hard when you try to solve the mysterious situations, laugh at your unhappy life, and confuse your perception of what can happen in a few minutes when you turn around back from something ... for all that I rate it 8/10
