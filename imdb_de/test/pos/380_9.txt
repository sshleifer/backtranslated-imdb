Well, that's about as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was just a "master of commercial tension" or perhaps a "compulsive technician" - or whether he was really "deep". No one knows exactly what such terms mean, but it is legitimate to ask if he could not have done all three things at the same time in his best form. <br /> <br /> In this case, it seems to be at its peak. Hardly anything is accidental. It is full of doubt, ambiguity and joke. And the story is captivating, because Patricia Highsmith obviously has similar complexes to Hitchcock's own. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the story was thoroughly outlined elsewhere, so I will not take care of it. I would like to highlight only five incidents on the screen for which Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible. <br /> <br /> Bruno Antony (Walker) followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two friends at night to a carnival on purpose to kill her. She has noticed his attention and is flattered innocently. <br /> <br /> 1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to get through the tunnel of love to an island in the middle of the lake. Walker is right behind them and smiles in his boat - Pluto. "Pluto." It's not an allusion to the cartoon character of Walt Disney. It is a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This little touch can not be a coincidence. And the "underworld" that Walker portrays is not just a literal hell, but the underworld of the human mind. I hate to say that he is a Jungian "shadow", but that's what he is. (Did Carl Jung see this movie at the time of his release, he was still alive - but probably not.) 2. Well, this is a really serious episode, right? Walker is a madman who is murdering a woman he does not even know. Imagine how this would have been planned by most of the directors. A night game drive through a crowded carnival stealing from shadow to shadow, the killer peeking out from behind the canvas walls, and so on. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker first comes through the gates and focuses on his victim, a little boy in a cowboy suit with a balloon runs up and shouts: "Bang! Bang! You're dead!" Walker shakes his head in surprise and stares at the boy indignantly. And when the boy goes away, Walker pushes his cigarette on the balloon and presses it, then he continues his search without another look. This is how Hitchcock deals with the impending demise. <br /> <br /> 3. The famous choking was reflected in the fallen glasses, which were played countless times. <br /> <br /> 4. Miriam and her friends stick to one of these gadgets that you hit with a big hammer and send a kind of hockey stick into the shaft to measure the strength of your stroke. One of her friend hits it and the puck does not reach the bell above. Under Miriam's cheerful and admiring gaze, Walker smiles and rubs his hands together, then takes the hammer, knocks it down and the puck hits the bell. She is excited. He lays down the mallet, looks at her, grins, and WAGGLES HIS EYES like a ten-year showoff! 5. After discovering Miriam's body while whistling and calling people, Walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the curb. Walker takes the old guy by the arm and leads him across the intersection. He holds his hand seriously to stop the traffic. A macabre joke. These incidents and other incidents occur during the ten or fifteen minutes of the carnival visit. (The performance of Robert Walker is consistently extraordinary.) It's basically a sort of invitation to be noiric. (See: "Ride the Pink Horse") But the threat to the scene is undermined by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. None of the known noir techniques is used. There is nothing really "scary" about it. And the murder itself is hardly a savage. I do not think any director other than Hitchcock would have acted like him. It would have been all threat and shadow, hiding places, failed attempts, dark grins instead of grins. <br /> <br /> Not that it's a totally flawless movie. A flawless movie is not there yet. Part of the middle section is a bit slow and Farley Granger, though a nice guy, is rigid, boring and quite stupid. His new girlfriend is just boring. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock should treat the wrong blame in "The Wrong Man" with deadly seriousness. I'm not sure if Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal and moral guilt. The latter was imposed on him early by his Catholic education. "Original sin" - you are BORN with it - and all that. In filmed interviews, he explained his fear of the police and of the authorities in general by telling a story that his father had taken him to the police station to scare him after a peccadillo. We are entitled to ask if this is just what psychoanalysis calls "screen memory." I hope you get the wordplay. I know, I know. It's tense and inappropriate, but I've spent a lot of precious time figuring it out.
