This movie is well worth it in spite of everything you hear. The performance of Marie Dressler (I hope I write it right) as a drunk old Sot is reason enough to see this movie. It is an amazing achievement. She is in drunken stupor in three scenes for a long time and she never does the same thing twice. You can actually smell the alcohol when it's done. Amazing. And of course Greta speaks her first lines in the movie and is great. The Eugene O'Neill story is solid and, like most O'Neill stories, very deep and intense. This is not an easy conversation, but if you appreciate these great characters from the 30s and 40s, you will like it. A part of the film is technically fuzzy, but all in all worthwhile.
