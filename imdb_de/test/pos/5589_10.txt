I think Crewes did a great job doing her bad part, she should have won a prize. Anything Dunne carries is salvageable because Dunne is a great actress and can rip anything, even a faint script. Therefore, I would recommend it only for this reason. This movie may have been a bit ahead of its time, the plot could be more acceptable nowadays. During the golden age of Hollywood, movies should be entertained or taught, mostly to make us feel good about the times. This presentation seems to deviate from this profile. Again I have to say whatever Irene Dunne was "good" for making things so believable! The only other actress I can say made me think that way, maybe it was Deborah Kerr. Take a look at Silver Cord if you have the chance for the "show," if nothing else.
