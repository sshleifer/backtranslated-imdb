The best screen performance George C. Scott has ever made. The screenplay by Chayefsky, the ironic dialogue, is near perfect ("Where do you train only your nurses, Dachau?"). Rigg is wonderful as the rescue angel that saves Scott from setting, as well as the whole cast. It's a funny and serious movie. It's a movie from that time, the 60s, but it's not outdated in any way. What is at issue, the chaos and irrationality of the system over the reason of the individual, is timeless. And the monologue "We heal nothing, we heal nothing" (delivered, actually shouted, as no one else but Scott could do) with its references to cloning and other "wonders" of modern science could have been literally written this morning. <Br /> <br />
