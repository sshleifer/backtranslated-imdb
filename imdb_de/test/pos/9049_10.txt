If a joke does not offend anyone, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> The Inki cartoons are offensive, no doubt. That's rap music. Get over it. I suspect that any sensible black person will find the Inki cartoons comical and that the people who are offended by them are white people who still think blacks need their patronizing protection against racist humor. That makes me sad, not because someone is really offended, but because someone might be offended, I can not buy Inki cartoons or The African Queen or The Song of the South on DVD.
