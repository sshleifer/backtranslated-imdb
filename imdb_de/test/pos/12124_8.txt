Let me first say that, in my opinion, this is probably one of the 10 most underrated films since this movie was released in 72. I absolutely loved this movie, it's very urban, bleak, no real Hollywood glamor to feel for all the characters here, I love the blood splattering here in abundance. Joe Pesci was pretty good here, but to me it seems like he's definitely been outdone by the lead Joe Cortese, now I do not know about him, but he can really act boy. I think this movie is probably true Because you live in New Jersey and live near Philly, you always have these kinds of things here. I think if the movie had a bigger budget, and if you say Robert deniro as Jerry's boss, you would have a perfect movie, but who should I say, I was so fascinated by this movie that it's already in my head with Mean Streets. I wish Hollywood would return to this urbanized, edgy portrayal of filmmaking: It would do them a great deal to do that. This movie is a great drama with great actors. and I highly recommend it to anyone.
