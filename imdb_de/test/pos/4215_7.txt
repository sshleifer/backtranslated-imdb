I'll be honest, I only hired this movie because it was part of the "Child's Play" series. I also expected a boring, boring fourth part of the series, but I was surprised. This movie was surprisingly good and I thought it was pretty funny. There was a lot of dark humor, and the idea of ​​having two dolls was a great way to spice things up. The two puppets worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type to the movie. All in all, it was very good for a fourth movie in the series with some cruel death scenes (just watch the guy from marilyn manson get killed in the beginning, not to mention that John Ritter gets a face full of nails). Applaud the authors for spicing things up, and the end, though I found it a bit strange, leaves another follower ... maybe "son of the chuck" !!!
