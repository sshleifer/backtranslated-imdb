Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen" immerses the viewer in deeper depths of life for much of his life, with grim scenes of alcoholic humiliation, family violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages contain the mythical image of death itself. Death is here as a ghostly one Horse-drawn carriage driven by a miserable sinner who died last last night on New Year's Eve. For a year, the wretch must collect the souls of the newly deceased, and after twelve months of this terrible bondage, the driver's own soul is finally released when the last person to die on December 31st becomes the new driver. <br /> <br /> The scenes with this coach (known in English as "The Phantom Carriage" or "The Phantom Chariot") are sinister and mesmerizing. Using the double exposure camera, which was quite sophisticated in its time and is still effective today. Most notably, the coach drives to the bottom of the ocean to collect the soul of a drowned person. As intriguing as these scenes are, the main part of the film is the downward spiral of David Holm, which the director himself plays in an unobtrusive depiction of a man who has given up the possibility of a decent life. In flashbacks we see how Holm enjoys a nice day on the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he seems to be a normal guy. Abruptly, without explanation or explanation, we then see Holm as an alcoholic wreck, in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. Usually, this before-and-after jump feels like a lack of stories, but in this case, the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar dirty details ourselves. It is believed that Holm is being led astray by his friendly friend Georges, the drinking mate who first tells the story of the Phantom Carriage. But whatever the cause of his downfall, Holm seems to be a lost cause, a common drunk who becomes perverted. It is a pleasure to hurt his family and not to reform. <br /> <br /> Although David Holm is our central figure, the true catalyst of the story is a young rescue army that has a sympathetic interest in his case and stubbornly believes it despite his hateful behavior. If the nurse herself dies - indirectly due to her services to Holm - she asks to see him, inadvertently setting in motion a chain of events that will lead to his recovery. Sometimes this film resembles Dickens' story of Scrooge's use ghostly visitors who encourage a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life, suffer from his misconduct, and reform himself. I was also reminded of Sjöström's 1917 drama Terje Vigen, in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family disappeared (a sequence that is repeated here). The director also reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore, which was previously stated in his "Mountain Ejvind och hans hustru" (a.a., "The Outlaw and His Wife", 1918), that no man can escape his fate. This time, however, it could be argued that David Holm actually manages to escape his seemingly inevitable fate, for he has received an unexpected second chance for redress. Viewers who expect a fall into the supernatural will appreciate the sequences with the Phantom Carriage of the title, but may not be prepared for the painful investigation of this movie about the alcohol consumption of a disturbed man. If you feel like an intense and powerful silent drama, you will appreciate "Körkarlen" in its entirety. It stands with the best serious cinema of its time and is certainly one of the most successful works of Sjöström.
