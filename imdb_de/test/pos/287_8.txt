Anyone who criticizes "Jacqueline Hyde" for anything other than the playful and undeniably erotic bustle he's intended simply does not play with a full deck. It's obvious from the title alone that this low budget horror comedy should not be taken seriously ... It's as tongue in cheek as a nymphomaniac French kiss and just as lovely. The female actors are all great and fun to watch. Take a look, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown prince of softcore horror. Unlike most softcore horror films, this one is entertaining with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses. The film does not even try to follow the story of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic, but seeks out all possibilities to create exciting visual disturbances and erotic situations. Blythe Metz, the brunette Femme Fatale, who portrays the sexier, murderous side of Jacqueline, is a real knockout. Watch and enjoy!
