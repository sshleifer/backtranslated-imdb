This is one of the many techno-phobic films that mushroomed in the mid-'90s after the Internet became mainstream. Hollywood movies have always had their way to "embellish" the illustrated collections to make them better and more appealing. The same thing happens when Hollywood tries to show hi-tech. The result of such attempts varies from very far-fetched and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995) etc.) to quite realistic (see Sneakers (1992)). <br /> <br /> "The Net" is somewhere between these extremes. Pecking can lead to many technical inconsistencies, and in many cases the processes seem to be much "sexy" and more graphic than when things are in real life (as is common in movies). <Just by overlooking these elements, the viewer gets a pretty solid, entertaining movie. The characters and acting convince, and the film helps keep you in the seat until the very end. The plot is alright (a pretty normal, really - based on the good old paranoiac design, but this time with a high-tech edge) and quite convincing (even if technical issues are not considered). However, the plot's development is somewhat sluggish, and occasionally one can expect some supposedly surprising twists in the plot. <br /> <br /> The bonus here is Sandra Bullock, who besides being cute (something of her) makes it seem easy) also portrays a solid act. You can really feel her character - her despair, her feelings. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the movie is entertaining and interesting, about 7 out of 10 in my scale. It's worth renting from the video library or even watching in the cinema. Whether you buy it or not is up to you.
