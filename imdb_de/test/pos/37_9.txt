This is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times. I'll go so far as to set it up with Ray and The Aviator. It is the story of a young, two-race boy living in a boarding school run by the amazing Miss Rachael aka "Nanny". You will fall in love with Nanny, a woman who gives herself all around her. S. Epatha Merkerson miraculously brings the character to life, and the other performers do the same. If I praised every actor for the way they played their roles, I would have to mention everyone in the entire cast. <br /> <br /> The music in this film fits in perfectly with the story and almost determines the course. And besides, this movie is really entertaining. It will not bore you, not even for a minute! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend an evening at home to watch a very smart, entertaining and high quality movie.
