If you've been looking for a movie chained with a runaway nympho to a cooler by an extremely religious man from the South, look for Paramount Vantage's latest release, "Black Snake Moan." Not exactly looking for what I just described you? Well, they will take you to your local theater and you will still see how Samuel L. Jackson's character, Lazarus, would say. As long as you are open-minded and do not take everything seriously, there is no reason that you will not leave the theater happy when you have seen it. <br /> <br /> In the third offer from director Craig Brewer we are in the deep south, where, as the slogan of the film claims, everything gets hotter. As we introduce ourselves to the God-fearing Bluesman, Lazarus, as I said, plays by Jackson and the almost half-naked Rae; a role that Christina Ricci has taken courageously. In the film, this unlikely couple crosses for so long that their characters can learn from each other a lesson. Both lessons ultimately convey the message to the audience that we are all human. Nobody is perfect, and if everyone remembered, we would be much better off. The question of whether this is understood or accepted by anyone who sees the film is another story. <br /> <br /> One thing that's not up for debate is how awesome Jackson and Ricci are here. With the role of a woman with a sexual mind you would think that exaggeration is a matter of course, but no, not here. Ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that doubles their best performance yet. Then we have Jackson, who disappears completely and for the first time in a long time lets us forget who he is. Unfortunately, the third star of the movie, Justin Timberlake, who plays Raes military friend, is not great. At first he fails miserably, as he seems to try too hard. Later it rises slightly higher, but still far from the level it reached in January with "Alpha Dog". <br /> <br /> The other thing Black Snake Moan offers is a great soundtrack. It includes tracks from The Black Keys, John Doe, scores from Scott Bomar's score and, of course, four, they count, four tracks by Jackson himself. It's actually one of his songs, the main production of the movie, 'Stackolee', which fuel for this great collection forms. It alone is worth the ticket price. Other notable musical delights from the soundtrack include Bomar's "The Chain," "When the Lights Go Out" by the Black Keys, and the theme song, which is also one of the most memorable scenes in the film in which Lazarus sings to Rae on a stormy night. <br /> <br /> Craig Brewer's efforts, however, can not go unnoticed. His latest movie, Hustle & Flow, which ultimately surpassed low expectations and was recognized by critics, put him on the map. What he did with "Black Snake Moan" is what sets him apart from other newbies in the industry. He not only directed, but also wrote his screenplay. The end result is a story that is surprising and smart. When you watch, you feel that, despite his brave serenity, you know exactly where you are going. Just as you think you predicted the next step, Brewer leaves the corridors and walks in a completely different way. However, there are some spots in the script. The background figures are monotonous and flat, while the end is a bit disappointing. It made me want something more exciting. After so many heights, I guess the final scenes were a bit weak compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that the majority of people who see "Black Snake Moan" will not enjoy it because of the movie. In fact, they can not stop themselves from thinking about how unlikely the situations are , The depressing part is that there are many other films with equally unlikely, even more outrageous, scenarios that are generally well received. It is the issues of race, religious motives and sexuality that the film shows that have more influence on opinion than anything else. The idea of ​​a black man chaining a white woman in his home is enough to make most people not even see it. Simply put, it's not for everyone. As I said, to fully enjoy it, you have to be open minded, otherwise you will just be wasting your money. For those of you who can, I highly recommend it.
