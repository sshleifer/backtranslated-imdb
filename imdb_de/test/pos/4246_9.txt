The film begins with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than that he is black and the agency needs a "marker" on the board. Swope ignores the meeting and reads the jet magazine at the big table, and everyone ignores Swope ... Suddenly the CEO croaks on the spot. There is no time wasted. A janitor is called to pick up the body, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the election of a new CEO. And as the votes are counted one after the other, the tension builds and is finally brought to a wittingly ironic climax, giving the viewer a delicious meal with logical implications that he can enjoy for the rest of the movie. If you've ever spoken to a stupid TV commercial, you'll like to watch this movie. Too bad that there are no real Putney Swopes in the world.
