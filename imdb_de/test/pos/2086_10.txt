This movie was full of suspense and well directed, the black and white effect made it a big mystery. Fay Emerson (Hilda Fenchurch), who was twice married to the famous musician Skitch Henderson and the son of Elliott Roosevelt (FDR son), fell in love with Zachary Scott (Ronnie Mason / Marsh). Ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture, including Mona Freeman (Anne Fenchurch), and suggests whenever he can. Rosemary DeCamp (Dr. Jane Silla) (famous radio and television actress in the '30s and' 40s mainly played the town of MOM'S) warned the ladies against Ronnie Masons sick mind and abusive childhood that he grew up as a child, what his love / his Hate triggered a relationship with women. Fay Emerson and Zachary Scott would be better stars with more rewarding roles, but their lives were short lived in real life. This film is indescribable, it is a very great classic from the year 1945, which many generations can see and enjoy!
