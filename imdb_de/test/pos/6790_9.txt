First of all let me say that I find films like Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile and most of Spielberg absolutely horrible and twisted. Although National Velvet seems to be in the same genre on the surface and has really crooked moments, I really enjoyed it, laughing and roaring throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The premise of the plot A young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the Grand National is certainly as implausible as it could be, but it's the only thing you have to accept so that it acts as a fairy tale or allegory. The characters have depth and grow throughout the story. Ann Revere gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the smartest women ever portrayed in an American movie. Her interaction with the kind-hearted Donald Crisp is funny and sweet. While Liz Taylor tries a little too much to be even nicer than Margaret O'Brien (she succeeds, by the way), her passion and love for her horse radiates through her face. Mickey Rooney gives the coach a nicely nuanced performance. <br /> <br /> This is far from a perfect movie. Some of the situations and scenes are a bit crazy and outdated (the antics of the kids and the scenes of Rooney at the racetrack and in the pub, for example), but that does not matter. The plot stays true to the characters and leaves a lot unsaid. We have no unnatural, extremely dramatic and preaching moments - sometimes less is more. The final scene is a great example of this - the emotional dialogue is left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Strong imprudent achievements, well-rounded characters, striking dialogues, intelligent and consistent action. We believe in the characters and are moved by their story. Yes, they just do not do it anymore ...
