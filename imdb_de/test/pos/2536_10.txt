This is a difficult film and would have been even more difficult if I had known then that the actor who plays the protagonist was killed by police in his home at the age of 19 is caused by a murder in which he is not involved was. He is involved in a juvenile detention center, in which he testifies to brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens strongly believe does not exist. When he finally escapes, he and three comrades survive with the only means they know, crime. What makes the movie so heartbreaking is that both Pixote and the actor representing him do not want to be the living conditions of the characters. Pixote tries to trust and love and bind, but in his world there is simply no place for the gentle side of human nature. You're left in the end and desperately want to do something for the Pixotes of the world, but what? Building more children's prisons with higher walls is certainly not the answer ...
