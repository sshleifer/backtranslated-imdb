I also saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager then, and I saw it with my girlfriend, who later became my wife. I remember that the movie made me feel the chances. The camera was very well done, if the memory is right for me. The boy was a bit much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and maybe that was the intro for the first time with my girlfriend at the time. I have not seen the movie since then and wander off why it has fallen by the wayside. I would like to revisit it to see if it was as good as I remember. The Elton John soundtrack was excellent.
