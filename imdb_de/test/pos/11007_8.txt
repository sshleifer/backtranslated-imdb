_Saltmen_ is a long movie for its genre, and often the tempo is much slower than what is expected of the Western audience. Still, I liked it both in terms of interesting topics and the great pictures this movie contains. Some of the landscapes are truly breathtaking, and there is enough interest that most _Saltmen_ can survive with minimal use of the fast-forward. <br /> <br />
