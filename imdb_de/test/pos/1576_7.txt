I just finished this impressively nutty affair, and although I can not say it was as good as I had imagined, it was still an effective and at times quite evil brain that distorted J-Trash and infuriated with misogyny was. His story is about a poor girl looking for her sister, who is eventually raped and drugged by yakuza buggers, and the helpful doctor who seeks revenge for a similar rape and drug trafficking in a bizarre, gruesome way. Oh yes, and there is also a bit of straight sex, unfortunately, all this is a very soft core, such as the Japanese rejection of nudity under the belt, but the pixelation is minimal, in fact, only perceptible in a funny blow job scene. Although writer / director Kazuo "Gaira" Komizu fails to create a particularly compelling story, this is at least a scary stuff. He dives early into the well of filth with a rather disquieting rape (which gets worse because the girl looks somehow young, I'm pretty sure she was of age.) For the most part, these are pretty professional-looking things , maybe not stylish, but it has a certain flair and the content is reasonably well-handled, with special kudos that largely avoid having to use a lot of pixellation.Things are mostly sex / rape for about two-thirds of the runtime and it is pretty good to watch if you turn on at such a price, it gets stunned after some time, but the ladies are eye friendly and it can be quite hard at times.The music of YÃ´ichi Takahashi is occasionally effective, although hardly an important part of the In some places the show perfectly complements, at least so big that I can tell more powerful are the effects of Nobuaki Koga, who in their appearance spray an impressively sparkling punch, which is supported by the insane nature of the climate-friendly phenomena. Things are even dragging on to a strange-looking ending, sure it's not lamenting or anything like that, but for a movie that's so run-of-the-mill for most of its duration, it's relatively poignant. All in all, this is a pretty entertaining distraction for mid-sized trash fans, especially those who like Japanese Rapey adventures. I could really have done it with a longer revenge section and more gore, maybe more with a point / mind, but hey, it kept watching me and it's pretty well filled with memorable moments. So, if you dig this kind of degenerated garbage, it's probably worth the time. Do not expect the second coming.
