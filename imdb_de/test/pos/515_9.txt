Well, here is a movie that does something that has not been done for a long time. It requires about ten different elements that we are already familiar with (vampires, martial arts, techno beat, top-o-the-line special effects, etc.), and make something that feels brand new. In something that could have just been a combination of "Mortal Kombat" and "Buffy: The Vampire Slayer", Wesley Snipes (not my favorite since and especially because of "Passenger 57") gives a really good turn when the half human / half bloodsucker. He acknowledges the internal conflict but does not elaborate on it as necessary. He makes Blade as deep as Michael Keaton did Batman. <br /> <br /> I'll say that the only part of the movie that made me a little tired was the ever-present horror movie clich√© of this one person. The hero happens to know who exactly knows how to catch the bad guy can stop. On the other hand, somehow you have to have that in a movie like this, so it's easy to excuse. <br /> <br /> Well, Snipes is good. And Steven Dorff, who was hyped in the previews, makes the hero of Snipes more than bad enough. He has instruction, presence and enough control in his little finger to teach Al Pacino how to weaken him a bit. Who would ever think that a comic film would be a starting point for an actor? I sincerely hope it is so. And whoa! Where the hell did Kris Kristofferson get acting talent? Do not get me wrong, but the prolific actor has not done anything reminiscent since Millennium, and how many of us have seen it just because of the cool video box? Well, here he is, people, in a very obi-wanish twist, as Blade's mentor and father figure. And also a good job. <br /> <br /> The quality of acting is determined by the quality of the choreography and the special effects. Accompanied by a pulsating techno beat, the fight scenes bring back memories of Mortal Kombat and drive them away quickly. Hello! It also had a script! I wondered what had happened to all the good writers there. <br /> <br /> The two most important clues that I saw a quality movie were these; I had no regrets about paying the full price to get in, such as every Schumacher "Batman", "The Avengers", "MK: Annihilation", "Godzilla" or "Armageddon". (wow, how many of them came out this year? Ugh) Also, I'm looking forward to the inevitable sequel, like the end of the movie. Let's just hope they do as good a job as they did the first one. <br /> <br />
