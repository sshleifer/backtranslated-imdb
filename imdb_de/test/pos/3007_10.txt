I just started watching the show in July. I accidentally thought that I was surfing the Channel while vacationing. It's a great show, I just wish it was not so late at night. It is at 12:30. As a working person, it is difficult to see all the time. <br /> <br /> I read some comments. I did not agree with the late age of not being grown up in the '60s and not believing that this stuff could happen. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the 60s. I am Hispanic and had a "white" friend and we had black friends in high school. I think people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a particular race or color. That way, I can see it from the beginning.
