Comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with Mike Myers 'Austin Powers' and Rowan Atkinson's 'Johnny English' and, most recently, Steve Carell in the big-screen version of the hit show 'Get Smart!' Recorded from 60. <br /> <br /> In 1974, David Jason wore a shoulder holster and a briefcase full of documents labeled "Classified". <br /> <br /> The Top Secret Life of Edgar Briggs' was his first starring role in a sitcom, having spent years as a supporting actor in shows such as "Six Dates With Barker", the "Doctor" series and "Hark At Barker "had played. <br /> <br /> Humphrey Barclay had found him in a pier theater in Bournemouth and was impressed enough to join him in the children's comedy show "Do not Adjust Your Set." starring Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle " Take. <br /> <br /> "TTSLOEB" cast Jason as "Edgar Briggs," a well-meaning but incompetent Secret Intelligence Service agent. While John Steed wore a melon, Briggs had a trilby. While Napoleon Solo had a radio pin with him, Briggs had a whistle. Objects fell into his hands. He read confidential documents in bed while his wife (Barbara Angell) searched Woman's Own (on one occasion it would be the other way round). As he pursued two Russian agents to a heliport, he accidentally switched on the airport's Tannoy system and transferred his plans to arrest her. Hiding in a train to meet a S.I.S. Man and his enemy contact, it went with him on board and brought him directly to Brighton! When he tried to organize the overflow of a Russian scientist, he took a shortcut to escape his pursuers, only to land hopelessly lost in a parking lot. But like "Inspector Clouseau", in the end he always seemed to be at the top, much to the annoyance of his colleagues. As already mentioned, he was married. His wife Jennifer understood the kind of work he did. Even though they once had a fight, she called him from the window of her high-rise apartment: "Secret Service this, Secret Service that !, you never stop thinking of the Secret Service!". He called back, "Think of the neighbors, they should not know that I'm in the Secret Service!". Briggs was part of an agent team whose "Coronation Street" included the number. Villain Mark Eden (he was the psychotic Alan Bradley) as "Spencer", Michael Stainton as "Buxton" and "Doctor At Sea" Elisabeth Counsell as the adorable "Cathy Strong". They answered "The Commander", played by the late Noel Coleman. The Commander was abducted in one episode, temporarily leaving Briggs for S.I.S. was responsible. - which of course scared everyone. <br /> <br /> This hilarious show was made by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna, who had written for the "Doctor" series. Instead of fooling Bond, it was more like a show of serious spy shows like 'Callan' (though it had a Bond style theme). Stealth meetings in underground garages, code breaking, stolen missile plans, something like that. Jason put a lot of energy into the role and did many of his own stunts, such as Briggs, who fell off a ladder decorating his apartment and tumbled down a hill in a wastepaper basket "Pink Panther" movies. <br /> <br /> "Briggs" had all the ingredients to become a hit. Unfortunately it was not networked. In Greater London, it was shut down Sunday at 7.25 in the morning. where it is in the ratings by the soap drama "The Brothers" by B.B.C. It was then moved to Fridays at 7 PM. because I.T.V. wanted to present his latest American import - the TV version of 'Planet Of The Apes'. Briggs never found an audience. A similar fate befell the next big show of Jason: 1976 'Lucky Feller'. Only in 1977 and "A Sharp Intake Of Breath" he found his first successful solo vehicle. <br /> <br /> The title sequence (together with two short excerpts in German!) For this series can be seen on Youtube. That's unfortunately all you can see. Jason will not allow his early lead roles to be either repeated or released on D.V.D. A big shame. At the moment, however, Edgar Briggs' life must remain top secret. <br /> <br /> CODA: I've seen a lot of episodes lately, and I'm glad it's going so well.
