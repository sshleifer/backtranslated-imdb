This is a funny, smart movie that pays off. In my opinion, it's a lot better than American Pie and other films of the same genre that seem to be constantly being snapped out. I had not heard of this movie yet, so he probably did not get much press, which is a pity. It does not take itself too seriously, but at the same time delivers a serious message to people about life and life experiences and about what matters ... Unlike a movie about a bunch of desperate boys trying to get to bed for the first time to go and a guy who puts his dick in a pie, but in the end everyone is laid and whoop-de-do ... What impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy American pop punk. .. They actually had a real punk back then like the Ramones ... That made the movie even better! To be honest, I did not expect much from this movie and I was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy is.
