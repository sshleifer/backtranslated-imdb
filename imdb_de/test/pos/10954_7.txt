17.12.01 All I can do with this film is to improvise my impressions. I did not get the "changes", I do not know the "score" and I'm not trained in the genre. I've always had problems with chord changes anyway (trumpet player, you know), so I was pretty well limited to keeping an eye on the basic "Keep the tune" and doing ad lib all around. What bothered me about this incredibly atmospheric black-and-white blues tune was the knot that was in my mind and heart as I tried to figure out if I should go with the ensemble or make a path along the melody (story). should go search as usual with the tune; I got lost again and again on the changes - too deep, extensive, probably over my head. Still, it was a gas to try to keep up. I admired how the actors played the theme and the story. I have not seen some things or heavier things, the others seem to seem: I did not feel that the fair skin was "trying to get away" as much as either they were unaware of the color or wanted to ignore it first: later she came back and fought. The young man with fair skin (his trumpet noodles mas ridiculous) was ambiguous, ambivalent and - possibly his best feature - removed. What, I thought after closing the shadow curtain on this provocative piece - is the foundation for such a thing? Is it a way to find "reality" by setting up a stage, populating it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and a theme? Is it more real or true than a well-done script - without the benefit of editing and revising? Is improvisation heroic, "artier"? - more than just a job? Where is there a greater or clearer truth: in retrospective craftsmanship or in fabrication and reformation? Well, I'm still lost on this issue. I loved the movie. It got lost in a cool, blue, misty evening, when I just had to go home and get my horn out. Guess what? I broke out in a twelve-bar blues riff, tried and true - I could not turn away from the melody. The reality is just too scary. jaime says, give them a 7 and more. I'm taking a break
