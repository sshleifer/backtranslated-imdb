Most of the films Brigitte Bardot saw I could not fully exploit their captivating screen presence. Unfortunately, she got few really good roles in films of unquestionable quality, which was a real oversight. She deserved her and could demonstrate her full cinematic power when approaching her. As Genevieve in "Love on a Pillow," we had a clear exception to the trend of light, fluffy vehicles because it was an interesting artistic film in every respect, in which a 28-year-old BB was seductive. "Une Parisienne" is another, with an extremely intriguing Brigitte in an interesting, well-done comedy examining how an ambitious woman-woman can be persuaded to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young woman. There are several good services here. Her playboy husband Michel is one, "the prince", played by Charles Boyer, and another, with entertaining efforts from a good minor cast. Brigitte Bardot looks in this film as I remember her as a child in her fifties. She was 23 years old in 1957 and far ahead of her time, more beautiful than any other actress of the time, including Marilyn Monroe. Her curvy, coquettish sexuality, which is abundantly presented in various, tight, skin-tight dresses, simply jumps off the screen. She was more hip and sweet than the women of America today, almost fifty years later. Obsessed with her career and still desperately clinging to feminist politics, they come away like a bunch of unsuspecting lesbians. In contrast, the kitten was sexually liberated, intelligent, and clearly independent long before it was fashionable, and although she fully understood the power of her extraordinary femininity, she used it for a purpose beyond mere self-interest - she believed love. A statue could not do it justice. They had to watch their slender but luscious shape (with a waist of 20 inches) pass easily through a room. They had to see that wild blonde mane, look into their big, brown, seductive eyes, and hear their full, sulking lips speak French. In a close-up at the end of this film, she winks and flirts with the camera, her beautiful balls sparkling. What a hot bride! For fans of Brigitte Bardot "Une Parisienne" is not to be overlooked.
