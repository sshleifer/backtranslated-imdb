From the beginning to the end witty, the courage of death must be mastered with a smile, especially when two funeral homes are fighting for control of the market: a classic salon and a revolutionary one in which every funeral is a show by Christopher Walken, a treat in the role of the visionary American Mortitian. But the rest of the cast is awesome and this success is another success that only UK can achieve. Surprising among the ensembles is Naomi Watts, who beats in another metamorphosis (accent included). Always with a smile on their faces, it seems a paradox that a movie could make so much comedy that could be called "Four Funerals and a Wedding," but you'll understand it when you see it.
