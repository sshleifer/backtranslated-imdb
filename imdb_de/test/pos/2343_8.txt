I have to admit that this film and its talented director do not get the praise they deserve. We hope that the DVD performs very well and makes both accessible to a wider audience. The actors have shown outstanding performances and the plot is excellent. Maybe the movie is a bit long, but May Miles Thomas seems to excite her actors when they perform well, and sometimes keeps them in longer close-ups than necessary. Good for the actors, I'm sure, but sometimes, as a spectator, you're ready to move on, so to speak. May Miles earns more recognition from the film industry than one of the leading digital film directors.
