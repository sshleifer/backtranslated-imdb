I was shocked to learn that Jimmy Caan left the show. Does anyone know why? I regard James as one of the greatest greats of all time and was not surprised that he had landed on TV, which can be better than the crap you see on the big screen. The stories are smooth and the camera faster than a racing ball! I can not forget the rest of the cast: James, Vanessa (yum!) Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch. Anyway, anyone can tell me why there's a junk theme on the DVD sets on the DVD, but Elvis' JXL remix of When the first NBC broadcasts is used a little less conversation? Does not it make sense to use a tune that would link you to the America's gambling mecca for DVD releases?
