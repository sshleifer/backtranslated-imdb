This is a very solid Randolph Scott Western. He plays Bat Masterson and goes to Liberal, Kansas to clean up the city. He befriends Robert Ryan, who plays a very direct lead role. Only then did Robert Ryan begin to play much darker roles. In fact, Randolph Scott shot another film in 1947, which was not Western and then nothing was done but Western, until he retired in 1962. I can not say more, because that would betray the conspiracy. Make sure you see these. 8.10
