This movie is surprisingly good. The ninja fight sequences were incredible. I have not seen all of Sho Kosugi's films, but that's probably the best of the ones I've seen. Probably the most impressive combat sequence was at the beginning, when Ninja killed about 20 people. This was one of the most impressive ninja combat sequences I have ever seen. Another good fighting sequence was at a burial by the cops, where the Ninja provides more people to bury. The last fight was also very impressive. I also kind of liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for a ninja movie, in fact it was a bit different from other ninja movies. So if you're a fan of Ninja movies, you'll probably like them.
