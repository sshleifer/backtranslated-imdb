When this movie came out, I saw Geena Davis playing soft, feminine roles ... This movie was anything but soft and feminine. Great lines, great action ... she and Samuel L really clicked. Too violent for the kids, but if you and your partner are trying to get a movie together, try this movie. Go Geena! Go Geena!
