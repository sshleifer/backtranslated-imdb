Michael (played by Steven Robertson) has a Zerebalparese and lives a quiet and boring life in Carrigmore Residential Home. When a newcomer, Rory (McAvoy), makes friends with him, he shows Michael how he can overcome the disability. Despite or because of Rory's crippling disability (unable to move his head and a few digits on his hand), Rory is fiercely independent and extremely rebellious. His influence on calm and restraint Michael is spectacular, and the two soon leave the nursing home to build a life in the outside world where they recruit the help of Siobhan (Romola Garai) as a nursing assistant. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the jewels of the year! Similar to last year in America, the film goes from extremely funny to stressful, touching, exciting and really moving, without being sugar sweet. O'Donnell knew exactly where to tug at the heart and where the story and the characters were supposed to do their thing, and so a wonderful movie was created where we should all drop by the surface and see what was in it /> <br /> The film's true strengths lie in the main characters. Your characters are so convincing that you really believe they are disabled. It's incredible to convey humor and sadness in addition to the already great performances. The couple really seems to be close friends, and as their story unfolds, they completely care about them. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best examples of the movie this year, which simply tells a very relevant story. If this movie does not touch your heart, you must contain pure ice.
