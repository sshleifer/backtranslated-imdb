I have just tested El Padrino in Germany. A great movie. We look forward to more films by Mr. Chapa in the future. It was wonderful to see such a well-made film with such tension and a story that should remain an instant classic. The ending with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a sequel. Seeing Chapa's serious potential and his ability as a writer, actor, director and filmmaker really characterizes Chapa's quality film. Chapa has impressed many with his triumphant performance in "Blood In and Blood Out", and now he has proven to everyone that his works show his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with real artistic control. Few filmmakers can afford that.
