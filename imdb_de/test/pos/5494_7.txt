This is another Eastwood movie that mixes intrigue, action and a bunch of romance, along with "The Gauntlet", "Firefox" and so on. The drama series by Clint is now well known. In this case, he is taciturn and a little outrageous, especially among women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the movie itself is a surprise. it is above average. <br /> <br /> Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who might not catch the bullet that killed JFK in case of doubt. He then took what his family drove away and is now trudging through the bureaucracy until John Malkovitch contacts him and calls himself "Booth", who enters into a kind of twisted relationship with him, based on their shared, disappointed belief that everything is meaningless, except the urge to avoid tristesse and predictability. Well, this is rather an unsightly group of settings that a performer like Clint should project, but he does it well, less robotically than usual. And he seems to carry the memory of this moment in Dallas like a stone load with him. He tested again in the middle of this movie. He hangs on the roof of a tall building and grabs Booth's hand. He pulls his gun and points it at Booth, who asks him if he really wants to shoot. Of course, if he does, he will save the president from being assassinated by a CIA-trained murderer, but at the expense of his own life. Booth pinches the situation as they hold their hands in the middle of the air. And Clint even has a short talk with Renee Russo about his failure to save the president in Dallas. "If I had reacted fast enough, I could have taken this shot ... and that would have been good for me." It is underplayed, but his voice stifles slightly, his eyes become watery and his lips tremble. It is one of the few scenes in Clint's films that could actually be described as "moving". We know from his newfound determination that this time round he would take the bullet. (The irony is that he does not like the current president, who could?) He makes pompous speeches in Colorado about how they "carved a nation out of the wild." Did not they do the same in Las Vegas?) <br /> It is often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It's not true, nothing is so simple, but in that case, one could argue for the truth value. The reptile John Malkovitch with his Tatar eyes is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Talk about Disillusioned. Okay, he can weaken it a bit and sniff with contempt, even if he puts two innocent hunters between the eyes, but on the screen he is fascinating. Renee Russo has little to do. Fred Thompson, as head of the White House, is now back in politics, a relief to the moviegoers. If Clint's acting area is limited, Thompson is a little less. In every film he was in, he wears the same serious and dissatisfied expression as if he were constantly plagued by some form of volcanic indigestion. <br /> <br /> The direction of Wolfgang Peterson is as good as in "The Boat," which is pretty good. There is a lot of the usual exciting cross sections in the last shooting. And as Clint and Russo fall into a passionate hug in their hotel room and two weasels scurry back to the bed in the heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet and a series of objects falling to the floor - not just the usual garments, but handcuffs, pistols, beeers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy watches and other obstacles. Clint lies on the bed, interrupted and sighs: "Now I have to put all the stuff back on." <br /> <br /> Well written and worth seeing.
