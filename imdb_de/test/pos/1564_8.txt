A great achievement from Emily Grace! I stumbled across this movie as I rummaged through my satellite lists and was curious about the summary of my satellite service's plot. I was very entertaining and had a lot of sympathy for the character "Alice" by Emily Grace. History let me guess what would happen to Alice and was unpredictable. The overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the minor characters. The end of the story ended pretty fair. I will buy this DVD to add to my library. I am a new fan of Emily Grace and I am looking forward to seeing more of her performances.
