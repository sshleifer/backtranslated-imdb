Since I did not read the book, I was more open to the fresh interpretation that each director gives to his medium (which is film and not "on the letter") to this film. I was happy that the Holocaust that was taking place in Russia (and its neighboring countries) finally got some attention. The Nazis were particularly cruel to Russians and Russian Jews. If you read the story and see the monuments built in Smolensk and the surrounding regions, you will understand this film and understand why many have remained silent when they should have persuaded and I hope that more stories emerge from it. It's about time.
