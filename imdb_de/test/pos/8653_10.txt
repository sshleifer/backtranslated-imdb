The movie is a great watch, very thoughtful. I think it's a movie about what it would be like if you lived in a world created by catalogs. The scenes are all perfect replicas of an Ikea catalog that they even see on TV. When they break into the kitchen, they break into another perfect picture of what a kitchen would look like in a catalog. When he is born again or whatever you want to call it, he returns to the harsh reality of life. I love that bit when he tells his new love that he left his partner. It's fun to be commercially lucky by saying that you can have everything, and although it's nice to have the same things, but some things you do not want to share. A film without children also ensures a perfect ten by Say.
