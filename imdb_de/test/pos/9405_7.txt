Anyway, when the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the help of flashbacks we can see the relationships that Martha has entered ... Unattended boys who can come without a mother to help and a father who has always been looped ... <br /> <br /> Plus the fact that they portray the real Martha as if she were a movie star ... she was a cute sweet girl next door. Apart from that, the other characters were really great, especially Jon Foster and Toby Moore, who played as Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel, respectively.
