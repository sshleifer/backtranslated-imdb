Was very happy to see the movie Hari Om at the Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and it was a wonderful movie. It was beautifully filmed in India and I would like to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the film. Apparently he was also in the movie .. Monsoon Wedding. He was the absolute star of the show. Benoit's character broke me ... was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great, too. They were all great! There were many great scenes like those with the monkeys. And basically, I just loved the movie. Everyone who went out raved about it and it was certainly a highlight of the film festival. Was my favorite from the festival. It has captured the liveliness of India really beautiful and can not believe how beautiful India is. The feeling when leaving the cinema ... was a real highlight. It's a delightful, happy movie. I loved it!!
