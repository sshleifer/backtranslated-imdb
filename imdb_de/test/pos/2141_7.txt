I have been a fan of Heaven's Gate since its first release. I have seen it at least half a dozen times and have long considered it a masterpiece. With excitement and anticipation, I then undressed to see the restored Director's Cut. To my surprise, I was disappointed that I saw him again and have revised my assessment of the director's film. Heaven's Gate touches some of the size, but overall it lacks the thematic and narrative consistency and the passionate urgency of a really great movie. <br /> <br /> First of all two technical problems: The sound quality diffuses at times diffusely for a while. Part of it may be intentional - a way to mimic the chaos and confusion of history as it unfolds. At important points, however, one can not register what the characters say. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is similarly diffuse. The images lack sharpness and detail. The result is a certain graininess and a lack of sharpness that blurs the foreground and the background. Structurally, the narrative is through and through, as if Cimino could not quite decide the effect he is after He certainly wanted an epic. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film is uncomfortable and unconvincing between styles and maybe even genres. Sometimes it reminded me of Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven' or even 'Elvira Madigan' in her slow tempo and her elegant scene painting. At other times, it threatens to turn into a robust "Western" similar to "The Wild Bunch". In fact, the latter film provides an instructive reference point for an assessment of "Heaven's Gate," since it shares the same period and uses a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker but more heroic America. <br /> <br /> This structural and thematic uncertainty is not helped by the inferior script, which often sounds forced and shattering. The result is an inauthentic feeling of the periodic language. <br /> <br /> The size of the Celestial Gate lies in its set pieces. Especially the roller skating sequence is amazingly beautiful and one of the most impressive scenes ever shot. <br /> <br /> Another set that works well when themes, moods and scenery are unified Kristofferson and Huppert ride the new rig to the lake and she washes herself while he takes a nap in the shade. The slow tempo, the evocative music and the monumental scenery combine in this scene to convince the love story that could perhaps be at the center of the film, and whose saving grace could have been if it were pursued more convincingly. > Some critics have complained about the length of the film. That alone does not bother me. A good movie can not be long enough. The recovered minutes are critical to restoring the motivation and characterization lacking in the edited version, and they are full of pictorial interest. <br /> <br /> Heaven's Gate's main fame may well be the painfully evocative soundtrack. The repeated waltz motive and its different ratings (entire band, guitar, solo violin, etc.) give the foreground action a haunting quality and create a thematic consistency that the narration itself lacks. Despite their obvious effect flaws, especially the lack of a captivating narrative, there is a sense of the size of the movie. You leave the cinema with an unfortunate feeling of missing size and the desire that Cimino could revisit the movie with the wisdom of the times and afterwards to correct what is so bad.
