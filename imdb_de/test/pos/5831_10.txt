OZ is an old television series from HBO. It shows life in a security prison called Oswald, but the main task focuses on Emerald City, one of the prison stages. <br /> <br /> Oz has an amazing plot and a great cast! There are many characters and almost all of them are very interesting. Basically, they are divided into groups (gangs), the Sicilians, the blacks, the Aryans, the gays, the Latinos and many others, who do not have a specific group, but have to do with many others like Ryan O'Reily (the Irish) <br /> <br /> The plot is very well built, there is much conspiracy inside, a lot of struggle for power. But all this is not only visible in the form of violence, everything is very intelligent and clever, nothing happens for no reason, everything is connected and very interesting to guess! I love this series very much and if you want to see something intelligent that is produced very well with a good cast and good performances, OZ must see!
