It is along the line of the comedy of errors, the erroneous affection that is transmitted from one to another flowers and inherits. Flares of Passion, sparks of fire kindled and extinguished? Probably she loves, he loves or loves her? Emotional cycle that develops, liberates, hides, but does not hide, wants to let him know, wants to let her know, inform? Good ensemble despite the seemingly confusing mix of feelings of different participants. <br /> <br /> It's a refreshing charmer, casual, free and simple and pretty down to earth - not Hollywood-glamorous like "Notting Hill" but lots of human feelings, frailty and vulnerability. Yes, everything is about an accidental (lost &) love letter. Kate Capshaw, owner of the city's bookstore, has a plethora of characters portrayed by seemingly unspoiled Mrs. Scattergoods by Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Tom Everett Scott, Gloria Stuart, Alice Drummond, and Geraldine McEwan. Romance is in the air, love lurks everywhere. You will appreciate the talented Kate Capshaw. ("The Alarmist" is another bizarre little movie that's fun: Capshaw has a wonderful chemistry with David Arquette and Arquette with Stanley Tucci). <br/> <br/> "Notting Hill" captivates in its revolving story with the glittering couple of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant and the wonderful support of his circle of friends (London). "Love Letters" is adorable in its quirky town (Loblolly) and its story, in which Kate Capshaw's centrifugal wave effects on her friends and neighbors are involved. Both, maybe fantasies, somehow felt better if it happened to you. And if you appreciate words or poetic lines, this movie might be for you.
