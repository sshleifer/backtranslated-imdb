This show is actually pretty good. Like all shows on TV, it has good and bad consequences. I've read where people compare this show to Married with Children, and I think it's a similar show for the new generation. However, due to the expectations and permission that was expected and permitted on television during the Married with Children days, the show has been extended to extreme proportions to show that it is indeed a television program that should not be taken seriously <br /> The War at Home has the luxury of being a bit more realistic. Parents talk to each other like parents do in real life and tell their children one thing when they turn around and do the opposite. Sure, some of the content can be considered controversial. But I think this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are many families, just like these. <br /> <br /> Each episode teaches a 'valuable lesson'. It's just that sometimes the lesson is that you do not find a perfect solution to every problem a family is facing, and sometimes the solution is to choose the lesser of the two evils. We all know that in some cases, as a parent, the only goal you can have is to protect your children from great difficulties, and hope that they learn right from wrong. I respect the authors for trying to keep the show alive instead of having a magical ending, as the Cleaver family has always done.
