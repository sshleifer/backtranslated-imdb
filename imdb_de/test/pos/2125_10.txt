I have a four year old daughter, and before this movie, it was all about the Disney princesses. Now she has seen this movie and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve and all her sisters. I can definitely recommend this movie to all young girls. This movie is one of the best from the Barbie collection. It shows all the good things a mother would like to promote to her little girl. With the great songs and dance moves she raises my daughter and tries to imitate the movements. The extras are also good, you even work on how good your memory is. I would definitely say it is a must for kids and adults.
