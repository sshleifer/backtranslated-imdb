This movie was very well marketed. When it was released in '97, Master P in the midst of fame and success sold everything and everything with his name to the market. So it is no wonder that this underground city drama has sold over 250,000 copies and is still in operation. <br /> <br /> If you were a No Limit fan or even now, have a look. There are some crazy old school videos and I can not start with the crazy, crazy strippers on the Bonus Ice Party. So, what I have to say to anyone who does not like Master P or No Limit Records, do not look at it, because it's not for you and do not vote, because you'll only scare off TRU's no-limit fans of hiring or buy this video with your low votes.
