I am sorry that this movie is not even popular in Hong Kong. For all Die Hard Chow fans, however, this is a masterpiece that should not be ruled out. This is "Mo Lei Tou" (a comedy style based on an unrealistic and ridiculous storyline developed by Chow) at its peak. The plot is absolutely 1000 times more ridiculous than any movie you can imagine. The dialogue is great. No part of the movie cools off, so you stop laughing. <br /> <br /> The plot looks simple, but crazy, so you start laughing. It begins with Chow, in which a young judge (of course a corrupt judge) has gone to jail when he helps an innocent married woman whom he loves at first sight to free her from a murder charge of this wicked minister's conspiracy. whose son was indeed the true condemned. Chow flees the prison and flees as a refugee. He intends to go to the capital to see the Emperor and report on the conviction. On his way, he succeeds in collecting two lovely women, one from the circus, another a prostitute, while in the meantime he has mastered the highest abilities to escape from the thin Mama-San (who happens to be his future in law) to argue. , Eventually, he managed to force the Emperor to reopen the case through a black mail to the Emperor, whom he met in the brothel. The Emperor made him a supreme judge, judging the case with the evil minister. He manages to create some brilliant but witty plans to force the convict to commit the crime and execute him while imprisoning the evil minister. <br /> <br /> The plans are really funny and ridiculously brilliant. Not to mention the tremendous dialogue that includes a brilliant, poor mouth-to-mouth dispute between Chow and the Mama-san, a fight between the fat Mama-san and the slender Mama-san to inspire Chow, learn the quarrels later, and so on the quarrel between Chow and the evil eunuch Lee near the end. Apart from that, some scenes are also brilliant. <br /> <br /> One thing that needs to be mentioned is that you really need to understand the movie and get 100% of all elements right Cantonese really good. This may be the reason why chow films from the early age are temperately taken up only by the Asian world. But as the Chow movie spread its influence around the world, hardcore fans like myself found out that his movie is not as funny as it used to be.
