When I first heard about this film, I was slightly interested. The conspiracy seemed to be an opportunity for fun, and Bam Margera as an actor and director seemed to be something good. When I found out that the film starred with Ryan Dunn, I was even more interested (I was a fan of Homewrecker when it started ... Yes, I'm so lame). However, I did not have much confidence that it was too good. As I sat down to look at it, I was afraid I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> But after five minutes I realized that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought the comedy of this movie was wonderfully idiotic and definitely not suitable for all types of people. The show was pretty good, much better than my expectations. I found it fairly easy to refer to Ryan's character, which gave the film a center that was credible. This is the key in a movie that is as disgusting as this one (and probably because I was not a fan of Borat). <br /> <br /> The film is not at all suitable for younger people, DUH, and will definitely do more than is a fair share of awkward turtles when watched with parents. But it's a good one for you and your friends on a movie night.
