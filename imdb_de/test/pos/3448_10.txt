This movie is great - especially if you like visual art. The landscape that the two daughters paint and photograph is beautiful. The story is sometimes funny and poignant. <br /> <br /> People who like European films and "art films" will love this movie. This is really an art film - it really contains a lot of art. Borrow it. <br /> <br />
