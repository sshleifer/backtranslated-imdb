This movie, too, "Do not look in the basement" is actually not bad. It's a little-known movie to kill even tough horror fans, but I found this movie quite entertaining. Do not get me wrong, it's certainly not without problems, but think more people should take a look. The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanatorium is certainly a delightful story for me. I thought the acting, which seemed forced at first sight, got a little better as the movie progressed. It seems that the actors really got their roles. There are some good, colorful characters, including a man who thinks he's still a soldier, one who thinks he's a judge, an adult with a child's brain, and an attractive girl who craves for attention so much she drops her clothes when a man approaches her. The title "Do not Look In The Basement" has about as much relevance to the story as "The Last House Left" in this movie. If you like movies with scary characters in a mental department like me, you should check this out.
