The other reviewers are too far away why the Farscape show is (temporarily) resting. It has NOTHING to do with the quality of the shows. In fact, the exact opposition is true. They were getting better and better! :) I've seen every episode and if you just look at it to get really cool, it gets cooler as you move on and on, and the wormholes and Aeryn subplots are really very interesting and did not give you more vibe fewer . Before, it was kind of messy, slow and pretty aimless. They spent those foe types like the first two seasons, but in the second two they were actually trying to do something :) Also, I have never seen such a great mix of sexy women and settings in sci-fi. The blue girl - tooth - was cool, but not "sexy". They literally came to the point where the girls ran around in leather corsets and high heels and blasted aliens - now tell me, what could be cooler than that ??? :)) <br /> <br /> The real reason why Farscape got a little bit off is that it cost too much - and that's a good thing for the fans, because the show, seen from end to end, is really like a 60 hour epic movie with all the blockbuster kinematics (ok, they use similar sets often, but the CG is great and the girls are sexxxy). Blah blah - the real reason is that TV shows are profitable. It's a BUSINESS, and the sci-fi channel, or whoever did not get as high a return on this expensive Farscape show as they did on junk shows like Stargate. Lexx was actually cool until they got rid of the hot German girl and replaced her with that bizarre, fat-lipped curiosity. In any case, yes, remember: Farscape was getting better and better and better every week was a small real movie. Then the networks decided, 'Hey, people will watch every old drek we blow in the air, as long as it's the only sci-fi thing at this hour. So why spend all this money on Farscape? budget 'Stargate' shivers down people's heads and calls it 'hit series' because it feels like we're going to play every damn night LOL :)) <br /> <br /> This is how it works. I have to tell you that Claudia Black is a really cool actress. After getting her facelift (her baggy eyes tightened) she looked really cool - one of those dynamic guys like Judy Davis and sometimes hot-looking, sometimes ugly - like a roller coaster ride. I would keep Claudia Black and Lucy Lawless in style and substance - both VERY fun to watch - not just Chrichton :) And yes, you may say that the pregnancy was a bit cheesy, but how many sci-fi shows have one BELIEVABLE and DEEP-romantic background is actually somewhere and goes on ?? It was quite a romantic story - the actors on the show are great. It's really a shame that the show is in limbo for the time being, but I hope that it will soon be released in more episodes and movies because I will definitely buy it! :-D
