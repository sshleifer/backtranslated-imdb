(*** Minor spoiler ***) <br /> <br /> If there's anything in the world of dumb clowns that baffles me, then Charley Chase never got his well-deserved "breakthrough" in the movies. Well, maybe it's not all that weird in that he's never played in all features before. But when I think about it, making such an explanation makes everything even more mysterious - why did not Chase get any offers to play the lead role in features? One explanation is that, no matter how amusing, his character was simply too realistic to go with a longer story; Without the burlesque elements that Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon, and other comedians possessed, it can be assumed that the comedy he made, which worked well for twenty minutes, is repeated after a few more roles. However, I do not quite buy that because Chase's gag design is great and, I believe, could sustain the interest of viewers only for a longer period of time; At least I'm tempted to think when MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE conducts the show. <br /> <br /> Mr. Moose is not exceptionally pretty, and Mrs. Moose is hardly a "classic beauty"; He has the truly largest front teeth of all humans on the planet and he has a remarkably big nose. Both operate plastically without the knowledge of the other, and when they later meet by chance, he does not recognize his wife and she does not recognize her husband. A series of funny misunderstandings starts with many clever gags. I do not think I'll reveal anything to make your viewing more enjoyable. Because if you are a fan of silent comedies, or even if you are not, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE offers so many memorable moments in such a short time that I find it a shame not to see it; stupid in fact, but no less extremely funny.
