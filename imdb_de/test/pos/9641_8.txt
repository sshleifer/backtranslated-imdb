Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during the First World War. The dialogue is extremely entertaining and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as a ship's cook "Ptomaine". Walter Huston's character is inspiring as a captain of the submarine, an excellent example of an officer and a gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this film was the level of technology shown in the fight scenes. I was surprised how similar World War I technology was to technology demonstrated 25 years later in World War II. The basic human nature was very similar today, and far from the conservatism I suspected in the so-called "innocent" past. All in all, I felt that the cast, the characters, the action scenes and the view of the story portrayed in this film are first-rate.
