I saw this movie out of curiosity and settled an argument. The film is now best known from the music collection that Sergei Prokofiev extracted from his accompanying music to the film. The troika movement even appeared in pop arrangements. The floor plan of the plot is known from the sleeve notes to various shots. An employee accidentally creates a nonexistent Lieutenant Kizhe in a list to be presented to the Czar. The Tsar is interested in this person, and instead of telling him that he does not exist, the courtiers and officers claim that he is real. Kizhe is banished to Siberia, recalled, promoted, married, resurgent, dies, receives a state funeral, is revealed as an embezzler, and demoted posthumously to the ranks. The clerk invented Kizhe with ink stains and sneezing, but I had heard that the movie was lost went. So there was no way to find out what happened. Then the film was released as part of the Prokofiev Festival in London's Barbican. For the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk puzzles two words while he's writing an order, making Kuzhe Kizhe. Since the Czar is in a hurry to see the order, there is no time to correct the mistake. <br /> <br /> After expecting a historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is very funny and the audience, even me, laughed uninterruptedly. Although most of it is currently being shot, mostly in the palace, there are some "trick" games where multiple pictures appear on the screen. For example, the Tsar's army is represented by a small group that repeats on the screen. Four identical guards perform a perfect drill in perfect harmony. Two identical servants scrub the floor. <br /> <br /> One small downside was that it was very difficult to find out who everyone was. There were two women who could have been the Tsar's daughters, or a daughter and a servant or something else. And only a few people were named. But all in all a fun movie and I'm surprised that he is not seen more often.
