"The Saint Take Over" stars George Sanders as Simon Templer, aka "The Saint" in this 1940's entry into the series. It also plays Wendy Barrie, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guilfoyle. Aboard a ship en route to the US, the saint meets and tries to take time with a woman (Wendy Barrie) who gives him the brush. Simon comes to New York to help inspector Fernack, who is now completely discredited due to a gangster assassination. $ 50,000 was found in his house. The gangster Rocky (Roland Drew) was found guilty in court, of course, and he and his gangsters pay the bill for the fraternity and lawyer - a total of $ 90,000. Today, you need this to defend yourself against a parking ticket. This was a murder rap. Rocky sends his bodyguard Pearly Gates (Guilfoyle) to the lawyer's home to steal $ 90,000 from the safe. The lawyer caught him in the act and sent him back with a message to his boss. Seconds later he is dead. Rocky meets a similar fate. And on and on - who kills this group of gangsters? The saint must bring one of them to speak, so that Fernack can be clarified. Can he reach someone before he is murdered? The woman he met aboard a ship appears again and plays a prominent role in the case. Few actors have a way with a line like George Sanders, and his dry wit, good looks, smooth voice and depth as an actor fits perfectly with Simon Templer. Paul Guilfoyle adds a touch of humor as a nervous, milk-drinking Pearly Gates, and Jonathan Hale is great as the sometimes angry but worried Ill Inspector Fernack. Wendy Barrie, who appeared in many Saint episodes, is very good as a woman conquering Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very pleasing.
