Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are a joy in this screwball comedy. Alec Baldwin, who was a rising star at the beginning of the film, is a hoot. Dean Stockwell is hysterical in a show by John Gotti. But Mercedes Ruehl steals, as a paranoiac and exaggerated film, the movie. Jonathan Demme, who used to be known for crazy comedies like "Something Wild" and "Melvin and Howard," proves once again that he's a genius. I was not surprised when he won the Academy Award for "Silence of the Lambs". The performances he conjures up in "Married" by his actors are inspired, and the audience is taken on a wild and woolly ride. <br /> <br /> One of the cutest, loveliest movies of the 80s, he stands head and shoulders over many of the satires of his time.
