I saw Dark Harbor at the Seattle Film Festival '98. Filmed in front of an autumnal Maine backdrop, this film has an excellent cast and action to keep you in mind. Sometimes scary, sometimes funny, I have to say that I stayed for days after seeing it. Rickman and Walker are wonderful because the icy marriages and Reedus is someone you'll hear more about, I'm sure. The opening shot of a winding, deserted street in a dull rain (and the score accompanying it) set the tone - simply terrific. Nice, nice work from a new director / screenwriter and his talented crew.
