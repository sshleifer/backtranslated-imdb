Tripper Harrison, Wildman's Chief Advisor (Bill Murray in his first major role), introduces the various crazy Hi-Jinks at the North Star Summercamp. Tripper makes friends with the sad and lonely, crazy boy Rudy (a nice and influential accomplishment by Chris Makepeace). Director Ivan Reitman comically tells the weird vignettes off the wall in an incessant, snappy tempo and maintains a responsive, good-natured tone throughout. This film cleverly sums up the airy summer atmosphere: making friends, finding first love, playing tricks, fighting a rival camp, campfire singalongs and, of course, the inevitable eerie urban legend of the escaped psycho-killer the hook hand. The sense of enjoyment that this image creates is positively contagious. Moreover, the humor is always stupid and occasionally rude, but never too evil or mean. Best of all, there is a profitable surplus of pure heart that goes with the humor (especially the heartfelt relationship between Tripper and Rudy is really touching). The performers have an obvious ball to play their likable characters: Murray's glorious gonzo and electroplating presence keeps things droning (his crazy PA announcements are absolutely snappy), and Harvey Atkin as the luckless camp owner Morty, Kate Lynch as Trippers Sassy old flame Roxanne, Russ Banham as the endearing Crockett, Kristine DeBell as the sweetie, foxy AL, Sarah Torgov as the stubborn Candace, Jack Blum as blutzy, Nerd Spaz, Keith Knight as lanky nerd Larry Finkelstein, Cindy Girling as Fetching Wendy , and Matt Craven as hip hardware. Donald Wilder's cinematography gives the film an attractive, sunny look and skilfully uses cloths. Elmer Bernstein's lively and melodic score succeeds as well. A real uprising.
