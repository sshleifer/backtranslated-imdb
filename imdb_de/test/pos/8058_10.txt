During the foreword by Clete Roberts, I began to believe that this was an Ed Wood production. What comes out here is a pretty tough stuff though. The story of crime and corruption in a southern city is told with a cast from Hollywood's Poverty Row. This makes the movie all the more realistic. No punches are made here, and sometimes the movie is reminiscent of "The Well" (1951). The black and white texture gives a newsreel-like quality. Of course, younger audiences will be reminded of "The Blair Witch Project," but this is based on REAL events!
