I have nothing but praise for this movie and the cast, especially Ann Margaret. But more importantly, I have praise for my in-laws, who were (and are) the adoptive parents of Warren and Frank in real life. I met most of the "kids" at Warren's wedding in 1989. This is an amazing story and it is even more amazing for me to know the family and know what everyone has been through. It's also fun to see how my in-laws were portrayed in the movie. It was pretty accurate. My wife even likes to see little details like a toaster that she remembered from her childhood. Yes, it's a tough movie to watch, but so amazing and from the heart. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this story to me is how many children have lived through my in-laws and as a result I married her daughter and had Warren as a brother-in-law. How many have I met with me. For the past 20 years, this story has been part of my life, which my mother-in-law shared with me. Know that and Warren. Warren lives with his family in California. He married his high school sweetheart, with whom he met again on his 20-year high school reunion. <br /> <br /> In the 80's there was a show called "That's Incredible". They had a reunion of the family, which also got to know the actors of the show. <br /> <br /> The DVD is available for everyone in the UK and Australia. It's a tough video to get around here in the US, and I could not find a DVD here yet.
