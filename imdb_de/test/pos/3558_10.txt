In a way, writers David Croft and Jimmy Perry's experience are based on the experience of Butlin's Holiday Camp entertainers in the UK. embodies the "Slapstick, Postcard Humor" of the British post-war year. In the fictional coastal town of Crimpton-on-Sea, "Hi-De-Hi" records the comedic bustle at Maplins Holiday Camp - one of many scattered along. The British coast is owned by the mega-rich but never seen (up the screen) Joe Maplin. <br /> <br /> Although the actual show began in 1980 with the pilot episode, it ran until 1988, when the BBC considered it too tame. For the progressive comedy department, seasons 1 through 5 focussed on 1959, while the squadrons 6 to 9 became aware of 1960 - a time when the British Holiday Camp began to decay in the old style. During the first five seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrother (brilliantly played by the late, magnificent Simon Cadell) was the camp's entertainment manager, a well-meaning but somewhat thoughtful former university professor who liberated himself from his background of the upper class and turned himself into the "real" World to lead his team of entertainment staff, in contrast to his own relaxed personality. From 6 years old, Fairbrother was replaced by Clive Dempster (played by David Griffin when Cadell left the show at the peak of his popularity). He was a former RAF war hero, who in many ways resembled Cadell's character in the background, but more a rogue than a gentleman. <br /> <br /> The true stars of "Hi-De-Hi", however, were Ted Bovi's (played brilliantly by Paul Shane) during the nine seasons, a stereotypical working class that drinks everyone, horrible comics - someone who never could resist an opportunity to numb the campers; Gladys Pugh (played by Ruth Madoc, who is currently making a career comeback with appearances on the hit BBC comedy "Little Britain"), Chief Yellowcoat (as the entertainers were known for their bright yellow jackets) and sports organizers - but more importantly, the only person who saved Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster from embarrassment by masking their inexperience in running a vacation camp; Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard), the somewhat stupid but lovable, cute chalet girl with the burning ambition to become Yellowcoat, and Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), Ted's innocent protégé, who learns more about show business than As was customary in a Croft & Perry production, the assembled characters were a series of outsiders excellently played by the actors involved. Mr. Partridge (played by the late Leslie Dwyer, who was 70 years old at the time he left the show), the children's entertainer of Kinderhassern; Fred Quilly (Felix Bowness), a former master jockey with dubious past; Yvonne & Barry Stuart-Hargreaves (Dianne Holland & Barry Howard), the snobbish former ballroom champion who stood at dawn of their careers; and Sylvia and Betty (Nikki Kelly and Rikki Howard), the two main girls Yellowcoats, who were always looking for the fun that Joe Maplin would never allow in one of his camps. <br /> <br /> "Hi-De-Hi" typified the slapstick era of the late '50s with their cheeky and to some degree vulgar "humoristic" humor (jokes about people sitting in toilets, and anecdotes about "women with big knockers" were the order of the day). But despite the hint of "Carry On" Falk, it was always so innocent and became a kind of commendable family visit in the 80s. The critics of the show, of course, noticed that the show has not been that way for several years, but I can not agree with that. While the early seasons focussed mainly on madness and slapstick humor, the latter series of "Hi-De-Hi" saw more emphasis in the scripts and the main characters (notably Spike Dixon & Gladys Pugh) could grow with a more sensitive story lines. However, there were some criticisms of the show. Clive Dempster was not Jeffrey Fairbrother and the first one did not have the chemistry on screen with Gladys like Jeffrey (I personally believe it would have been more credible if Gladys had married Jeff); Five Seasons, dedicated in 1959 and four by 1960, caused more than a few continuity flaws (the disappearance of old faces and the introduction of new figures were not properly explained, especially with the yellow coats that came and went regularly, and the character of Gladys Pugh, who had emerged in the pilot episode as a freedom-loving ogre, who was suddenly turned into a naive, virginal character! In addition, most of the holiday season of 1959 was treated in the first season, extending the rest of the year into five more series something unbelievable, but the show should not be looked at closely, and the comedy outweighed their weaknesses. <br /> <br /> All In all, "Hi-De-Hi" was probably one of the last comedies from the golden age of the BBC and even if it never succeeded, British British comedy stars like "Only Fools & Horses," "Porridge," or so-called ar "Last" competition "From the summer wine" is "Hi De Hi" stringed As a comedy, the whole family remembered. If you have not checked it yourself, I ask you for it.
