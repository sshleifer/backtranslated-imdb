Tumbling Doll of Flesh (also known as Niku Daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This was on my wish list for a long time, and then I made a copy on Ebay some time ago. It has never been on DVD and what I got from Ebay was a very good DVD-R that I am very happy with. The film is, in my opinion, the most extreme example of torture pornography with an emphasis on pornography. A woman replies to an ad for a pornographic film and goes with the producer to a place where he is shot. The porn is definitely real, with the annoying Japanese pixilating to hide the hardcore recordings without succeeding most of the time. After the porn movie was filmed and the actress is ready to leave, she is hit with a baseball bat over her head, brought back into the room and brutally dissected in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes, male porn, screwing her into an open one Wound in the chest. This is after both legs have been severed, her arm and a few other beauties. This movie far surpasses the Guinea Pig series. In fact, they are not even close to realism, though cheap gore effects are shown in this movie. This is indeed one of the best fake snuff movies I have ever seen, if not the best. Now I have to warn you that you should stay far away if you are not interested in this stuff. This movie is very strong and with the right sex he is very sickly erotic. And I mean in a very sick way. But wherever you go on this subject material, this movie brings the goods home, and I would definitely recommend that you look for it. After reading about the film, I was expecting something very strong, which was, however, surpassed a lot.
