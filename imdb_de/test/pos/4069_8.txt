I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've found that many reviewers call this typical "Buddy" movie. De Niro is by no means Murphy's buddy in this movie. Part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's unwillingness to be friends with anyone. Murphy really shines in this movie. He does what he does best and looks like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants to become so much an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect for the straight man who thinks it's stupid. I thought they had great chemistry and would be the perfect casting choice. Rene Russo is also great as a television producer. Of course, she loves everything Murphy does, and endeavors (along with Murhpy) to get DeNiro up and running, too. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have touched the fun scene with William Shatner and repeated his role as TJ Hooker trains Murhpy & De Niro on how to behave like cops. But my favorite scene is that Murphy hopes in the "confessional" that he could get a Wesly Snipes-like cop to team up with De Niro. Man, that was weird! Comedy often depends on your personal taste. Surely you could put holes in the plot, mostly you can do it with a comedy. I was curious about the combination of Murphy and De Niro ... I think it has brought out the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him back up front. I can only imagine that it was a great honor for Murphy to work with the great De Niro. Rating 8 out of 10 stars.
