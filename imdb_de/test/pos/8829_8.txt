I'll stop believing for a moment and stop pretending we could, could, or should, "as is" or "as it should" be in the universe. Human knowledge in this area is probably primitive, as medieval maps are compared to today's satellite maps. So we have no idea. Considering that this is "just" a BBC TV documentary simulation, it gets a lot better than many big budget Hollywood blockbusters, and that's just unbelievable. 3 All in all, a great show that shows the CGI report containing the previous knowledge of the solar system. Probably the whole thing is done by fictitious and CGI-generating just to make it palatable to a broad audience. Have you ever seen clips of REAL space missions and REAL spacecraft? The quality is generally average to poor and the comparison would be compared between an x-ray of the breast (and what it says about the human body) and a CGI-eden cyborg movie. However, the chest radiograph is real, while the cyborg streak is simply fictional SFX. 5 actors do a good job. I'm not telling my grandchildren about it, but it's very fair because it's a BBC documentary simulation.
