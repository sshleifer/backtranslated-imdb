I saw this movie as a child and still enjoy watching the nostalgia factor. When I was younger, I loved the movie because of its entertaining story and interesting characters. Today I still love the characters. Besides, I think about the conspiracy because now I see the moral and the symbolism. Rainbow Brite is anything but the worst movie of all time, and although outdated, I will show it to my children in the future if I have children.
