I really like this show. It has drama, romance and comedy in one. I am 28 years old and married. I can identify with both the experiences of Lorelei and Rory on the show. I have recently seen the repeats on the Family Channel, so I'm not up to date. I think women would like this show more than men, but I know that some men out there will have fun! I really like that for an hour and not half an hour because the hour seems to pass when I see her. Give a chance if you have never seen the show! However, I think Lorelei and Luke are my favorite characters in the series, mainly because they are connected. How could you not see that something was there (or how long do you need to see it?) <br /> <br /> Enjoy watching!
