This movie would be especially fun for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially in any indie function. Those whose heritage includes an introduction to the movie may not appreciate it so much. I am difficult to please in the documentation category. This document is something else - its pleasure comes from an earthy realism of punks from indie filmmakers who are screaming to be there. Whether you've ever wondered what it's like to be in front of or behind the camera in movies, or if you've been taking care of the sometimes painful and hard-hitting indie world, you'll surely get a kick on this movie.
