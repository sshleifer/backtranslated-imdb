I admit that I've never seen "Waiting for Guffman", the critically acclaimed comedy toy from 1997 about a small town where a pageant takes place. When the ad for Best in Show had the slogan "From the team that's been waiting for Guffman," a large number of critics in their reviews hinted that only people familiar with the film or its filmmakers and performers , have a good time to see this movie. For the shame, critics, for the shame sometimes two! Any critic who implies such a thing in any movie probably does not want to share the movie's riches with the rest of the world, but this is a movie that I hope people will experience, now that the video is out DVD is available. "Best in Show" is without a doubt the best comedy of the year 2000. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a mock -umental style that compares the main competitors (not to mention the screwballs) of the annual Mayflower "Best In". presents Show Contest, where dogs of all breeds come to see who the first dog is, we have the lovable and gullible Harry Pepper (guest) with his bloodhound, the simple Gerry & Cookie stain (Levy & O'Hara) her terriers, the Nuffel yuppies Hamilton & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), the gay dog ​​friends Scott Dolan & Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins & McKean) and the millionaire Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) as well as her trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch) everyone has a simple object in mind: the Blue Ribbon bestowed upon the best dog and ... do I have to tell you the rest? <br /> <br /> director / writer / star Guest's idea of ​​humor is one, who assures me that it's out there. Ko There are many who are worthy to laugh at, and the idiocy of films like "American Pie" or other pointless "teenage layers" will not conquer the world. His idea is simple: Make your comedy not only funny, but SMART funny. But instead of stepping into the glittering footsteps of films like Zero Effect and High Fidelity, he used a rather unusual approach (and, as I understand it, he used that approach for Guffman as well). Whether you remember it or not, much of the film is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do was probably not written in the script, maybe even not even dreamed by guest and co-writer / star Levy. But with a gentle hand from Guest, he and the actors managed to perform a witty theatrical performance that would probably have been thrown off by other, less skilled actors. Well, that's smart! <br /> <br /> The cast naturally makes improvisation the most. All are a miracle, especially guest as pepper. But the real standout must be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, the unsuspecting announcer of the contest, who can spy on the hilarious stories and comments that no announcer would ever dream of ... that is, if the announcer wanted to try funny. Williard can tell the dog about the sudden move on and about how much he can bench press. There's even a part where he gives an idea for a new marketing strategy: Have sexy women in tight shirts and shorts pose with the dogs and imply something like "doggie style of a time". It is invaluable, as is its performance. <br /> <br /> I hope people will participate in this 90-minute "Dogumentary". The movie deserves so much recognition. It was nominated for Best Picture Comedy at the Golden Globes, but did not win. I can not understand why. I mean, in the comedy department it's best on the show. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A
