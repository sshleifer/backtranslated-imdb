I really only saw this movie because it had Rupert Grint (whom I knew as Ron from the Harry Potter movies). I never really appreciated Rupert as an actor until this movie. I loved the whole movie. Rupert does a wonderful job in this funny, quirky movie. I think the movie could have gone well without sex, but it somehow worked. I can not wait to see more of Rupert's films in the future. Julie Walters has also done a great job. She plays a very minor role in the Harry Potter films, so I did not really know what to expect from her. But she was wonderful as Lady Evie. The part where she swallowed the key was absolutely funny. Overall, a great movie.
