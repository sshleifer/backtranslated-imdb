"Best in Show" is an often witty mockumentary that leads us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners preparing for the event. The only thing that distinguishes this movie from real dog shows is that the dogs in "Best in Show" are more subdued than their owners! Fun stuff from a top cast, including Eugene Levy (who co-wrote the film), Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, and Christopher Guest (who co-wrote and directed with Levy). They're all funny, but Fred Willard steals the movie with his explosively witty performance as a dog actor who says the most abominable things. Plus the dogs are cute too. "Best in Show" is not exactly the laugh-uprising that I expected, but there is laughter and it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
