After falling asleep for loneliness, Lestat awakens from a 100-year sleep to the sounds of new music he wants to belong to and the band "The Vampire Lestat" is born. His longing to end his loneliness and to annoy his "life in the light" attitude along with his music annoy his vampires and evoke an evil that has been dormant for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> Those who are looking for a true adaptation from book to film. Those who have read the books and expect to see them on screen will experience a great disappointment. This movie will appeal to those who really enjoyed the movie "Interview With the Vampire". <br /> <br /> There are some storylines and incongruences, but overall the movie was satisfactory. Stuart Townsend portrays Lestat with a sensuality and sexiness that is missing in the previous film. The relationships portrayed in the movie were very sexy and sizzling. <br /> <br /> As a movie, history forces you and attracts you. Casting is wonderful. Loved this story and the movie. If you love sensuality and sexual tension, you will love this movie!
