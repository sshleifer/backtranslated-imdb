It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision you offer afterwards, you can see the gears and wheels that make these people what they are. This is followed by such an insight into the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the great storytellers of the time, who brings with him time. <br /> <br /> The film style of Christopher Nolan attaches great importance to the delivery of the story. Although people may complain that they rely too much on the time-lapse of time, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses this technique differently each time. Memento was probably the most complicated piece I've ever seen. Discount the hardened cynics who claim that it's an old piece of meat wrapped in chic dressing. Memento shows how even the simplest stories can be transformed into a train of thought. The Prestige, which has been greatly reduced in comparison, still showed creativity in how its three stories are interwoven. Even in an emaciated company like the Batman series, Christopher Nolan has sprinkled some of his outstanding yarn-knitting tricks and revived the Dark Knight. See a dilettante writer who becomes a reluctant voyeur who becomes an ignorant accomplice to a multitude of minor crimes and finally sees an end that no one could expect. I had never heard of Follow and did not know what to expect. At each point, the film suggested me where he was leading me. Since the mysterious angle was clear, I was constantly trying to figure out what would happen next. And here the movie is so successful in my opinion. The film has many elements that have led me to many wild chases. <br /> <br /> The film is completely in black and white and is narrated in several timelines, both of which are considered baubles these days. The following does so in the least formal or constructive way. There does not seem to be any reason why the story is told that way, but you do not feel like you're taken. The lack of presumptuousness or self-confident arrogance makes up this narrative style. Highly recommended!
