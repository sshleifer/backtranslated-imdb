As a fan of Dario Argento and a Phantom of the Opera fanatic, I really wanted to see his first version of the story before the bad thing "Dario Argento's Phantom of the Opera" was written. The movie is just great, even the storyline that counts here among the best in Argento, in a coherent story. The way he turns a classic love story into a weird slasher is just great. The film has a very nightmarish feel, which makes you stay on the edge of the seat. The colors have never been better in an Argento movie since the stunning "Suspiria". The murders are clever and bloody, all in the style of Argento. The thing with the eyes in this movie is just worrying and much better than Fulcis Splatter. Acting is so-so, but once you've seen the movie several times, you better understand and get used to the motivations of the characters. My two biggest complaints are rock music. I think it was a clever idea to mix nice opera fragments with heavy metal, but it does not work very well here. The end is VERY disappointing, which is the worst part of the film, which apparently echoed the previous "phenomena" of Argento. The same thing happened in the director's cut of "The Exorcist". I wish they had kept the original ending. Still, it's a fantastic movie and a must-have, if only for Daria Nicolodi's memorable murder sequence.
