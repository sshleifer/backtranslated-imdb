My Santa Lucia choir was selected to be part of this film. All 100 plus. When it was time to film the film, I was asked to vote only 10. Oh, my goodness. We had a little girl who went early to stretch her almonds because she wanted to play in the movie. The decisions were hard to make. The people of Georgetown are as nice as the people they show in the movie. Gracious, benevolent believers. The city sponsors an annual Christmas Market every year on the first weekend of December. I was there this year and it was wonderful. The city is beautiful and people work hard to make it magical. The city appears today as it did when the movie was filmed. There is much recognition for the Historical Society, which works hard to preserve its historic value. The school's director, who was converted to a charter school, was honored for volunteering by the governor of Colorado.
