I was privileged to watch Mar Adentro last Friday, and I am still shocked by its beauty, the powerful work of each actor and actress and the incredible ability of Amenabar to tell the story of Ramón Sampedro, known in Spain for doing so was that he asked a legal euthanasia, lost the court case and finally died in front of a camera that drank a glass of poison and froze our whole heart with his determination not to remain immobile forever by accident. <br /> <br /> Before I saw the movie, I was already fascinated by the strong symbology in its title that I would translate as "Into the Sea" and not, as some say, "Out to sea" and which is taken from them an original poem of the man, which is in this story. Then I saw the movie. Oh my friends. This is a cinema with a capital C. The narration leads you to the heart of every single figure: Sampedro, born again in a Bardem that you forget from the beginning, is a man of humor and abundance in the center of hope, and his hope is to die because for him the life he lives is not worth living. The rest of the characters dance around him and respect his decision because he sees him as a human independent being (forgetting that he needs the others for everything), even though they love him so much. And that's what the film is all about: love. You can feel it, you can breathe it into the skin of every figure. They experience the growing sense of three women who meet him in the film: Gené, the member of the association who defends his right to die in dignity, his girlfriend, her story in the movie is the hope for us, the happy can be a normal one Live life in this world; Rosa, the woman who meets a good man in the midst of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and despised her; Julia, the woman who shares a tragic fate with Ramón and ultimately acts in a way we can not understand otherwise. <br/> <br/> However, before Ramón met these women, she knew what love was because you can not meet him without loving him, and he is deeply loved by his rejected family: four characters in their humility and bravery are unique, each with his own thoughts about his decision, each respectable in his own way, because the terrible thing about this story is no one is to blame for what happened. Unfortunately, life is sometimes so terrible. From this well-known quartet I especially liked Mabel Rivera's work as Ramón's sister-in-law Manuela: a terrific performance. <br /> <br /> I would like to draw your attention to three episodes that are for me the best climax I have ever seen. If you have not seen the movie yet, do not read this paragraph and read the next paragraph again by starting "Mar adentro". Let the movie show you its secrets. The episodes I loved were: 3. The best love scene I've seen in a movie when I really felt love enter the screen is when Ramón dreams he's flying to Julia on the beach meet and they kiss. 2. Gené phoned Ramón the day before he did, and he told her it was better to say goodbye right now so as not to get her into trouble with the authorities. And then she knows it's the last time they'll talk, and she fought for his right to die ... but she does not want to lose him because she loves him as a real friend and although she does is his decision to respect at all costs. 1. the best A young Ramón on the beach looking at his girlfriend under the sun and jumping from the rocks to the water, into a sea that is retreating. We see the crash, we hear his voice, remembering what happened and claiming he should have died at that moment. The face of Bardem face down showed us from below. And the hand of a friend who pulls him from his forehead and leads him back to a life that will be a hell to him in the next 30 years. There are many others, like the impressive ending, although in Spain we know too well what Ramon did. Mar adentro did not deceive me, Amenabar never did, but this time he did it. Thanks to the actors who took part in the project and who may have taken it personally, because this is not just a movie, it's an elegy for a man who died alone when he wanted to "legally" die, which meant for him Bardem pointed out that he died with the people he loved and loved.
