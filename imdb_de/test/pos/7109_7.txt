This has one of the more unusual behaviors I've seen in a horror movie, but it's based on a good, solid Universal Studios tariff: lots of monsters, pretty heroine, villagers with torches. But my favorite part is Larry Talbot (The Wolf Man), who is looking for healing for his lycanthropy. After he died in the original "Wolf Man", he is resurrected and roams through "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" and "House of Frankenstein" to seek a way to end his suffering. I think the first-time viewers will find his search in this movie very interesting. <br /> <br />
