Renee Zellweger shines as a nurse Betty, one of the most charming, unconventional and carefree comedies of the year. When the soap opera owned the waitress Betty Sizemore, she witnesses the murder of her insensitive husband by two hitters Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and believes that the actors on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to visit the famous cardiologist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show) to find. <br /> <br /> As the two strangely merged hitmen, the caustic rock and the educational Freeman bring some fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy off-screen actor personality. Renee Zellweger presents herself in an innocent, candy-covered and sometimes terribly sweet performance as a nurse Betty. It exudes goodness, warmth and is irresistible. While the script sometimes feels like a sit-com, sometimes filled with incredible characters and constructed situations, Zellweger is so personable and so disarming that everything fits together. <br /> <br /> With only a few black splashes of comedy to keep things interesting, a successful performance by Zellweger, a great minor cast, and a skilled script, Sister Betty is absolutely adorable. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 points
