"Nuovomondo (2006)" (referred to in the US as "The Golden Door") was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. This film is different - and, I think, better than most films about impoverished people leaving Europe and coming to the United States. The film begins with scenes in a poor, rural region of Sicily. We always hear that Sicily is a rocky island, but you will not really understand the effects of this sentence until you see the first half hour of The Golden Door. <br /> <br /> The middle section of the film is dedicated to the long trip to the US. Most immigration films show us ten minutes of people getting seasick in the third grade and then the Statue of Liberty. Not in this movie - we get a feel for life below deck and it's not charming. (We never see the Statue of Liberty either.) After all, the typical movie takes us ten more minutes from Ellis Island, and then the immigrants walk through the Lower East Side of New York. Not here - the Ellis Island experience takes up about a third of the material. <br /> <br/> Vincenzo Amato excels as Salvatore Mancuso, who brings his two sons and his mother to the new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is as good as Lucy Reed, a mysterious Englishwoman who also speaks fluent Italian. <br /> <br /> There are some strange accents in the film, especially the soundtrack with songs by Nina Simone. There must be some symbolism, but I could not understand it. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer has already pointed out that this movie is better viewed in a theater than on a DVD. Nevertheless, it is a large screen or a small screen, the search is worthwhile.
