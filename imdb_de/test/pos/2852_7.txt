This is the story of a man who attended a comedy, and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a man in love with pictures and afraid when he unexpectedly identified with one of them. The incredible story of A GUY, which became more frightening when the heroine fooled herself and the villain. Gosh, has that made us live? People who are fooled by the perfect face and imagine how this face should be perfect inside? "Toto, I think we are not in Kansas anymore".
