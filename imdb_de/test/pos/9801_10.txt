This must be the best movie ever (in my opinion). It really taught me when, at the age of 10 (in 2000), I watched a child's freedom slipping by more than we expect. Joseph Mazzello must also be my favorite actor, and I think he and Elijah Wood did a great job in the roles of the brothers. This movie is pretty sad and some people do not understand the end. But the story itself is unbelievable, the thought of a poor, seven-year-old boy (Bobby) abused by drunken step-fathers is terrible. My favorite part of the movie is when Tom Hanks (older Mike) lists the 7 things that are a kid for the adult world. However, there are some areas that could have been made better in this film, such as the mother's casting (Lorraine Braco), which I consider a terrible actor. "The King" has played his role well, as it is a difficult role. Joseph and Elijah were definitely the stars of the movie. I could not believe how well they were the victims of an abusive stepfather because they were as old as they were (7 and 9). But overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves great children actor, and a great movie. :)
