OK, I admit it, I'm 40 years old and still shedding a tear as I watch Johnny call his robot back. <br /> <br /> "Robot, stop ... attack ... robot, what are you doing, robot ... robot, where are you going Robot, come back Robot ... robot please do not do it you're going to die ... Robot ... Robot, please comeback! I need you here? Giant Robot ... Robot! Giant Robot ?? "Johnny Sokko, the last Emperor Guillotine <br /> <br /> Of all In the Tokusatsu that's out there, Giant Robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there. I appreciate the fact that when I was a child I was involved in everything that had to do with sci-fi and anime. <br /> <br /> LIVE ON GR!
