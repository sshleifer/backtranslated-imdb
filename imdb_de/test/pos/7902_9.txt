This is not a typical Indian movie. There is a great sense of humanity and the characters are pretty realistic. There is a great dynamic in interpersonal relationships and there is a sense of guilt, grief, passion and passivity between the many characters. When you see this, you get a sense of the heavy burden of the 5,000 years of strata and layers of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations. The final scene of an elephant traveling in the countryside was a great footnote to such an ancient civilization, yet human relationships are still preserved and cared for. I saw it on DVD, the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting. Was surprised to learn that the film did not do well in India (or is not shown) (... but maybe not too surprised). The artistic heritage of rural societies is slowly being lost, and its legacy will not be taken up by younger generations, as some of the older musicians in the film no longer live today. Excellent movie.
