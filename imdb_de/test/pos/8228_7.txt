A title search with Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is the film that is missing in the list you've seen. One of 4 films made by Scott at RKO during his heyday (1947), the others are always easy to come by. Liberal, Kansas, southwest of Dodge City, is a powder keg that's about to explode between the Trailriders driving the longhorns into Trail Street, the city's main street, and the bastards who feed our bellies. A strong man like Bat Masterson has to step between the two groups and bring the city to order. That's all I want to say, except that Scott movies usually have only one pretty girl and this one has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT has always played men of reverence, courage, prudence, and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago, parents were able to send their children to a Scott movie, confident that they would learn positive values. Robert Ryan plays the main role in this movie and plays a good one for a change. In fact, RYAN was one of the many HEROS who had starred in America's films. How sad, what we get today. George Clooney teaches our boys that we should sympathize with suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between the Olympians murdered in Munich in 1972 and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 takes its moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the crazy left. I wonder how it all works in Liberal, Kansas. After all, Liberal was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.
