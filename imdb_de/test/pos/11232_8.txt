When Northfork debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, many people did not like it because they found it boring and too slow. I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest movies of the year), but it was not boring at all. As Roger Ebert said, "There has never been a movie like Northfork." I do not usually agree with Ebert, but once he speaks the truth. Although John Sayles' Sunshine State may have some of the same immediate issues, nothing I have ever seen or knew can even be compared to the striking originality of the Northfork of the Polish brothers. Northfork is perfect Example: How often is it better to go for a few more minutes to go to an art house movie than to the latest Jack Black movie? The plot is not a hideous cookie mold; it's just so strikingly original. A small town in Montana called Northfork has a nearby dam nearing demolition. Therefore, the entire city must be evacuated. Some people just do not want to go. In a secondary plot, a young orphan (Duel Farnes) is very ill and bedridden. He is looked after by Father Harlan (Nick Nolte). The boy introduces himself as a fallen angel, helping him through his illness phase. <br /> <br /> Although much of the film is straightforward, part of it could make David Lynch run away with money. There are weird weather patterns, a funny, wooden, huge dog thing and symbolism that would make Fellini proud. It's not as confusing as a Lynch movie, but it's still weird. That's what makes Northfork so great: it's so extraordinary, yet so simple and plausible. <br /> <br /> Northfork has a magical feeling: it's almost as if you are looking at something you are not quite sure what it is, but you are thrilled. As I said earlier, I agreed with Ebert how this film is different from any other. However, I do not agree when he says that it is "not entertaining". He goes on to say that it is just "captivating". Maybe he just thought that he should give good reviews because everyone else is doing it, but instead of how slow it was, I still thought it was very entertaining, something that many dramas can not do anymore. Northfork Maybe it's not the fastest or most popular movie, but if you do, you'll be extremely surprised, as I was. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Reviewed with PG-13 for short sexuality.
