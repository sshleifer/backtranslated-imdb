I love the absurdity and biting humor of Buñuel's surrealistic films (such as "The Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie" and "The Devastating Angel," to name just two). Other, earlier works (such as "The Forgotten Ones", on juvenile delinquents from a maritime neighborhood in Mexico) are more serious and represent a strong social message. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that it is "Nazarin" The most successful shoots the heart of the beholder. While it is true that it is flooded with irony, it does reveal an aspect of Buñuel who seems fascinated by the beauty and seriousness of the spiritual quest. While the director (quite typically) inflicts countless blows on the Catholic Church, he also appears to show a sense of admiration for sincere Christian thought and his practice of selfless love. <br /> <br /> "What Luis Buñuel blatantly praises a Jesus figure? I always thought of him as a totally cynical artist with no trace of belief in human virtue ... until I saw" Nazarin. "I guess that He satirically reveals the difficulty of following the example of Christ in a society plagued with meanness, ignorance, and sin, but also portrays the hero, Father Nazario, as a beacon in a sea of ​​darkness Some would argue that Father Nazarios doubt his belief in the loss of his holy values. (Oh, if he can not do good in this world) Who can do this?) But I would say that this "mistake", his frustration, makes his character all the more heroic because he shows how human he is and how difficult he is. His inner struggle must be. that the priest is not from this "dark night" could come out and regain his confidence? Maybe only a difficult part of his spiritual journey was presented to us. The elegant, open ending (in which he desperately takes on the fruits that a stranger offers) allows us to imagine the end result of the story. <br /> <br /> In Buñuel, I recognize the aggressive, self-proclaimed atheist with brilliant wit and social awareness; but after seeing "Nazarin," I also feel from him a certain warmth, a depth and maturity that is not so obvious in his other works. <br /> <br /> To counteract this, I strongly recommend that you watch him afterwards. Short film "Simon of the Desert" (also made in Mexico a few years later). It's a similar theme - the renunciation of the ego in the face of temptation - but only in a hysterically funny and totally disrespectful style.
