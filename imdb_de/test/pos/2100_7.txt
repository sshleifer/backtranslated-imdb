Nice combination of the huge monster and samurai genres. The giant monster Majin, the god of the mountain, is a reserved and hideous character, very similar to the God of the Old Testament, raining destruction and punishment on those who desecrate his holy land - but it's interesting to know what finally gets him Awakened is not the suffering of men, but a punctual and personal insult. It is beautifully photographed, with solid acting, great miniatures and wonderful music from the great Akira Ifukube. Majin is not a 400 foot monster like Godzilla - he is 2 1/2 times normal size, and the evil samurai he thrusts into the ground gives a good look into his contemptuous eyes as he presses down on their fortress and she beats her to pieces. Not much in terms of extras, but it's nice to see this forgotten classic salvaged and put back in digital format.
