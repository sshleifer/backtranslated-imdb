This remains "a perfect movie" for me even after all these years. I remember well how I sat in the theater for a long time, stunned by the experience, overwhelmed with emotion. I own the DVD (of course!) At least once a year. It is incomparable and I can not contribute much to it, has already written about its excellence and beauty. So happy that others love it as much as I do! A note: The author of the book he is based on - Michael Ondatje - was enchanted by the film and is quoted as saying he wished he had thought of some of the beautiful scenes written purely for the film. Hana at his side "invites" Hana to his side with a trail of small candles and the way he arranges for Hana to see the frescoes in the ruined medieval church.
