"How can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" Here is how. There were few film versions of a famous novel that did justice to their source material better than Anthony Minghella's film about Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain. When you read the book, you will be able to feel most of the key scenes in a way that shakes the soul. I often cried when I read the novel and spent the entire evening watching the movie through tears. <br /> <br /> Amazing scope, nice words, great acting and great music. In the interview on the DVD accompanying the film, Minghella talks about the different layers of the story. All work. One of the best movies I have seen, and an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the last ten years.
