I like going to a museum. You can appreciate the great talent of the main composer Michael Cimino and this fabulous art designer of light. Vilmos Zsigmond. As I said, I am as in heaven and discover all the creation this man can apply to a single frame. Imagine, you can see a moving picture of this artist. I can say: this movie is one of the best.
