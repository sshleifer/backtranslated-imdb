I recorded this on Sundance and had no idea it was a Miike movie. I thought it was just another kung fu movie. <br /> <br /> Then I saw things like the dancing saxophonist <br /> <br />, who sounded like an Oriental Gato Barbieri, and I knew that had to be Miike. <br /> <br /> I missed the opening credits and had to wait until the end of the credits to see Miike's fees. <br /> <br /> So far he has not disappointed me. Audition, City of Lost Souls, Ichi the Killer and The Happiness of Katakuries were all the best, and now I've found out that this was the third in a trilogy. Except for Miike and Todd Solendz nobody makes any interesting movies anymore.
