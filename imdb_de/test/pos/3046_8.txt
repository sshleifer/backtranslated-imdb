Martin Ritt seems to be a director who has always been interested in social issues (as a son of immigrants, he had every incentive to do so, especially as he was blacklisted in the 1950s). "Conrack" is based on Pat Conroy's novel "The Water is Wide," about his own experiences when he taught a school of impoverished black children about the outside world in 1969, much to the chagrin of the right-wing superintendent (Hume Cronyn). What added to the film's power was the cultural and historical context: Conroy (Jon Voight) frustratedly tells another teacher how many children do not know about Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, the Vietnam War or even Vietnam. He goes on to enlighten her about all these factors. <br /> <br /> Somewhere I read a complaint that when Conroy played music for the kids, he only played white music. The truth is, you can not blame the movie for it; it was based on the real experience of Conroy. In any case, the movie is a true gem.
