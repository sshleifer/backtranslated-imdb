Having been familiar with Hartley's "The Go-Between" for a long time, both in the original book form and in the disappointing Pinter-Losey movie adaptation, this was an interesting stuff. Sometimes "The Hireling" turns out to be almost a mirror image; It's located in a slightly less distant period for the main section highlighting the British class system, and includes a standard-scene sports match (boxing instead of cricket) that reveals quite a bit about it. <br /> <br /> This refreshes in its small character focus. You can not exactly know Lady Franklin and Leadbitter in the Romance sense, but this distance is adequately portrayed in body language and twist by the actors. Their removal from a perfect compassion with a true character reflects the dormant difference that undermines the central relationship. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully subtle and we see more in their "less"; never are these theatrical, eye-catching performances. It is fitting Stanislavian interpretations that give the impression that these characters have life outside the boundaries of the film. All the other parts are treated very satisfactorily, although they are much smaller in this film than I guessed in the novel, and indeed compared to "The Go-Between," an impressive work on disillusionment. <br /> <br /> The disillusionment at the center of this movie is shown so sad and moving in the late scenes where Shaw Miles is kissed and rejected, and where a drunken leadbitter faces Cantrip and Lady Franklin. It's a howling shame that what would have been an incredibly poignant end to a spoiled, desolate life on both sides of the screen is "beautified" with a very odd little coda. One is completely stunned by the leap in tone as Shaw's Leadbitter takes over and ironically sings "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" as he plunges his car into things. The political point is overburdened by this bombastic, rather tricky opera ending. The sense of subtlety so effectively transmitted is lost because the implicit point is heavy and loud. Agit-Prop certainly has no place in this kind of delicate epoch. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, you can not be too hard. While this absurd tail is a big mistake, the rest of the movie has to be praised as a sensitive, evocative film that expresses sadness and detailed observation of the past of British society. Hartley's sleepy but crystal-clear tone is clearly visible throughout. It's just a shame that we do not end up with the shattering conclusion of Shaw's drunken scene. The tragic, misleading figure of Sarah Miles' Lady Franklin is abruptly denied her place in the epicenter of the film as the outstanding human drama bizarre enters the realm of political scoring. Shaw - the driest yet heartfelt feel of actors - is betrayed by the extraordinary excess that closes the film. Thus; a fine little triumph is sabotaged; But we should remember the many good points. <br /> <br /> Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
