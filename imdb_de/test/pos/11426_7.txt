Seeing Laurel without Hardy in a movie looks strange, yet entertaining. It is a successful parody of the classic silent movie in which Stan's talents come into their own. While his paintings with Oliver Hardy were magnificent, these early solo efforts give you an idea of ​​how well he knew his craft and how great he would have been if he continued in the tradition of Keaton and Chaplin as a stand-alone star. The dance sequence with his real wife in the café scene is the best part of the picture and has some very funny pieces to Laurel's excellent dance steps. And the highlight of bullfighting is a gem, as even the bull suffers a pratfall. And I like the irony of the scene, where he's buried in hats and shows up with his famous Laurel and Hardy melon. As much as I love the Laurel and Hardy team, and believe there was never a weird comedy duo on the screen at their best, it's nice to see them occasionally on their own (see THE FIGHTING KENTUCKIAN, the Hardy with the Duke.) as another beautiful example.)
