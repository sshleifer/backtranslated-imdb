In the early '80s, I picked up Honky Tonk Freeway from the cable. Since then I have been waiting and hoping it would be on DVD. I found it yesterday. It's one of the best humoristic character studies I've ever seen. The Old Fashioned episode is priceless. At the moment (28.04.02) only two have checked it. One hated it, the other loved it. If you have a DVD player, borrow it or buy it like me.
