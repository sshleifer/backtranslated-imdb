The movie is excellent. One of the most notable features is that Flynn's performance is outstanding. This is to be emphasized, since he was often mocked by Bette Davis as an actor. I remember the scene where Flynn makes Arthur Kennedy drunk to put him in the battle for the throne Little Big Horn The cold, calculating look on Flynn's face is extraordinary - far better than the much-vaunted Spencer Tracy or many other stars could have done it. <br /> <br /> The other thing to keep in mind is the outstanding performance of George P. Huntley Jr as Lt "Queen's Own" Butler. It is amazing why he stopped making films shortly afterwards - one would have thought he was a character actor for years.
