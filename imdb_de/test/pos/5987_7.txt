I was glad that this film has renounced the alleged deep of all the many pseudo-serious interracial films. Race was an issue, yes, but also class ... and loyalty ... and honesty, etc. <br /> <br /> I also loved the idea that the love affair was not just in the 'decorative' thing aspects the appearance of the two characters. are not our divorce courts (on both sides of the Atlantic, I dare!), which are now filled with enough pairs that look 'good'. together.' is a solid marriage enough? In any case, the tenderness and sensuality of both characters was strong enough to cut love scenes that would bring a rainbow to any dull day! In other words, a carefree movie that is by no means easy!
