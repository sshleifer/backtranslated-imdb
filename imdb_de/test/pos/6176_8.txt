This is a brilliant, lavish Czech film by the Sverak father-son team, which is about two Czech pilots fleeing to England to help the RAF in the Battle of Britain, but also a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Has excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes? probably the best ever and much better than Pearl Harbor or even the Battle of Britain - and a series of interesting general themes like love, war, romance, companionship, loss and bondage. Also the circumstances of moving and learning a foreign language (although here with the great Anna Massey made easier). <br /> <br /> The film has some great little motifs like the world famous RAF bullseye device, shown throughout and at one point beautifully reflected on the black vinyl record, flipped all around (music is of course another theme of the movie). Also, all the traditional icons of English life: curled beer glasses (as opposed to the post-war glasses used in Pearl Harbor), tea in a beautiful china tea set in an English garden (though filmed in the Czech Republic?), The mascot dog, an old one Bottle of HP sauce, even a dartboard! <br /> <br /> Of course, the airfield and the surrounding countryside is absurdly different than in the whole of southern England, though the virtuoso aerial photos make up for this. This shows Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, who are always with the South of England and the Battle of Britain do have. But the best of all is the sensational music of Ondrej Soukup, just about everything by Hans Zimmer, but all in the tradition of the late, excellent Ron Goodwin, who scored the original Battle of Britain alongside other classic English war movies. There is even a nice little cameo role for that ?? apparently ?? famous Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline Lookalike) Oldrich Kaiser playing the title song, Dark Blue Sky, on the piano. Excellent! <br /> <br /> There are also a few small but funny Freudian devices that always float a puffed condom on the ceiling when Karel (the Callow, but the brilliant Krystof Hadek) is stuck in the airfield during the flight Dear rival and pilot pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is with Susan. <br /> <br /> Another great English actor in this movie! Of course Charles Dance is fine as Wing Commander Bentley. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and worth seeing / worthwhile? Get the DVD with special features (stuff like how they created the dogfights). Probably the only movie that combines subtitles with characters that speak English, German, French and Czech at the same time.
