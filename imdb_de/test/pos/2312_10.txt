I have not counted how many times I've watched this movie, but I love it and find it very funny whenever I see it. The facial expression, the slapstick humor and the timing of the jokes make it great. The characters, especially "Nitro", "Sonar" and "Stepanik", are weird. I thought Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job. I think this movie was perfect cast. I think it has to be released on DVD before I go through my VHS version.
