A group of friends collapses in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat tire, the other jeep of the other does not start mysteriously). One of them takes the tire to a run-down gas station and that's the last thing you see about it. As the remaining foursome go in search of their friend, they come across nice Mr. Slaussen, who helps him repair the Jeep and offer cool drinks and shelter from the heat in his equally run-down, reclusive house, which is currently occupied is of very realistic looking mannequins. He goes out with one man from the pile to work on the car and leaves the three girls in the house. Before he leaves, he warns her against leaving the house behind his hut. He warns her in front of "Davy", his brother who lurks around and not everything is there. Of course, one decides to go in search of a working phone and will never be seen again. Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? The mannequins ?? Tourist Trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity that defeats people and never gets along!), But it differs from the rest of the genre of the 70s in their twist of an end. I started to regret Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a terrific, scary, exaggerated performance) at a certain point in the movie, and you can almost see Molly doing the same thing. This is a gem if you can find it; When I was younger, I had taped it off the cable, and when I walked through a used video store, I discovered a VHS copy that was totally overpriced, but it's worth it. Fans of Tanya Roberts will not be disappointed either. The best part of the movie for me was the scene with the soup (and the crackers !!). <br /> <br /> I gave him a 7 because it was part of the movie and still hard to explain.
