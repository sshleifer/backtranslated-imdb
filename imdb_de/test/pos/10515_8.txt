I love the Ln Chaney version of "Phantom," and I appreciate the version of Webber, if I only wish for the growing interest in the book. I wish I'd rather find a mysterious horror with the downplayed romantic aspects. I disagree with the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber has reduced the relationship between Raoul and Christine less. Fortunately, this is a comedic short version in which only Erik and Christine do not even have to have this version bother with other characters. <br /> <br /> I thought I would wait for another version to surpass Lons performance. I was totally wrong Leslie Nielson is fabulous like Erik, of course that's a parody. It is still brilliant. <br /> <br /> I especially appreciated the fact that Erik looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim. I have not seen such a phantom yet, except Lon's. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this short film if you do not like spoils. Because this should not be taken seriously.
