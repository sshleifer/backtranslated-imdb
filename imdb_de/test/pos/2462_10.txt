The time of the Vietnam War is certainly far ahead of my time, but it has always interested me, and I have watched many movies about it. All the others I had seen had worked hard on the front of the battle. When I read a description of "The War At Home," I found the concept intriguing. No film from the Vietnam War I ever heard of has talked about what happens to a soldier when the fighting is over. <br /> <br /> One night, as he leafed through the canals, the movie aired on the Sundance Channel. I turned off the remote and leaned back to look at her. I have not left my seat for the entire two hours; It's one of those films that interests you very much because there's no way to predict what's going to happen next. <br /> <br /> This movie has made me a big fan of Emilio Estevez. I enjoyed him very much as Billy the Kid in the "Young Guns" movies, but I never saw anything he did afterwards. Emilio proved to be very talented in writing and governing as well as in acting. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is extremely good. It's hard for me to think of a point where it's going on. <br /> <br /> What astonishes me is that it did not receive an Oscar or real recognition when it came out. It's a dramatic story about parents trying to deal with the fact that their son is not who he once was and probably will never be the way they remember him. Definitely worth seeing.
