I study Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I came across "Cidade de Deus / City of God". Let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or BETTER as "City of God". <br /> <br /> The acting, the cinematography and the music monitoring make this film a unique experience. I have not been to Brazil yet, but this film introduces the harsh reality to the citizens of SÃ£o Paulo. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if you like good cinema. This movie is disturbing and you may feel discouraged after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Something you want to see, but nothing to sleep on.
