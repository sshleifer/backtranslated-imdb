The Seven-Ups is a good and thrilling movie. It's packed with credible achievements by Scheider, LaBianco and an effective, fearsome performance by Richard Lynch - though most characters are hard cardboard boxes. The character development does not develop on the screen at all. We only know that the good are the good and the bad are bad. Deviating from the crime norm, The Seven-Ups succeeds in throwing Scheider and the crew in a unique spelling in the middle of a building ground. On-site locations in New York City and an excellent choreographed chase underline the film. The only drawback of the movie is the somewhat confusing plotline at the beginning. They give the viewer little evidence that the men being kidnapped are related to the mob (see you later in the movie). If someone blind started to watch the movie, the story could be a bit confused. Otherwise, The Seven-Ups is a pleasurable, testosterone-rich time.
