This movie was a big surprise for me when I saw him at Cinequest in the big California Theater in San Jose. It's a musical I do not usually like, but I have to say it was different. Robert Peters, who staged and stared at the film, did a wonderful job. During his questions and answers, he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew! Most of the dialouges were "on the fly" and he made the film during another film festival in Germany. I can not say enough great things about this movie, the only bad thing is that you really notice the camera work and shake it a bit. If you come across this movie, have a look!
