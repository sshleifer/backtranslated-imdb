WTF !! End of one of his books / movies with a happy ending? The notebook was fine ... but too bad, enough with the depressing ends already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable ... but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their entire lives to achieve only a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - finally finding the true meaning of happiness and living the rest of the day. Do not we already know what really happens in real life? Can not we - for a moment (one and a half hours) live vicariously through a film that ends with a happy ending - that gives us hope for our own future ??? <br /> <br /> Yes - wah. I know. But I think we have to anticipate films that end like this with a warning. "Attention: No happy ending."
