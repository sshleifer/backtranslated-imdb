Is it full moon tonight? OH! It does not matter that they can change anytime they want the drug! What did I expect when the night is full moon ?! Gosh. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie, there's romance, suspense, horror and hot stuff;) I like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from bungee jumping kill and catch her. That was really cool. The scenery of this film is in the city of love, which is Paris in France. The cemetery scenes are nice, it gives you shivers that do not know what is happening there or who is behind the walls. The scenes that make you jump out of your seat are really cool. Even they brought me into these scenes. His friend, who died, and the girl he killed in the cemetery but still shows himself to be the main character (I'm sorry I forgot his name), was really funny. The actors did a good job and the make-up crews. If they are all celebrating in an abandoned church, I can not believe that people would do that, because even though this is an abandoned church, it is still the house of God. I bought this movie a long time ago and do not regret buying it. I am a horror movie lover. I give this movie 5 out of 6 stars. For the people who are open and love movies like this, give it a try, you like it.
