The movie is not for everyone. Some may think that acting is bad, if it is understated and natural. There are no obvious evil acts and there are no breathtakingly beautiful moments. There is a lot of indecision, many contradictory feelings. <br /> <br /> This film takes a very honest look at a very complex topic: sex with minors. It's complex because the characters try to deal with love and sex as their bodies and their hormones are still evolving and developing both their minds and their personality. Complex, also because the society has very simple views on sex with minors, and complex because the characters do not know if the society is right or if their instincts are right. <br /> <br /> Some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions. Questions such as the one who was really responsible for the relationship that got damaged, the good that came out of it were art that got more damaged, some problems with their relationship stems from being banned from the company's problems own immature, and probably most importantly, was this really a crime? <br /> <br /> The film is determinedly neutral in all of this, and this neutrality is its strength. This is the reason for the subtle acting, the simple sets, the missing background music, the soft light and the general "flat" presentation. The message is clear. We do not really understand that kind of relationship today, and quick judgments will inevitably be superficial.
