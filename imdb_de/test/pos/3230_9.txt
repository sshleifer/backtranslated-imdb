Text from the 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide. <br /> <br /> fuckland The title is a pun based on Fabian Stratas' leading actor in the film's allusion to his protagonist's secret agenda. <br /> <br /> Fabian is an Argentine citizen, an amateur who pretends to be a tourist when he visits the Falkland Islands, shortly after he was reopened to its residents. His master plan is to win the ultimate fight by seducing and impregnating the local women, starting with the delicious Camilla and thus a generation of half Argentines. Fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fisheye perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic flair and intimacy. (ARGENTINA)
