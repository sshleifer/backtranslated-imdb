I came across this movie on DVD just by chance through a blockbuster rental. Voyage to the Planets is an outstanding BBC 2-hour documentary / drama about a future "grand tour" of the solar system. This film seeks to keep up to date with the knowledge of the planets and space travel and the plausible extarnations of existing technology, and tells the story of astronauts on a journey to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto. <br /> <br /> The special effects are perfect for a TV show. I found the actors believable as astronauts. The situations presented are mostly plausible and you learn a lot about the science of planets and space travel! Only two minor complaints: I sometimes found some situations and dialogues a bit maudlin. I am also not sure if a single crew and a ship would be sent to a single mission to see all of these targets simultaneously. Visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. would probably be separate missions. <br /> <br /> You have not tried to save on this show with production values. The scenes of Venus and Mars were actually shot in the northern deserts of Chile - the driest part of the world and a dead call for the Martian landscape. Sequences of weightlessness were filmed in a Russian transport jet. The producers could have fooled themselves with studios and CGI about these two things, but instead chose the real thing. <br /> <br /> I would especially like to mention the wonderful music composed for this film. The exciting theme of Don Davis is the first thing she grabs at the beginning of the film. The grandiose attitude of Pegasus passes through the screen and David Suchet emphasizes "it is man's destiny to explore the stars ...". <br /> <br /> When I see this on a small TV screen, I regret it. What a thrill to see this in a movie, or even better an IMAX presentation!
