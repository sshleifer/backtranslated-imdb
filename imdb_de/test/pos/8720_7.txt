The swinging bachelor Matthau, a successful dentist, joins his blond lover Hawn and tells her that he is a married man with three children. After her suicide attempt Matthau decides to make herself responsible and to marry the girl. Worried that she will become a "home bitch," Hawn wants to meet his wife and explain everything to her. Matthau employs his faithful sister Bergman to behave his wife, and then things get really complicated. <br /> <br /> A farce comedy with irresistible footprints often leads to the black, but is not credible for a second. The script challenges us to believe that we men are so one-dimensional that it is truly unimaginable. But maybe this comedy does not have to be analyzed too deeply, just sit back and enjoy the exceedingly jolly Matthau, the exceedingly charming Bergman and debutant Hawn, who has basically created the stupid blond girl role here.
