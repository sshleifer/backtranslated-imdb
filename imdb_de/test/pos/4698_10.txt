As mentioned and mentioned in many previous comments, this unique series has many great items and ingredients. In fact, more than 20 years after its original broadcast, it is still being watched and re-watched, and has a large global fan base, indicating that the creators of this series undoubtedly have done something right. However, the root of the series' brilliance and remarkable appeal must be based on beautifully written dialogues and timeless characters. All are brought to life by wonderful actors. The characters are wonderful because of their complexity. Unlike many other Robin Hood adaptations and indeed many other movie and television productions in general, the good guys in this series often make mistakes and have obvious shortcomings, while the bad guys, while being labeled as evil and reckless, can often be understood and sometimes even quite sympathetic. This makes Robin of Sherwood a story about versatile, REAL people? instead of good and bad people? something that contributes greatly to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. Although this is a very action packed series with many astonishing stunts (which is remarkable in itself, as it was done long before today's computer animation, green screens, etc.), behind each of these endless types, falling castle walls, catching horses and catching fire There is indeed a real person who has fallen from a castle wall or horse at some point or caught fire, there are always amazing dialogues between the different characters in each episode, but in the end, they are usually the villains in the series "Nickolas Grace as Sheriff of Nottingham, Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne and Philip Jackson as Abbot Hugo de Rainault who get the best lines and steal the show more often with their arguments full of wit and affection." It's a wedding "no celebration!" is just one of their many timeless "pearls of wisdom" that seems to follow you through life :-). 20 years later, is it really hard to believe that Robin of Sherwood was originally something made for television? and apparently not with a lot of money? to provide fleeting Saturday afternoons for young children in the UK. Filmed in beautiful locations, with smart, amazing scripts and remarkable stunts and fantastic actors? many of them give their performance in this show? This seems to be more professional in many ways and has a higher production value than many Hollywood movies.
