Post-war England, the beginning of the "nuclear age". But the worries of a young student yearning for his first "kiss" can not be disappointed by something as unimportant as THE BOMB. This was a delightful if not instructive look at young love from the point of view of a growing man and his 40s world. Free of political correctness and forbidden messages, this film shows the viewer of the world who can only create the mind (and hormones) of a young teenager. Wonderful plots <br /> <br /> maintain the character's interest ala "Gregory's Girl", and many <br /> <br /> well-blocked shots help maintain the imagery of that era. This is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who has ever fallen in love or wanted to. Will he ever get his wish? Look at it and see.
