The failure or breaking of a love story is for me, whether I like the characters or not and whether they click together. Matt is pretty unlikely: distant, brute, seemingly lazy and a misogynist. He was seriously injured by his dysfunctional mother and that makes him a little easier to take. I think I liked the details of his malfunction - he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he is pinning Amy. He's so cool for Amy that he beats twice. When they talk, he can not show her who he really is. She can empathize and stony at just the right moments. She seems to be so mature and strong that the later emerging features of her did not fit. (For me.) I found her incredibly sexy and pretty. , , Pretty girl next door, I call it. So I would like this movie if it was not really messed up. <br /> <br /> Funny things happen with the coach, but Matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. The football scenes in the end were confusing. Matt does not wear the ball, but seems to be a block. Guys, he's not the right size! He is fifty pounds too light for this position. But I thought his acting was clever. I measure that by how I wanted to rip his neck a few times in his scenes with Meredith Monroe. The movie was alright. Meredith M was better than all right.
