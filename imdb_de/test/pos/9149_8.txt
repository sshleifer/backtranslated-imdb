This film is a good start for beginners who have never seen a "silent movie" and for those who believe that quality cinema began with the efforts of their generations. They do themselves a disadvantage by not broadening their horizons. The "Silent Film" is an art form of pantomime, which differs from the sound film and the stage, it can stand on their own merits. THE BELOVED ROGUE (1927), United Artists is a fictionalised history of the relationship of the French poet "Francois Villon" and "King Louis XI." Through "Villons" whistle, "King Louis" will defeat his enemy system "Duke of Burgandy", minimize the feudal system and establish KING as head of state and the beginnings of modern France, led by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, Drew's grandfather). For those who only remember the decaying actor "Larry Renault" in DINNER AT EIGHT (1933) or the ham in THE INVISABLE WOMEN (1940), this will be a revelation. Watch out, still cut with the 'Great Profile' as proof that he is commanding the screen. Co-starring in his first American movie is CONRAD VEIDT with his "Corps Spider" interpretation of "Louis XI". This is a duel of theatrical titans who do not give the other a centimeter. On a trivia note is Character Actor and Dwarf ANGELO ROSSITTO in his first movie, his last, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985). There are other character actors who would continue their sound and are easy to hear. <br /> <br /> United Artists did not save any costs in this beautiful production supervised by WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. Costumes, props and sets are well made and not exaggerated as in DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS productions. Here is a touch of reality. The DVD copy we watched at Delta Entertainment comes from a good master. Although it was not "restored", the musical soundtrack was clear and the pressure only suffered from annoying black spots (dirt) and failures. The only major damage at the end of the last roll by water. 'Cinema' also has an edition that may be of better quality as they fundamentally restore their prints. It is best to check with them. In our opinion, this is a must, especially if you do not have any silents in your collection. This is a good start.
