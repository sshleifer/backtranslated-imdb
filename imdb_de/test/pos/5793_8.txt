There was a lot about Little Vera that was strange to me. All in all, I liked this movie, but in many ways the characters do not behave the way I used to. For example, the environment in which Vera's family lived was very tense. Almost every time the family was together, they either drank, fought, or screamed, and often it was a combination of the three. After watching the movie, I felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place during the movie. However, I was very interested in seeing the history of this Russian middle class family. Throughout the film, we are reminded of the industrialized state of Russia by repeated shots of a train passing by the screen. It gave the viewer a sense of a lived life. The characters seemed to focus on living their lives through work and drinking after work. There was no feeling of happiness throughout the movie. The only time a character could not scream was when Vera fell in love with her fianc√©e Sergei for the first time. This was very short-lived, as the viewer later discovered (after Sergei Vera's father locked in a bathroom and Vera let him out, whereupon the father stabbed Sergei), that he is abusive. Another time Vera is told that the only reason for her birth was that the family could get a bigger apartment. It is very interesting to see how both Vera and the family could relate to each other. The movie was definitely worth a look because it shows what life can be like in areas of Russia.
