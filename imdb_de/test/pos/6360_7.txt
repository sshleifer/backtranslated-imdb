"The Couch Trip" is one of those stupid comedies they released in the 80s. In this case, Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who expresses himself as a psychiatrist, and he goes to Beverly Hills to visit Charles Grodin. The film's humor derives largely from its satirical view of Beverly Hills and the empty lives of the people there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid). Do not expect religious experiences. But you'll most likely laugh a lot as the people in Beverly Hills flaunt their wealth. With Walter Matthau, Donna Dixon, Arye Gross and Victoria Jackson (from "UHF").
