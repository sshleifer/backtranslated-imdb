After seeing this routine by John Leguizamo, I finally realize why he is such a talent. I like great stage work, and that's stage work at its best. I can not call it a stand-up routine because Leguizamo is so intense when he plays the different characters. The only time he breaks his character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part, doing so coolly that one can not help but appreciate one's talents. I was not really sure how I felt as an actor, but Freak confirmed my appreciation for him. For those who have not had the opportunity to see this show, I feel for you. Be sure to check it. It's one of the nest routines I've ever seen. Placed with Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. Four stars and more.
