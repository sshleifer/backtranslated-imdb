This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's great to be in groups, I think. It's also great for any Alan Rickman fan. He does such a wonderful job. It's captivating, entertaining and very surprising ... you have to see it at least twice. I did not see it with someone who did not like it, or at least it's worth it.
