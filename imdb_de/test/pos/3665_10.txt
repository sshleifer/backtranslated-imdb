I've seen a few Bollywood movies in my childhood - you know the typical plot boy who meets girls, girls reject boys, Dakus (villains) take girls away, boys save girls by killing hundreds of Dhakus, and they marry happily Of course I skipped an hour with musical style numbers.) Well, I look at Hari Om, I'm expecting another typical Bollywood movie; To my delight, however, it turned out to be atypical and quite funny indeed. Bharatbalas Hari Om could be described as one of those "off beat" Indian films, such as the ever popular South Asian hits like Monsoon Wedding, East is East or Bend it Like Beckham. Being of South Asian decent and having seen several classic Bollywood films, there was a lot of humor and sub dialogues that reminded of the fun and charming side of Indian culture (eg the different ones) Indo-pop numbers actually reproduced by Nitin Soni or the funny Indian slangs that were used). Hari Om can be enjoyed by all South Asians and is also entertaining for those who do not get used to Indian humor as the characters and actions appeal to all viewers. <br /> <br /> In a coconut shell, the film is played by an auto rickshaw driver (aka "All-Wheeler" for those who have traveled to India) by Vija Raaz (from Monsoon Wedding), who picks himself up involves a rogue and owes him a lot of money. In order to avoid the sale of his four-wheeled vehicle "Madhuri", he escapes with "Madhuri" and a very charismatic and lovable woman from France, Isa (Camille Natta), who herself escaped the boredom of her friend Benoit (Jean Marie Lamour) was in the swimming pool) , The movie is from her journey through the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan? the land of love stories; By humor, you see the two main characters who want to find out who they really are. <br /> <br /> What made the night most memorable was the director, executive producer, principal editor and even Ms. Natta's mother present at the screening. After talking with Bharatbala (who actually has a zoological background), many interesting tidbits of the film were discovered, including: the film was finished just 10 days before the Toronto International Film Festival and only took 45 days to shoot, and it was only five actors doing the play (the rest were all real actors for the first time). When I got home, I realized two things from the movie - that despite the differences between each of us, there is always a human connection and, secondly, as the director said, "Everyone has a love story". <br /> <br /> It is a must for everyone!
