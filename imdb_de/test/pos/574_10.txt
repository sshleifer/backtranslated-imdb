I am glad that this was the work of foreign filmmakers, because they can not be accused of unfair prejudice. For no reason, the police in Jacksonville rush to the court in this case and select the first black suspect, who accuses the murder of a white, foreign tourists. You have chosen a 15 year old. An old child as close to a saint as one might think it would be arbitrary, and making a fool of himself trying to set an unlikely case against him. In addition to the injustice that results from the obvious prejudice, it is the unlawful detention of a completely innocent young teenager of 6 months. The question arises as to whether we as a society should compensate those who are being tried, imprisoned and subsequently found innocent. This docudrama is well produced, professionally recorded and presented in a gripping package that you do not want to miss for a minute. If you are interested in social justice, do not miss it. It certainly deserves his Oscar.
