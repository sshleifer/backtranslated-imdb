The warmest and most engaging movie of his genre, That Lips, Those Eyes, made me smile and cry as he reminded me of the work I need to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment. Hulce and Langella are great and the story seems to be self-written. A brilliant screenplay by David Shaber (one of my favorites! - see The Warriors and Nighthawks for more ...) and beautiful sets made locally (I think) in the actual summer theater where the story takes place. You can not see this movie and you do not want to drop everything and go to the theater! Please check this video if you can find it.
