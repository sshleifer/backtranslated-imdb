This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does not fit the 1956 classic, but is a fine film with enough coarse and tumble action and moves in a good clip. The Ranger explores a series of mysterious murders that have a sinister pattern, with peaceful Indians who are victims of a gang of hood murderers. There are more murders and acts of violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures, and the film has an undercurrent of racist insensitivity whose comments are sprayed throughout the script. The ranger uses disguises as only he can to gather clues, unmask the outlaw's band, and bring them to justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels play in a colorful presentation that celebrates the desert and cactus land of ancient Tucson. The music score is good, but the familiar William Tell Overture theme is filled with interesting vocals, but they do not have the glamor and beauty of the traditional Ranger theme.
