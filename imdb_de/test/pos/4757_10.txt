"The Seven-Ups" seems to be a repeat of "The French Connection", which was released two years ago. Both the late Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are there, as well as the stunt driver Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> But we are not dealing with French drug trafficking; Instead, we are engaged in a war on various hoods and criminals after a police officer was brutally killed by a Hoodlum. We experience inconvenience and a New York City from the 1990s. <br /> <br /> I like to watch this movie because it's exciting to see the action and remind of a cooler time. However, comparing the chases, Mr. Hickman was involved in the three most compared objects: this movie, Bullitt and The French Connection. Every chase scene has its own qualities and this one is just great. <br /> <br /> And I am glad that this title has been given the light of day on DVD.
