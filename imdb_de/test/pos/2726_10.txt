Every now and then, one encounters a film that compels people to rethink the response of society to people who are different from their definition of the normal. Mitthi, who suffered from anti-social elements and was left alone with her tragedy, retires to her idyllic world ... one that she believes is the real world. Surreal (Mitthis world) overlaps with the real one (her family). <br /> <br /> Mitthi, who suffers from schizophrenia, forces us to rethink our priorities by trying to rehabilitate patients like her. Are we right to pull them back into our reality if we only have to offer them pain and suffering? What right do we have to rob them of their source of happiness? What right must we take to their joy if we can not help them in their grief? 15 Park Avenue is one of the best films on social issues ... and shows us the need for every patient to need empathy and not just sympathy.
