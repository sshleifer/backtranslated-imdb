I saw the movie in its original theatrical release in Austin Texas. The old Paramount Theater (I do not know if it still exists) performed with loudspeakers on the walls that were connected to all six channels. At 15, I was overwhelmed. The concept of surround sound at that time was completely alien to music and film. <br /> <br /> I vividly remember at least three outstanding scenes in which the surround sound had a big impact. (Please forgive me if time has distorted my memories with inaccuracies.) The first was a camera ride through Catfish Row, alive with the places and sounds of daily activity. They saw everyone first, such as a blacksmith, and when the camera passed by their sound, you could hear them going to the left or right of the theater side. The second was a marching band, first seen in the front, then marched past the camera and split left and right. Not only does the sound of each instrument have its own directional path, it has also changed in tone when played on you, on your side, and then away from you. And if that was not enough, they also considered the Doppler effect for each instrument. The third scene was about to end when Porgy left Catfish Row for New York to search for Bess. He and about half the performers pass the camera as they leave the village with the same sound effects as the brass band. The other half of the cast sings and sings goodbye to Porgy and her other friends. The friends' answers can then be heard from the sides and from behind. <br /> <br /> Surround sound has been used throughout the movie with great effects. I think I remember a rock or something thrown from a pier and heard it land in the water behind me. Such small things were obvious to theatergoers who were fortunate enough to have the full six channels - things that would seem banal without theaters in cinemas. <br /> <br /> I stayed several theatrical performances in the theater. You could do that then. And I went back several times before leaving the city. I never saw the movie again. It's literally BEGS for release on DVD with restored image fidelity and surround sound. I hope someone kept it somewhere. Please, Gershwin family, let it be free, before it is finally lost for other generations.
