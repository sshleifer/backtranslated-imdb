Stan Laurel considered PUTTING PANTS ON PHILIP the first "true" L & H movie. THE SECOND HUNDRED YEARS was the first "official" L & H movie, but Stan did not just have to put up with the show (he had signed up as a director and "gag-man" at Hal Roach Studios before including Oliver Hardy's lamb-legged accident, which forced Stan to replace him, and the extra money he and his new wife, Lois, had to pay for his historic return to the show, as well as writing and governing, editing and writing Involvement in other areas of production), but also recognized that he was part of a team that worked well together. This is therefore a historic and very important film in the history of comedy. <br /> <br /> It's also a surprisingly funny little silent movie; It differs slightly from what Laurel & Hardy would become known for and from what they are directly connected with today. The characters of 'Stan & Ollie' do not appear - the Scottish Stan Laurel plays the nephew of Oliver Hardy, a respectable man from the city who is reluctant to be seen joking with this weird-looking guy and the habit of chasing pretty girls , There are a few very funny moments in this well-made, charming little movie, and the performances of these two Kings of Comedy are just the thing. Look at Stan's little "scissor kick" and a smile that says, "Well, waddaya know?" when he sees girls, for example, or the rushing scene at the airport. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, if you can, with background music from The Beau Hunks Orchestra (available in the VVL video releases) that enhances the feeling of the 1920s and is very pleasant to hear , It's a brilliant and underrated little movie, so I said it was "surprisingly" funny.
