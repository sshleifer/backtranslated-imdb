This is easily one of the best films of the 1950s. Otto Preminger shot only four or five really good films and that's one of them. Frank Sinatra does his best and the music score by Elmer Bernstein is dynamite. From the opening tracks (by Saul Bass) to the hysteria of drug addict Frank, who enters the cold turkey, this is a fascinating movie! With Kim Novak (very good performance), Eleanor Parker (very poor performance), Darren McGavin as reptile shifter and Arnold Stang as Frank's friend. Beware of bad printing: This movie is in the public domain, so some copies are pretty rough.
