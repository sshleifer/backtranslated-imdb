What a fantastic movie !!!!!!!! I came out of the theater amazed. The movie I just saw was one of the best movies I've seen in my life. I had my eyes glued to the screen. It is very symbolic, optically lush, beautifully shot and beautifully told. These are essentially two people who move into an apartment and live side by side with their partners, who are believed to have an affair with the other partners. If accepted, our two heroes act the way they think they are for their partners. There is an obvious repression of emotions among themselves, using vouryistic camera work, body language, and symbollic stairs. It's a visual celebration and hard to like. Part of the story gets a bit confusing, but that's nothing. The ending is one of the most beautiful (and anti-hollywood) endings I've ever seen in my life and visually amazing. The films that are insistent contribute to the mood. I recommend this movie to anyone who is open-minded and respectful. What a great movie.
