This movie is really unique. It really captures the spirit of the game, but makes it entertaining for the modern generation. The romance between Tromeo and Juliet was believable and erotic, not influenced by many adaptations. It's so funny that I almost cried with laughter. <br /> <br /> Like most Troma's in your face, taboo themes, gore and sex, and still add really good acting and a Shakespearean storyline. You really have to see this movie to believe it! <br /> <br /> There are some daring jokes in the credits (best credits I've seen since hot shots), lots of jokes in jokes, and general satire and Shakespeare refs. And Lemmy from Motorhead tells. I lent this movie to a friend and had almost no work to get it back. Troma at its best, this movie is truly a gem and one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the kind of movie you would see with your mother and offend some people. For anyone who is bored with the mill cinema, you MUST see this movie with a crazy sense of humor.
