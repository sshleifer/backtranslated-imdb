Great, just great! The west coast got "Dirty" Harry Callahan, the east coast became Sharky. Burt Reynolds plays Sharky in "Sharky's Machine" and I enjoyed every minute. Playing in Atlanta, GA is exactly what everyone wants. Instead of a suspension, he is sent to the Vice Squad. As in the Dirty Harry movies or other police films, the captain will always be the jerk. When I was a kid, I was curious what this movie means "Sharky's Machine." Well, I knew who played Sharky, I wonder what his machine was. It was his group of colleagues. After he has uncovered the murder, he selects the culprit. If it turns out that he's a big mob boss, Sharky will not play around anymore. When he brings the other prostitute to safety, Sharky struggles hard and good, even though he loses a finger on the bat. And I also like the part where evil is blown out of the building through a glass window. That was the BOMB! Randy Crawford's "Street Life" really got the movie in the right mood, and the movie itself is really a big hit for me, ALWAYS! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
