I have to admit that I have a penchant for the humor and storytelling style of British films, though of course not everyone succeeds. <br /> <br /> This movie made me think and left me with a movie back to my face. It's about character development and relationships, about truth and lies, and whether love is sometimes not enough. Some very nice understated spectacles from all participants, especially the two main actors, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of fuss about Gosford Park, but with this piece I feel like Fellowes has actually produced a better movie, even though it was not a mainstream release. An intelligent, mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed, but capable of real actions of grace.
