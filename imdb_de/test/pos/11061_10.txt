I first saw this movie in elementary school in the 1960s. I was intrigued by the character Ingrid Bergman played, and it was my introduction to the French Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the film is the best as she comes back to avenge her father's wife and daughter (her mother was shamed in disgrace). During this time, she meets the wonderful Clint Maroon, played by Gary Cooper. The chemistry between the two is great. The second half of the movie takes place in Saratoga, New York (the saratoga of the title), and I never enjoy it as much as New Orleans, but it's still very good. I give this movie a ten - partly out of nostalgia, but mostly because it's just a damn good movie and the characters are just as wonderful as Bergman and Cooper (Flora Robson is almost close to stealing Bergman's scenes). It used to be shown regularly on television, but if anything, it is rarely shown - it would be good if one of the classic movie stations would record and use their program cycles.
