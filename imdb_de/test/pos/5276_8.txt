Okay, if this movie had been shot much later in the history of cinema, it would not be particularly worthwhile. However, in 1898, films were still in their infancy and almost all of them were boring and had no real story to tell - instead, they showed only ordinary everyday people doing day-to-day activities. When they are seen today, almost everyone is hopelessly boring and very, very short - often less than a minute! And considering that, this short film from a movie is quite swelling and can only make you laugh. Two guys, a miller and a chimney collide and throw flour and coal dust together when they quarrel. THAT'S ALL - the movie is over before you know it.
