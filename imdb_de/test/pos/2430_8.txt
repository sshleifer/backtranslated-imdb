There is no question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. Apart from very marked differences in appearance (Anderson's eyes are noticeably larger, the lips are thicker, the nose is bigger and the end has appeared ... etc.), Anderson's inability to speak Russian was a ridiculous reference. I hate Anna Anderson and their allies so much. Not many scammers have the audacity and perseverance to cheat on such a totally untenable scheme for over 60 years. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I have some sympathy for Anna Anderson. At that time, life had been difficult for a young Polish agricultural worker. And embodying another woman for over 60 years is a tedious task for everyone. She had to hold back her fleshy lips all the time to imitate Anastasia's thin lips, and occasionally had to go insane to make people believe that all her chaotic memory was just a result of a mental problem. <br /> <br /> Anna Anderson was a great woman on a wrong track. Having put her good looks, learned elegance, stamina, and acting skills into proper use, she could be a first-rate actress. By the way: Some of the main characters of this two-parter seem to be loosely based on real numbers. Prince Erich could be a mix of Gleb Botkin (who thinks many of the most imaginative minds are behind the plan), Duke George and Dmitri von Leuchtenberg, and several other characters. And Darya Romanoff seems to be based on the beautiful princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova. But unlike the real allies, Prince Erich was moteless in this show and supported Anna out of love for and sincere faith in her, which touched her. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great show. A bit fictitious, but remains true to reality. The power of Amy Irving's acting is that she successfully represented Anderson's self-assurance, and the mix of identifying others and being one's self is intriguing. Just as Princess Xenia said of Anderson, "She was herself at all times and never made the slightest impression of playing a role." Highly recommended.
