I would love it if members of the cast and crew sat down and made an audio commentary on this movie! All the different places where they filmed this movie! Should deliver some very good anecdotes! Fans of this film would like to know: <br /> <br /> What kind of approval did they have to get to film in certain locations? <br /> <br /> Were there unforgettable outtakes? <br /> <br /> Were there any scenes that were deleted? <br /> <br /> What challenges did the cast and crew face? <br /> <br /> Did actors have any stunt doubles? <br /> <br /> What was it like to work with other members of the cast? <br /> <br /> Were one of the scenes free? <br /> <br /> What do cast members and crew have? now? <br /> <br /> What places are still there and which places are no longer available or are they now another business? <br /> <br /> It is one thing to read about this movie, this site and other websites. But it is simply no comparison to get it straight out of the horse's mouth! <br/> <br /> Come on, people! Meet and comment! Never go away from a challenge! Treat yourself to the fun!
