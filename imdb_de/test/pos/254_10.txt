I have just seen the 08th MS Gundam for the second time. It's so much better than Gundam Wing. I can not wait to get the DVD and see what was cut out of the show. It's great to see how the Gundams actually move awkwardly across the country. Someone really thought about writing this movement script. <br /> <br /> See this today.
