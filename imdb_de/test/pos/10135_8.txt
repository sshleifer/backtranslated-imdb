Corniness warning. As many IMDb users already know, I'm not a stupid, cheesy person. If you do not want to read this type of review, then go ahead. <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, you hear this from a man who laughed through the Titanic and nearly broke his parent's belt, rewinding the propeller scene continuously. <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler --- <br /> <br /> One day I went to the theater with two friends to see Dickie Roberts: Former Kinderstern, last year in August. The boring trailers kept rolling until one started so quietly. It was for the radio. When I saw the trailer, I had to watch this movie on the opening weekend. When this weekend was over, Scary Movie 3 was over, so many teenagers were waiting in line that Friday night. It turned out that the movie was sold out and these teenagers were so desperate to watch a movie, they left and Good Boy and Radio were sold out. I could not get a ticket and in the following weeks I dealt with more important things. About 5 months later, my friend rented a radio. He let me borrow it and I looked at it in my room. I'll tell you this now, this is the ONLY movie I've ever seen that ever made me cry. When the mother of Radio died, she came out automatically. The next day I went to Blockbuster and bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> Well enough of my stupid personal story, let me tell you something about the movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally challenged man nicknamed Radio. Ed Harris co-stars and this movie is directed by Mike Tollin. Radio is based on a true story and is a teen who lives alone for a lifetime. He walks around with a shopping cart, picking up whatever he can and always carrying a radio. He has his own collection. At the end of each day he goes home to his mother. He went to school later in the film. One day, radio passes the local high school while the football team is training. A football flies over the fence and the radio picks it up and continues. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, the football coach. They meet, and this is the life of the radio. Throughout the film, Radio and Coach Jones spend a good time together, teaching each other things. It's nice to see the movie go to the highest delights, the deepest lows and just watch the radio live its life. They will laugh, cry and live the life of the radio with him. This movie has a special place in my heart, along with Toy Story and others. This is a must for the whole family, for yourself or if you are someone who just wants a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Radio will never forget me. No way. <br /> <br /> As Ed Harris's character said just before the end of the film: <br /> <br /> "We do not teach radio, radio teaches us." <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
