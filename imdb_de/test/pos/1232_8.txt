This film, for which he was meant to be, was successful. It is a short tragic movie. Although I have chosen a film that really develops characters and their relationships, this film is just a taste and give you the factor "what happens next". After seeing it, I really wanted more, more of the characters in the story, what influence they had to make them the people they were. I think that's what the creators thought. The acting is incredible. There are not many lines in the film, so their body language, facial expression and general presence had to be strong enough to hold back a scene. Both Franco and Miner have this element and it shows. That they (especially Franco) should take the time to do this obviously says that they believed in this film and wanted to be separated from it, and for that I appreciated the movie for what it was. I am also glad that I own it, so that I can share it with other people who never knew it existed.
