Wow, what can I say, it was a good movie, unlike all the boring remakes we've seen lately. The only thing I would have wished for would have been a little more of an end than if Jane had left her husband. She fell in love with her, not just her, but everything she is. I wish the producers would actually show this end instead of leaving it to their imagination. I really hate it when they do that. The aerial shots looked like fun, but I think you need to be light and muscular, I'd like to see more movies like this, maybe they could do some sort of sequel to Jane and Serena. If I were in Jane's shoes would have gone well for the girl, she was attractive.
