This feels like it's a Czech version of Pearl Harbor. It has the same story, both boys fall in love with the same woman. The woman is a married woman whose husband has been missing for a year. I do not think the plot is too strong. The younger guy is pretty naughty, that's cute. It has been watching me because of the emotional music and the pleasing scenes one after the other. It also has some strong visual effects. The best part is that the love stories are seamlessly integrated into the story. <br /> <br /> I think if it were in English it would be such a big shot in all states. It is a pity that not many people are open to foreign films.
