Catherine Breillat, selected during the Quinzaine des réalisateurs, will be masterfully shared by her autobiographical film in 2002. There, her lead actress Anne Parillaud (La Femme NIKITA, Luc Besson) embodies the director of Intimate Scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy of the behaviors of actors. Making Of Filmgenre? Pornography or exhibitionism? Sex Is Comedy is a postmodern film based on a film within the film. As an implosive story of a minimalist love scene, the film is built up with a constant solidarity of forms and spirit, in which Breillat repeatedly breaks and analyzes the taboos. Catherine Breillat uses her clinical analyzes of sexuality as an isolated problem outside of society, using visual codes and a sense of the formula to communicate through the door of the heart Nénette et Boni, Claire Denis, The Dream Life of Angels ( Eric Zonca) in the role of actor and Roxanne Mesquida (Fat Girl, Catherine Breillat, Marie from the Bay of Angels, Manuel Prada), the actress, are actor She invents, she clarifies in an interview. Breillat even observes the man in front of him, a chaste man. Then Breillat films the shame and the sexual mutilation, but also a great hope, a disturbing dimension of ecstasy, a nudity of feelings, the halving of the exhibitionism, which seems to be one. The director is eventually expected to make the actors reveal their feelings, body, and soul. Arranged in this way, given the problem of the order of "who am I", the performers of Breillat use an inorganic vitality to unite in their ongoing work. But for a form of incredible exorcism, Breillat poses many questions for an actor. The actors, who are suffering greatly at the same time, seem to be those who seek that loving transport as part of the eternity of their work. The art of Breillat is known by researchers how to extinguish the boundaries of intimate scenes in a dialogue. Make-up, erection prostheses and syndicates are not enough to remember which images and scenes by Jan Steen and Rembrandt could be in the anecdote and the daily characters of a shooting set. While the moral categories disappear in the context of Sex Is Comedy, Breillat succeeds in revealing the loving imitation of actors in a landscape of impressive and dramatic humanity.
