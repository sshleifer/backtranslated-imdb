I did not expect much of this story from a kid whose semester paper was stolen and turned into a screenplay. Frankie Muniz from "Malcom in the Middle" is the star of the kid and is pretty good and Amanda Bynes as his girlfriend is also very good. Yes, the movie works as an advertisement for Universal Studios and is really a stupid kids movie. But I enjoyed it anyway. NOTE B-
