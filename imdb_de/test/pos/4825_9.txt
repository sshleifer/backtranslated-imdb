From acting to Cardone's direction, this new twist on the mistaken theme of the known spirit will hold you in place. Sometimes slow, because it creates that tension that is "what's going to happen". Medium-good on gore but what is pretty bad there. Spoiler: The death of the Jockhole and the subsequent feast is a highlight for Gore Hounds. <br /> <br /> The writers invented an old story, but they added more twists and gave them typical ghosts. Cardone brings it to life. , , uh. , uh death. <br /> <br /> Lori Heuring, Scout Taylor-Compton and the ever-fabulous Ben Cross are real, there's no sign of acting here. Everyone in the cast is committed and really is not what every director strives for. The actors believe so we believe. <br /> <br /> In addition to the traditional surprises of the ghost story, the movie is loaded with lots of atmosphere. From the mine, Hanks house and the house of Tunny there is a terrible fear from the beginning Frame to the last. <br /> <br /> Horror fans, do yourself a favor and enjoy what is one of the real horror movies today. <br /> <br /> I end up with a big kudo Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nedivi (script) for Hollywood inventor without inventor would be nothing more than an ugly reality TV party.
