This is the fourth feature-length feature film by Marc Recha. In the third "les mans buides" - empty hands - I promised myself that I would not cut my veins anymore. But this time the plot is completely different - a tribute to Ramon Barnils (Sabadell 1940 - Reus 2001), a Catalan journalist. The trailer's visual elements are breathtaking - a shiny river bathed in sunlight - and the promise that Marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother - neither of the two professional actors - finally convinced me six weeks after its release , Let yourself fall in this very unusual street / river movie. Learn almost nothing about Ramon Barnils, but his most miserable heritage: his constant struggle against the amnesia of what we Catalans have forgotten. "Batalla de l'Ebre" - the prospect of the Battle of the Ebro in Wikipedia - lost not once, but twice, because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of halfhearted democracy, no one has remembered the rightful side of the EU Spanish Civil War and those who fought him. This film is about the lonely people who travel with little conscience to the places that took place there 70 years ago. This film is about the landscape.
