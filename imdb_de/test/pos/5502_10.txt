For some inexplicable reason, Jerry's films often seemed to come in from Diatribes from certain sites, though there were seldom disappointments at the box office. It's one of the big secrets of life for me, because his films have always been a feel-good factor for me. But this movie is not only not bad, but a very good and clever comedy. For those who can tickle of "modern" gross or cruel humor, you will not see this movie: There is nothing in this area and you will waste your time watching this movie once on TV. I've been waiting to see it since, and that's been a few years. The idea of ​​an arrogant millionaire wishing to win the war against the Nazis with his own small private army of submissive employees would be boring, would not it? Well, only Jerry Lewis would dare to try such an act for a thoroughly funny comedy, and it works, I have to say, brilliantly. In other films, this film is testament to its comic genius, both in conception and execution. I think Buddy Love could have said, "You know, real comedy can not only do a six-year hysteria, but that for his father." Maybe some nutty Nazi generals with Monocles and a limp would not really like this movie. If you just see another comedy in your life, look at them. Be careful, you might laugh. And I'm not joking!
