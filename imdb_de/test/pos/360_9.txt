I just looked at this thriller again, one that I had previously believed to be one of Hitch's lesser efforts. How can you be wrong? Maybe because I'm older or maybe because the movie gets better with every movie, but now I think it's great. Every little bit of tension is squeezed out of the smallest detail, and the last scene of the carousel is simply breathtaking! Perfect in every way, highly recommended.
