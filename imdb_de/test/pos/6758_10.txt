Especially from the brilliant spirit of the animation pioneer Wladyslaw Starewicz is "Fétiche" or "The Mascot", as it is called today, as a masterpiece of stop-motion animation, which is unfortunately almost forgotten. Still, this man's work deserves to be seen, and indeed, one has to believe that the excellence of the animation is just unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Decades before the "Toy Story", Starewicz explained The idea of ​​moving toys in "Fétiche" tells the story of a small stuffed dog who becomes friends with the sick daughter of his creator. One day his creator takes him to sell him, and the adventure begins as he seeks home. In his odyssey he will travel from Paris to hell and find the other toys that should be sold with him. <br /> <br /> It's a surreal experience to watch this movie as Starewicz lives every imaginable creature with grace and beauty. Other toys include a beautiful ballerina who loves a thief, but she is also secretly loved by a clown and forms a love triangle. An old woman, a stuffed cat and a stuffed monkey complete the group. Every toy is so detailed and expressive that you can understand its motives without words. <br /> <br /> The surreal atmosphere of the whole animation is remarkable. It is hard to believe that a work of this magnitude was completed in 1934, because it looks even better than most of today's animations. The influence it has in modern animators like Tim Burton and Henry Selick is very important. <br /> <br /> These short films are a masterpiece of animation and the outstanding work of a genius who has done it all himself and that has influenced animators for decades. Starewicz's work is an immortal work of art that everyone should see. This work is not only suitable for children, but also for adults and probably captures most of the subtext hidden in the movie. <br /> <br /> It is possible to find it on the DVD "Vampyr" as a bonus feature. If you have the slightest interest in animations, you should take a look at it.
