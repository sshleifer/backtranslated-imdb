I love this movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = What is hard to do. This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever. It does not distort the characters like other movies out there. Everyone is in character and has a role to play! <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Buster and Babs walking down the river after a torrent (courtesy of Buster), and Plucky on a journey with Hamton (fun stuff). , Elmyra walks around (as usual) and tortures animals, Fifi follows her fianc√© for an autograph and Shirley and Fowlmouth go to the movies. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Buster did not like me and Babs segments so much, even though they had some notable dialogues and jokes. I have to say that the Plucky and Hampton 'Vacation' parts were the best! Hamton's family is HILARIOUS! I especially like Uncle Stinky. Fifi in the hotel was also funny. I love the actor cameos during this scene. : D <br /> <br /> Probably the most famous part in this movie, again IMHO, is when Fowlmouth and Shirley are in the cinema ... LOL! You have to see it to appreciate it! And when Hamton and Plucky go through the tunnel to fulfill a wish ... :) <br /> <br /> Although this movie moved slowly during the parts of Buster / Babs, the rest is gold. I rate this movie 8/10. Show your children one day ... or even your own adult - Watch this movie! You will not regret it.
