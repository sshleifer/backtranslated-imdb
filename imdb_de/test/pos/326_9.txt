I saw this movie when it was released, and it certainly touches the heart. I liked the perspective of a child who learned that what she thought about her was not true. It's a mess for the little kid. And her search to find out who she is. And before and after she knows about her, the relationship between her and her foster mother. That's a nice view. An R Rahman adds his stress with a good recording and songs. In this film mani ratnam does not trump or give any advice (as in Vuyire), but simply tells the characters the way they are. And that's why the movie hits the audience. The pool bath scene of Chakkarvarthy and Nandhitadas did not convey perfectly what it meant. Mani Ratnam has improved amazingly.
