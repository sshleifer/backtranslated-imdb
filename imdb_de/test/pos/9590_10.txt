I'm like the other fans who love this comedy. I waited for it on DVD. I got it on VHS and was so tired of waiting for a release and worried that my VHS copy was going to ruin it. I got the equipment to get it on DVD. The picture and the sound are amazing to my surprise. If someone else wants a copy, write me a line at <br /> <br /> stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /> <br /> and for 7,00 € I put it on a DVD, print the DVD and get it in the mail to you. £ 7.00 only covers my cost and recorded delivery, etc., maybe with a little more, so I'm not after making money with it. I want the world to see this ignored gem of a comedy for over £ 26, unbelievable. How can you not release this classic? Send me an email for payment details like check or paypal etc
