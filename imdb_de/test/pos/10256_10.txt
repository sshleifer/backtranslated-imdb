Cooley High is such a great movie that he still does not feel outdated despite the soundtrack of the time, the urban landscape, the wardrobe and the slang. Incidentally, the soundtrack is a timeless classic in itself. Instead, he picks you up. That's the basis of a good movie. It does not miss a beat from start to finish and I never tire of looking at it. <br /> <br /> The end is unique in the sense that it is one of the saddest and most uplifting of all movies ends. There may have been some (backdraft comes to mind), but Cooley was the first and much more emotional.
