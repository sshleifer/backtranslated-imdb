Most of the silent movies I saw were serious, and it was fun to see one with a comic touch. The scenery and some scenes for "The Beloved Rogue" recalled "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" from 1923 in relation to the Paris street scenes and the celebration of the "King of the Fools". John Barrymore portrays the greatest French poet Francois Villon in a characterization that ranges from virtual slapstick to romantically delicate. The "water in wine" was a bit amusing at the beginning in the picture. <br /> <br /> It seems that times never change, and it's interesting to see that the movie made a compelling observation almost a century ago - Paris has to run its fool for one night while everywhere the one is all the time. How true. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt's appearance in the movie was a bit of a surprise to this viewer, I just saw him as Major Strasser in "Casablanca", oddly enough, one of his latest films. As King Louis XI. Is he a monarch, obsessed with astrology, skillful but suspicious, and it was a bit disturbing to see how much he resembled Brad Dourif's Wormtounge character from the final chapter of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Not necessarily the confidence radiating from a king of France. All the more plausible was the rise of Burgundy's Duke (Lawson Butt) until Villon took the opportunity to engage with both rulers. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that the use of Inter- The title cards were extremely free and were only used when it was absolutely necessary to advance the story. Without them you would have missed a strange nugget. It seems Villon had exiled himself at the Lame Flea hostel in Paris! <br /> <br /> The pressure I looked at was of exceptional quality. The very first movie featured on Mill Creek Entertainment's one hundred DVD action and suspense movies says something for a movie that's now 80 years old. It's great that silent movie films in this commercial format are becoming more widespread and accessible to a whole new generation of movie lovers. <br /> <br /> One question - it seemed like Conrad Veidt King Louis purposely snapped his nose or an accidental gesture that simply remained secure in front of the cutting room.
