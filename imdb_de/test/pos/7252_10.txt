This movie is great. Stylish, funny, good acting. I have described it variously as "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Muskets" and "Reservoir Fops", both are excellent descriptions. The plot is simple, but it does not affect the enjoyment. Carlyle is a brilliant brawler and Miller is an excellent drunken gentleman. The sets and costumes are stunning, and the music and camera work are unusual for a "costume drama." It is definitely not sense and sense !!!!! My recommendation? Take a look, sit back with a big tub of popcorn and have a damn good time.
