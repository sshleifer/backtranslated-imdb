I saw this movie in 1954 on a double bill with "Valley of the Kings". These films have helped to create a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975, I visited Egypt!) Seen today, "The Egyptian" suffers from a flat dialogue and a few gauche touches, but it is a glorious movie that you can watch - which, unfortunately, Hollywood does not do - - and it has a great story ... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or revenge-my-thing. Too bad that the 20th movie will not be restored to see it on the big screen.
