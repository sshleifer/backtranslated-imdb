I love Sarah Waters' Fingersmith and was worried about adjusting the TV. I was disappointed with the BBC version of Tipping the Velvet (which was nice to see, but Keeley Hawes could not sing and Rachael Stirling could not act). Fingersmith is a very closely drawn novel with breathtaking twists and turns, and I wondered if this would be possible in just 3 hours. <br /> <br /> I should not have worried. The adaptation was excellent, very little cut out and was moving at a rapid pace (although I wondered if you had not read the book, would you miss something?). It had the look and feel of a classic BBC costume drama and I had to keep reminding myself that this is a contemporary book. <br /> <br /> The acting was outstanding. Sally Hawkins played her heart as Sue Trinder and Elaine Cassidy, a slow burner, who was glowing at the end of the story as Maud Lilley. The love, the passion, the realization of the scams that both had to do were written on their faces. It was a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> I hope Rachael Stirling has watched: How to play a Sarah Waters character!
