A pretty interesting look at some characters from India's rising middle class. Although India is rapidly modernizing, its culture does not keep up. This film includes the patriarchal society in which women are not really free citizens. A land of arranged marriages, men romping with totally unpunished lovers, and women expected to tolerate all of that will eventually be left out. I was impressed with Nandita Das, who was quite attractive and played her character with absolute seriousness. Shabana Azmi impressed me even more. I understand that Bollywood has been around for a long time. Her calm beauty and unremarkable mental suffering were excellent. The lesbian subtext of this movie was never particularly erotic and never exciting. (Damn!) Worth a look for those who are interested in very different cultures.
