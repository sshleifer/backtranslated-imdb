The story of Sweeney Todd recalls the work of classic writers such as Charles Dickens and contemporary writers such as Edward Gory. As a musical, of course, it is more like the musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the dire effects of poverty in the Industrial Revolution and the collapse of organized society. However, this musical differs in one very important aspect of Les Mis: Stephen Sondheim, the songwriter who can adapt to any style. Sure, he has had successes and failures, but one can always rely on his shows: they will be something unique. Who would have thought that someone would write a musical about a barber who cuts people's throats and turns them into meat pies? Sondheim did, and he did it wonderfully. The entire show takes place in a factory to convey the ubiquitous catastrophic effects of the misery of those at the bottom of society, and this perfectly fulfills the needs of the show. The catwalks and railings are moved throughout to suggest streets, sidewalks and bridges. Techniques are borrowed from Kabuki and Noh, with the visual stage pointers and sentence changes. To top it off, portray the gorgeous Angela Lansbury as cruelly practical and humorous Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn with his opera baritone voice as murderous Todd, and you've created an outstanding musical vehicle. The rest of the cast moves smoothly through the clich√©s of the love story, with the exception of Johanna and Pirelli, who sound a bit too forced. If the Johanna and Pirelli from the Broadway show could be here, that would be perfect. Hearn plays while singing more than Len Cariou on the OBC album, and the accents do not sound compulsory here. While all the Sondheim score always underscores the dark seriousness of the story. As I said, he can adapt to any style. In follies he mimics 1930's 1930s show tunes, in Pacific Overtures he captures the subtle art of Asian music, Into the Woods taps the 32-bar Disney songs, and Assassins tells a story of American music. Here, however, he does wonders when he clearly makes his score English, from salon songs to opera duets and soliloquies to society waltzes to Gilbert / Sullivan style. And yet the show remains deadly serious, though it provokes more laughter than any musical comedy. There is still a dark warning in her for the evil of avenging herself. Here, this film makes a mistake by cutting the solo of the judge in which he has emerged from guilt because of his crimes. Without them, the judge is just a common villain, and this movie shows that there are no straight bad guys. Both Todd and the judge learn too late the horrors of taking responsibility for their actions, and Todd loses everything in his obsession. This is highlighted by the deterrent reprise of Sweeney Todd's grim but exuberant ballad. The show ended with Todd and Lovett getting up from the grave to tell us that the end is the same: In a world full of sweeney, revenge begins just revenge. "Look at the story of Sweeney Todd, he served a dark and vindictive god, seeking revenge can lead to hell, but everyone does, and seldom does he do as well as Sweeney, like Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of the Fleet Road."
