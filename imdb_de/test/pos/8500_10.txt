This kind of show should not happen on TV. This is the kind of rimlessness normally reserved for independent films. This is what only HBO should do. The fact is that Denis Leary has managed to come up with one of the best television programs of all time, which could easily be included in the ranks of THE SOPRANOS, OZ, ED, etc. Mr. Leary and his gang for creating a truly unique visual experience , My only complaint is that the show is not long enough ... an hour would do it better, but I can not wait for the next episode!
