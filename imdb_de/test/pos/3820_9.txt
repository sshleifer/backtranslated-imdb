I saw this show a few times when I was young and she played Tilt. My parents loved it and now I feel how they feel. This show did what the original limit and twilight zone (new and old) could not do. This show used some old ideas and some really original ideas. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright did this. These guys were producers of Stargate SG-1. The show anchored the audience in the story and created a truly eerie atmosphere. That did not exist in the new twilight zone. Rod Serling came in and the forest near made the mood easier. <br /> <br /> The end, whether good or bad, made for a scary time. You never could predict what would happen. I still try to find the seasons on DVD.
