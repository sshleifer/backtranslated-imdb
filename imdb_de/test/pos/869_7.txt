A very interesting plot of the film, based on the novel "Waltz into Darkness" by the writer Cornell Woolrich. It's more of a drama than a film noir trying to send a message that love is changing your own life, d. A rich man really changed his life out of love, while his partner finally realized that he was the only one who loved her. Belmondo played well, as always, while a rather young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role as a detective or police officer. Frankly, Bouquet was not that impressive in this movie, but less than that was the performance of Catherine Deneuve. She was not so convincing in her role as a prostitute, then lover / wife of Louis Mah√© (Belmondo). For those who like to visit the world, the film offers the opportunity to see part of Ascension Island as well as the city of Lyon in France.
