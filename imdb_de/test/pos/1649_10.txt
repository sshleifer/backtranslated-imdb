Many experienced and excellent actors mingled in an ongoing conspiracy of an undescribed part of World War II on the Eastern Front. Characters well presented and unforgettable. One episode leaves you wanting for the next. Watch the credits when the thousands of Shtrafbat battalions are listed. An innumerable history involving hundreds of thousands of people. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always full of people and dialogues. Produced with excellent sets and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a terrible time. I would like to buy a copy for my own collection to enjoy the series again and again.
