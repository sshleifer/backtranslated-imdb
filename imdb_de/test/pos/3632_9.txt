A very touching film, a great surprise from Brazil, a country that normally exports themes about social issues, violence and sex ... Magical realism is a very difficult task and I think Jo達o Falc達o did a wonderful job. It seems he really does not intend to make a realistic film, far from it. Although many people think that the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is the assumption that Falc達o was influenced by the series "Hoje ia Dia De Maria". The TV series produced by Globo was filmed after the film, but previously aired ... Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> The negative is the photograph of Walter Carvalho. It seems he has not grasped or understood the concept developed by Falc達o. The story is captivating and universal, even though she plays in a small town in Brazil. That could happen anywhere in the world. A great movie that I can warmly recommend.
