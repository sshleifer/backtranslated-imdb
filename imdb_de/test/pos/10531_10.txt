This film is a remake of the famous Fritz Langer masterpiece "M-Murder". It's well done and with a fun key to talk about fairly serious events and current issues in the Eurobe, but not just the whole world such a huge evil and very contagious these days. "Children of Wax" or as it is known in the US distribution, reveals the issue of hatred of Germany and Turks in an amusing way. The most beloved is the participation of the favorite actor of Lars von Trier, the great Udo Kier, the Bulgarian Film director Ivan Nichev so much fun.
