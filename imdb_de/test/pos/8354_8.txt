Another good animation from Disney. Sequels are not always great and tend to follow the same pattern as the original. Tramp's son, however, tries to savor the world outside the home and the family he knows and where he belongs. Being a junkyard dog is not for everyone, er, but Scamp overcomes adversity. The voices of the different characters were outstanding and were delivered by several well-known actors such as Scott Wolf, Alyssa Milano and Mickey Rooney. Entertaining and a well-made family movie.
