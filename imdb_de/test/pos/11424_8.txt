Stan Laurel first made a name for himself by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s. In "Mud and Sand" (a parody of Rudolph Valntino's "Blood and Sand"), he certainly shows himself to be an excellent comic actor and performer, but I think a movie like this really does not work because Laurel was a great satirist, but because it allows the audience to jump into the comedy already familiar with the situation and the scenes. Laurel can then let go with his inspired gags without having to create the context or abandon it. I saw it the day after seeing "Blood and Sand" myself; It has certainly improved the experience of knowing what was parodied where. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Laurel's character (rhubarb Vaseline, if you believe the title cards, or rhubarb Vaselino, if you believe his name on the CD stands chalk board) ticks his mother with a two-for-one It's a two-for-one trick, because it's a great gimmick, but it's especially funny when the viewer knows how he takes the air out of Valentino's extravagant and melodramatic promise to give his mother the luxury she wishes. <br /> <br /> This is the best Stan Laurel solo work I have ever seen. It's just funny - especially if you've seen the source material.
