Now I had myself seen a few episodes of Leauge Of Gentleman, which I found funny. When I brought the film, I was not sure I knew enough about the show to get it. This is one of the best comedy movies I have ever seen and the clever acting of the Leauge makes the movie. It has a very good and funny action and the use of just a few characters helps because it is not too confusing what would have destroyed the movie. Even if you've never seen The Leauge Of Gentleman, as this movie is filmed, you'll be made to laugh. This is a movie that can be viewed several times. He is a great movie you can see with your friends. It really deserves to review a definite 10 out of 10.
