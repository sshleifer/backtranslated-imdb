I'm new to the game, but I would have started MUCH earlier if there had been this movie! I caught it at Gen Con last year (a trip that was just a favor to my husband) and I loved it! Even for a non-gamer like I was then, it's funny and accessible - so much so that I finally gave in and sat in my husband's playgroup. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give away all the details of the plot, but if you're a player, you MUST see this movie - and if not, you'll have a great time in spite of yourself. There are certainly "in jokes", but the vast majority of the film is accessible to everyone. <br /> <br /> My only complaint: I wish it was longer and I wish it was available on DVD. Maybe soon? ...
