Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film "A Death in Venice". Although the hero in the book is an author, director Luchino Visconti, who also wrote the script, transforms him into a composer. The author / composer Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde), who is nearing mental exhaustion, is a burned-out craftsman. After a long and successful career, the peace and quiet of a less hectic life now strives for. He decides to go to Venice, where he wants to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition. While he is in the picturesque seaside resort, he attracts the attention of a beautiful young teenager, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen), who looks at him with curious interest and is immediately inspired by him. Although fascinated by the wondrous youth, Gustav has yet to find a private time away from the boy's governess (Nora Ricci) as he has to cope with a plague that seems to have affected the city. The film dialogue, like the novel, remains as subtle as the few short encounters between the boy and the artist. Finally. The audience, in contrast to the book, is hampered by allusions and imaginative flights of fantasy. Your affair is never given wings, substance, or opportunity, and if it were not for the brief solution in the book, the film would only allow the possibility of "what if". Nevertheless, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment of peace to receive what is forbidden, elusive, but definitely criticized by prying eyes. Great story and a Bogarde classic. ****
