The Assignment is an outstanding thriller with multiple storyline-driven storylines, not Star Turns, the need to stage special effects, compulsory romance, and endless chases. However, there is a chase and a dandy here. Aidan Quinn is wonderful, as both the terrorist and the naval officer were "recruited" to kill him. It rarely happens that a second or third-rate actor like Quinn gets an important lead role like this who wears a movie. Usually such a role is assigned to an a-list box office actor, which is why I've probably never heard of this movie before I saw it. Donald Sutherland is great as a morally ambiguous, sometimes sinister, agent recruiting Quinn. Ben Kingsley is also fine as an Israeli agent. The plot is very complex and there are several storylines that gradually converge towards the end and not all at once when we are used to it. The paranoia and claustrophobia of this type of thriller is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. The locations are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is nothing special, but rarely do we get all of the above today's features without dumb and / or meaningless storylines; unconvincing star turns; loud, annoying soundtracks for music videos; a villain who beats him up; and repeats a cast, costumes, and conspiracy, usually aimed at an audience under 25 years of age. This is an outstanding thriller that was most likely not justified at its release. *** 1/2 out of 4 stars.
