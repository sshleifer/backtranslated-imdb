Great movie! Great combination of talents! I am a huge fan of David Duchovny and he is outstanding in this movie! I would like to see him in other films of this kind. His talents are definitely under-utilized and have so much more to offer besides "Agent Mulder" (although I'm a big fan of this series as well). He is easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you have not seen this movie, you have to! A great love story that shows that love never dies ... it's with you forever. Minnie Driver is great and how can you go wrong with a cast of Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Loggia and Mr. Belushi? This movie did not receive any kind of awards, but earned. Great job, Bonnie Hunt! By the way ... the soundtrack is great too! **
