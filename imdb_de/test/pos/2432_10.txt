This movie is a very pleasant homage to the Bogart and other detective films of yore. Robert Sacchi makes it with Bogie and Michelle Phillips as Gena Anastas to a truly timeless beauty. <br /> <br /> However, the most notable part of this film is the longest belly dance scene ever produced in a Hollywood movie. A well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in the cinema comes close to dancing excitement. <br /> <br /> The scene, which is ultimately an important part of the storyline, takes place in a lush nightclub in the Middle East and is fascinating at all costs. The pulsating music, the swirling veil and ringing finger cymbals, the free-flowing waves and beautiful costumes - and a surprising twist with the seductive Sybil Danning - provide suspense and suspense until the end. <br /> <br /> The three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by the exotic brunette beauty Kamala Almanzar, one of the leading belly dancers of the USA since the mid-1970s. It was hand-picked by the famous Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian to travel with his orchestra. Guy's Ensemble is the live band to which the dancers perform in the scene. If you see the trailer on this page, you can take a look at Kamala (playing the finger pool behind Sybil Danning). <br /> <br /> If you're not a fan of belly dancing yet, you'll see this movie, and if you're a lover, it keeps you looking good after being watched several times.
