This is such a funny and funny movie. Extremely entertaining in every corner. It has a fancy set of memorable, psychotic, but lovable nuts. We have; the judge, the sargent, the boy, the creepy old lady, the bitch, the clown. And unfortunately they all live in a big house that has no locks and is understaffed. For our pleasure, we see them walking around, playing games and being dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way ... never give your patient an ax! <br /> <br /> This was in front of Cukko's nest AND surpasses it. At least on the fun level. It even has its sweet moments. Love is pure, love is grace, love is strength, you love me, your love is pure, you will always love me. " Who could resist that now? Nuts are also humans. Only a few loose wires. Be careful, otherwise you'll get an ax in the back! Playing children. Hehe. <br /> <br /> The phone repairman was really funny and his reactions to the crazy and bitchy boss were really real. All the characters in this movie are incredibly well played. And I found her really funny. No, terrible! They can even give you dirty thoughts about how to use them. Or how they can benefit from you. <br /> <br /> This is actually a very intelligent movie. There is a brilliant ending. I have to say that I assumed this was good, but I never expected it to be that way. It's terrible "The court has made its decision, they are no longer in control!" I love it. The end is so, SO perfect ... you will shed a tear. <br /> <br /> I'm so excited to see such a movie. I will never forget it now. It's not just a cult, but a cult CLASSIC. Whatever you do ... Do not look in the basement !!!
