A film like Crossfire introduces another film that spreads around its social consciousness - d. H. The last movie crash - almost to shame. Not necessarily because either his message of intolerance is much more decaying (though I bet Crash throws the gavel a lot thicker in comparison), but because storytelling and its tools never get into it much like Crash. Perhaps it is not really necessary to compare the two, as Crossfire is immersed in its core deep in the vein of film noir style. It was really interesting to see what the director Edward Dmytryk said on the DVD interview, in which he mentioned that the budget for photography was (intentionally) much lower, so that more could be spent on the actors, and the schedule ran at a very brisk, fast pace. What then seems unbelievable about the picture is that one would think to look at many of the lighting sets that took a lot of time. Just for a small scene, as when Robert Mitchum's Keeely is first interviewed under Captain Robert Young - the seamless contrasts of the shadows in the room are exquisite. That there are many other lighting fixtures that go even further with such small markings is essential in terms of the appearance of Noir time. Just look at a picture of characters in a staircase, the bars are facing them and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> But back to the actual part of the movie - it's really a story that turns out to be a murder mystery, but one that we the public need not take long to find the answer. It is more about something other than the mind and the soul of a murderer who would not be found in an ordinary criminal image, since there are essentially no "criminals" in the film. So there is a very calculated risk that signs are too thin to support the (worthwhile) message against anti-Semitism. But Dmytryk's directing for his top shelf cast, along with a truly grandiose screenplay by John Paxton, characterizes the characters, least of whom they seem to be too skinny next to the message. And what would a Noir be without an attitude? Mitchum also helps in scenes such as between him and Young, where it is very much due to the situation of the moment of history (ie, a detail in the plot), by adding some witty humor to some of the dialogues. It may already be in the lines, but it helps to make the character with a good edge for his scenes. <br /> <br /> Then there's Robert Ryan, who is a Montgomery-born man you know you do not wear. In the beginning I do not like much, just by his BS behavior, but you are also not completely sure. Then, when it comes clearer ironically through a subjective point of view of the suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) in the home of the soon-to-be-deceased Samuel, his performance becomes a great balancing act between crap and joke even on his blind path rather scary. It is a good achievement if he is also counteracted with Cooper who has actual personal problems he is facing and expresses with regret and humility. However, much thought is given to the end of the film, and as you look at the movie, it's more about engaging in the dialogue and flow of the scenes, and in the sometimes overpowering camera, the movie moves actor, so the message is in a sense secondary. Not that it's not important, especially for the period (right out of World War II), but years later the actors are seen, even those who do not have the big marquee status like Gloria Grahame as Ginny (the femme fatale of the Picture if it could have had time for one who does not have it) and William Phipps as leroy (the "hick") working off each other, which remains very strong in the compact script. <br /> <br /> Dmytryk is also very wise in the decision to limit the score, is also powerful, because for very long distances we hear nothing, and most of the time it is rather random for the environment of the figure. He might as well have taken additional notes to some dramatic scenes, especially the audience's opening grab. By keeping away from it and achieving the right settings and nuances in camera and cast, standards in the genre material are raised to a very fine, memorable level. My favorite scene would probably go to Finley's story about an Irish immigrant, whom he tells Leroy, where all these elements fit together well. My favorite noir may not be very high - and I would still cast Murder My Sweet as the director's masterpiece in this kind of movie - but it's certainly higher in quality than anything B-level.
