Of course, seeing a few boom microphones does not mean anything, does it? Lord, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin have really put it together, right? I've laughed a lot, as is often the case in such films, but I do not know what to laugh about because I've laughed at so many other things. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, but I would say that a little more editing would have done wonders. I'm a big fan of Blaxploitation, so I do not think it was terrible, but I know that "The Human Tornado" was several times better. I think those who make it through this movie might need a colt or two afterwards. I mean, it really helps you not to notice the boom microphones when you see them again.
