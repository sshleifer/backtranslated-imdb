This Bravo Special is one of the purest conversations I've seen on TV. Unlike Me First & The Gimme Gimmes (the world's leading punk supergroup / cover band), the Dan band must really be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> On paper, the Dan band is just one The joke actor sings girl songs and inserts indecisive obscenities into the lyrics. Listening to their "Dan Band Live" CD will get you everything and it's getting old fast. (I only bought it because there were some songs that were not in the TV special.) But what made Dan Finnerty a Hollywood cult hero is his amazing on-stage presence. This guy OWNS his audience every second he stands on stage. And the backup singers are also a big part of the visual punch line. As far as the actual band is concerned, they are mostly out of sight, but definitely more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical lounge act backing band. Hopefully a DVD version will be released soon - some songs have certainly been cut and although the heavy censorship adds some unwanted humor, the INTENTIONAL humor is also eliminated. <br /> <br /> If it makes sense All over the world, the owners of Vegas Casino will soon be arguing about who can build Dan's own showroom faster. <br /> <br /> "Re ------- member my name ... FAME!"
