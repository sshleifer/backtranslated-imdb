<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 5 years ago When you watch an Australian movie, you'll see crocodile hunters, war stories, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, as well as Australians generally portrayed as naked folks living off the land, saying words like "cobber" and generally being the classic outsider. Fortunately, the Australian movie has evolved over the past few years and is the modern day. Classics like Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Choppers, Yolngu Boy and Sample People. <br /> <br /> In this evolution of the movie we also find Two Hands. <br /> <br /> Set in Sydney's Kings Cross. Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival at the rough end of the city. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is a boss of Sydney Mob. He is the king of organized crime, wearing straps, carrying a stub and helping his son with his origami. He is vicious, but real. Like his "mob" who holds the gun in one scene against the head and then plays board games in the next. They are respected and if asked for a favor, do not say no. <br /> <br /> Enter Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is your average Aussie guy in his early twenties. He's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on the bad side of another. When Pando asks Jimmy to deliver $ 10,000, Jimmy accepts. <br /> <br /> Things get exciting when two teens manage to steal the money while Jimmy is on the beach. Now Jimmy has a fortune of $ 10,000 with a big mob boss. From here we see all the connected stories with Jimmy and his bank robbery attempting to reclaim the money, Jimmy and Alex (the love interest played by Rose Byrne), Pando trying to find Jimmy and of course the two teenagers and her new prosperity found. The concept is deepened by the narrator, Jimmy's late brother Michael, who was killed years ago by Pando and his gang. In the end, all storylines really had a startling turn to shock and stunning the viewers. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br />
