Walt Disney's 20th animated cartoon was the last to be green-lit by the great man himself (he died in late 1966) and is generally not considered one of the best. The main problem is that the movie seems to be just the feline version of LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMATIONS (1961), both of which are certainly more beloved by fans, though both are an animation. As a cat lover I dug this somewhat springy brew in which a spoiled female cat (voiced by Eva Gabor) and her three little kittens are thrown on the streets of Paris by the greedy butler of a wealthy woman (Hermione Baddeley). Fortunately, they meet a street cat (Phil Harris), which leads them on the return journey. On the way, they are assisted by a feline jazz band (led by Scatman Crothers) and two helpful and amiable stupid dogs. At home, Edgar the butler celebrates his supposed heirloom, and the mouse and horse do their part to help their feline pets. Legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier was sent back from retirement to sing the theme song (including a French verse) and Scatman's band indulged in a breezy number called "Ev'rybody Wants To A A Cat".
