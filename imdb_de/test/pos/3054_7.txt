Since Bette Davis's vehicle "Ex-Lady" from 1933, I have not seen a movie that was so much better than the star said! Most of Rap's "Atoll K", "Utopia," "Robinson Crusoeland," "Escapade," has come from the horror stories that told Stan Laurel about his production over the years. Given that he suffered a stroke while filming, it looked like death had been warmed up by much of the death (from the first two shots of them together you would never guess that Laurel Hardy survived for eight years) and then diabetes was diagnosed (once with him) If he adjusted his diet accordingly, he found that he was recovering), one can understand why Laurel did not consider this film the most enjoyable experience of his life. Yes, it's flawed: the cheapness of the production is coming through, the dubbing is horrible and Laurel and Hardy were too old to make the energetic slapstick of their best films. But it's still really funny, and LÃ©o Joannon's story introduces elements of political satire (sometimes libertarian, sometimes communalist) that one would expect from socially conscious comedians like Chaplin or the Marx Brothers, but never from Laurel and Hardy. The film deserves credit for being different (though it's pretty obvious to Ealing Studios' classic "Passport to Pimlico" made only a year earlier), and for integrating the Laurel and Hardy comedy into a rather nervous context that is different from anything else you had used before. This is not a great movie, but it is certainly better than the eight gritty movies Fox and MGM had made in the early 1940s. I suspect that only the film's technical cruelty kept it from winning the cult after the Marx Brothers "Duck Soup" won the "Duck Soup" of the Marx brothers in the late 1960s / early 1970s.
