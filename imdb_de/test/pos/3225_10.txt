I absolutely fell in love with these girls. Let me tell you something: I'm from Romania and this is just the sixth series that runs on USA TV every other day. I watch the internet and download it from there, so I'm in tune with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I will absolutely know everything about her. I checked the internet for what Rory's car is, what her middle name and stuff are: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria. I can not understand why, but my friend does not like them, and I try to see him, how wonderful they are, but to no avail, but he understands me and lets me be with my "obsession" with the Gilmore Girls. I adore her. I really hope that if anyone sees this, he will try it: you will not regret it
