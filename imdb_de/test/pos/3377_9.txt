I wanted to see that to get a glimpse of the show. It talked more about Robin Williams, then about Mork & Mindy. I thought it was great anyway. We had to see that Robin was always "on" no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was fantastic. <br /> <br /> The introductions of the main actors seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming that helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little ones behind the scenes of his other shows (Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley) were enlightening. I also thought that Harvey of Richmond-Peck was also a beautiful stone in the pond. (This is a good thing). <br /> <br /> This film told the ancient story of the Hollywood people who went through the ups and downs of fame. I clung to my TV and I learned to love Robin, damn it, most of the time they all seem to be the super people I sometimes think of as Hollywood. Go figure. <br /> <br /> I sometimes wonder why the network people are always played as idiots. We have never seen the head of ABC. I just heard him like Charlie from Charlie Angels (wondering if this path was planned?). It seems so sad that a show at number one could be so destroyed by their own network. I think this story could be told about everyone's life as they climb the career ladder of a job. Movie stars and TV stars are always loved or hated by so many people you grew up with. They just want to fall back on their past to remember their own past. I remember watching the show and wondering what's going on in her personal life. <br /> <br /> Mork and Mindy will always be part of me, and I have seen part of it. It may not all be the truth, it's not a lie at all, but in the end it told me a wonderful, sad, happy story.
