This movie ... I saw it fifteen years ago and could not remember it in the last few years, name or anything else, just a Romanian compatriot who was brilliantly played by Anthony Quinn. The impression I have of this drama will be eternal. Finally I found the name of the movie, I hope I can buy it. And frankly, this movie is worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was quite young when I saw the movie for the first time. I asked my friends if they had heard about this story, but nobody knew anything about Anthony Quinn, who played the role of a Romanian farmer. I remember when a German officer came and saw Anthony and told him that he was a good "race", but in fact the German cheated on him. For a few dollars you will not get rich if you buy the movie, but you will be rich if you have it.
