In The Karen Carpenter Story, there's a clever scene in which both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard spontaneously decides to let Karen sing for the owner of the studio. Richard grabs the wrong The key for Karen to sing along, so Karen sings above her natural range. You can see a confusing expression on the owner's face; he thinks that she really can not sing. Richard quickly recognizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner makes a priceless double whammy. Nicely done! For some reason, I have never forgotten this scene. <br /> <br /> The Karen Carpenter story describes the meteoric rise of carpenters and Karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. Many things are glossed over. This is not a documentary, and the movie has asked me a lot of questions. From Karen's solo venture (the CD was released just a few years ago.) If you buy it, you'll wonder why they've been waiting. It is one of Karen's best works. The songs are not as timeless as her work with her brother Richard, but it was a great recording (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I've heard that you can say you can hear a cheap, worn, small radio in the middle of the Third World. that seems to be more static than anything else. However, if a Carpenter song appears on the radio, you would think you would hear a hi-fidelity unit worth $ 1000. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
