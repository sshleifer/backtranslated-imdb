I first saw this movie in 1994 or 95 in my first year of high school when he was on Lifetime. After seeing it for the first time, I thought it was wonderful. Sure, it may not have gone any longer, but I think it's as accurate as possible (regardless of what others think). Cynthia Gibb was great at portraying Karen, and Mitchell Anderson was okay as Richard. Louise Fletcher (who played Nurse Ratched in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in 1975) was fine too, but I found her version of Agnes (Karen and Richards mother) a bit of a control freak. I'm an extremely big fan of the Carpenters and I believe that Karen's voice was and is so wonderful. It really saddens me that she's gone and left the earth too soon, but thanks to the infinite popularity of her music and her angelic voice, the music will live on. In any case, it's a mystery to me and other people (fans and non-fans of the Carpenters), which has caused Karen to get this problem with her health. Was the media responsible or just the decision of Karen? I would not believe it was her decision. It could have been the medium of an article printed about her somewhere in the 1970s when her hit "Close to You" appeared (from what was shown in the movie). There are also some other moments in the movie. Richards struggle with drugs and Karen's short marriage. I did not hear about her loss in February 1983 because I had not seen the news yet. I found out years later. I do not know if there will be another movie about Carpenters or Karen in the future, but until then this movie will work well. However, I would like to say the following: If Karen had disregarded the incorrect details of this article or any future articles that had been published with similar content and described them as "chubby" (which must have been quite an insult), she would still be here earth today. I know that she is in heaven and probably entertains everyone with her beautiful voice. God bless you, Karen !!
