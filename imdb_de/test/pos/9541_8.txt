This almost perfect cinematic rendering of Edith Nesbit's popular children's novel follows the lives of Roberta (Bobbie), Phyllis, and Peter and their mother after their father was unjustly charged with high treason and sent to prison. You live in an almost uninhabitable house in the countryside near a railway line? Mother writes stories to earn enough money for food and candles while the children spend a lot of time around the train station, especially waving to a specific train "to send their love to the Father". <br /> <br /> The characters are always a compelling and smart novel and are brought to life under the direction of Lionel Jeffries (better known as a fine character actor). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and brother. Her mother is Dinah Sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (railroaders' Perks) and William Mervyn (the old gentleman on the train). <br /> <br /> 'The Railway Children' is gentle entertainment from another era, but does its job beautifully. As we watch as Bobbie grows up with the worries of an absent mother bumping into her own needs, to be alone and have fun, we can only rejoice when events come to an end at the end of the picture. We have a sense of time and place everywhere? be it from the steam trains, the high school hunt or the red flannelette petticoats that were worn by the girls (and served to avert catastrophes!).
