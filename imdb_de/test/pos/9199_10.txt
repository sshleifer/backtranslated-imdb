This show is pure entertainment and does not try to be a greek drama. It certainly contains elements of everything that revolves around all the actions, but it is immensely compelling and fun. Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show and you will never lack the material to work with! Everything and everything happens there! The actors in this show are very personal and you really want to see what they want and what they want every week. The show is also very funny. The humor arises from the characters and situations. Not just thrown in for nothing. In this respect, it is a well done show. Anyway, I'm looking forward to Friday evenings and I'm glad that I now own the first two seasons on DVD!
