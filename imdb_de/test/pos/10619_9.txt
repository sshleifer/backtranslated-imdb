Prepare for the journey to Hanekes "La pianiste" ... Huppert's psychic illness of the main character miraculously surpasses any limits you might expect. The most amazing thing is that you get pity on the character Erika. Trash sexuality (no nudity), perversion, masochism, incestuous relationships ... Haneke gives us a rough meal that is hard to digest; Sometimes you can only escape the extremism of some scenes when you start laughing at them. The "Mise en Sc√®ne" is perhaps not the most attractive part of the film, it has obviously Austro-Germanic, sometimes Scandinavian comments: static, long scenes, but never boring. The Viennese attitudes, the French language, make the whole thing look like a European mix. The permanent Germanic background (Schubert) is beautifully chosen. Especially the two Cannes awards for the best actors are deserved: one of the best performances of the year by one of the greatest French actresses of all time.
