Edward Dmytryk directed this shadowy film about a murder investigation involving demobilized military personnel. Robert Young gives us a lecture on hate, Robert Mitchum goes through most of that image and Gloria Grahame repeats the Feistiness she has shown in "It's A Wonderful Life". Robert Ryan is at the heart of the matter: anti-Semitism. He goes so deep into his role as Monty Montgomery (Imagine's parents named Lawrence calling her son Larry!) That the drama is sitting right on his shoulders and he's more than up to the challenge. Without him the film would be commonplace. Ryan played some memorable villains in his day ("Bad Day at Black Rock", "Billy Budd"), but this idea brought him to the map. With Sam Levene as a murder victim.
