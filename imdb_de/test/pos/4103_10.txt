It amazes me that manufacturing companies will sue for reproductions they fail to deliver. I have been searching for this movie for some time on DVD and VHS. You can get all sorts of movies online, old movies, new movies ... but they all target a specific group. This film is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can not get a copy. If enough people enroll, the copyright owner may receive a notice. It is time for this to happen. Yes, it is date, but the wizard of OZ is too. It does not seem that this should be so difficult. Right now, like many others, I see these illegal copies in search engines.
