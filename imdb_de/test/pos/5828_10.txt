Yes, this show had a lot of frontal nudity for men and yes, over the years, the plots were exaggerated, melodramatic and very unrealistic. It did not matter, however, as the show is great. You can really get involved with the characters and every character, no matter how small or big, is perfectly staffed. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine anyone else, except JK Simmons plays the racist neo-Nazi racist, or else Tobias Beecher plays except Lee Tergesen. The transformation of his character from Season 1 to Season 2 is amazing. The character of MADE Oz OZ, however, was CHRIS KELLER (played by Christopher Meloni). He had no relation to anyone else in prison except Beecher (well, except Ronnie Barlog, but that was only to get Ronnie to play with Keller's lover, Beecher). Their relationship crossed the sexes and Tom Fontana really got us to look after these two and wanted them to be together. <br /> <br /> I loved Vern's soft spot for his kids on the show, and like Fontana out of all the friendly characters, those vile criminals we worshiped, even Simon Adebesi. <br /> <br /> But some storylines were unbelievable and unrealistic: * A guy building a bomb in ounces * Guys standing in their windows in a spotlight looking at other men planning something in their heads - too exaggerated. Drugs in ounces * Each drug used or sold in the rehabilitation group and sister Pete did not help anyone in six years. * People get killed in the gym, in the pantry, and in the kitchen. * Nobody injured Ryan's mother. * Nobody fights Cyril outside the boxing ring (except, of course, Vern). * Two inmates whose tools are alone in the elevator shaft, and one of them dies without investigation. * Karl Metzger (Guardian) is killed and nobody is examined. * The governor holds all his press conferences in prison. All an inmate has to do is to say "I want to see Glenn" or "I want to see McManus" and they are brought to them without questions being asked. * People die every week in Oz * On the outside, people kill someone and get 20 years to parole in eight, but if they kill someone on the inside they go to death row almost immediately * There is no onsite paid employee in In the kitchen or in the post office - the inmates lead both departments without questions. * Aging drugs for inmates to replace time * Ryan has no friends or colleagues, but he is never hurt, killed, mutilated, raped, or beaten. * The boys NEVER flush the toilets when they go to the bathroom or vomit. An NBA scout arrives at the jail to promote an NBA player (yeah right). <br /> <br /> With all these mistakes, this show is still great. It's cruel, brutal, sexy, nervous, raw and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, JK Simmons, Christopher Meloni, Luiz Guzman, Adele (the man who played Simon Adebisi), Eammon Walker, Lee Tergesen, Terry Kinney, mums, male Alexander, LL Cool J etc. etc. Everyone is great and made the show worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I recommend borrowing on DVD. The sixth season will be released 9/06 (next month). The first five seasons are on DVD - look at them and watch them again with audio commentary. I loved the director's comment with Chazz Palmentari. The sequence with Andy Schillinger, who ran down the cafeteria tables and then fell into the hole, was a fantastic, first-class shot !!!! Kudos! And Kathy Bates, who directs Family Business and the famous wrestling scene between Beecher and Keller, is just amazing! Brilliant!!! That would have to be so strange that Meloni Tergesen's private part touches an icon like Kathy Bates in this one scene !! Impressive! Did that nicely, my pun intended! <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Oz: The Next Generation !!!! (like Star Trek, etc.) C'Mon !!! Let's start !!!!
