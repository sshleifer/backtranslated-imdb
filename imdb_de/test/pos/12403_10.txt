This movie is like "The Breakfast Club" meets "Mad City". Justin Walker, Corey Feldman and James Remar deliver one great turning point after another and deliver really great performances. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you do not like movies that "go all the way" in terms of violence, then do not look at the last 20 minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I could not take my eyes off the screen. This is a really pithy, realistic teenage drama. I can not believe it comes from B-movie king Roger Corman. This film is a must for those who do not have a matter of the heart. Highly recommended.
