Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born in a back family in the Bronx. Although the Polonis have been known for their sweets for decades, the business has come in difficult times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is one of Manhattan's most talented dessert makers, but due to the glass ceiling, she does not seem to be in a prime pastry position. An accidental meeting between Marco and Grace leads to a conversation about a possible solution for both. In the near future, there will be a high-profile bake-off, The Golden Whisk, and Marco wants Grace to work with him. There's a lot of "dough", haha, it's about the winners, enough to integrate Grace into their own business and also save the Polonis restaurant. Reluctantly, Grace agrees. But there are complications. Some of the judges and competitors may have problems with Grace and Marco. Even though Marco and Grace both have a certain attraction for the other, Grace has a long-time, very rich friend. Can Marco and Grace win the competition? This is a nice movie for romantics. First, there is the beautiful cast. Holly has always been a charming actress with a remarkable hoarse voice that enhances her appeal. In this movie she is perfectly cast as a determined, but beautiful Grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, also enjoys being a handsome baker. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marcos mother, is very nice. As Hallmark film costumes, sets and production facilities are not objectionable, and the script is still fresh and funny, despite some familiar subjects. Indulge yourself, romcom lover, a sweet confection by watching this movie. It's definitely the movie equivalent of a big box of quality chocolate.
