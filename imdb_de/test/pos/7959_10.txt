CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST is a perfect movie. An immaculate film about all the shortcomings of humanity. From the outside, it might look like a movie about death, but it's actually a movie about life. I just can not recommend this movie enough. And do not worry, dear reader, it's not a depressing movie. As I said, it is a film about the brightness of life under the guise of death. You will laugh. You will cry. You will realize that life is fragile and short. And you will leave the ad with a better understanding of how valuable life is this movie and reviews of other foreign films)
