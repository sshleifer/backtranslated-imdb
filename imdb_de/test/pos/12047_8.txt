This was Bollywood's answer to the fatal attraction, and this is a classic movie in itself. Juhi Chawla was good and Sunny Deol too, but it was Shah Rukh Khan who became famous as a stalker. Since then he has become a Chopra favorite (Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil to Pagal Hai, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). Shah Rukh seems at first glance to be a rogue, but then you begin to sympathize with him. The scripting was excellent and the songs were chartbusters. My favorites are Too mere samne and Jaadu teri nazar. <br /> <br /> After the bleak failure of the undervalued Lamhe Yash Chopra, Darr struggled. The dialogues were memorable, the k..k..Kiran dialogue is often repeated. Since Darr Yash Chopra has slipped a bit. Dil to pagal hai was bad, but he broke easily with Veer Zaara, which was much better. This was Yash Chopra's last masterpiece.
