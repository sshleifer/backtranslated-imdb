I gave this one 10 because it's the best movie of its kind ... a good old fashioned T & A movie in the shadow and spirit of "Animal House". I saw this with a similar movie called Swap Meet, and both were good of their type ... a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Let's face it ... there are more breasts in this film than you would imagine for a R-rated movie. From beginning to end they always seem to appear on the screen (sunbathing, bedroom scenes and of course the football game). Plus a memorable kiss booth (kiss me, clutz!). Everyone seems to have a good time in their roles (several Playboy Playmates, Danny Bonaduce, several well-known TV and movie actors, etc.). The only complaint I have to file is that the character of Lisa London with her surname "O'Hara" and not with a good name from the 1970s like "Olivia" (or even with Ora or Ona or O ... ?? !!) referred to as. I saw this again in the late 1980s with my ex-wife (pretty well-endowed) and she could not believe I really enjoyed the movie !! She was probably jealous !! This movie is again a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon ... Do not think too hard!
