This movie has a punch. There are now and then a few that make me think deeply and bother me a lot. I could see myself in the same situation - passively allowing things to happen around me, not standing for the right and decent, just trying to avoid annoyance. How often do we avoid making waves or stretching our necks? How often does our inaction tolerate the evil deeds of others? We would never join them, we say, recognizing that what they are doing is bad, but are we doing something about it? <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a reserved, nerdy office worker who paid his home in Brooklyn, New York during the dwindling days of World War II. He rarely deals with what's going on around him, never married, rarely socialized, just goes to work and takes care of his sick mother. Then a series of events in his very "white" neighborhood pulls him out of his smug shell into a whirlwind of events. It begins with his watching the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by his neighbor's son from his bedroom window. Soon after he gets glasses because of poor visibility. As he can see better now, he will be less able to deal with the circumstances of his life. The one ray of hope is a new love in his life, and he marries, hoping to continue in his normality. Then he is struck by virulent anti-Semitism on this street, although he is recognized as a Presbyterian WASP. As things continue to get out of hand, he discovers that he has an important decision to make - does he enter or just leave. <br /> <br /> I can not, as anyone can see this movie without being concerned, think much about themselves and what they really stand for. Post-war anti-Semitism is the scene here, but at all times and in all places, there is injustice. It is up to the individual to decide where he stands.
