Located in and around a poor working-class town in the mountains of rural Italy, this is a story of insanity. The landscape may be quite picturesque, but here is madness, hidden behind the mask of a person who looks outwardly normal. This person kills small children. <br /> <br /> In style and tone, this movie is similar to Dario Argento's famed Italian Giallos, these mesmerizing whodunit horror films, except that Argento's films look much better. Nevertheless, the visuals in Fulcis are "Do not Torture A Duckling" competent, with interesting compositions and lighting effects. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night increase the tension in a sequence in which one of the "ducklings" is vulnerable alone. In a sequence, the Gore is a little over the top. This is not a Slasher movie though. A legitimate theme underlines the story. And the subject is that madness can take on many unexpected forms, not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo or black magic. <br /> <br /> Many red pegs complicate solving the puzzle if the viewer does not accept a director's agenda. Do not dismiss anyone who does not seem suspicious. The twist near the end makes for a good misleading. However, in a scene in the middle of the game, a line of dialogue could be added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the killer. The final of the film takes place on a beautiful mountain top, the wind whistles in the background. We see flashbacks for clues and get insights into the mindset of the killer. <br /> <br /> I'm not interested in the widescreen projection of the movie. Background music, however, is effective, ranging from uncomfortably creepy beginnings to unobtrusive jazz to indigenous Italian songs. Acting is generally average, though in some cases it is somewhat over the top. <br /> <br /> Although not as visually brilliant as Argento's, "Do not Torture A Duckling" is still a good movie containing a themed storyline and enough whodunit puzzles to interest most viewers, the thrillers and like murder secrets.
