I love this movie. is it more in the air? What can I do to get it back on track because I miss this movie when this movie is aired again? I love this movie so much. Does anyone know how long ago it has been since the last time at Disney? It was a very long time and I'm sick of waiting! I want to see Susie Q again. I swear, they take all the good movies from the air and play new stupid gays who are fake and reserved. I miss this movie, I wish you a star, Kazaam with Shaquille O'neil and a few more. Where did all the good movies go? I want her back. I miss all good movies and they do not have them anymore. If anyone finds out if Susie Q or a good old Disney movie is coming out, let me know. My email address is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no space) 148. Thank you and I hope you would like to have this movie again. have a great day
