This totally strange ball is a typical and outstanding example of the satanically shocking 70s horror. The events are very confusing and it takes a while to figure out what the hell is going on, but the brooding atmosphere immediately draws you in. Just from the indescribably bizarre intro that shows some weird kids turning toys into real war machines, you know that this is going to be an uncompromising and bleak shock. "Brotherhood of Satan" soon seems to be another episode of the alleged and unofficial "spooky little town hiding a dark secret". A young widower, traveling with his new, delicious girlfriend and eight-year-old daughter, stops in a remote small town to report a car accident they saw on a nearby highway. The villagers are very hostile and insist that visitors leave immediately. The city clearly bathes in an ambience of fear and panic, as local children have inexplicably disappeared, holding unnatural forces within everyone's city limits. Hillsboro is in the hands of a satanic cult, apparently dominated by older members of the community. I really liked "Brotherhood of Satan". The story reminded me of a novel written by John Saul, but I can not remember the title. It also dealt with a cult in which older people abused youthful villagers for their greedy earnings. The film is mainly based on scary scenes (like dolls and witchcraft relics), but a more engaging and coherent script would have been nice. The topic often raises many questions and questions, and director Bernard McEveety can not always give us answers. The climax is terrific, very seventy (means shocking) and unforgettable. Also wonderfully shot movie.
