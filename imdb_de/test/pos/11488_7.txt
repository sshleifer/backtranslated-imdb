"Committed" is all about Graham as an invincible optimist looking for his self-esteemed husband, who has gone in search of himself, resulting in some kind of crazy, funny, funny odyssey with a bunch of minor characters and characters Problems leads. A fresh, fun and unpredictable little streak. What "committed" in history lacks makes up for it through good nature and subtle morality and maxims. If you like this little chick movie rated critically by critics and the public, you should visit Lisa Krueger's hit indie "Manny & Lo" (1996). (B)
