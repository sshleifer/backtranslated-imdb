22. JOE (drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a racist factory worker known to hate "hippies and negroes." He meets Bill, a businessman who has just murdered the lover of his drug addicted young daughter Jill (Susan Sarandon). Jill runs away and joins a hippie community on the outskirts. Bill asks Joe for help. Her quest leads her through the most simmering areas of the city, where both the inner hatred and disgust of the men are further tested. Review: This was the first sleeping smash hit by director John G. Avildsen (an amazing run that included): 'Rocky', 'The Karate Kid', 'Split Image', 'Weekend at Bernie's'). The film is interesting in that it summarized the themes and ideas of the turbulent 1960s (Vietnam War, Black Power, women's rights, etc.). It also has a good performance by Peter Boyle as Joe, one of the first anti-heroes of the cinema. He has always been good at playing creepy, domineering heavies whose abstract ideas are enforced by his intimidating presence (he would play the Frankenstein monster in Mel Brook's parody of Young Frankenstein). He reminds me of a little kid trapped in a big, stupid, awkward body. The film has a weak script (Joe and Bill's meeting is a bit coincidental, for example), but it has a particularly cruel end to the taxi driver. <br /> <br /> QUOTE: Title song: "I saw a guy who sold garbage to kids, he gets nervous every time I come by, because he knows if I catch him, I'll put him in kick his head and kick his fat.
