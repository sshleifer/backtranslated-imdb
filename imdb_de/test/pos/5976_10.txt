I saw this movie many years ago (along with another of Shepitko's films Wings) as part of a Soviet film series in a local movie archive. But as far as I can tell, Shepitko's film has never been recorded on video or DVD in the US. Ascent is a great movie for any standard, with stunning black-and-white photography, hypnotic focus, and actors so deep in their roles that you do not feel like they're just performing. Although the details of Russian resistance to (and cooperation with) the German occupation are very enlightening, the story is timeless. Two Russian partisans are captured by the Germans, and the interrogation tests their integrity and courage. I suspect the reason why it was not released by the Russians on DVD (here is the spoiler) is that the Jewish intellectual (and not the harsh Russian peasant) is the partisan who resists both threats and temptations, and peacefully goes to his death. and sets a heroic example for the villagers.
