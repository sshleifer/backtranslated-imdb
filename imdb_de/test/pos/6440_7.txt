In Yorkshire, a chimney sweep from 1850 is falsely accused of theft by his crooked master and runs away. He falls into a treacherous river and is taken to an underwater kingdom where he finds many friends and saves the mythical water babies from a bad shark. <br /> <br /> Based on a book by Charles Kingsley, this is a lovely children's movie, half live action and half animation, which is both a cruel and evocative account of Victorian times and an incredibly entertaining underwater adventure. There are really two films in one that somehow complement each other and make it a much richer whole. The animation by Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is wonderful, as well as the photography of Ted Scaife and the music of Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a great raw diamond quality as the (literal) fish out of the water. I love the moment when he stands on top of the villa, sees all the chimneys and "Blimey !!" calls. at the top of his voice. Mason and Cribbins are the dirtiest, meanest mob bumpers you can see in a costume drama (if you want to see real Victorian values, do not look at Sense And Sensibility, pay attention) and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who makes countless voices) and Percival are all excellent. This should be a good children's movie - good old singalong fun, but also a bit thoughtful, sad and scary. High Cockallorum !!
