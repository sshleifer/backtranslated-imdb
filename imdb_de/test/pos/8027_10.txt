This movie was overshadowed by "The Jackal" (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), which was released in the same year. After watching both movies, I can honestly say that this is the superior movie. Admittedly, the production value of 'The Jackal' was very good, he probably had a much bigger budget. However, 'The Assignment' is well written and has a fascinating history. Aiden Quinn is flawless in two roles. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay have done a great job in creating a deep and complex relationship between the character and his family. I liked the ending very much. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of the figure of Jack Ryan in the Tom Clancy movies. Both are naval officers who have fallen into incredibly dangerous roles while working under cover on behalf of national security. Yet, both Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their respective characters as heroes who manage to be both masculine and gentle. They have a real tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. <br /> <br /> What I do not understand is that the opinions of everyone who posted in this movie (myself included) can be much more positive than the lukewarm reception the movie received. This is a movie that is sufficiently complex and subtle that it remains convincing even after several considerations. If you're a fan of spy genre movies, I'd recommend 'The Assignment'.
