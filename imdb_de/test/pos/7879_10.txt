Peter Boyle has always been a great actor, and he proved it through his performance as a Bone-ho-Bigot, which made me hate him every time he used the word "N". I watched him and his big mouth and wanted to turn off his lights. (Just think, Peter Boyle was once a monk.) (Now a Supporting Actor in "Everybody Loves Raymond"). Susan Sarandon, who makes her first debut, has to take a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone in her own filthy water. I noticed that a great Raggerty Ann Doll (Creator, John Gruelle) was the only one Susan could actually trust and love, and the puppet appeared in some scenes. If you really want to know how the '70s comes out with drugs, free love and pipe dreams, enjoy the great direction of John G. Avildsen ("Rocky and" The Karate Kid). I always thought that Peter Boyle should have been blown in the end !! This is definitely a cult classic worth seeing and sharing with others.
