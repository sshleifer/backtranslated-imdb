I think it was back in 1987 when we passed our exams and my friend and I saw in the papers that one of the theaters was playing "Teen Deviyan". We decided to just go without hope for something big. But we had a pleasant surprise. The film was shot in 1965, but even by today's standards, the storyline was completely modern and far ahead of its time. The music was wonderful and Dev Anand, born like a city, looked and did his best. I still remember that feeling when we came out of the theater after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Who thought of this story that a man was in love with three different girls at the same time? No, he is not a pastime pastimes or deceives them, but he likes all three for different reasons. One is homely, one is an actress, and the third is a high society girl who can help Dev in his poetry career. The question is, which one is for him? What makes matters even worse is that all three of them like him too. When things come to a dead end, a hypnotist takes him in, and in his hypnotized state, he dreams of his future with each of them and makes the right decision. Part of an otherwise black and white film is the core of the film, though Surprisingly, it is cut out of most of the versions available today. If you want to watch this movie, make sure this part is intact. If you see this film without this part and get confused, do not worry because you just saw an incomplete movie.
