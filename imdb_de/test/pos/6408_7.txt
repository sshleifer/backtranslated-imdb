By comparison, Tarkovsky is a speed geek. <br /> <br /> By comparison, Bela Tarr is MTV. <br /> <br /> In comparison, the movie "Russian Ark" is riding a roller coaster ride. <br /> <br /> I've just described three of the sllllowwwwesstttt experiences I've ever experienced, and this one surpasses them all. That does not mean that it is bad. On the contrary, I really liked it. But it was a chore. I will not describe the plot because it is easy to find it elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the plot is INSANE. It's one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since "Becoming John Malkovich". I think the interesting conspiracy is the main reason why I did not bow down (the humor was nice, too, which is something we rarely see in slow, artistic films). <br /> <br /> Norm. Most films have little plot and little substance; Nevertheless, they fill 90 minutes with many exciting pictures to inspire us. But "The Hole" has 100% plot / theme without much to please. In that sense, I think this is a truly intellectual experience, much like reading a painfully wordy novel like Thackaray's Vanity Fair (which I NEVER could end!). <br /> <br /> tremendous attention span, I think you will really like this movie. Despite its rapid pace, it is very creative and imaginative. It's like Jean-Pierre Jeunet at Quaaludes and with a dreary, dusty camera lens. Good luck.
