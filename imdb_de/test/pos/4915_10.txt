When this was shown at the Seattle International Film Festival, I was the only person who stood and clapped and cheered. The rest of the crowd bored or fell silent. It's a well-played little movie that reaches deep into the reality of the humanity of a young gay man. It's about a real man; and does not play with the threadbare, muscular "gay paositive" that applies to the genre of non-pornographic gay cinema (and that's why so many contemporary gay genre films are so stupid). This film is intense passion and great tragedy. The acting and the direction and the cinematography is fantastic. All this keeps the film clastrophobic and tense and passionate. Do not miss that if you can find it.
