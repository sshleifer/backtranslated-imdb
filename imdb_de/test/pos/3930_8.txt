I did not expect much of this movie when I went to the theater, but I had been waiting for it for many years. To summarize, it was damn good! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he would be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn, but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good but Brian Van Holt is the best performer. He played the evil too well, I mean, he was sick, sadistic and very cruel. The back story between the brothers was good, and I liked the fact that until about 40 minutes after the movie, no murders took place. It gave you time to choose the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to die for. Jon Abrahams was pretty good as a stupid CMM bud. I liked how Chad somehow cried when he found him dead. It showed how he really felt. Overall, this was a goddamn god slayer with great effects. Bravo!
