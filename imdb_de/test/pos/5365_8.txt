I saw this at the 2004 Stony Brook Film Festival in New York and it was warmly received. In this pre-World War II film, two German rocket scientists are working on the Scottish Isle of Scarp, with war on the horizon. The characters that can be found on the island are invaluable for their creation and portrayal. Shauna MacDonald is particularly memorable <br /> <br /> After getting to grips with the "Scootish" accents, the audience feels like these people enjoying the way the Germans work to connect their island to the mainland connect at home a rocket-based mail delivery. As implausible as it seems, this film is based on an actual story. <br /> <br /> All in all a memorable movie that will stay with you for a while due to its casting, history or landscape.
