The best of the American pie "bakery". I found that the humor and the plot were a much more compelling audience than any previous American pie movie. Also, regarding the appropriateness of the content, I found that this is acceptable to a much larger audience than any previous American pie movie. I really enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie hit the market for the first time, I read a series of negative reviews and was not seen in the theater. I regret this decision now. The film far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialogue / scripting and overall quality. I give two thumbs up!
