What you have seen in BULLITT and the French Connection is nothing compared to what you have here. The hunt takes almost 15 minutes and is the best you'll ever see. This movie has become a classic mystery since the heyday of the 70s. It is a pithy and realistic representation of the common streets of New York City. Tony Lo Bianco behaves in this film with one of the smartest ways ever shown on screen. He tears off his own colleagues and makes it look like the police are responsible. His childhood friend, Roy Scheider, is a street commissioner confused by the gangsters' disappearance. You can see that Lo Bianco enjoys the game throughout the movie. But sometimes the movie gets boring, but if you feel like giving up the movie, something big happens and pulls you back. The Score of Don Ellis sets the tone of the cold, gray winter time in New York City. To top it off, my husband Joe Spinell comes in an early role as Toredano as a garage man. <br /> <br /> rating, 7 out of 10 stars
