As a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London, I was delighted to see this movie on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This movie offers great shots, a superb soundtrack and interesting insights into a "not so well-known" London. <br /> <br /> The film is completely in "dark" colors, which I personally do not like much. In addition, the story was a bit too British and the comments were sometimes a bit flat. Apart from that, there are some great comments from Londoners and excellent shots. FINISTERRE does not glorify London by showing all the major attractions of the city, but gives deep insights into what London really is. From the eastern end to the vibrant center with its music scene and 'special small retreats' for Londoners. <br /> <br /> All in all: <br /> <br /> + Great soundtrack + Nice shots + great insights <br /> <br /> -Narration - sometimes something to see - very dark picture <br /> <br /> worth seeing! I give a 7/10
