It follows a little known British film from 1998, which was filmed with a budget of Â£ 8000 and has a running time of 70 minutes. If you see it, would you ever expect the director to make it to Hollywood and become one of the most respected and famous directors of the 21st century? Well, everyone has to start somewhere, I think. <br /> <br /> The director of following, as you probably already know, is the Englishman Christopher Nolan, who staged the critically acclaimed independent film Memento right after the episodes. A few years later he was hired by Warner Bros. to lead the new Batman series, which further admired him, and so on and so forth. My point is, everyone has to start somewhere? even if it is not in the most amazing debut ?? and Christopher Nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with Follow. <br /> <br /> Looking at it, I could not help thinking of another directorial debut, avant-garde author David Lynch's Eraserhead. The following is not a surrealist psychological horror film in this sense, but the similarities are striking; Most notably, it is recorded in grainy black and white and has an atmosphere that makes it unique. It's hard to describe in words, but it loosely resembles the smoky atmosphere you would find in the movie Noirs of yore. So you can say that the consequence is a contemporary noir or a neo-noir. All in all, this is a fusion of it and a psychological thriller, and the story fits best with these two genres. <br /> <br /> The main character is nameless and the title of the film comes from an early compulsive-compelling trait he possessed? Chasing people on the street and following them, sometimes even for hours. During one of these "stalking expeditions" the main character is noticed and confronted by one of the persons he follows. It turns out that the "confrontator" is a man who is willing to befriend our narrator, and he introduces himself; his name is Cobb, and he's a little burglar who asks the narrator to follow him on his break-in. From there, the main character in Cobb's world gets carried away, and he becomes involved in crime, passion and violence as he becomes more and more familiar with Cobb. It's not so much a character study but a movie that follows the turbulent relationship between these two main characters and the devastating impact on our narrator. Nolan succeeds in making the film similar to a film noir and imitates the respective atmosphere well. <br /> <br /> As a thriller, the episode is tense and atmospheric; As a film in general, however, this is a disappointment. If not, then you could definitely call it oppressive. The entire film is not shot chronologically or linearly and makes the story and the movie experience partly unique. This style has been done so often that it is almost a common technique? and the story itself is, to some extent, unique. <br /> <br /> However, ultimately, the impact on the entire movie is not as heady and disappointingly unspectacular. History requires more? more action, more tension and more tension? however, it is too much involved in one's own action and instead focuses on creating a complicated story. This succeeds, but without other elements it is a film noir that does not quite work. It has a sense of emptiness that is not enormous, but is still noticeable. Besides, is the shocking revelation of the movie in the end ?? almost a mandatory congress in Film Noirs? is one that makes us feel betrayed; It is unpredictable and comes from nowhere, but in terms of the story it is disappointing as it essentially makes the previous scenes and the entire movie seem like a huge waste of time. <br /> <br /> But the positive is far outweighing the negatives and in the end it turns out that the movie is a flawed, but satisfying movie: yes, everyone has to start somewhere. Christopher Nolan does that with Follow and he does it in a fine way. It's not the most amazing movie, and it's not the worthy recognition the director would get in the following decade, but it's still a good movie. Choosing "Completed" will find a well-made, tight and atmospheric thriller that does not have a striking nuance or an innovative style, yet still reaches the audience.
