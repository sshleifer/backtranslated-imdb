Like many other commentators, I expected a musical taste that would satisfy my curiosity - and got more than I wanted. I heard and saw a powerful, exquisite, sometimes haunting, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (in the truest way) and absolutely stunning mix of music and musicians. Reminded me of some forms of Indian music (East Indian), but at the same time was very different. <br /> <br /> Starting from the first song by Baba Zula to the Kurdish singer Aynur (what a voice)) to Siyasiyabend to the jam session (or "jugalbandhi" as we call it in India) in the little one Selim Seslar (big fan right now :)), I enjoyed every minute and wish it would not end up.>> One of the best music commentaries I've seen and heard in a long time. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for a CD with the soundtrack and I hope to find it online soon, as well as old and new albums by Baba Zula. One day later The music is still imprinted in my brain and I do not want it to disappear. Turkey and especially Istanbul seem to be such beautiful and exciting places now - and I will start saving today to tackle it. <br /> <br /> Believe Akin - this is a gem.
