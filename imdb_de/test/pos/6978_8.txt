Formerly Coppola with a sublime cast that most people have never seen (too bad). There are some wonderful things in this case - Shirley Knight's best performance (an undervalued actress), a road trip in the late 1960s, James Caan, who is very reserved and moving, Robert Duvall in a role he had borne (nervous, lonely, motorcycle cop) and a touching script with F. Coppola behind the wheel. If this had been done by someone five years later, that would have been a huge success (so much for the timing). Anyway, I recommend it to anyone who does not need explosions in space and bad jokes with mother-in-law or a billion-dollar budget to sit for a few hours and follow a story. Give this a chance if you can find it!
