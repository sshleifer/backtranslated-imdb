PRIZE OF HONOR, also known as PRICE OF POWER, is an ambitious Western melodrama that highlights the action and appeals to an old-west version of JFK's assassination. In 1881, the president travels to Dallas and is shot from a window while driving his car through the city. Corrupt officials have executed the murder and let a modest slave take the rap. Our hero, the serious but mild Giuliano Gemma, aims to enlighten the conspiracy. A rousing story, bold for the subject, but entertaining despite the low number of shoot-em-up action. The film is a 7/10 point, despite the poor presentation of the DVD, which is too dark with bad sound. Look for a good copy.
