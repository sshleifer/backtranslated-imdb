For the man who hatched the idea for Lifeforce, I have to say one thing: Thank you, sir! Lifeforce combines the inexpensive sci-fi pomp of Star Trek: The Motion Picture with the cheap horror thrill of Phantasm and crowns it with t-ts- and some real meaty hangers. And the best part is that it's actually a good movie! It amazes me that someone justifies a mainstream movie that serves to make a hot chick appear nude on the screen for an hour and a half. God bless you all who were involved. Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter) plays Col. Carlson, the American commander of an international space mission to investigate Halley's comet. Carlson's crew finds an extraterrestrial ship within the comet, in which there are three naked people in suspended animation - two guys and a hot broad (Mathilda May). In short, they are "space vampires" ... naked "space vampires". They are destroying the crew except for Col. Blueballs, who decided to leave the hot chick out of her Lucite showcase because the part of his brain controlling his nut fluids told him it was the right one. The colonel carries him in a rescue capsule to our big blue ball. Meanwhile, another space shuttle crew has discovered that his ship was dead in space, bringing back the three space coffins of the Living Dead Martians to London. And then people start turning into pork ropes, and they're generally getting out of hand too damn fast. Carlson works with the unwavering Col. Caine (Peter Firth) of the British SAS to track down our nude sweetie - who has a damn good time sucking guys left and right. Carlson has discovered he has a spiritual connection to Vampira, the enable them to track them down with the ultimate goal of ripping off their asses and ruining them and their comrades' big space screen, which absorbs the energy of the people who attack the vamps. Will they succeed in time? MINOR SPOILER: Yes. <br /> <br /> Wow. What can I say besides "wow"? This damn movie really works. I can not believe they got British actors like Aubrey Morris (A Clockwork Orange) and Patrick Stewart (Sexiest Man Alive or such a title). All actors are good. The direction is good and really shines in the last half where we see the fantastic destruction of London. Special effects are also no disadvantage. For 1985, this film must have been the right thing for fx. All effects are quite impressive and there is a wide range of animotronics talents, make-up effects, light shows and very beautiful space scenes with old-fashioned modeling and matte painting - beautifully done. There are even some bloody and bloody squib shots for all horror fans. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a great movie for all those who have nostalgia when popular movies with 100% love were shot right from the start. The creators of the movie really made sure all the basics were covered, and the end result is a phenomenal fun affair that you do not have to turn away because the procedures just look too good. Real solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.
