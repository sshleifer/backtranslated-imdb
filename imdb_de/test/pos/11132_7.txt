A recent survey of children in the UK underpinned the concept of this film 27 years ago. Since young people are more than anything else, they want to become someone who is famous. It used to be doctors and firefighters who wanted to be children. Now everyone wants to be famous. Fame is a story of a group of children who was inducted at the High School of the Performing Arts in New York City. We saw her at the first audition, then we took lessons and learned about life over the next four years. The movie has many good qualities, but in the end you feel a little dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Alan Parker's bold directorial style goes well with the story. The film was classified as a musical, but is above all a drama. Musical numbers and dance routines break out here and there, and Parker keeps them as close to realistic as they could have been filmed. Acting is, with a few exceptions, mostly the top drawer. The tempo is a bit off, especially towards the end of the movie, but by this time the story has already taken a few wrong turns anyway. First the auditions at the beginning of the movie should have sorted out some of the main characters. It seems unlikely that someone would introduce themselves to one department and then stumble upon being admitted to another. Some of these people just do not look so talented or interested. As soon as the first year of teaching begins, the film starts a nice groove. The interaction between students and teachers is handled very well, so you want more. The movie starts to lose later, as we see more and more lives of students outside of school. Some of these people just are not worth taking care of. <br /> <br /> The film's biggest flaw is to make the character of Ralph Garcy so prominent. This guy is a guy. egocentric idiot. A "professional A-hole" as he proudly explains on stage during his comedy routines. The audience should somehow feel for this guy and his tragic personal situation, but I was just hoping he would throw his butt out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people the movie cares about. Try it as much as possible, I still can not develop abdominal muscles like Gene Anthony Ray did in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is good. It is unforgettable, interesting and full of daring scenes and performances. It may run a little too long and maybe some of the fake characters are fully developed while others float in the background. The music numbers are great and there are even one or two surprises that will be discovered when the movie is over. Although not perfect, Fame will be a movie that lives on in one way or another for many years. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
