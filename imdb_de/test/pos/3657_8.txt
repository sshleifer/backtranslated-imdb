Hari Om is about an impossible love between a French tourist and the auto rickshaw driver, who agrees to take her with her indifferent friend for a rendezvous. A third-world road movie, from lavish reveries to wacky comedy, is characterized by the outstanding performance of Vijay Raaz, who became one of the most diligent Indian actors after appearing as an event planner in Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding. <br /> <br /> In an interview, Raaz shows that he is quite untouched by his success and responds to questions carefully and thoughtfully. He discovered the love of acting and joined in the study of a large theater company, but for a person with so much formal education, he is surprisingly inarticulate about his craft. He speaks of honesty and purity as the source of his approach, and the seriousness of his desire to convey something authentic to the public is clear. On screen, Raaz conveys an emotional integrity and dramatic certainty that elevates his character to an extraordinary level. Director Bharatbala has used it perfectly and directed it. He has a wonderfully expressive face in which the camera revels; Close-ups of this face are as compelling as shots of Camille Natta, who is beautiful as French Isa.
