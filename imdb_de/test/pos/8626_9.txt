I grew up with the Abbott and Costello movies, A. because my dad grew up with them and our two surnames are abbott. That's why we owe a little respect to the deodorant. I did not know how bad this movie and the others would be. It was a really classic reason, it was funny, because Abbott and Costello were always the same characters, but it was so funny. Well, what I like about Jack and the Beanstalk is that the love story is totally boring and that a song that's Prince is singing, omg, unaware, but I like the perspective they had for love, the story. The couple has to marry because a kingdom runs out of money, they meet in the prison cell and fall in love because they both pretend not to be royal and they end up the couple, such a happy ending, I do not think so that this was the original version, if she should have cut it out of this movie, but I think it was original and I love it. but it's shit, lol, even if the movie really starts with the gigant + abbott and costello, it's sooooo weird. When the giant hits the clinker against the door and the clinker "OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR" screams, the stuff is really funny. And this joke Jack starts screaming, Prince, Prince and all these dogs jump at him. Kind of cheezy, but really original. I wish they had at least tried to remaster it, even though I had the African screams and the beanstalk, and I do not care about the quality cause when I put it on tape, it was poor quality, and so it was I guess. The beginning is mildly funny, the middle is really funny, and the end is not exactly funny, but I'm 19 years old, and when I make a movie that makes me laugh so much, it rocks, this one Movie is really funny. I love her style. Even the chapters are shit. Also, the part where Jack climbs the beanstalk and they all sing a song about what a dipstick is and that he gets killed, that's pretty funny
