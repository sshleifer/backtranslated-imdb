Tim Burton, the man behind the original Batman movie and Beetlejuice, brings to the world the successor to Batman, who surpasses the original in several ways. First, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batman's enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads in the story, and the penguin works just like the original joker. The sets are stunning and immaculate. There are so many dark streets in Gotham City that you would never know what's happening on one side or the other. The only thing that gives him a bad name is the script, which sometimes seems to go down and then does not recover for a while. Tim Burton's direction brings superhero films to a new kingdom. Beats all Superman movies and the other Batman movies by a mile. Although the new Batman begins with the realization, he has a bite that lacks it, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.
