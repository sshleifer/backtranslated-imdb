I had a long memory of this movie for years, I found it somewhere and could not find it anywhere, so I thought it must have disappeared. <br /> <br /> TO ... My Gran showed me a box she sent in the Daily Mail. I think there is nothing decent in there, but to my great surprise there were, among other jewels, The Water Babies! I have not been so excited for a long time! It's a great carefree movie, the songs are not memorable. If I was a child in the time he came out, I would have thought of something more. Unfortunately, it was just a movie that I saw in my house 10 years ago, when I was a little spud. And if you look at it now, the animation is awful! and the recovered voices they do to make the sound richer in movies are completely out! But who cares if your child never thinks of these things, even if they lead a boy who is about 10 and sounds like a boy in the middle of puberty. <br /> <br /> Great classic children's movie!
