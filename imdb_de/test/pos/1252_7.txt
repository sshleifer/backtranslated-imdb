To explain Disney's "The Kid" has absolutely nothing to do with the eponymous Charlie Chaplin 1921 classic. What we have is a pleasant, if unbelievable, good family comedy that only the people of Disney can offer. Bruce Willis plays in the tempo change a self-centered plush shirt from an "image consultant". He not only downgrades his customers, but also those who are close to him. They know he has to change before the credits. <br /> <br /> In his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of Willis' character as a nerdy 8-year-old, who played with Cutesy Pie's conviction of Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere). This forces Willis to deal with his past, and you know the rest. <br /> <br /> As Willis' love interest, Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin are his assistants. Both have little enough to do, as most of the film involves interaction between the Willis and Breslin characters. <br /> <br /> "The Kid", although not the best Disney movie is one that is still a sitting and look with your family and get away with a warm feeling.
