Heya Denver fans! The animation is a cartoon classic and one of my favorites (and yes, it was also aired in Europe, including my tiny Central European country Slovenia! = :) Oh, how do I miss the 80s cartoons !! Honestly, they were much better than today's children's shows. Imaginative, creative, full of fun with good manners, more substance, great plot and excellent character voices. Today's computer-animated shows do not have all these features. All of you who agree and want to bring back all the shows so that the children of today's generation will see the entertainment that brought us these cartoons, please log on to the adjacent page and sign a petition for a repeat of the 80s best cartoons ! <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com / 1 / we-want-at-80s-kid-cartoon-kids-show-channel <br /> <br /> Carpe Denver! =) <br /> <br /> Lejla
