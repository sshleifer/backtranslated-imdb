After trying the model industry (as a model), I look at this show with a slightly different view than most others. Although I can admit that ANTM can be a fun and entertaining show, over the seasons it seems to deviate from reality. <br /> <br /> The show seems almost pure advertising to its participants None of the winners of the show (or competitors) have made a name for themselves under the umbrella of the show. Maybe it's because the truth is that any girl with a real potential for a high-fashion model does not have to be in a hugely difficult position to submit to agencies (you can do so via e-mail or per Post if you are prevented from removal by an open call from the agency) Sign up with an agency and start a career as a model. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently not ANTM either. And participating in a reality show seems less buoyant in the modeling business than signing up with a top or decent agency (for which only one candidate per cycle has a guarantee anyway). <br /> <br /> The show can not hurt, it can certainly be amusing and has a kind of magic that works especially for teenage girls, I found out. However, I must add that ANTM can become tired and boring after watching several cycles as it has become for me. And apart from some unrealistic situations (each more outrageous than the last), the only other annoyance is the overuse of "Tyra, Tyra, Tyra!" Tyra seems to really want these girls to succeed, but it is necessary that the temporary excavations of each model be treated in Tyra images. for virtually every panel and every challenge to record a story or scenario that "Tyra" has experienced and overcome? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, take some Tyra out, add some more reality, and ANTM could be a 10-star show instead of a 7.
