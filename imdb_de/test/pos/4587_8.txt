You can read all kinds of references into the world of idiocracy. A futuristic world populated by spoiled, selfish idiots fueled by the technology of a bygone era, this idea is modeled on HG Well's "The Time Machine" and Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" among other satires at an early age At the stage of the film, a narrator explains the rapid humiliation of mankind over five hundred years, but does not fill in the gaps where all the futuristic technology comes from in the meantime. Most criticism of this very funny (and funny) film seems to surround this omission and the resulting complaint that the world is not "realistic". As if "realism" had ever been a necessary feature of satire. Is "Brazil" realistic? How about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? What about Gulliver's Travels? I did not think. "Idiocracy", though perhaps not as sharp as the best of the genre, strikes the same notes and generally succesfully. <br /> <br /> Also, I did not find the futuristic technology a problem. It's pretty easy to figure out that Mike Judge is misleading the current trend towards automation and simple product interfaces, so even idiots can use them. As in "Brave New World", the film has sometime in the past reached a point of automated self-sufficiency (evidently created by the now-extinct "intelligent people" to appease an increasingly stupid population) and leaves the rest of humanity free to indulge in the worst, most selfish impulses you can imagine, and even become stupider. The movie is taking place during the last gasp of humanity as everything falls apart forever. It may still be "unrealistic", but if so, it is a remarkably well presented brand of unrealism. <br /> <br /> Of course, the stupid people spend most of their time on the screen, but they're just the victims - they do not know any better. Mike Judge rescues his true hatred for the intelligent rulers who are already dead at the beginning of the film but are now very much alive in the 21st century. People like scientists who hunt "hair growth and prolonged erections" for no other reason than the chance that they will make profits with their snake oil treatments. People like politicians who have companies just buy the FDA and FCC. People like media professionals and their yuppie snoopers who promote stupidity - that allow the destruction of culture, morals and health to generate a quick price. <br /> <br /> For who is really to blame, the Morlocks or the Eloi? The Paris Hiltons of the world or the brilliant executives and advertisers who brought them on television and lowered our cultural standards to the point where they could stay? However, this is all contained in "idiocracy". One line here, a hint there (witness of the hilarious car doctor who literally does all the work in the health care system). It's one of the few aspects of the movie NOT hammered into the ground by the unnecessary narrator. It's only available to the viewer or not, but it's one of the most interesting topics in a movie that's a lot smarter than any other comedy of the year. <br /> <br /> Too bad that so many people are going to do it Let the movie think it's just an excuse to showcase backgrounds and people being hit in the bar. Not that it's not funny either, and maybe it's a bit sparse. But in "idiocracy" it is not as easy as it seems.
