Based on Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time," this amazing film by Eroll Morris documents the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy. Despite his debilitating illness ALS, he has contributed more to science than any capable physical scientist could ever dream of. The movie begins with narration of Hawking's childhood and, like a poor student, was noticeably bright. He thwarted college and university, where he was diagnosed with the disease that would take away the normal functions of his body, but would allow him to continue to live and think perfectly. Morris discusses how Brilliant Stephens' mind evolved from childhood to the present, and eventually his mother tells how she had prophetically bought an astronomical atlas during her pregnancy to read in the hospital. Hawking himself tells the timeline of his discoveries while Morris interviews close friends and colleagues fortunate enough to be friends with the great man. <br /> <br /> He tells how he was first fascinated by the discovery that the universe expanded like a star. We also know that stars will eventually die and become what is now called "black holes". If so, will not the universe begin to contract and turn around until we reach the "big crisis"? as Hawking puts it. And when the universe withdraws, will not time "turn back"? When this question was asked, I began to think that death may not be the end, maybe one day will go back and our death will become our rebirth and our birth our death. The universe, like everything else in life, is a great cycle. <br /> <br /> That's what Hawking tells us, everything in the universe is self-recycling. This is completely logical and can raise your consciousness to think in millions of directions. That's why I love this movie and why is it a MUST SEE !!! An 11 out of 10 ... Morris never stops toamaze!
