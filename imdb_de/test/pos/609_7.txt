A look at three geishas that have far exceeded their heyday. Now they lovingly look back on their past and complain their presence. Kin (played by Haruko Sugimura of Floating Weeds) has forsworn men and made money as a money lender; Everyone in the block owes you something. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, wish they could land husbands, but are not fool enough to believe that they will ever do it. Their children - one has a son and one - a daughter - marry both (not with each other). Tamae is annoyed at how much more beautiful her daughter has become than she is, and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man. Nobu's concern for her son is more legitimate, but (understandably) selfish. After her son left, she will be alone. A bit into the movie, two of Kin's previous clients are looking for her, one so obsessed with her that he's trying to make her commit a double suicide with him, others of her most beautiful clients. Unfortunately, he comes for her money, not for her love. As I have described the film, it sounds incessantly depressing, but it is not really. Sad, but not deadly. It is bittersweet. Unfortunately, I did not like Late Chrysanthemums very much. The story seems to be better when I look back, but it is very slow and boring. In fact, I nodded twice during the movie, and I was not tired at all before I started. This is the kind of movie I like to appreciate; It reminds me a lot of my reaction to some of Ozu's more famous films. 10.7.
