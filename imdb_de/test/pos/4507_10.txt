Stranger Than Fiction's film The Kite Runner, Marc Forster, is the cinematic equivalent of eating vegetables, as this Art-House epic PG-13 is good for your movie fare. No, that's not the kind of movie I like to drag on the couch and eyeball at the end of a hard day. The Kite Runner is not a typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget about your problems. First, there are no celebrity stars in it. Second, nothing is cut and dried, black or white or so fancy that you do not believe a picture you see. Third, if the characters occasionally speak in their native language, the kite runner will drop into subtitles. Fourth, Forster's film is not a romantic little thing about boy-want-girl, boy-loses-girl and then boy-wins-girl. Fifth, you may feel uncomfortable in this foreign-language film and question your assumptions about life, friendship, and survival. The main topics are cowardice and salvation. The protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the story, for which he has to pay at the expense of his personal safety and integrity. Right, the kite runner is about redeeming for the sins of the past. We're talking about personal responsibility, so do not lend or buy this wonderful movie for a boy's night party or anything to take the bad taste of the day out of your system. Based on Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel, this culturally enlightened melodrama of right and down first looks like one of those lighthearted friendship films about youngsters in the style of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot. After about half an hour in 127 minutes, this escapade with two teenagers flying kites in Afghanistan becomes dark and unappetizing. However, if you can manage the remaining hour of conspiracy, you will be satisfied, relieved, and perhaps even entertained. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner will open in 2000 in San Francisco. Our protagonist, Afghan emigrant Amir Jan (Khalid Abdalla of United 93) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni of The Florist) receive two published boxes of copies of Amir's first novel. No sooner had Amir had the chance to take his triumph of a storyteller life than the phone pushes him out of his reverie, he is reluctantly dragged back into a past that is best forgotten. Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub of The Nativity Story) calls Amir from Pakistan to make an inquiry. Rahim was a servant in Amir's household in the 1970s when Amir lived in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion of his wealthy Pashtun merchant father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi of A Taste of Cherry). "You still have a chance to be good," informs Rahim Amir, without sugar being added to him. Basically, Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan and then enter the war-torn Afghanistan and save Rahim's young grandson Sohrab (Ali Danish Bakhty Ari), who is being held captive against his will as a sex slave for Assef (new arrival Abdul Salam Yusoufzai) Chief and Amir's once dreaded opponent. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner moved from San Francisco in 2000 to an expanded flashback set set in 1978 in Kabul, when life was idyllic. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) and son of his father Hassan's (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada) love to watch movies like John Sturges' Western The Magnificent Seven if they do not fly kites. By the way, this is kite flying like you've never seen before. Not only do the children fly with them, they also compete with other children to see who can cut the strings of another child killer. The kite surfing scenes create the same excitement as the dog fighting scenes in Tony Scott's Top Gun. Hassan is Amir's best friend, but unlike Amir, Hassan belongs to the insulted Hazara minority. Previously, the young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with the young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two Flunkies. Assef just wanted to beat her up, but Hassan pulls out his slingshot and threatens to use her on Assef. Assef had no choice but to resign. In the meantime, Amir was ready to suffer the fate of the hand. Amir's father, Baba, laments his son's lack of spinal column and fears that he could grow up half of a man because he's a coward, as opposed to the small, brave Hassan who bumps Amir out of difficult circumstances. However, Amir and Hassan emerge from the showdown with Assef without a scratch. Later, after Amir sets a new record with his kite flies and combat skills, Hassan runs after a dragon to challenge him. Hassan is the eponymous character referred to in the title. Hassan claims the fallen dragon, but he is at the mercy of Assef and his two henchmen. Assef has Hassan keep the dragon, but his followers harness Hassan with outstretched eagles in an alley while Assef has spoiled the youth. Worst of all is a traumatized Amir watching the attack up close, but he lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who intervened on his behalf. In addition to the extraordinary aerial photography with the dragons, The Kite Runner is down to earth, straightforward stuff. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to rescue Sohrab, he masquerades as a Taliban fighter but does not carry a firearm. The rescue scene in The Kite Runner is similar to the escape scene of The Midnight Express. While Forster does not explore local politics or delve into the ethnic and cultural issues involved. In fact, Troy's scenariist David Benioff had to remove some parts of the book, and the racial and ethnic prejudices are not clearly defined. So you have to accept some things by faith. In almost China Forster has provided the film with a lens to give it an authentic look. Forster deserves recognition for this two-hour and epic allure. The ideas, especially of the children, are characterized by their credibility. The Kite Runner is a movie that you will not forget so quickly.
