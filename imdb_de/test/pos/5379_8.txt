This is a scary underrated gem with scary performances and a fantastic finale! All the characters are great and the story was great, and I really liked the ending! The plot was great and it never bored me, and while the kid actors were bad, they scared me! That was some time ago on the space channel, so I decided to give it a try and play it. I read some good reviews from other horror fans. I have to say that I agree with them Martin was fantastic in his role as a Satan worshiper. It has tons of scary atmosphere, and it lets you guess consistently. In addition, all the characters were very sympathetic, and you're really starting to get interested in Ben and his family. It has a lot of disturbing moments, and the movie really shocked me sometimes, and it's extremely well done on a low budget! This is a scary, underrated gem, with scary performances and a fantastic finale! I recommend this a lot! The direction is very good! Bernard McEveety does a very good job here, with great camerawork that creates a spooky atmosphere and keeps the movie at a very fast pace! There is a bit of blood and blood. We get a severed leg, many bloody bodies, bloody neck, cut and roll, beheading and skewering. The spectacle is excellent! Strother Martin is fantastic here! As a Satan worshiper, he is extremely scary, very persuasive, quite deterrent, extremely intense, seemed to enjoy himself and did a fantastic job overall. Charles Bateman is great as the father, he was very caring, very personable and gave a good show! I loved him very much. L.Q. Jones is awesome like the sheriff, he was funny, on top of that, he looked very young, had a cool character and just did a great job! Ahna Capri is good as a friend and did what she needed to do pretty well. Charles Robinson excelled as a priest and did not convince me a bit! And his laugh was especially bad. Geri Reischl is a decent daughter, she was a bit personable and only got on my nerves a couple of times, I liked her more. Alvy Moore was stupid but very sympathetic in his role as Tobey, I dug it! The rest of the cast is doing well. All in all, I highly recommend it! *** 1/2 out of 5
