Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, We have really won a winner here. Not really, but boy, this movie is often a hilarious and always entertaining, terrible scream of a stinker. Poor Alma (who gets Julia Ruiz) suffers from an ancient Mayan curse that causes deadly poisonous snakes to grow in her body. Alma and her crazy shaman husband Brujo (Alby Castro, feverishly overseen with delicious eye-blood intensity) are jamming in a train heading to Los Angeles. Of course, a few deadly vipers lose so they can terrorize the colorful passenger assortment. The Mallachi Brothers, who are working on an absurd screenplay by Eric Fosberg, are just treating the ridiculous premise and creating a wonderfully miserable piece of delirious campy cheese. The gruesome CGI effects, the pathetically unflattering, usual variety of Gardner snakes (the soundtrack adds eerie rattlesnake sounds to give them a weak sense of otherwise unavailable threat), the tempo, the total tension of any tension or anything Wait, the obvious shaky stage-train and above all the simply amazing "you have to kid me!" Exaggerated, absurd finale are all fantastic in their breathtaking horror. Better yet, we've also played (albeit lame) games of a no-name cast, a nice smidgen of yummy, nude female nudity, a funky Hum'n'sHiver score, and lots of rude and grotesque make-up -F / X. Bonus points for the fact that the symbolically sexy little girl is eaten by a big reptile, and for the engineer who gets caught being pulled out of a hollow light bulb (!?). An absolute dedication of a kitschbr√ºller.
