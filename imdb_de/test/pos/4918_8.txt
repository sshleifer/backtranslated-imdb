I gave this show a chance because of Jaleel White, not because of his Urkel character, but mainly because of the Sonic the Hedgehog voice. XD Well, as I said, I gave her a chance, and I loved her very much. I never cared for the Urkel figure, so I was glad to see Mr. White in a different role than the nerd who was so annoying. And his Calvin J. Fraiser (first called Calvin, but in the second episode, everyone called him "J") was very entertaining and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite episode was when J arranged an ex-cowboy's cheerleader with the Snobby child. ("Do not talk like that about my mom!") "That's an adult, you stay down there!") The only beef I have is that the show had three main characters, but Mr. White's character always seemed to have the most attention, and the other two (who were married) always had the back stories ... It's not really good when a story about those two pregnant who need to sit back to J. babysit his girlfriend's dog ..... <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I really wish this show could have taken a bit longer. Unfortunately, it seems that people are not interested in Jaleel White as something other than the God-fearing, annoying ass known as the Urkel. <br /> <br /> I hope they bring it out as a DVD box at least.
