The English are a bit too angry, the Scots are a bit too heroic. The dialogue is sometimes too dramatic and the <br /> <br /> transitions between the scenes could be smoother. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, "The Bruce" looks authentic, if not polished /> <br /> history ... even if it plays loose with some important facts. Sandy Welch is not Gibson or Branagh, but he makes a brave <br /> <br /> Bruce. And Brian Blessed chews the scenery in sexy <br /> rascality as Edward I. <br /> <br /> Although the budget is lacking to make the final battle truly impressive, they still had an impressive amount for the English and Scottish armies. According to filmmakers, this is the largest filmed reconstruction of the medieval battle ever staged on the British Isles. Permission for a few flaws and shortcomings makes the movie <br /> <br /> convincing.
