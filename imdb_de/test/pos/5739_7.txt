As a ghostly guard, Paul Naschy is scarier than most of his fur-and-shoe-polished werewolf characters. The story is not unknown, a group of children celebrating in an abandoned school. The thing is, one of those fathers of this kid did the same thing years ago, but now he's deceased, and the youngest group of kids seems to be reliving an event from 23 years ago. It's pretty well done for films of this kind, and there's a mystery in what's going on, because what's happened to the kids before is a mystery, and maybe the truth has not been revealed. So no, not just your standard dice. This moves into a pretty good clip and will not let you lose interest, as is the case with many movies, and the oddball story is compelling enough to keep you interested, and there is a lot of tension in many movies. The end is pretty abrupt, and I think it's largely up to your imagination, but it's not too welcome either. 7 out of 10, check it out.
