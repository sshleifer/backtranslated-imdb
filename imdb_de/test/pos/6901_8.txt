When people talk about how "they do not do the way they used to do", just point them to this fantastically entertaining and weird-looking horror of director Glenn McQuaid's comedy. <br /> <br /> It's a story of Graverobbers (played by Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) who end up digging up more than just silent immovable bodies. After the first shock, they quickly realize that they can actually turn the situation to their advantage. And that is exactly what they are trying to do. However, it seems that things did not work out the way they intended when poor young Arthur (Monaghan) actually told his story to a priest (Ron Perlman) before being taken to the gallows. <br /> <br /> If you look at the details of his filmography, McQuaid seems to have taken the core of his first short film and extended it to this feature film, which is not a bad thing. Fessenden returns and is fine. Monaghan is one of those guys who can actually still make him like him while he's dealing with the shameful business of stealing from the dead and with other genre favorites like Perlman and Angus Scrimm in the scene where this movie is a lot of fun for genre fans. <br /> <br /> It also benefits from a unique and affordable design and look that sometimes passes from EC comic style panels to live action (a la creepshow) and always somehow feels authentic in its Hammer Horror Feeling. Maybe everything is covered with so much dry ice, but that's not the point. Whatever was done to capture everything on film, it works. It works well. <br /> <br /> It may not be really scary, but this movie has a great vein of black humor and definitely drips every minute of its life into macabre material that should please all who have it. The patience for the horror is something calmer and feels like it could have been done in the days of Hammer definitely. <br /> <br /> See this if you want: The Flesh And The Fiends, The Doctor And The Devils, Creepshow.
