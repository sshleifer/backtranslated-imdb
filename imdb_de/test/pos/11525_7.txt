As a father of forty at the age of forty, I thought that film made compelling contemplation-if not edge-of-the-seat stuff. I deserve a much higher rating than the 4.3 I had when I wrote this. (I gave it to 7) <br /> <br /> I agree with some comments on the characters, but Cameron Diaz shines in another, very different role. The plot was a bit stupid, but the point of the film was beautifully summed up for me in the last, rather surreal sequence. A moving end for all parents. <br /> <br /> I would imagine that a young, single guy might find the movie rather boring, but for other people who are not fixated on high testosterone doses, this would find something sweet.
