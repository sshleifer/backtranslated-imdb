Billy Hughes is a dumb young woman working on a cheap horror picture shot by an American director in Moscow. One night, Billy is detained in the film studio. Later that night she hears someone was in the building and goes to check it. Then she encounters a woman who is brutally murdered while she is being filmed. After Billy escapes the killers, he informs the authorities and only blushes when the men show that it was an act. Billy knows what she has seen, and soon her life is again in turmoil, of subterranean characters who believe they have something important. I do not know how that heartbreaking sleeper passed me by, but I thought It was a much older movie. But there is one thing, it has to be one of the most thrilling and violent thrillers I've seen in a long time. It's just a great suspense builder and most of the time it snaps! The first half of the feature is surprisingly exciting with exciting sequences that have your heart in your throat and tarnish us with an atmospherically predictive environment of alienation. This is a funny evil black line. Mistakes appear in the story as they lose the furious grip they had so early on, and stupid humor (or rather weird relief) between the characters of Fay Ripley and Evan Richard is a hit-and-miss affair because of them too strong. In the long term, it could probably have done without. Despite some moments of crisis, this aspect did not hinder my enjoyment of it. For me, the gentle end that they had decided on simply did not feel right. <br /> <br /> The interestingly mysterious premise was scary and had some disturbing goods. So multifaceted was the context and its thrill, it was something completely new, how it all worked out, and the nervous jolts and unbearable suspense were woven into a series of sudden twists and turns. Indeed, they have made excellent use of the novel idea of ​​this disability to hinder the situation by staging it in a foreign place where not too much English was spoken, so we also get into confusion. The petite Marina Zudina shows a shocking depiction of the American mute girl Billy. The way she was able to express the irregular emotions through her eyes and actions made her a bit harsh and believable. Director Anthony Waller shoots the film quite stylish, timely and skilful, without losing the dirty look that results from his rigid environment, and a powerful, airy music genre annoying stubbornly. The only real name that came up was the little cameo part of Alec Guinness. The performances of the performers were all fine, especially the nimble twists of Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as Russian killers. <br /> <br /> This riveting feature, which consists mostly of unknowns, is much better than the average dark thriller. Highly recommended.
