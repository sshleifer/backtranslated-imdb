This was a truly epic production that had all the elements one would want in a fantasy movie. The costumes, the music, the cinematography - all the artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and provided a rich experience. Ted Danson, known for his TV roles in Cheers and Becker. was excellent in the role of Gulliver. Mary Steenburgen (Time Behind Time, Cross Creek) was equally successful in her limited role as a wife. <br /> <br /> Other gigs I really enjoyed were James Fox as a dr. Bates, Alfre Woodard as Queen of Brobdingnag. and Peter O'Toole as Emperor of Lilliput. <br /> <br /> This would become a pleasing children's movie, but it would also appeal to adults because of its deep social commentary.
