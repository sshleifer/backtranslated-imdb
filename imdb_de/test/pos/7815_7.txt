"One Minute to Pray, One Second to Die" is a high quality western spaghetti with a solid cast and an interesting storyline. It is beautifully filmed with a relatively high production value for a movie in this genre. <br /> <br /> Alex Cord does a great job with Clay McCord, an outlaw who suffers from increasingly debilitating seizures. He seeks amnesty before his enemies approach him, but it is too exaggerated for his own good to ask. Robert Ryan delivers the best performance in the film as governor of New Mexico. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are great too. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good, but it does not strike me as one of the best spaghetti westerns. There is too much style missing to be in the same league as the big ones. It has some cool spaghetti overtones, but overall it's a bit too much like an American western. This is particularly evident in the music, which is fine, since films generally run well, but quite boring compared to Euro-Western standards. The soundtrack somehow reminds me of the music of "The Unforgiven". Although there is an interesting story here, it is told in a way that is a bit too conventional for my taste. If a spaghetti western fan and a Hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together, that would be the perfect compromise. I really liked it. Like I said, it's a very well done movie, and I recommend it to anyone who likes westerns, spaghetti, or anything else.
