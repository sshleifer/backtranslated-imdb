It's the war correspondent William Holden who falls in love with a stunning Eurasian doctor Jessica Jones, who stands in front of the stunning backdrop of Hong Kong. The cinematography is great as they meet on a hill overlooking Hong Kong. The story deals with ethnic tensions, mixed relationships and extramarital relationships. But what I love about her is the strong character of the heroine, portrayed by Jessica Jones, a Eurasian doctor who remains humble and steadfast in her altruistic mission and remains true to her love. Nevertheless, she is released in her hospital because she has raged with a married man by talking to high-ranking bludgers. One day, William Holden is called into the Korean War he covers, and on this unfortunate day she learns the news of his death. The end, of course, is tragic, I cried as she walked to her hill. It was a very sweet, unfortunate love affair. It defeats all adversity, the fact that she was dismissed from her job, how his wife would not divorce him, but insisted on her great love - despite all, they had a great love. Personally, I do not believe in extramarital affairs and I think he should not have done anything if he was bound to someone else, and she would not have allowed it, but still a really great movie. I think the heroine overshadowed the hero. Jessica Jones is sultry and did a great job, though I found it odd that they did not do a real Asian actress or someone with Asian blood. I agree with a review, Jessica Jones spits out sexuality as she lies down on the floor and looks calmly at William Holden, but her eyes say, come take me now. <br /> <br /> I think it's a pity that most of the great movies were made before I was born, many Hollywood movies seem to lack depth, to be a great show and to rely on stunts and heavy sex scenes. This is really one of the biggest unhappy love stories in movies.
