I've been addicted to "GG" since mid-2001-2002 (season 2) when I saw "Smallville" 10 minutes earlier. Thanks to "Beginnings", I have now recorded up to 2 episodes on tape, last night (Ep. 4.9). I'm a pure middle-aged man, and this is the ONLY weekly TV show I watch. <br /> <br /> I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a damn good-looking woman and is funny and smart to boot; b) the dialogue is extremely well written; c) It's totally weird and disgraced over-trash like "Everybody Loves Raymond". Many current television comedies have been heavily influenced by the hugely successful and much despised mucus pit "Married with Children," which prompts the viewer to mock the characters and feel superior. In "GG" the characters have mistakes, but we can see our own weaknesses in them and laugh with them, not about them. This is a stimulating television in which the authors urge us to keep up with the quick exchange and references from pop culture / literature / current events outside the left field. It's a huge pleasure to watch these episodes over and over again, catching all one-liners and clues to previous episodes. Stars Hollow is a little world of its own that I will gladly visit while the series is running.
