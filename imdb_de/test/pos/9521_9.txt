Beginning with a "My Name Is Joe" -like scene in Anonymous TBT Alcoholics in a wacky spiral of infidelity, double standards, and secrets. But what do you expect from a family of lawyers? <br /> <br /> A really funny movie featuring some of the most disgusting characters since The Birdcage, Plot and Subplot are associated with surreal scenes of decadent Parisian life (ever) for a wedding ceremony in the men's room where the bride's mother and her disturbed girlfriend Dope smoking and cracking blue jokes? No, not me either!), Resulting in a final scene of almost Arcadian symbolism. <br /> <br />
