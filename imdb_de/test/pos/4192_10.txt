Forget Easy Rider - Head is the movie about the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Laughter almost: The Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV spot about dandruff! Look: the fifty-meter-long Victor Mature tries to figure out what the hell he's doing in this movie! Listen: Frank Zappa (with his cow on a leash) says Davey Jones "Your music is terribly white"! Experience: The only live performance of Monkees as a real rock band plays the most honest, really real punk rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about a transsexual dad! Be confused: be very confused, as confused as Terri Garr is when Mickey Dolenz makes sexual allusions in her film debut! Witness: futile protests against the Vietnam War jump out of nowhere and disappear just as fast! See: Mike Nesmith was spitting for Christmas wearing a velvety Victorian smoker jacket in a cobwebbed gothic horror movie sound stage! Be drifting into the karmic bliss inspired by a comic version of Indian mysticism delivered by a black-faced white-faced character actor, while Peter Tork pretends to play the guitar! Discover: Oscar winner Bob Rafelson's first feature film, written by Oscar-winning actor Jack Nicholson! Imagine, it does not happen: When the Monkees commit a group suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge! Take Drugs - Take Many Drugs: Take as many drugs as the cast and crew that made this movie obvious! <br /> <br /> With Head, the Monkees have proven to be the most furious and keenest entertainers in Hollywood history. no cash. It is confusing to discover that they attribute the failure of this film to bad promo. Sure, the doctorate was practically nonexistent; But did not they realize how angry, how depressing, how self-defeating this movie is ?! I mean, this movie is a bad acid trip to the suicidal department of a mental hospital. The only film that I know to be depressing is Terry Gilliam's country in Brazil. And as in Brazil, this film shows why life in the late 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky. It's not just that Western culture was suffering from a heavy flood of information, but the information itself was just bad, bad, worse and bleak. In fact, it was the overloading effect itself that kept people going because people were distracted by one crisis or another. If the news from Vietnam was too much, they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rise in unemployment rates. <br /> <br /> The "positive" answer to the reality revealed in Head was Woodstock - three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drink and shit and piss and bad acidity and Peter Townsend Abbie Hoffman almost killed. All took place behind a steel fence, under the loving watchful eyes of a veritable army of New York State Troopers - meaning that the "freedom" of the Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the song in which John Sebastion sang the song while he was singing was so hard that he could barely speak. "500,000 assholes are too stupid to get out of the rain," one of the critics said to Woodstock (I think it was Andy Warhol). <br /> <br /> The good thing was Jimi Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner. Two years ago, the Jimi Hendrix Experience was opened on its first national tour of America as a prelude to the Monkees. <br /> <br /> See, it's all somehow connected. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself - no, you owe it to your unborn children - to see the real 1960s, only to be found in this bizarre, wonderful and utterly absurd tribute to one of the movies more interesting capitalist scams of the late 20th century.
