What some Hollywood films try and virtually never do, by somehow creating metaphysical connections between people (without becoming unrealistic), this beautiful film succeeds perfectly (similar to the wonderful "La Double Vie de Veronique" by the same director) and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL movie that changes the life perspective a bit - intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully staged, outstanding leading actor, masterful cinematography. I've just seen the movie on the third or fourth time and still think that it's one of the best I've ever seen. And if you are not satisfied with the end of 'White', then 'Red' puts a happy end to the entire trilogy.
