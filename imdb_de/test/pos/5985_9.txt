This movie is a gem! It's the story of Juliette, a regular cleaning lady who works in the large corporate headquarters of a yogurt company, and Romuald, president of the same company. He does not acknowledge them, he does not notice anyone until several plans to snatch his company from him are taken all at the same time. He is lost, nobody to turn to, no one to trust when he discovers Juliette. As a cleaning lady, no one cares about her, so they say and do incriminating things that make them smart enough to join their helpless and hapless boss and help. > I've been keeping an eye on the DVD for years and an earlier commentary released in September 2007 has raised my hopes. Unfortunately I can not find a DVD. Does anyone know if there is one?
