John Landis really excelled when he staged Michael Jackson's THRILLER as a short film. Of course it's crazy, the dialogue is awful and it all looks too cheesy, but it's still perfect. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date are in the cinema watching the latest horror movie. If it gets a little too vivid for the date, she leaves. Michael follows. On the way home, they decide to take a shortcut through the local cemetery. It starts there. <br /> <br /> The real thrill dance is incredible. It's full of those typical Jackson moves and some memorable zombie moves. It is neither rushed nor too long. The whole thing looks like a movie and is actually pretty scary. Of course it's one of the most famous music videos ever, and it's probably the best music video ever made. <br /> <br /> Overall: Take it seriously. These 13 minutes will be among the best ever screened. (5/5)
