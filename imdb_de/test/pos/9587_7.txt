Tiny Tweet and Sly, the Sneak, are locked up in cages to make a train ride, who knows where. Swinging Tweety starts an unbearable song as soon as the train leaves the station. Let's hope that Puddy Tad gets him this time. Sly tries a few funny hand tricks, but the sports director pampers the bird in a safer place in the luggage. The cat's next attempt ends up in the coal stove of the steam engine. And the hunt is on. Of course, there's a bulldog too, and stupid Sly just can not keep his mouth shut. <br /> <br /> Next, the stubborn pussy tries out the old stacking-of-the-suit bit (twice), which generates a win Tex Avery would be proud of. Unfortunately, this bulldog seems to be everywhere for New Year's Eve. He even shows a talent for changing the shape and making enormous rackets out of his trouser pocket. Not even Sylvester's ability to overtake a raging move can save him if he's thrown down several times in Silver Streak style. In Grandma's new place (Gower Gulch, 86-year-old population) reaches the last attempt of the cat cross-dressing. But you know what happens to men in clothes, they get more and more attention than they expected. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 points
