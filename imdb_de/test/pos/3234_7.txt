I think this movie version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is actually pretty good. It is certainly amusing. Well, it's not a masterpiece as PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ('95), but it's very good stuff ... especially the city of Bath !!! ..The royal crescent, the roman baths, the fascinating georgian atmosphere .. that is excellent. If you are a Bath fan like me, you will love this movie! The performances may sound a bit 'melodramatic', but I have the impression that this film, like the novel itself, purposely makes fun of the popular stories of romance and terror and the society of that time. The only drawback is probably the female lead, since I personally have a different idea of ​​Catherine Morland's physical appearance. The music is also something "unusual" .. but I find it strangely acceptable, although it has nothing to do with the historical historical period. I wonder what dear old Jane might think ... :)
