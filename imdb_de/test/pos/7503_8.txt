In this Paddy Chayefsky screenplay, George C. Scott gives his most beautiful and funniest drama. Diana Rigg is attractive and quite the complicated young woman. This film moves between tragedy and chaos in a New York hospital of the late 60s with amazing consequences. Barnard Hughes is as always sexy (also a great stage actor). <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10 points. Best Performance = George C. Scott. Chayesfsky was a big blow when he dropped Vanessa Redgrave at the Academy Awards in 1978, but he is a good writer. A true ensemble that works wonders down to the smallest part. This won the best screenplay at Oscars and Scott was nominated. Instead he should have won instead of PATTON last year (which he did brilliantly). Find out!
