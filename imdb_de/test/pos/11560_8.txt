Harvey Keitel, in one of his first leading roles as a pure, ambitious and uncompromising offspring producer, Coleman Buckmaster, delivers a first-class performance to boot a truly talented hot shot with a "golden ear" and the son of a famous jazz pianist Coleman is eager to bring along some tracks cut the group's smokin 'R & B outfit (none other than Earth, Wind & Fire in their breathtakingly funky prime), but his strictly commercial greedhead label A-Chord Records is led by a rousing, mob-connected center - the-road square Jerry (a real Unhip fan of Ed Nelson) wants him to record a hit single for the nasty, charred Carpenters-style pop-pap trio the Pages, a supposedly squeaky, clean bunch, the smarmy pedophile stepfather Franklin (a completely mean one) includes Bert Parks, the bitchy, neurotic daughter of velor (a fine, elusive turn of the self-assured, pretty brunette e Cynthia Bostwick) and the hedonistic smack-addicted son Gary (the former 50-year-old sitcom classic Jimmy Boyd). The extremely naive and idealistic Coleman needs to learn how the music business really works, and play the unobtrusive Dirty game as best he can, otherwise he loses both the group and his credibility. <br /> <br /> The haunting, corrosively tough and relentless biased script of syndicated columnist and rock journalist Robert Lipsyte, director Sig Shore (the most famous producer of "Superfly") shows a decidedly cynical and unflattering portrayal of the various Bribes, pay-offs, broken promises, and back stabs, duplicates, and double-negotiation that are an unpleasant, yet intrinsic, part of the largely corrupt rock music business, with particularly thought-out themed clues as to type vs. style. Commerce, the struggle to preserve artistic integrity and the recent urge to homogenize rock into bland, useless, creatively stagnant mainstream respectability. In addition, this earthy downbeat gemstone provides a rare intriguing, meticulously detailed and credible behind-the-scenes look at the shoot as cowboy cowboy Coleman struggles with his own words to "make chicken chicken salad". In chic parts, disc jockey and the legendary "fifth Beatle" Murray the K appear as laughing, leisurely DJ Big John Little (Velor bites his hand after Big John thighs during a live on-air interview!), New York Soul DJ and host of NBC's "Friday Night Videos" Frankie Crocker as his jazzy'n'jivin 'self, R & B singer-songwriter Doris Troy (she wrote the lovely "Just One Look") as church pianist and Tubby, bald-headed 70s blaxploitation Favorite Charles MacGregor as a priest at a wedding. The rather poor tone and sloppy cinematography of Allan Metzger unintentionally contribute to the rough, rough and rough documentary authenticity of the film. Although technically a bit deficient, this movie is still considered one of the greatest, most bitterly pessimistic behind the scenes of the 70s Rocksploitation gems.
