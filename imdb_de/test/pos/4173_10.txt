There are two ways to look at 'head'. Either it's a dazzling, dazzling music collage, old movie clips, psychedelia and TV sitcom comedy, or a devious, overbearing, confusing confusion. The truth is probably somewhere in between. It's also one of the best movies ever. <br /> <br /> "The Monkees" - Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Mike Nesmith - had just finished their hit series and wanted a movie. In collaboration with the writer Jack Nicholson and the director Bob Rafelson they made "Head". <br /> <br /> It begins with the opening ceremony of a bridge in San Francisco, where the Monkees Gate brings the process to a crash. Mickey jumps over the safety bars and crashes hundreds of feet into the water. Mermaids rescue him in the company of a great Jerry Goffin & Carole King composition called "The Porpoise Song" and images that make the Stargate finale of "2001" shabby in comparison. By now you have either turned off in confused disgust or are completely tied up. <br /> <br /> More bizarre events are taking place; Mickey uses a tank to destroy a Coca-Cola machine in the middle of the desert. the entire Italian army surrenders to him; the group is assigned to play the scales in Victor Mature's hair for a TV commercial; an overweight waitress insults the group and calls it "God's gift to the eight year olds"; a surprise party for Mike goes awry; The group is sucked into a vacuum cleaner, and in order to cover everything, they are evicted in a huge glass tank. <br /> <br /> You will either hate or love this. I found it a refreshing change from thoughtless pop musicals "Let's do the show here". The songs are good too; 'Daddy's Song' is excellently choreographed by Toni Basil (later he appears in Rafelson's Easy Rider) and offers wonderful editing. Davy's clothes change with lightning speed. "As We Go Along" is a beautiful Goffin & King number whose accompanying images contain a strong environmentalist message. <br /> <br /> Frank Zappa and Annette Funicello are just two guest stars who pop up. Did Victor Mature read the script before agreeing, one wonders? He is funny in it. <br /> <br /> So crazy that he has an ingenious spirit behind him, 'Head' is a little gem of the '60s, and it's always worth thinking about it. Too bad that at that time there was no audience. If only "Spiceworld" would have been like that!
