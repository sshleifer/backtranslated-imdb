I have not been in Istanbul for 10 years. During this time, I lived in London all the time. When I saw the movie, I realized how much I am an Istanbuler. I am not only from Turkey, I am a part of Turkey. One of my parts is Istanbul, the sound of the Istanbul, the people of Istanbul. Faith Akin probably believed that he made great musical documentaries, but I have to say it's more than that. It's about putting a nice mix of very different genres of music, cultures, approaches, politics and ethnicity into a tasty pot. .. <br /> <br /> As we all know, Turkey is just the place or western city. As one of the band members, Istanbul said it was a biocultural city. But much more an eastern city because we have always tried to be a western city. It shows that we have never been one. <br /> <br /> This movie will catch you from the first second. Music is excellent, people are fascinating. Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu. Singer, band members! It's nice to see you all in a small movie theater in Wood Green.
