My benchmark for measuring the watch capabilities of a movie is when I get windy. When I start to shift positions and notice that my ass is sore, the movie is too long. This movie was not nearly boring. Predictable in some parts for sure, but never boring. <br /> <br /> All other military branches had written love letters about them and saw their recruitment levels rise. Why not the Coast Guard? They are definitely undervalued until the day your boat sinks. <br /> <br /> The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect for the aging macho man who does not know when to stop. However, the performance of Ashton Kutcher impressed me the most. I've never liked him, never seen one of his TV shows and always thought he was immature ... well, punk. In this movie he does a great job! He is well on the way to becoming a leader. I think the movie we showed was a preliminary rough cut or something, because about 2/3 of the way the film supply got very grainy, the sound level dropped and microphones were everywhere. During the visit, there were also representatives of the film who were looking for feedback from the audience - especially the parts of the film that we do not like. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave concerns aa few lines at the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife, Sela Ward, pack up their things and take off their clothes. He says, "Maybe I should be the one to move out." And she answers, "No, you do not know where this house is located, I should be the one to go." That does not make sense: if she knows the layout so well, Costner is right, he should be the one who has to go.
