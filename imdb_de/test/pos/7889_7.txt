WARNING: Read this entry after watching the movie! Like "Easy Rider", which was released a year ago, "Joe" tries to illustrate what happens when the counterculture and the (even right-wing) mainstream America meet: there is a violent end. Although this film is primarily a slow portrayal of traditional American morality "old fashion" versus the "do-what-feel-good" lifestyle of the 1960s, it is also a commentary on upper-class vs. Sub-class class and their inability to meet in the middle as pictured when the Comptons hit the Currans. Boyle's Joe represents a generation that got stuck in the 1940s and 50s. "Kill a commie for mommy (or jap or hippie for that matter) is fine as long as it helps America and saves America." Joe and wife Mary Jo are clearly the archetypes for Archie Bunker and Dingbat, wife Edith. However, this film - forever known for its violent (but not bloody - blood is not seen at all) end, is inconsistent. Joe (literally) bombards the hippie generation (literally) with them to infiltrate their numbers to track down Compton's daughter - if he's clearly rejected by the idea, but renounces the separatist idea of ​​sex. If he is betrayed by theft (read: trust of the older generation in the newer generation), he proposes by an unyielding chain of murder. Perhaps it is thanks to the Tarantinos of Hollywood that the viewer expects the death of the bloodstream in the final scene, but the bloodless shootings crave for any kind of influence or realism. 'Joe' is not a great movie, but it's an interesting account of the class and cultural alienation and the animal extremes that underlie the generational gap.
