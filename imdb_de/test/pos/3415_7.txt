Red Dust is both well played and well done, but as far as the movie is concerned, I think many viewers will be bored as he did. There was a movie that used to be called "in my country" with Sam Jackson. He was not well received and both films were almost exactly the same. I think Red Dust was better off for the more interesting performances by future Oscar winner Chiwton Ejofor, but the plot is just too tight, it starts pretty strong, but then the movie hits the audience with countless uninteresting court sessions. This could have been a great movie if the writing was not missing. But see if for the performances.
