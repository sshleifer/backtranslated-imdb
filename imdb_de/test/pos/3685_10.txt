We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and unsurpassable. He was about to leave when he saw that and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy - and with some interference in the DVD, we finally had to switch to the widescreen version and then back to full screen to stop it. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was perfect for the role. And she can sing too! <br /> <br /> If only Hollywood learned from independent filmmakers! Maybe we would return to the real movies. But for now we stick to off-beat and really entertaining movies like these! Other examples we have enjoyed are: A box full of moonlight, April pieces, Milo deliver, The Celestine Prophecy. Most of Christopher Guest like: Best in Show, For Your Consideration, A Powerful Wind and Waiting for Guffman
