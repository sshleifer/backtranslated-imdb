I had heard about this film, but did not see it until my daughter, who had seen him on a flight to Australia, told me it was a great movie. I wanted to know if Rupert Grint, far from Harry Potter, shows the promise you see in the Potter films. I was not disappointed. He has become a good actor, showing a series of driving lessons, from a shy boy who is crushed by a cocky obsessive mother, to a young man who values ​​his own dignity and that of others. When he goes through the lines of plays and poetry with his aging actress, it is obvious that he is ready to take on much more complex roles in films and on stage. The jewel of this film, however, was Julie Walters. I had seen her before in the Potter films Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls and loved her. In Driving Lessons, writing lines of poetry and Shakespeare, I was impressed with her timing, her language skills, and her body language. I hope it was make-up / costuming because it represents an elderly woman with osteoporosis, though this is not mentioned in the movie. As a nurse, I can say that she did this perfectly and a woman portrayed the edge of age, but sticking to the glittering past in which she was having fun. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I wish I had seen it first in a theater - but I doubt I played it somewhere here in Albuquerque. We miss so many of these types of movies here.
