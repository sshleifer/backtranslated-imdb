This movie I remember was a great movie! I saw it on TV when I was 11 years old and could not remember the title. If I remember correctly, I think it's a Christmas TV movie special. One of my friends at work and I discussed it a few years ago, but none of us remembered the title. But we almost remembered the whole movie. No one else at work remembered having ever seen it! Thank god someone on a TV movie website answered my post! Now I have the fun to find a copy of it! It's amazing what you can remember as a kid, but this movie definitely plays vividly in my head ... even after 28 years. And I think I only saw it once. Maybe it was because I'm the eldest sister in my family, or maybe because I babysit and work in daycare, that it stayed with me for so long. Regardless of the real reason, it has remained one of the films that I have wanted to see lately !!! If anyone knows where to look online, or has a copy, please let me know. I would love to see it again !!!! Many Thanks! Seriously, I tried to post that and my comment is not long enough. Apparently I have to type more. Did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is the sister of Peter Billingsley, who starred in A Christmas Story? I know that I'm not the only fan of this movie. So if someone knows where to find it, I would be very grateful.
