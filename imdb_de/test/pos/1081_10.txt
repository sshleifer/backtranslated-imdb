Over the years, I seemed to have missed this image of Ronald Reagan, and when he recently came to the big screen in the sky, it was recently shown on television. This is a great low budget B & W movie of the late 1930s. However, it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal insurance companies with false claims during that particular period of time. I was surprised by the role played by Ronald Reagan, "The Killer's, '64", along with veteran big-screen star Sheila Bromley (Nona Gregg), "Nightmare Circus," '73. The great supporting actor was a great movie showing Ronald Reagan as a very young man of his career in Hollywood at the time: God Bless HIM!
