The director loves the actress and that shows. The actress lives in the figure we love at first sight and sound. The character loves her jealous, inconspicuous husband and he loves her. His childhood friend loves his wife secretly and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes love tragic and ironic. His wife is jealous of his childhood friend and believes that her attention is a secret love for her husband. Then there is a murder and the investigating police lieutenant who only loves his son. It is annoying that the above persons, who had unpleasant contact with the deceased and all lie to some extent, have taken his company out of the company /> <br /> And then there's the atmosphere of post-war Paris, where there's a shortage of coal, music filled with erotic longing and wistful memory, and innocence washed away by the rain for a long time. All in a milieu of wizards, their tricks not always work, dogs running on hind legs and expressing music criticism, hungry news reporters and exhausted police officers. <br /> <br /> And then there are many of the best actors of their generation who have had some very bad experiences. The director was led by a man who fell in love with his lead actress and was rightly a respected friend of Picasso's. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie many times and I love them all and it.
