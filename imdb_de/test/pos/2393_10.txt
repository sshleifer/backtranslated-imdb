I attended the screening of Eddie Monroe on September 30 and was pleasantly surprised by the story, the great acting and the talented directing. I could hardly believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by Vario (Uncle Benny), Sara (Jessica Tsunis) and Morris (Eddie Monroe). The minor cast was full of colorful and amusing characters. This movie reminds me of one of those films you'll look back on in 20 years, and you'll find that he has retired many actors. Similar to "The Outsiders", where Tom Cruise, Emilio Estavez, Patrick Swazey, Ralph Macchio and others can be found. Take a look at Hollywood, there are new stars on the horizon and you can be spotted in a small independent movie titled "Eddie Monroe". Well done!
