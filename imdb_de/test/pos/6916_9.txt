I really enjoyed this movie made for the TV movie. I surfed on channels and came across the start of the movie. Boy, I am glad that I stopped. This movie has a real hot cast as well as a semi-credible storyline. There is drama, comedy, action and, best of all, the human aspect of this movie makes it great. I hope it comes out on video, because I will buy a copy. Rating ... 9 out of 10 stars
