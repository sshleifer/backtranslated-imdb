"Saturday Afternoon" is one of Harry Langdon's best-known short themes, and with good reason. It's one of his funniest and best movies. The act - as it is - is an old staple: a husband with chicken luggage sneaks out with his buddy and a few other girls for one night. It's a solid and well-rehearsed comedy act, but the difference here is Harry Langdon. His slow, ineffective, confused, innocent character has somehow crept into a marriage with a woman who feels he has to be governed with an iron fist, of course, and he only has to cheat on her because he can not say it. " No "to the admonitions of the chummy Vernon Dent and the girl's cute eyelash fluttering. <br /> <br /> It's a very adult problem to find such a helpless, childlike character. Harry does not want to cheat, but he can not help it. In a wonderful comic book business, he can not bring himself to kiss the new girlfriend. He shoves the kiss on her lower hand and wipes his hand ashamed as if he were chastising him. The film is a three-reel comedy, ten minutes longer than the two reels in which Harry Langdon had previously starred for Mack Sennett, without further action. Maybe it was even designed as a two-reel machine. This works wonderfully, because it gives him as much time as he needs to bring in slow reactions and confused insights and semi-storylines in which so much of his comedy lives. <br /> <br /> He's in good shape here and the show is really Harry Langdon's curious magic and ability to make almost no comedy. His small half smile, his gaze as he handles the money he has hidden under the carpet, childish attempts to fight in the end. I think his comedy makes us realize something fundamentally innocent and confused in us that makes us feel that the whole world is too much for us, but at the same time allowing ourselves to understand what Harry is not doing (like the fact that the women, whom he kindly brings to his friend to cheer him on, after he thinks that the date is indeed whores, he forces his, with a little sadness, to realize that we are no longer so His comedy is just as capable of audibly telling us "Awwww" how she often makes us laugh. <br /> <br /> Here, Harry wants to refuse to cheat on his wife, he wants to tell his wife whose boss and some power in his relationship back, he wants to fight against the two violent men in the end the movie, but he can not influence his environment so much, and sometimes we all feel so. <br /> <br /> The movie is perfectly done by director Harry Edwards, director of Langdon, directed. It moves at a fast pace and never stops, while at the same time, it's time for Harry Langdon's still-reactive comedy to showcase best. Vernon Dent, a frequent film for Langdon, plays one of the roles in which he almost becomes a comedy partner because he works very effectively with Harry. The gags are distributed to maximize effect, and Harry ends up with his own version of a Lloyd or Keaton stunt. Here the comedy is not in Harry's great response to the danger of sitting between two moving cars, but in his slowness to pick them up. <br /> <br /> This is a funny film and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique and talented humorists that I know have ever existed.
