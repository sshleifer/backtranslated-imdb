Better than it could be, this film died quickly and painfully at the American box office. Jekyll and Hyde, sometimes sophomoric, biting satirical and witty, are usually just a near-perfect reflection of time, full of drugs and sexual humor, and they each remember everything or everything Woody Allen of "Everything You" I always wanted know something about sex "to the Mel Brooks from" The Producers ", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong. Look at this, listen carefully as some of the jokes go by very quickly and remind you at a time when comedy was offensively funny.
