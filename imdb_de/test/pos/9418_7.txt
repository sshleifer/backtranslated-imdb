I saw two very different Holmes adventures this morning, but you would be surprised at the similarities. <br /> <br /> This was probably the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone (If I'm King, Romeo and Juliet) and Nigel Bruce, and director Roy William Neill. It was not the first Sherlock Holmes adventure, as it was a few years ago. <br/> <br/> That made an excellent team, but I prefer the Hammer version that I will talk about later. <br /> <br /> Holmes relies on many disguises in his work, and I am always amused about the manners that are shown when they find out something. They always seem to keep jumping when they find a new clue. <br /> <br /> The story of keeping a bomber from the Germans during World War II was interesting and focused on the puzzle.
