Unlike some previous commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Be honest, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. However, I believe the film has done a good, not terrific job of portraying Karen's life. The film was good on TV, but the content was a bit too short. I suggest you all look for some Carpenters specials shown in the '70s. You can not believe how great a drummer Karen was. Cynthia has not grasped the extent of Karen's talent. Karen was also nice, but had a bad barber. My choice for Karen is Hilary Swank. I would like to see a more factual story, because Karen had more to offer than to hear at first glance, when we just started with We. I have tons of unpublished Carpenters music, and she's absolutely outstanding. (Her singing from California Dreamin is a dream).
