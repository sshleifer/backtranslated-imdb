Fame is one of the best movies I've seen about The Performing Arts. The music and the acting are excellent. The script and the set design are also excellent. My favorite part is when all students dance and make music in the canteen. I can watch this movie as often as I want and never gets bored. I give it 8 1/2 to 10.
