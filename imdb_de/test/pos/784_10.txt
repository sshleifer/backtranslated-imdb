I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and I have to say that I loved it. The combination of humor and sincerity really paid off the movie. The film was about a 17-year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. Seventeen year old Ben decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls, driving and life. It is very funny and touching. I have to honestly say that it is now one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to everyone. If you have not seen any of the shows at the film festival, it will be released later this year. Please have a look! It's a great movie.
