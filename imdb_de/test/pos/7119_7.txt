I am really impressed. I expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing else. <br /> <br /> OK, there's a lot of pretty geeky humor. But the movie is so well done. Acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue, while the gamer is sometimes cheesy, I think, to respond to the gamer crowd is not bad at all. Sometimes it's even great, I dare say. <br /> <br /> If the player who built this non-traditional fighter character is more likely to get the usual (min / max) types, all these additional attacks will be (apparently correct), I did not check the rules, it was cool. <br /> <br /> The sets are amazing for a relatively low production movie. <br /> <br /> The story is moving right. The transitions from the game world to the real world are well done. A man playing a female character is sometimes played by a woman and sometimes by himself. Pretty smart, I thought. <br /> <br /> The man who decided to play a woman forgot over and over again that he was female was good for a lot of laughs. He even said once a day, and the female kept going to play the role (sorry, I did not look up her name, but she did great). The guy who's always trying to "get something" got a bit boring but I think that was more gamer humor. <br /> <br /> There was just so much fun in the movie. Carefree fun! Very well done, and I say that as a movie fan, not as a gamer (and I'm not a D & D player.) As I said, I expected so much less. <br /> <br /> Films often do not hold my eyes Attention, in the end I listen to them while I work on my computer. He kept my attention. I can not praise a movie much higher.
