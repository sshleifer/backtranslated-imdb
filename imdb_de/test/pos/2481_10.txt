Imprisoned in a jail in California in an indefinite future, an English film crew conquers lawsuits while young students and political dissidents are tried under the fictitious Insurrection Act, which allows the United States government to protect civil rights for its own citizens In case of need, suspend cases without the right to deposit or the need for evidence. In such cases, the government has the power to arrest and arrest any person who it believes is involved in future sabotage activities. The trial group consists of a feminist, a black panther and a folk singer. Those convicted by the Conservative Tribunal can choose between a longer prison term or three days in Punishment Park, where they can gain their freedom by reaching an American flag in the desert. You have to do this without food or water. They are also being pursued by armed National Guards and police, who can bring them back to the camp if they are taken prisoner, to impose the sentence awarded to each convicted person. The reality is different. Those who choose Punishment Park are hunted and killed or brutalized, with no hope of gaining their freedom after a police officer is found dead in the park. The park appears to be a training ground for the police and guards, who must master these acts of oppression so that they can be used in open American society. Recorded on 16mm and in documentary style by Watkins, in his famous Culloden and the controversial The War Game for the BBC; He interacts with the prisoners and guards and watches the unconstitutional trial. Between them they form an absolutely convincing political film that is still vital and relevant. With his knowledge of the medium, Watkins has produced a driving, unyielding, and ultimately scary film presentation of a fictional American political detention camp that would not convince without its flawless construction. Many of the actors are amateurs who improvise with broad characters. The sparks fly in the process scenes in which each case is heard, in part because Watkins kept the people in court until the scenes were shot by the jury. Watkins also claims that the actors often express their own opinions, which certainly explains the ferocity and credibility of their performances. The film has been heavily criticized for polarizing the opinions of those who see it. It has been claimed that the film is reactionary and unambiguously demonstrates that conservatism and war are at the root of America's social problems. While this critique may be valid, it is important to remember that the film works on a fictional, metaphorical level, and perhaps it is the realism that the film constructs so skillfully that it encourages such a heated view of its content. In fact, the main theme of the film is the problem of polarization. The "conservative" judges and brutal judicial officials are on the one hand and the "liberal" convicts on the other, without concessions being made on both sides. This really seems to be the movie. The new law and the park itself are the result of a situation in which mediation between the two political positions has been lost. <br /> <br /> During and in protest against the Vietnam War and the treatment of those who rejected the war made in America, the main themes of the film on the persecution of their own citizens by the government and the acting on civil liberties conservatism at the time of the Patriot Act and identity card, the same way. It is also a disturbing chord with news from Guantanamo Bay and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners by Allied forces. <br /> <br /> The threat of internal "terrorism" is so volatile that the film can not fail to connect with the current settings on the subject. Not surprisingly, the film has a turbulent history of distribution and its content has put it to extremes, but the disquieting fact that this film may still be so relevant today indicates that the wait was not in vain. Punishment Park is a movie that had to fight to be seen everywhere, and it requires your attention.
