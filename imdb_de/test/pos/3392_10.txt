Even for a 17-year-old student who loves history and caught a glimpse of emotion and excitement in his childhood years in this series, his DVD release was a blessing for all time. North and South is really a series about friendship, love, honor ... you name your own list of feelings that you get when looking at this series. I remember the first time I watched this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I think that looks exciting. Too bad, I never had the chance to see the first and second books on television in the Netherlands. When the third book was aired in the summer of 2004 as a late night series in the Netherlands, I just knew that I had to see the other two series. For most people, the third book was a big disappointment, as far as I know. Well, since I've seen the first book on DVD, I have to say it's the best of the three books so far. For all the kids watching the awesome movies like The Patriot "Oh America for Freedom," there's a more realistic view for them .....
