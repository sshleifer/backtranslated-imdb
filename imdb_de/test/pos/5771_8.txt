This tour of Knotts includes one of his best sidekicks, Frank Welker. Welker makes the movie. Knotts and Welkers fight for laughter and both get a lot. Knotts works for a small "no-where" city, where the city is run by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong, the city fathers allow Knotts to take the case. Frank Welker's character befriends Knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the confusion and good name of Knott. This film shows the usual Knott's fears of death, which have made him famous on television and in the film for years. This was possibly the last good trip from Knotts. If you have another 90 minutes you will get an old fashioned laugh, a great icon, Don Knott.
