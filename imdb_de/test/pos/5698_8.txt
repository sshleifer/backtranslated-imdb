I vowed that I would never allow myself to devote myself to the fake authorities of the sixties, who told me that things were better in the "good old days". The current Australian Prime Minister is a dirty example of such thinking. <br /> <br /> But I switched to "A Decade Under the Influence" because I have the much-lauded "sneakers" documentary on the other channel such a daunting experience. I found the values ​​expressed by the "sneakers" to be too ugly. So materialistic! So free of any indignation about a society that can kill it, kill someone to steal its very ugly shoes! Thus, it lacked a meaningful purpose, that they did not despise the exploitation of an audience by urging them to keep those shoes over their heads, to conclude a sponsorship deal with a cobbler company, it was just too much to continue to be able to watch. <Br /> <br /> "A Decade Under the Influence" was a totally different reaction to the fruits of stupidity, corruption and concupiscence in high (and low) places. <br /> <br /> I have the change noticed in the movie. As a result, America's catastrophic foreign policy debacle in Vietnam was uncovered, and my website, www.peterhenderson.com.au, featured many less reported places. "A Decade Under the Influence" documents the exact time this change took place. Prior to the 1970s, American forces portrayed the armed forces as an invincible fighting force made up of decent people conquering transformed heroes on the battlefield. After the 1970s, they are generally portrayed as a discouraged mob led astray by a bunch of bureaucratic clowns in the Pentagon. Before the 1970s, the FBI agent and the honest policeman were portrayed as your friend and protector. After the 1970s, the FBI agents were all incompetent, and the best thing a policeman could do was ignore their stupidity and the corruptibility of his supervisor and maintain justice in his own idiosyncratic manner. Before the 1970s, this was the archetypical American "little guy," the "average Joe," the Jimmy Stewart guy, would face up to the problems encountered, thereby gaining insight into the underlying wisdom of his elected leaders and the justice of the American Way "win. Kevin Costner takes over the role after the 1970s, but now he is the voice of a man who cries out in the wild for evil or takes his fate and makes the best he can. <br /> <br /> And this way of thinking of the "old religion" has now been deprived of all honesty and righteousness and portrayed (with some justification) as pious bigotry and selfish hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> "A decade under the influence" says it like it was. "A decade under the influence," it says, as if it were now. It shows the redemption of the American film industry from the hands of artistically, morally and intellectually bankrupt studio moguls. It shows the storming of the Hollywood Bastille by the independent filmmakers, who promised to bring a disillusioned and weary audience back into cinemas. The fact that their mistakes were numerous and at times catastrophic only emphasizes the magnitude of their achievements. A performance that is reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitude of big box office like Clooney, Daman, Affleck, etc., and the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent.
