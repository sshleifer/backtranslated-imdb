Forget about all the sappy-romantic films that contain notebooks and lip-locked couples who somehow manage to get together for a screen life of overly simplified, unrealistic romance together to the Great Afterlife. Forget all those shameless "dogs give their lives to save their family" (though I have to admit that I have a soft spot for them myself). Forget that Ricky Schroeder at a tender age (now shamelessly!) Has shown his tendency to exaggerate. <br /> <br /> This TV movie, which unfortunately never seems to be broadcast again, is the eternal champion of tearjackets, hands down. And a well-written and well-made story. Ann-Margret had a great opportunity to take on this role. Nothing flamboyant or sexy about her, and that's a monumental achievement in itself. Based on a true story, she plays Lucile Fray, a terminally ill mother who struggles to find a good home for her ten children until her last breath, rather than leaving her to unpredictable government agencies. Frederic Forrest does a great job as her husband, the good-natured but unreliable breadwinner who can no longer look after the children because of his crippling arthritis and personal demons. <br /> <br /> The film takes us through Lucile's heartrending process of interviewing potential parents and then watching her children leave home. It also gives us the perspective of the children themselves and the father - who is frustrated by the tragedy now taking place and the one who will surely follow, and the frustration with his inability to do more. The scene where the youngest of the children (Steven) is brought to his new home is the most heartbreaking one I've ever seen. Now I've grown up as a "hopeless romantic" and have built up the many years since, a harder, more cynical shell. Usually I find more ridicule than empathy in the sentimental film trip imposed on us today. But this gem from the early eighties still beats me. <br /> <br /> I really want someone with a marketing appetite to release a DVD version of this drama. Special features include the Emmy Awards broadcast the following year. A-M was nominated for this role, but the award for best dramatic actress went to Barbara Stanwyck for "Thorn Birds". Stanwyck burst into tears during her acceptance speech and blurted, "Ann-Margret, I love you!", Which brought Ann-M to tears. <br /> <br /> One final note. The IMDb rating for "Who Will Love My Children" is 6.4. However, over 75% of ratings are in the range of 8-10 (mostly 10). What type of handicapping system this website uses to change the overall rating of the movies listed by IMDb is completely missing the mark on this site. This is the "lament" of all time and a damn good TV movie.
