OK, yes, it's bad, yes, its all down, yes, it makes the mule dubbin like an Oscar winner, but look at it like I'm 13 years old, special effects were pretty much non-existent in 90% of the movies, back in the Good Times Old times when movies needed a story ... OK, so the story is a bit dubious. But wow, I came into this movie as a kid in the 80s. cheesy rock, bad special effects, but airplanes a dogfight and it had queens a vision on the soundtrack. See for yourself the worst things have a silver lining .. All in all, if you want a bad movie to show a 12 year old who hates computer effects (if there is such a movie) this is the ideal choice
