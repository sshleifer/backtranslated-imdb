This is not a walk in the park. I saw it when it came out and did not have the guts to see it again. You will never see a terrifyingly devastating or depressing movie. I felt as if I had been beaten severely. What kind of world do we live in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? This is our world, what we have created, what we let happen. And I would like to say that I-ME-WE is not responsible. Babenco made this movie to wake us up, to shake us to the core, and he succeeded. How can we be cruel or selfish or neglect our children when we see the graphic results of such behavior? He shows us all a charge for doing so to the lowest and least powerful in our society. And if you do not do something every day to prevent it, then you are part of the problem. I'm NOT a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think about the condition of my soul.
