Okay, Ghoulies 4 is kind of bad. And not even the ghoulies are there. And the spectacle is bad. The plot is stupid. I forget to mention how funny this movie is. It's so squeamish and so ridiculous that it's too funny not to enjoy it. There are only 2 ghoulies in the movie and they do not really seem to relate to the ghoulies of the other movie. But they are pretty funny. And a funny thing that Jonathon Graves is coming back for. When you saw the first one, he was a figure in it. This is better than the first in my opinion. There are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one of them in a grocery store. "Attention K-Mart Shopper!" Take a look at this, if you enjoy bad movies. It is so bad that it is good. And did I mention that Barbara Alyn Woods is hot?
