There are so many episodes that make me howl over the stories, and I wish I could pick the best ones. Rocko and Bill form a weird couple who can not help but manage to play the victim and the BS Their way out of the hard times just to pull Dan into their crime lives. <br /> <br /> Canadians will notice the weird joke for Toronto or the federal government, and because the CBC has done a really good show of the Frantics Dan was part of the show, the show shoots at them and in the episode "Dan's Umbrella "The CBC is raked over the coals. <br /> <br /> When Dan says the CBC taxpayer money would never waste money on a useless venture, Rocko enters the room and returns Dan his tape of Friday night with Ralph Benmurgue. This show was a flop and most people would not understand the joke if they did not know the history of the CBC because they do shows, people do not watch or bully good shows that they see.
