Entry from Europe via Czech fighter pilots, who fly for the RAF during World War II. As an American, it is always interesting to see a new position on known events in history. The style in which this is filmed, or the romantic triangle of love that anchors the narrative, has nothing terrible or revolutionary about it. Nevertheless, it is convincing all the way. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action and symbolism that is underestimated by the director and the performers. This is a breath of fresh air after sitting through overblown and boring Hollywood epics like Pearl Harbor. All around a solid production. This is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema.
