VHS - I have looked at this over and over again and loved every minute so much that I have now ordered the DVD. I just wish the movie could have lasted longer. I never worry about what other people mean, I prefer to think about my own thoughts and disagree with the negative comments, and I will not let others destroy my enjoyment of the movie. Decide yourself and do not let others put you off! I have all Jane Austen's BBC series, but this is my favorite. I see that there will be a NEW Northanger Abbey, which was released in 2007 and which I will buy when it comes out, but it will not stop me from seeing Northanger Abbey in the '80s.
