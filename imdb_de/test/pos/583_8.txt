I first saw this movie as a teenager when it first appeared in theaters a long time ago. When I saw it again almost 30 years later, I was surprised how well it lasted. The gags are still funny, the interaction between the characters works great and the cameos look better than ever. (Steve Martin's must be the best.) <br /> <br /> My children (9, 11, and 14) all loved it a lot, and the music is good enough to make them sing the tunes many days later. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that you watch at least half a dozen episodes of the Muppet Show before you watch the movie to get a feel for the background story behind the characters, otherwise the movie won. It makes so much sense.
