As a Bills fan, I was initially annoyed that they made a movie about the Bills and the loss of four Superbowls. But as soon as I started to look, I really felt connected. It was really nice to see how the "Bills" won the Superbowl, and I have to say that it was indeed done very well for a TV movie. Gil Bellows as QB and Jon Voight as coach of the old school have done a very good job. 8 out of 10
