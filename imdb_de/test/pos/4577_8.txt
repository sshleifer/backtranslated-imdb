This movie deserves better. Mike Judge's satirical joke, which has brought to light something in this country, tries to dispute that we as a society are stupid. <br /> <br /> Could the 24-hour Anna Nicole coverage be proof? Mike Judge paints a terrifying future in which the fools survive and thrive. Lets stop you and think and laugh. Can you look at the world and not ask if we're going to be more stupid? Are we overtaking both human waste and our own waste? (Beware of landslides). <br /> <br /> The movie is really funny. I would tell you more about the plot, but I do not want to spoil it. <br /> <br /> So why publish this movie with the ZERO promotion? Could it be that the fools are already taking control?
