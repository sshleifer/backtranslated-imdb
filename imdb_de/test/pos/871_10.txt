The film is a joy, not only for the action, which is gripping, but also for the outstanding performances of the actors Deneuve and Belmondo. Although it was considered a "flop" on its first release, it has become a major success, and it's clear why. Deneuve's acting style was perfect for the movie. She always gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something, and her character is in this movie. I will not spoil it with the washing, although it is revealed quite early. Belmondo is adorable as the rather young but in love tobacco dealer. I would recommend this movie to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. It's a brilliant Hitchcockian thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that evolve with the movie. The movie lasts about 2 hours and you feel that you have not been sold too short. Deneuve steals the show in this movie, and it is clear that Truffaut was very much in love with her at the time the movie was made. An absolute must for every movie viewer or movie. 10/10
