Commissaire Mattei (André Bourvil) is a single with a small gun that loves cats and his boss in the Paris police is a philosopher who knows that sooner or later the police will become guilty. That's what the movie is about. And a jewel robbery in Vendome. Corey (Delon) brings the plan out of jail, Bird (Volonté) joins him and helps him against two tough guys who are after him because he has taken mafioso Ricos (Andre Eycan) money while Rico is already Corey's girlfriend and left him alone in prison for five years. Corey and Bird find a third man, Jansen (Montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand-made ammunition into a hole. A perfect plan and a good cooperation, but they have to sell the loot, and Mattei has the role of a buyer in disguise. The circle closes. To help each other, they are shot by the cat who loves Mattei and his little gun. <br/> <br/> Melville took 20 years to make a robbery film after receiving no order for RIFFIFI. Melville wrote the script and filmed in southern France and in Paris from earlier. The great Henri Decae is, as always, the light cameraman. It is the penultimate picture of Melville, who died in 1972 after another film with Delon. <br /> <br /> Melville wanted Belmondo instead of Volonté, he did not like this Italian at all, but Volonté Bird is not an excellent refugee and offers the most compelling performance besides Bourvil. But watch out: Melville notes that Volonté is an instinctive actor, a strange character who is very tiring and absolutely impossible on a French set. Melville did not like him at all and never wanted to work with him again. Melville is wrong. Volonté give the liveliest character in the nowhere of not so many interesting characters. In the winter of '70 you can see what he feels chased by Mattei and his small dangerous weapon and all the dogs of France. A wild actor. Even André Bourvil, who died shortly before his time filming He was also not a first choice, but definitely a great replacement. He carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the movie and in the end has the chance to plead guilty again. Jansen entered the jewelry store at night with a rifle and a tripod, but ultimately risked a successful shot freehand. When he meets Delon for the first time, we already know that the elegant Jansen has a serious alcohol problem. After the robbery, Montand refrains from taking his share of the loot and mentions Delon, who looks up to him, that he has only come into the red circle, because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon does not understand what he means. The audience remembers seeing Montand in a great scene in his haunted house fighting helpless nightmare creatures who came out of the closet and attacked him. At that time a very rare scene, you remember a long time afterwards. I bet it was so hard to arrange and direct the stuff at a time when nobody could imagine the coming days of digital filmmaking. Great artwork when art was made by hand. <br /> <br /> We'll certainly remember a crew like the actors, but after 33 years, it also seems to be the less popular of the six Melville thrillers. What's wrong with it? I'm afraid you're not interested in these three actors (who show three criminals) and their police hunter. We learn too little about Corey and his deadly 5 years from his beautiful wife (Anna Douking). Montand is still a good sniper, but what made him a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe. Delon looks like he's in an earlier adventure of the Samourai, Volonté is the man in the trunk of Delon's American car that moves excellently and Mattei is a gay sight, a great actor on the verge of his life. But how could he ever doubt that everyone is guilty? In an interview, Melville says there is no woman in the movie. Not in the very red circle, but I still remember the beautiful, good-looking Mrs. Anna Douking (without future career). We are in the 70s. In fact, a woman rises from the bed of an old mafioso who is wearing nothing, and slowly walks to the door to hear the voice of her old lover Delon. Bardot did something like that ten years ago. This time, Melville directed. Well done. <br /> <br /> The RED CERCLE has certainly added some, but not many, sparkling jewels to film history. The robbery on Place Vendome and Montands is awe-inspiring as the deniers of the wardrobe and Volonté Bouvil escape in white underwear and cautiously carry their pants over a stream. That's not enough for a great gangster and robbery movie. But the 110 minutes never bore you and it's a high level game. And there are probably some secrets that you will experience when you watch the movie again and again. None of the secrets is that we are all guilty, and the late Francois Perier is also introduced. <br /> <br /> Michael Zabel
