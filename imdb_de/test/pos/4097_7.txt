I really loved this movie and tried to get it for several years. It's simply not available and has not been shown on television for many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something else to say, and you thought about how each person views things from different perspectives. Often we do not value something we have until it is no longer there. <br /> <br /> My 12 year old daughter just discovers the music and loves some songs. One day I hope to get a copy of the film so she has the opportunity to watch the movie. (Oh, I would like to see it again!) <br /> <br />
