Much better than is generally acknowledged, this version of "Lost Horizon" not only had great music and beautiful scenery, but also some stunning mountain scenery. Several years ago, a special laser edition was released that added more than 30 minutes of previously deleted footage, additional music, and lots of bonus material. So why not on DVD? Sometimes difficult to find the studios. Surely the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in a movie, good acting or melodious pipes? The song and dance man Bobby Van is great fun, Michael York is a suitably tragic villain, and seeing Sir John Gielgud, dressed as Chang, sounds stupid, but sounds great on screen. Trust me, you have to watch this movie - if you can find it!
