I saw the movie when it was released in the movies, then I saw the VHS tape over the years, and as I strolled through Target, I saw this DVD with "Pushing Tin" for the exorbitant sum of $ 5.50. <br /> <br /> There's something about this comedy that has really clicked on me - like Kelsey Grammar, "with a tattoo on his thing," an unorthodox commander, a rusty diesel submarine, and a Crew of screwballs and outside lands. He's dealing with the best in the Navy - a Los Angeles-class nuclear attack - and his old captain (Wm Macy). Bruce Dern plays the villain, Rip Torn the admiral who does the exercise - If you do that I do not have to laugh hysterically while the cook is running with the cook. Well, you have a different kind of humor than me. <br /> <br /> Toward the end, the machinist says "DBF". without explanation - apparently some insider knowledge was obtained from an old submarine adviser - thanks to Google I learned that with the advent of nuclear submarines the old salts would carry "DBF" pins - Diesel Boats Forever. <br /> <br /> A Navy friend said that many technical aspects are not correct, but who cares? It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not know I think it takes a clairvoyant to know who will win in this exercise!
