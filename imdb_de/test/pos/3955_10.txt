I have recently seen blind spot in Coyoacan, where it attracted a large amount of audience and some pretty intensive discussions led. I really admired the story and the visual approach. The action is frightening and the loneliness that projected the film is amazing. The melancholy that surrounds these three inappropriate heroes has a lot of beauty. Not only in the desert, but also in the city. My best scene was when the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable city lights. You really feel for this guy. I have never heard of the actors, but I liked all three very much. I think they did a great job on their journey to find themselves. All in all, this is a surprisingly cool and exciting thrilling movie. I still have many pictures in my head.
