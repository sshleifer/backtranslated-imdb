IMDb forces reviewers to enter a certain number of lines, but I really just want to say, "This is an incredible movie, and you can not call yourself a movie fan without seeing it." You should just trust me on this point and stop reading this review and get the movie and push play. But I have to enter something. So let me say: <br /> <br /> (1) River's Edge contains something Crispin Glover's always funniest and best in a movie, and if you followed Crispin Glover, you know that alone already a 10. Funny line justifies. (2) River's Edge contains the second most noticeable performance of Dennis Hopper's career (except in Blue Velvet) and it's really excellent. Dennis Hopper is really funny. <br /> <br /> (3) River's Edge contains the best of Keanu Reeves' career and is excellent. It was the role in which he was born. He has a lot of good lines but especially one is really funny. Listen carefully when his character and stepfather talk to each other. <br /> <br /> Still the best Stoner movie, it's much more than that. It tends to be found in the drama areas of movie rentals, but if it's a drama, it's the funniest drama any times.
