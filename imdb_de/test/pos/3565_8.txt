George Hilton never really tugs me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood, but that's a great trip for him. Basically rippin the Django / man with No Name and do damn good work. The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the following Cat & Mouse games are a pleasure to see. Fans of the genre will be in heaven.
