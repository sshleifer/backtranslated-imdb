I've seen this series on PBS in college in 1980 and still can not get it out of my head even though I have not seen it since. I remember every actor (the cast was perfect, as mentioned in other comments), the design, the lighting, and of course, the story just enough to keep you on the set. Probably the best TV series I've ever seen, next to the original "Roots".
