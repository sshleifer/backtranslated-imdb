This movie is just incredible. Unfortunately, he is not even a shadow of him in Portugal ... and I agree with an earlier opinion, only FF fans will really give the film credit ... but for the rest ... I dare to see it The story is great, and I thought the game ended the story, but the scriptwriters gave us a great story for the God of all RPGs ... that came out of the sky as usual;) eh, but the little details, they gave us (us fans of the game) are beautiful .. like the ringtone is the battle winner song of the game, and even some moves are pretty familiar, only to see it's a great story, great animation .. just a 10/10
