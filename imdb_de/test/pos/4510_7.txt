In 2000, after the death of Baba, Amir is a famous writer and receives a phone call from Rahim Khan Terminal, which reveals secrets about his family and forces Amir to return to Peshawar in Pakistan on a journey of salvation /> <br /> I am not familiar with the Afghan culture and have not read this novel despite my daughter's recommendation. Yesterday I decided to watch this movie on DVD. I found a good story about loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and salvation, with a glimpse into Afghanistan's recent history, from a peaceful time in the 1970s to the days of the Taliban. The actors and actresses have great accomplishments that lend credibility to realistic history. The dry locations in China are reminiscent of the images we see on television from Afghanistan. In the end I found "The Kite Runner" a good movie. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ca√ßador de Pipa" ("The Kite Chaser")
