The man with a golden arm was one of three great movies from the same period about drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain. But I think that's the best of the three. <br /> <br /> If Otto Preminger had shot the thing instead of the obvious studio sets in real Chicago, the movie might have been even better. Who knows, maybe Preminger did not get enough money to pay for the location. It's the only mistake I find in the movie. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is a heroin addict card trader who went bankrupt because of his cover for his boss Robert Strauss when the game was looted. He took the cure in prison and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. But a lot of people conspire against him. First of all, Bob Strauss, who wants him to do business again, mostly because there are some heavyweight players in town. He uses some methods to get back Sinatra's services. Secondly, Darren McGavin is the local dope retailer who wants to rekindle Sinatra as a good customer. And last but not least, Eleanor Parker, his wife, who works stubbornly to defeat everything, just to keep him around. Frank Sinatra received a Best Actor nomination for the film, but lost to Marty to Ernest Borgnine. Sinatra might have won for this film if he did not win in the "Supporting Actor" category for From Here to Eternity a few years ago, and that Marty was such a celebrated film this year. His scenes, which are retreating into Kim Novak's apartment, will leave you shaken. Eleanor Parker does not get enough credit for her role. She really is something of a crazy woman that Sinatra has tied to herself, no matter how expensive she is. If she had not been nominated for Interrupted Melody in the same year, she might have been nominated for it. 1955 marked the peak of her career. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin received his first real publicity as a very serpentine drug trafficker. His performance is guaranteed to make your meat crawl. <br /> <br /> Elmer Bernstein added a great jazz touch to highlight the general drowsiness of the bleak Chicago neighborhood where the characters live, your family.
