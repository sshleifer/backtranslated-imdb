An obsessive love story in which the characters were extremely compelling. I think this movie highlights the talent of professional actors. Especially for Vincent Cassel, who (at the time he was filmed) was not the first character for such a role. And yes, he has managed to seduce the beautiful Monica Belluci beyond the film during this creation. All I can say is that this movie should have been released in the US instead of thinking of a remake. It's just so french, almost perverted ... and yet so true ... this movie should be left untouched right amount of ingredients, so as not to flop it ..
