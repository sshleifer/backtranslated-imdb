Garlin did a great job. Nice concept, well executed and tight produced. Came like a very sincere story. As a fan of "Curb Your Enthusiasm", where Jeff was pretty much the role of the straight, I was delighted with how much depth he contributed to this role in a simple yet effective manner. The humor was unobtrusive and subtle and supported itself the dignity that I really liked rather than slapstick or exaggerated. And there were some nice little surprises and twists. The convenience store vignettes were a pleasure. <br /> <br /> When I say that this is a wonderful "little" movie, I do not mean budget or quality. It is simple, intimate and handmade. It tells a highly credible everyday story. Relax and have a look. Let it wash over you and you will feel good about it.
