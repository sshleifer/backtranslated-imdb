I saw this on HBO because it won the Oscars a week ago. It is comparable to fictional drama in the courtroom. The story is about a 15-year-old black kid who was brought to justice for the murder of Jacksonville, Florida. The murder of an elderly white woman was based almost exclusively on the identification of the victim's husband and a confession against which the defense must defend itself. <br /> <br /> About half of the footage relates to the process. It is supplemented by footage of the defenders (two defense attorneys) who explain their case, interview witnesses and visit important places. This is handled with a minimum of unnecessary repetition and arranged in logical order. The camera work is pretty solid. And there is an easily surprising afterword.
