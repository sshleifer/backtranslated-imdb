After reading more than my fair number of reviews for a variety of different films, I noticed a certain trend and people are judging what is expected hard. I think if you go into an open-minded movie that does not expect anything, you will have better feelings than if you try and look, but have ready-made standards that you want to achieve. <br /> I try not to be hypocritical. I saw this movie with a very clear and open attitude and was very satisfied. Since this is not a mainstream title or a prize awarded for the matter, I did not know exactly what to expect, but in truth I had much more fun than Ninja Scroll. Nice animations, a deep story, and the ever-joyous Ninja Hack N Slashing combined well with one of my favorite personal animations I've ever done. It's a chance and you'll come out with a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> - "Before you speak, be sure what you will say will be more beautiful than the silence" - Chinese proverb
