I thought I had already commented on this movie before, but I can not find it here. I write it anyway. I accidentally found this movie from the library holdings of my college. It was free to watch, so why not. <br /> <br /> Of course I am glad that I saw it. I love this movie. I have already seen a few Russian films, most of them have serious topics. I am surprised that this was a good comedy. I had a great laugh when I saw it. and this is a movie I want to buy. This thing is so funny. and not only are they stupidly funny, these conspiracies were very original and well thought out, so they do not seem stupid at all. I am surprised that this movie did not attract many viewers. This is a classic that you can see again and again. <br /> <br /> These actors were also very authentic, their acting is genuine, not fake. If you have not seen it, get a copy soon! absolutely to suggest.
