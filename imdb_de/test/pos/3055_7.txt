The movie is not half as bad as people want you to believe. <br /> <br /> Why do so many people hate this movie? Is it because it's Laurel & Hardy's last time together and it's not her best? Or is it due to the lack of Laurel & Hardy regulars? Or because it was not done by Studios Hal Roach or 20th Century Fox? <br /> <br /> Certainly true that this film is not a successful attempt to revive Laurel & Hardy and bring her back to the 1950s. It's also definitely true that the film is far from its best, but to be honest, the movie is still well entertained and makes this movie far from the worst. Not the most dignified "goodbye" movie you can imagine, but still a fun and fitting farewell. Both retired from film after graduating. <br /> <br /> The movie still contains some great slapstick moments and the chemistry between Laurel and Hardy is obviously still very present. It also makes this movie better than most of their 40s movies together. It's a surprise that the slapstick humor still works as well as it does, considering that the days of slapstick comedy have been over since the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The story may not have been so entertaining and there are too many sidekicks and characters, so the movie sometimes loses focus on the boys. Too bad, because there are still those who really carry and make the film. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see how poor Stan Laurel was at the time this film was made. He looked really sick and old, which of course he was. He was already well over 60 years old. After an operation, however, he recovered completely and lived for 15 years before he died in 1965, 8 years after his good friend Oliver Hardy. <br /> <br /> An entertaining, if not perfect, farewell to the boys, Laurel & Hardy and the end of 3 decades of fun, humorous, high quality slapstick entertainment from movies that are still seen by people all over the world and to be loved. <br /> <br /> 7/10
