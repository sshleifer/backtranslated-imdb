I do not pretend to be a big fan of Asterix, as I just saw another movie adaptation and read only two of the comics, but this was a great movie. I only saw the English version and found the voices that fit the characters perfectly - Brad Garret as Obelix and especially Sean Astin as Justforkix. The story itself was both interesting and really funny (especially the contradictory name endings - all Viking names end in "af" while all the nicknames naturally end in "ix"), with some romance thrown in (but I have the History has been upgraded, even though total production has been burdened with unnecessary stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is as follows: Viking leader Timandahaf is tired of robbing villages and then finding them empty, advising his "wise man Cryptographer, whose entire repertoire consists of ancient proverbs, and cryptographer tells him that "fear gives wings to the villagers." Timandahaf takes this literally and believes that fear actually enables flying, and goes on an expedition to " Champion of Fear, an expedition that naturally takes him to the Gallic village where Asterix and Obelix live. <br /> <br /> The two are currently s frustrated - Justforkix, the cowardly pacifist nephew of Chief Vitalstatistix, was entrusted to them to train him to be a man, and the boy makes little to no progress. If Justforkix unknowingly gives "fear of everything" in the presence of brainless Viking Olaf, he is considered a "champion of fear" and is kidnapped. Asterix and Obelix are sent by Vitalstatistix to rescue Justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son home. After all, this is a great movie with a few mistakes aside from the clich√©s and sometimes even broken dialogues. I enjoyed it very much, although it does not correspond to the comic.
