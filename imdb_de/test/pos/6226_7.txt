Tourist Trap (1979) is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70s. The film is about a group of young friends who are stranded in a deserted alley of a creepy old waxworks cabinet. The owner of The Museum looks like a strange but harmless old man, but things take a very vile turn when members of the young group are killed, whoever is responsible for the murders, is it the old Slausen or is it his collection of spooky mannequins who do that seem to be alive and hungry for blood !!!! This movie was good, it was fast, the performances were very good by the actors (Tanya Roberts was very sexy) and the movie was never boring, and as I said, he had some very scary scenes so be prepared under the Hide blanket! Definitely recommended for fans of horror movies / ghost stories! I give this movie a very respectable 7.2 out of 10 points.
