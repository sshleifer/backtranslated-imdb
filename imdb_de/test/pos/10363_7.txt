I actually accidentally switched to the Lifetime channel when the movie started and looked at the end. This is certainly a serious problem that is probably more common than we assume, in relation to this type of attack on a young woman by an ego-manic fellow who feels he is over the top To be a system. and unfortunately that is often. <br /> <br /> The cast here was believable and the performances credible. Many of these Canadian / Lifetime flicks are decidedly "over the top". However, this is one that I could call "under-the-top". <br /> <br /> Although he appreciated the fact that he was not exaggerated, this movie seemed somehow like a record being played at a slower speed than the actual, the 96 minutes seemed to be much more and it seemed like a shorter movie that keeps going through, apparently going on and on, and on and on again - before coming to its inevitable and predictable conclusion. <br /> <br /> Despite this criticism, the captivating characters and performances have made it better than the average movie of this type. <br /> <br /> And although these pictures often "milking" the climax, this is the case, one could have given it a little more detail and longer.
