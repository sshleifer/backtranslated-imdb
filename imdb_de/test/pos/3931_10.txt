I do not think I'm alone when I say that the horror genre of 2005 was not very good. While "Cursed", "Hide and Seek", "The Ring Two" and "The Amityville Horror" all showed insights into the interest and potential, there were more failures than hits. For proof see: "White Noise", "Boogeyman", "The Jacket", "Mindhunters" and "Alone in the Dark". Imagine my surprise when "House of Wax", written by brothers and sisters Chad and Carey Hayes, turned out to be a surprise. <br /> <br /> Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is a young woman traveling with her problematic brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and his friend Wade (Jared Padalecki). Together with Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Ri'chard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) they hope for tickets to the last football game of the season. Along the way, they encounter some car problems and have to enter a deserted city where nothing is as it seems. <br /> <br /> When we hear this is a remake of the classic Vincent Price B movie, I rolled my eyes. I did not even want to think about what disaster director Jaume Serra cooked for his audience. At a time when most top-class horror movies are disappointments, latent with bad writing, static direction, and lay play, I'm glad that Serra and the Hayes brothers have set themselves the task of celebrating a good, old-fashioned Spookfest. Unlike the disappointments I mentioned earlier, this one does not bother and uses every cinematic trick in the book to give each one exactly what he came for. <br /> <br /> I am glad that the Hayes have really taken the time and effort to create sympathetic and believable characters, making the events all the more urgent. There are also the young actors who portray them. As she did in The Girl Next Door, Elisha Cuthbert proves to the audience what a talented actress she really is. In the remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2003), Jessica Biel silenced naysayers by delivering a raw and emotional performance that brought the viewer directly. Here Cuthbert does the same. Chad Michael Murray ("A Cinderella Story"), in one of his first mature roles, is not a slacker than Nick. Murray radiates charisma and a hard edge and impresses with sportiness. Murray and Cuthbert fit together perfectly and have a tangible family chemistry. <br /> <br /> Especially the press and the American audience celebrated a big day before the big acting debut of Paris Hilton. As I expected, Hilton is not embarrassed. In fact, she is as good as everyone else in the movie (do what you want). Hilton is present on the screen like Cuthbert and Murray. She is sexy and playful. I can not find any reason why she has experienced the worst reception of the movie, apart from just exploiting it. Jared Padalecki ("Gilmore Girls" of the TV station) splendidly manages to overcome his signed role. Robert Ri'chard (Cousin Skeeter on TV) and Jon Abrahams ("Meet the Parents") are not very busy, but do the work. With just one scene, Damon Herriman ("Soar") makes an unforgettable impression and his presence hangs over the rest of the movie. Finally, Brian Van Holt ("Basic") is excellent and threatened in a dual role. <br /> <br /> Once again, kudos have to go to screenwriters to avoid clich√©s as much as possible. Despite widespread opinion, "House of Wax" is quite unpredictable for much of its life. Take the following, for example: It seems the killer is out for the count and Carly bends down to get something out of his pocket. What do you expect? Watch the movie and you will understand what I mean. It's also refreshing to see a horror movie in which the characters even show a degree of common sense. <br /> <br /> Unlike most horror scores, John Ottman never distracts from his exciting work. Like the other Dark Castle releases, however, the visual aspects of Wax are praiseworthy and extend the film beyond its genre peculiarities. The talents of cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, production designer Graham Walker, art director Nicholas McCallum and editor-in-chief Joel Negron emphasize the gruesome images. When it comes to pictures, I think the bloody dogs will love the many make-up effects and tricks. Every death scene is more stomach upset than the last one. If you look at his past in music videos and commercials, it's obvious that Jaume Serra has a big eye for style. His "in-your-face" approach is a big win for the success of this film. Only if you think that the camera will turn away, this is not the case. He is also especially good at building thick layers of fear and atmosphere. One outstanding attitude is our introduction to the killer as he emerges slowly from a trapdoor. <br /> <br /> In such a case, I would normally admit when I'm in the minority (Shut up, okay? I liked "House of 1000 dead bodies"!). In this case, I am firmly convinced that the critics have misunderstood it. I'm not sure why people in this movie are so tough, considering it's way better than the latest genre entries. Perhaps they are afraid to admit that a horror movie with Paris Hilton might be worth a look ... who knows? This is a horror movie and a remarkably stylish and effective movie. As a lifelong horror fan, I can only say that I enjoyed "House of Wax" in all its intrusive and sadistic splendor. I consider it a great achievement in modern horror and (along with "Sin City") for the first completely satisfying release of 2005.
