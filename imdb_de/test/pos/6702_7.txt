Finally, I put Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format and the rousing Henry Mancini score to the point. After watching Lifeforce for fifteen years, I have to say that the DVD version "uncut" was both great and disappointing. The US version is a lot better than the DVD version. The US version of Lifeforce moves much faster (editing the DVD version is awful, it feels like an unfinished cut). And the many scenes not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact, a "new" moment almost destroys the entire movie as Caine (Peter Firth) meets the male alien in the cathedral. I love this scene, but in the US version. On the DVD, the male alien talks to Caine and what he says is soooooo funny. It's the height of fun: <br /> <br /> "It'll be a lot less scary if you just come to me!" The male alien says in a deep voice of the 50s. I was down when I saw that. It just does not belong to the movie. This scene is a pure camp in an otherwise very serious movie. I'm glad that Hooper (or whoever) cut this scene when the movie was released in North America. Several changes have been made to the US version, which significantly improve Lifeforce. I wish the DVD had the US version. Editing is sharp and exciting without being annoying, and some points that were already boring in the US version become even more boring on the DVD version due to extra scenes. And the opening credits on the DVD are terrible. Much better in the US version. Even more subtle. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Basically it's aliens who pit across the earth and absorb as much life force as possible. The movie has too many flat, boring sequences (talk, talk, talk), but if the action is going to London, it's fun. The movie really shines in these scenes. You can see that Hooper finally does what he does great: chaos, wildness, horror! Lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. They are the best apocalyptic scenes ever made. It is also the best zombie movie of all time. The zombies are hungry (for life, not meat) and they are crazy, agile and scary. Not the slow drilling of other zombie movies. Also, many people have criticized the end, but I love it. It makes you high and dry, like one of the victims who are exhausted by the life force. <br /> <br /> And to think that this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80's when people turned to E.T. or Cocoon or other sweet and boring, good science fiction movies. No wonder it was bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic view! <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, it's not great. The picture is muddy and grainy and there are no extras. But it's great to see the movie in widescreen format. I just hope they release a clean, crisp US version on a DVD, with comments from Hooper and Dykstra.
