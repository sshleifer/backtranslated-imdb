The subspecies series is always the best vampire movie of all time. There is something about them that makes them special. I think it's the feeling you get when you look at it. <br /> <br /> They are in modern times and yet they feel like they are in the 1700s s or 1800'si think it has something to do with the sets used, if so, then it works it continues, guys :) :) <br /> <br /> in a brief summary of what happened in the first part - Radu was allegedly banished years ago by his father from his homeland, and he has decided to return and to take what he considers his birth rite. The bloodstone and everything his father has, he kills his father, played by Angus Scrimm (the big man in the phantasm films). and take the bloodstone, which has a strong power, to whomever he has, for who has it, never needs anyone again, because the stone is supposed to drain the blood of the saints, and every time the radu takes a drop of it, he goes crazy slowly from it. (that's all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire were bad enough). Well, Radu's brother Stephan tries to stop his evil ways while trying to prevent him falling into a tourist who is in a house / fort owned by a friend of his. <br /> <br One thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well, you have to watch the movie to see what's going on in here. <br /> <br /> I will review / comment on the other sequels in the near future. <br /> <br /> the difference between this and Buffy is too commercial, and it's not that this will not appeal to everyone, but it has an atmosphere far superior to that of Buffy, even though Radu does not look that good The miracle full of Sarah Michelle Gellar :). <br /> <br /> rating for this movie 10/10 a good example of how a vampire movie should be made :). <br /> <br />
