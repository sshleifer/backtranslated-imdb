A somewhat typical piece of filmmaking from this period. It was obvious that it was first recorded in this world for the stage, but still a very good movie from start to finish. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York can make their stage appearance for the screen and both make it effective. There are few stories in the story and anyone unfamiliar with these types of character studies may be a bit scared off. All in all, a good movie in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York do too much.
