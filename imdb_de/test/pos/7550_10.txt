Unfortunately, many great movies on IMDb, like this one, have "adjusted" their ratings from IMDb. This is really a beautiful and intriguing movie by the accomplished director of Bonnie and Clyde, Little Big Man, Night Moves, Mickey One and The Chase. <br /> <br /> If you click in the rating range, you will see that the actual median for Four Friends is 7.6. However, IMDb has adjusted the rating to 6.4 "(dumping down). <br /> <br /> Per IMDb: "IMDb publishes weighted voting averages instead of raw data averages Different filters are applied in sequence to the raw data Trials," tuning votes "of individuals who are more interested in changing the current rating of an individual Films are interested in eliminating and reducing rather than expressing their true opinions .... The exact methods we use are not published, this should ensure that the policy is maintained effective. " In other words, we will not disclose our methods. So you can not question how we came to the score! What a shame to watch fine, thought-provoking films like "Four Friends" is nothing better than lame comedies due to the "filters" of IMDb.
