Based on Han Suyin's book "A Many Splendored Thing," this film addresses issues of Asiatic-White racial relationships, a theme that comes from the personal experiences of Han who grew up as a Eurasian in China. This background and beautiful settings in Hong Kong give this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for their time. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that may be more than the movie itself remembers. Beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and does a wonderful Oscar-nominated mixed-race doctorate during the advent of communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better as a journalist playing a romantic role in war-torn regions of the world. The acting is first-rate, and the chemistry between the two lovers creates real moments of silver-screen affection that melt the hearts of the romantics. Especially the hills above the harbor, where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The end is a real jerk. Some may consider sentimental romances pass√©, but for those who love classic Hollywood love stories, this is a shining example.
