"Sweeney Todd" is in my opinion one of the few "perfect" musicals. Like "My Fair Lady" and "West Side Story" it has a wonderful, intelligent score. It offers the two leads and several supporting characters interesting roles. It has a timeless theme, revenge. It has a lot of humor and is just as powerful when presented in a simple or grand style. <br /> <br /> "Sweeney Todd" tells the story of a simply inappropriate man during the industrial time in England. It shows the man's inhumanity for man, as in Sweeney's own words: "There are two types of men, leaving one who stands in his right place and one with his foot in the other's face." To correct the injustice done to him, Mr. Todd planned a plan to seek revenge. With the help of Mrs. Lovett, who owns a meat pie shop under Mr. Todd's hair salon, they set out on "those upstairs serving below." <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to have seen her the original Broadway version eight times (six with Cariou and Lansbury, the other two with Hearn and Loudon). I've seen the revival with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler and several other concert versions. <br /> <br /> Although the technical aspects of this production, to say the least, are lacking, I believe that this filmed production version is the best. Lansbury and Hearn were the top two in these roles, and they have a wonderful time together. <br /> <br /> Very good collateral work by Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck. Although Betsy Joslyn and Cris Groenendaal, as the young lovers have absolutely no chemistry, they are basically unsurpassed. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
