Jack and Kate meet first with the doctor Daniel Farady and then with the connoisseurs Miles Straume and they show that they did not come to the island to save the survivors. Locke and his group find anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis and Ben Linus shoot her. In the meantime, the group of Jack finds the pilot Frank Lapidus, who landed the helicopter with minor damage that can be repaired. Jack forces Miles to explain the real intention of why they came to the island. The second season four episode returns to the island with four new characters and stops the confusing "flash forwards" and it seems like the explanations that I (and most fans and viewers) expect in "Lost" are finally coming to stand at the beginning. Why the Government's interest in Ben Linus and how he is informed by the boat are some of the questions I will be expecting in the next few episodes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
