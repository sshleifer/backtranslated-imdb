I was fortunate to see a midnight screening of this movie tonight. I have to say, I expected a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre conspiracy. I was completely wrong. Not only was this movie incredibly entertaining, it was all I just enjoyed. Bruce Campbell was as incredible as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He played the henchman of the crazy doctor in the widest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he just seemed to shine. But I really can not ignore the magic of Bruce Campbell. Although I thought Ted Raimi had stolen the show, Bruce did what he did best on the big screen. Somewhere between the sketchy, uncomfortable American businessman and the tragic victim, he showed the same energy he has always shown to be unbelievably attractive to the public. The film itself was often interrupted by applause from the audience. The crowd was definitely upset with every little twist the movie made. <br /> <br /> This film is not an Oscar, but goodness, it was amazing. I would highly recommend it to any Bruce Campbell fan. If you like Campy sci-fi movies, do yourself a favor and look at it. I can not wait for it to come out on DVD. <br /> <br /> Take it the way you want ... <br /> <br /> - the feed
