I have been slowly collecting the films available on DVD from Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut. Both the actress and the director have done some stinkers in their time - luckily Mississipi Mermaid is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Next to "The Soft Skin", who happens to be staring at the sister of Deneuve (the late Francoise Dorleac), this would have to be my favorite Truffaut movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Truffaut also wrote the script. Something that always fascinates me about Truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when you present a story - you could almost call it naivety. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, there is a scene in which Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon with the remains of the loot. He rings and Deneuve answers with a negligee. By the time Belmondo reaches her room from the street, Deneuve puts on her dress, puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes, lies down on the bed and pretends to be asleep. It's a scene that could almost have come from a child's head - but that's Truffaut for you. Seeing <br /> <br /> Catherine Deneuve in her late 60s films is indeed a sensual pleasure. She is so beautiful that it is almost painful for us to watch. By the way, for these fans there are a few topless scenes of her in this movie - indeed a sinful pleasure. <br /> <br /> I disagree with the previous posters. I do not see anything "Hitchcockian" about the movie. As far as appearance is concerned, I love the look of the older footage used in the 60s. There is certainly a unique look to movies of the time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for Deneuve and Truffaut fans ......
