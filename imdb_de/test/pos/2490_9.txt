It is said that the film is or was prohibited since its release in the US. Since there is no information about IMDb, I have to rely on my other sources and believe it. If that's really true, the movie is even more hurtful and scary, and still is. <br /> <br /> The movie is a so-called mockumentary, though I think the subject is too serious, so call it that. It creates a scenario in which America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are immediately arrested without proof. After a compulsory tribunal, they must decide whether to go to prison for a few years or to choose the detention center. In this case, they have to walk three days through the desert to reach an American flag that is fifty miles farther as they are being pursued by police and army troops. <br /> <br /> The film itself pretends to be A documentary about these incidents, following both the tribunals and the desert hunt, filmed by European film crews. All the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and film everything. People stare directly into the camera and yell at them. It seems very, very real. Talking about realism is nonsense. This movie is not about how to make a realistic movie, but what that movie would look like if it were real. And that's how it would look like. If it were still filmed. In a "utopian" state like this, there certainly would not be a European film crew allowed to film such things. <br /> <br /> There are many things that scare us. The defendants are people from all walks of life. Political leaders, musicians, authors, philosophers, unemployed, etc. They seem hopeless, rebellious or scared. They are not heroes. They talk a lot in the Tribunal, know that it does not work, and still say everything they said before in speeches, books and songs. One says he is not afraid to die. Is that true? Well, he does not have to run through the police-hunted desert. The defendants have no chance, or at least their only chance, the decision between prison and jail, is actually no chance. The way they decide in the end and how the movie ends makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide. <br /> <br /> These tribunals remind us of many tribunals in the Third Reich. The officials use the same idealistic way of speaking, ignoring all the arguments of the defendants, yelling at them and then telling them to be quiet. They warn the accused of "watching their language" and offend them much more. They ask them questions, the defendants can not answer, but it's never intended that they should do it. These scenes are a statement of what we call justice. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the desert are on a different level. When we see the prisoners for the first time, we realize that they have no chance. They see the desert and the mountains, feel the sun and the thirst and do not know how to endure these days off. The film crew follows and speaks with them as they try to escape this madness. They argue, should they play the game, flee or rebel? It leads to the same and nobody is surprised. Some will wonder if such parks would actually exist in such a state? Why not? It empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they see fit. It's not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed Jews before building concentration camps. The comparison is fair, as they do not really make a difference. <br /> <br /> The movie is scary and depressing. The issues being discussed sound familiar to ignore. This is not science fiction. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopian. The film shows us that government and democracy, as presented to us, are not only useless but dangerous. It also shows us that revolution is not definitely the solution. The defendants seem to be confused because they do not really know how to fight it. They do things, but for free. Even if this is not a solution for us, it is still a statement. <br /> <br /> For me, the scariest thing is the fact of the ban of this movie. Here we have a movie that accuses the loss of freedom, morality and peace. She accuses the government of being a fictional government, dangerous and inhumane. And such a movie is prohibited. Think about it the next time you see the American flag.
