I thought that was a beautiful movie - very brave. Such beautiful pictures - and I liked the use of glasses with applause. Also, as the best friend repeated the line about "..and she is a year older than me ..." showed that her friendship has regained and grown, but maybe there is some competition left ... I loved the recordings from hands that felt the fabric. The dance concert was beautiful. The beginning seemed slow, but it took a while for him to look for the characters - the husband could have been more abusive - he just seemed to be absent, and when other characters talked about him, it did not really fit. The affair in between. The best friend and the best husband seemed to be coincidental. The gathering of doctors seemed to indicate that there was not much time left to live .... When the unfaithfulness was revealed, I did not feel so much sympathy for the character - more of a relief! The end was so great - the lines in between. She and the husband, and the scene in which she is drawn, is brilliant!
