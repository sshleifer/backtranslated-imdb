This is the first movie I have seen from Singapore and it is great. If you do not know much about Asia, its languages, and its culture, this film can be a bit confusing for uninformed people. As an Asian American who has two major subjects in two Asian languages ​​(two of them being Mandarin) and has attended some Asian American language courses, this film was easier for me to understand, but even without that kind of knowledge, I think this film is for Foreign audience still accessible, as long as you consider that it is a kind of film of the coming age. The movie is definitely worth seeing, just to see what problems young teens have to fight and fight with. This is a fantastic comic of age, but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way. The actors are outstanding.
