Emilio Estevez did make a good movie - who would have thought that? I sat in two previous films directed by Estevez - "Wisdom" (with his then girlfriend Demi Moore) and "Men at Work" (with brother Charlie Sheen). They are lousy films - badly played, directed, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor, but as a director lousy. I turned it on out of pure curiosity - it has a great cast and I had nothing else to do. Damn, if it did not involve me. <br /> <br /> It's about Estevez coming home from Vietnam because he's constantly drawn to what happened there. His parents (Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen) and his sister (Kimberly Williams) are trying to reach him, but they can not. Something in Vietnam hit him hard ... and he explodes ... <br /> <br /> A little too long, but still very good. Much of the material is known, but the cast is so good that it appears new. Estevez is good, Sheen is great (and Estevez's real father), Williams touches and Bates is just extraordinary - he tries to keep the family together. All this leads to a powerful ending that really surprised me. <br /> <br /> It's worth catching. <br /> <br />
