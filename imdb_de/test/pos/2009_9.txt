This new Jeskid movie is great! Check it and you will be amazed. The story of Emily Waters, once a girl from a broken home, whose only way to escape an abusive father, was through her sketchbook. Until one night her drawings manifested in reality and saved her, she now fights against those who would do evil. Both live-action film and hand-drawn animations merge into a unique and original experience that will take your mind off the beaten track. The music is also incredible, she really internalizes the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict. Directed by Jesse Cowell and animated by Erica Langworthy, featuring beautiful Marissa Parness, music by Nico Audy-Rowland, Daniel Collins, Jeff Strathearn, Matt Sisco and Selcuk Bor. Support this film and support Jeskid, he is a very talented Type. Also watch his film Shades of Gray.
