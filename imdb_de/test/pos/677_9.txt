When I saw this movie for the first time, it was around 1956, and although I have recently seen it again, I have not changed my mind about it. I think it was the best movie by Robert Ryan because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenist in real life (my dad), even though he never murdered anyone, but was more affected during World War II, which bothered him made it worse. Just having to settle for humor to get through the day was so appropriate. (My mother and brother had to do this.) When I saw Robert Ryan portray this man, it was a very good imitation of this man, and I was impressed.
