I remember seeing this movie when it appeared as a TV show. Movie of the week in the early 70s. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen this movie for over 30 years, I remember how scary it was ... the sister's body in the basement, the storm raging outside, the creepy house without electricity and a killer still on the grounds. <br /> <br /> You just do not make TV movies like these anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underrated actress, and I liked her not only in "Betwitched," but also in several of her more-enchanted roles, such as "I really wish someone came out with a DVD that has several 70's televisions movie the week on a DVD. Would not it be great to see "When Michael calls," "Bad Ronald," "Do not be afraid of the dark," "Crowhaven Farm," etc. on a DVD? I know that there is a market for such a DVD for all baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s. If we are lucky, someday someone will offer us a DVD with a large selection of t.v. Movies like this.
