One of my favorite movies. Great cast, led by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with brilliant comedies. An exact mix of character and story. Real people with real problems and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Sensible moves from slightly sad to funny weird. Read the quotes. This is the best adaptation of a Neil Simon game. <br /> <br /> If you want to see more of Eugene, check out Biloxi Blues (with Matthew Broderick who starred in both stage versions) is fine, a bit darker. Get out of the TV Broadway Bound.
