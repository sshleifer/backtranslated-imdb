This is a well directed Columbo episode, also with a good character, but the story just does not know she's interested enough, and does not seem as well layered and constructed as a Columbo movie did. This also applies to the murderer's intention to kill his uncle. It's pretty simple and does not seem to be well thought out. Maybe this movie did not really take it seriously because the atmosphere of the movie is usually light. At least in comparison to different Columbo films. <br /> <br /> For example, the movie offers a lot of comical relief, mostly from the Columbo character himself. It makes the movie an entertaining movie, but he also feels that he sometimes exaggerated it, also because he usually does not agree with most of the other films in Columbo. <br /> <br /> The characters are good and it helps that Martin Landau plays in a dual role. It is always funny to see how much he looked like a young man, whereas a person like Peter Falk has changed little over the years and only turned gray. The film also features Julie Newmar, best known for playing Catwoman in the 1960s life-action series Batman. It's weird how she still moves like Catwoman in this movie. Intentionally or is this just her way of acting? <br /> <br /> It's an enjoyable and good movie to watch Columbo's movie, but it also makes you feel that anything could have been better with a better-thought-out script. <br /> <br /> 7/10
