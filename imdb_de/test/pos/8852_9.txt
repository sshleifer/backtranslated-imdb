John Carpenter's brilliantly exciting movie is a great mix of sci-fi and horror. He takes over the classic body swap theme and brings it to the top. Carpenter is a remake of the 1951 original by Howard Hawks, and preserves the themes of paranoia and Cold War confidence as a backdrop for taking on aliens and the impending demise amidst the madness and isolation of the Antarctic. The direction of Carpenter is superb, as always, as his camera glides through the lonely world of characters whose habitable surroundings are spoiled by the fear of being taken over by the body. But here and similar to David Cronenberg Carpenter does not hold back the incident, because through some fantastic special effects, we experience some crazy moments of surreal blood. However, he never loses contact with the human side of the story because in the face of all the shocking events in front of us, the idea of ​​trust and mistrust is perceived. <br /> <br /> 9/10
