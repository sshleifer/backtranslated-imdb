This movie was a pleasant surprise. I had expected it for a long time and feared it would not live up to my expectations. <br /> <br /> It has exceeded her. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie <br /> <br /> Hilarious from start to finish (stay until after the end credits!), it's absolutely remarkable how a movie about stupid and annoying characters is so smart , can be funny and captivating. <br /> <br /> With its obvious matte images, the future Earth of the film is reminiscent of the Planet of the Apes series and other sci-fi films of the time. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie is essentially Planet of the Apes, but with people who are the mental equivalent of monkeys. <br /> <br /> It's moving pretty fast, and Luke Wilson is doing the film pretty well, with a character that reminds of the one he played in "Bottle Rocket." "(In an early scene, there is even a not so subtle allusion to" Bottle Rocket ".) Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former" painter, "who was also frozen. </ / Despite his strengths," Idiocracy "has that pronounced sense of a movie that was taken away from the director / editor before its fine tuning. <br /> <br /> I can not live for I understand why a movie that is so funny is easy in a few cinemas without advanced movie screenings No trailers and no marketing would be discarded. <br /> <br /> It's as if the studio decided they would not spend anymore and they just went away. <br /> <br /> Or maybe thought she, the film has the makings of a cult classic, and the only way to become a true cult classic was to make it a failure? <br /> <br /> Whatever the case, that's one Shame, because Mike Judge and especially this fil m deserve better. <br /> <br /> I assume this movie will have real legs on DVD. The mouth will make it to the success it deserves. <br /> <br /> Maybe the Fox executives saw themselves in the characters, were confused and thought it was a documentary?
