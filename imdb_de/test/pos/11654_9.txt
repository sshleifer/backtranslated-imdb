"Dead Man Walking" is not a movie about the death penalty, but about the people involved in a death - the murderer, the families whose children were killed, the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor, and what happens. It tells the story with little fanfare, but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD and every time I see it (not often, it's never a simple movie), I'm more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the cast have done here. So revealing that it could be a documentary so convincing that you can not avert your eyes, so subtle yet so powerful ... "Dead Man Walking" is nothing short of a masterpiece. It does not matter if you are for or against the death penalty (or have no opinion at all), in this movie you will surely think about the topics. A brave scriptwriter and director needs that material without even a twitch, and everyone involved in the movie pulls it off - there's not a single scene that rings wrong. A masterful movie, but do not expect easy viewing ... for some, the final scenes could be more graphic than anything you can imagine, even if no blood or violence is shown. You become involved in this film and become a participant, and there is a character that almost anyone can identify with. 10/10.
