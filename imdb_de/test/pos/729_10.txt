It can be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you do not necessarily have to load a movie with money to make it good, nor is it guaranteed to be worth it to be seen), but I think that the point is completely missed. If you count on fast cars, T & A or a movie that spells out for you, do not look at it, you will be disappointed and speechless. <br /> <br /> This movie was thoroughly pleasing edge of our seats and really made us think. The author has obviously put a lot of thought and research behind the film, and it shows that it's all the way to the end. Remember to stay open. <br /> <br /> Note: The school scenes were all shot at McMaster University and most of it was done in Toronto.
