This is the movie that eventually drove me to join IMDb so I could vote (and comment). I've come to appreciate well-produced "war movies" recently, and this is one of the most thoughtful I've ever seen in this viewing experience. My husband and I first saw this movie last night. It is gentle and exciting at the same time (no contradiction). This story in the hands of Hollywood could only become another smarmy, action-packed Top Gun waste of time. <br /> <br /> The two main actors who play Frantisek and Karel performed wonderfully well; and Krystof Hadek is a very "handsome" boy, without exaggerating or exploiting this fact. In terms of Hadek's acting and looks, my husband (ironically) said, "Well, he's not a Tom Cruise." I answered, "Thank goodness!" If you appreciate beautiful and unobtrusive spectacle, you will see this here.
