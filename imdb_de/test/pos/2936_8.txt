This is ten times better than "Who will be a supermodel" on Bravo. I think it's more in line with business. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and can make the most of every aspiring model. In each model, the photos look for depth, personality and beauty, strengths and resilient characteristics, and the ability to endure and work what they want. I enjoy watching Tyras personal experience get into the photo shoots and on the slopes. I do not always agree with the comments of the judges or Tyra, and at least one of the winners, in my opinion, deserves no victory. But this is just a show and every girl there is very happy to have this chance.
