I had never heard of this movie when a good friend recommended it. I trust the taste of this friend and bought the DVD. My wife and I sat and looked at each other without knowing what it was about. I thought it was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, mainly because I saw the truth in satire. I recommend this movie to all my friends. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. Some people will see the stark humor and aura of stupidity and find that Idiocracy is one of the stupidest movies they have seen. What these people do not seem to understand is that the stark humor is there, not to amuse the audience, but to show what the idiots will address in the future, "average guy." He is there, above all, to resist the snappy commentary on the society that is spreading in this film. Many of the funniest parts are in the background, so it is worth seeing several times. What makes the movie even funnier and more frightening is that I see elements of it in daily life, in people I meet, or in the media. Then I go back and see Idiocracy again and realize how good it is. <br /> <br /> The few people who have seen and enjoyed this movie can be part of an elite club. I see an advertisement for a product with a groundbreaking new ingredient and I turn to my wife and say, "It has electrolytes!" She knows exactly what I say.
