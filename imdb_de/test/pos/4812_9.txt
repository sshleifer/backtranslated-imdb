If you are familiar with the work of author Johnny To and his band of filmmakers on Milky Way, you know what to expect with this latest production. All the familiar elements are there: the strong camaraderie between two characters: usually a cop and a villain, the odds and rewards that make a penny and pay off in the end, and the humor that even in the worst cases creates situations. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decides to rob an insurance company. Lau Ching-Wan (also brilliant in other Milky Way films such as "Longest Nite," "A Hero Never Dies" and "Where A Good Man Goes") portrays a hostage negotiator / police officer who rests on the robber's tail a series of tricks and clues he must follow to get his man. <br /> <br /> Funny, poignant and cool while subtle. "Running" is actually one of the most entertaining Milky Way movies to date. Do not miss the accomplishments of the two leads, especially Andy Lau, usually an average actor who has rarely been so natural and fun to watch. This movie is a way to see everything to see.
