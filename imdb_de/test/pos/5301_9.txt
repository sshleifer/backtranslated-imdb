While Hayao Miyazaki's films have always been or are a hit in terms of history, they are clearly impressive, with characters using simple animations against the backdrop of artistic imagery. Ponyo sticks to this formula, with a main character so adorable that I want a plush doll from her and the scenery so pretty that she does not look like a picture torn on the wall. <br /> <br /> The story On the other hand, I did not enjoy as much as his last two major releases, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. It was just a bit too youthful, it seemed to be more for children and adults just enjoyed the animation. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed that Joe Hisaishi, who also scored the results for the above-mentioned two films, was not nearly as memorable this time around. I still can not quite remember Howl's score, but I still remember that it was one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. Ditto Spirited's - though I only remember that it complements the movie very well. Maybe it's because Ponyo is more youthful, the score is not so insistent. In any case, this movie is still a must for fans of anime or Miyazaki.
