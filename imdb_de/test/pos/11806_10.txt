Although he is flawed in his view of homosexuals, this film will enlighten the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies surrounding AIDS. Despite the depressing theme, this film shows a warm friendship between two boys and makes you laugh and cry. Very well played by everyone, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. The language is a bit strong, but appropriate, and it's a fun and intelligent movie for the whole family. But remember to have the Kleenex ready!
