The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of World War II, a unique environment in which some British agents are held by the Germans in a farmhouse. Since they are technically not yet at war, it seems as if both sides must have recognized what would come. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) flee into the countryside and separate. One night, Milland passes Gypsy Marlene Dietrich as she is alone in her camp to prepare dinner. Their encounter is an amazing and compelling scene, not so much for Milland, but for Dietrich, who takes sexy sultriness to a whole new level. Milland disguises himself as a gypsy in order to hide from the Germans, but remains committed to his mission to find the scientist who knows the formula for a new poison gas but is also not a committed Nazi. The Hollywood gypsy life and customs are predictably portrayed, but the underlying knowledge that it would be one of the targets of Nazi extermination creates some tension. The film goes over the borderline between a serious story about the poison gas and the urgent quest for the formula and a colorful but unconvincing love story between Milland and Dietrich. They are both very good, though; It is the film's fault that did not give them or their relationship enough dramatic realism and used and exploited obvious cultural differences for questionable comedic purposes. Nevertheless, there are some exciting and interesting points here and there, the surprise discussions with German soldiers and Gestapo agents, in which Dietrich makes a great hand reading and Milland is almost as fake, and a dinner party of Germans with different stripes on which On the radio it is announced that Germany was attacked by Poland and all stand and salute a stiff arm. Mitchell Leison missed some opportunities here and there, but he took full advantage of others.
