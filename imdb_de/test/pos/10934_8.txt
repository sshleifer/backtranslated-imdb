At first glance, this movie seems to be a fairy tale about a beautiful and clearly white horse that you have never seen. Strictly speaking, however, in the context of history, the implication is that in order to survive in direct America after the Civil War, one must have a horse and not an old horse, but a really great one. And Eagle's Wing is such a horse. But for a man who is worthy of such a horse, this is another matter. Who should own it? The Native American or the AWOL soldier? The story is in primitivism against civilization. As other commentators have already said, it is ironic that an English director needs to grasp this fact and develop that simple theme into a Western that no one else has ever had to offer. The film is essentially about this beast and the wild harshness of the environment and the people who live on it. The photography and the soundtrack are exquisite. The performance of Martin Sheen is a revelation. This movie, which was released in the same year as Sheen's other major appearance as Willard in "Apocalypse Now," suggests his abilities were never again so revealing. More is a pity. A comparison of the two stories shows the surprising similarities between them - not least that both films depict the journey of a man into his soul to find salvation. While Willard is released, I leave it to the viewer to decide if Pike is ultimately the case. The end is in the truest sense of the word fabulous and very moving; be warned. Overall, this is an extraordinary movie.
