I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival, where it became a crowd pleaser. This is a parody of the French cottage industry of OSS 117 films of the 50s and 60s. The first OSS 117 film, based on Jean Bruce's novel, was screened in 1956, long before the first James Bond movie. He saw Ivan Desny as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath and six other action-adventure spy films filmed until 1970. Luc Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven all take turns as Oss 117. Jean Dujardin plays the title role in this comedic version of the series. When the movie begins in 1945, he has a French mustache and resembles Desny, but when the movie begins in 1955, he really looks like Sean Connery. Jean Fran√ßois Halim wrote this witty screenplay of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. It draws on the stupidity of Naked Gun, Get Smart, and the Pink Panther, and uses fresh humor at current events in a delightful combination that will delight the international audience, and I am sure that this will be the first of a revived OSS will be 117 revamped comedy adventures. Michel Hazanavicius leads. I would give this a 7.5 and recommend it.
