Visconti's death in Venice is considered one of the most beautiful films ever made. As we watch, we acknowledge that we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Endless opulent death in Venice is certain; But in another important way, it's an unsatisfactory movie. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and from the distance of Aschenbach's literary career and achievement; his imperialist nature, his layer-by-layer programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio shows up and becomes obsessed, it's obvious that Aschenbach has no idea who he is under his gilding and carefully lived life. When Tadzio is spotted, the "loner," as Mann sometimes calls him, divides into two parts. Aschenbach No. 1 takes in the sight of a beautiful 14-year-old boy and then tries to process the dizzying jerk in blood pressure like a work of art - a "divine" work of art. But Aschenbach No. 2 turns out to be a stalker, who takes over the sensible Aschenbach No. 1 and then replaced. Like the original Aschenbach his sexual double is humiliated, in order to get in touch with the object of his obsession - and thus Tadzio - remains a far-off ideal. Thomas Mann has no mercy for this game. Every bit of self-knowledge comes too strong and too late. the excitement of sexual blush is too great to resist. The fact that Venice is seized by illness means nothing to Aschenbach - except that his game now has higher stakes. When he finally whispers under his breath, "I love you," he knows that everything is lost and the abyss is waiting. Is one of them filmable? Maybe, and Visconti creates a visual party that you can not look away from. But there are mistakes: He and Dirk Bogarde make Aschenbach sympathetic; Man again, not. Aschenbach's POV dominates the movie and we are expected to identify it. But nowhere on the screen is a man torn apart from within. Bogarde alternates with ease between the sublimly Controlled and the ridiculously temperamental temperament - but what is it? Bogard's reactive power has no mooring. Mann writes a character who in his imagination performs the Dance of the Seven Veils and knows all the consequences that such freedom entails but is unwilling and unwilling to resist. Also, the screenplay by Visconti creates a character that is not in the original - Alfred, a friend of Aschenbach - to dramatize Mann's discussion about art and artists. These scenes are badly written catastrophes, and the actor portraying Alfred is hard to see. In addition, Visconti's Aschenbach is a composer of the gilded era, which in my opinion works for the film. and Mahler's symphonies replace Aschenbach's novels. Unfortunately, Mahler's great music is poorly recorded and played very poorly. Death in Venice, as handed down to us by Visconti, is not the complete success he might have had, but as a purely visual experience, his power can not be denied. All film students, especially the film art, will want to take a look at it.
