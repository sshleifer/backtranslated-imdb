OK, so, until the 15th minute of the movie, there is still no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie arrived in an upholstered bag from Down Under with sharpie-encrypted information on the front. I'm a programmer from a North American festival, and MOD LOVE was sent to me by our chief as a possible starter after passing the far-flung interface between Moscow and Karlovy Vary. <br /> <br /> Immediately I thought, "This movie is not for us" (no dialogue at minute 15 ??), but he still looked. Well well well. It was built, built and built, and halfway I was involved in this movie, because as if you go to the zoo, you are initially aloof, but until you come to the dangerous snakes, you are quite "there." <br /> <br /> This film has a dangerousness, not at all like the much-vaunted WolF Creek, but because it is so totally "different" in every form and form, and a web seems to be web made up of all the fantasies of most independent first responders, ie. - gloomy weather, red-nosed intrigue, strange splicing, sinister music, and an action that, although incomplete and simple, has something in common with one of the 'great Aussie films,' The Cars That Ate Paris by Wier. But MODERN LOVE is not really a very Australian movie in the sense of ocher freshness and playful self-irony that pervades many of the country's films. It works from the beginning in a rather nightmarish area. No cell phones, no brand names, no i-pods, no anxious urban media and class anxiety - just a guy married to a handsome man, an old Volvo, and a little boy (son) having strange teeth and grips around. Oh, and it's in a strange village by the sea, where people all look a bit "wrong". Photographed by Nick Matthews (2:37) and music by Tom Huzenroeder (Ten Canoes), MOD LUV is successful where many Aust. Films fail - that is, it stands regardless of the "godforsaken" country from which it comes. Instead, it revels in a distorted yet entertaining puzzle that the film itself can not solve - and here lies the weak link ... What on earth does this movie have to do with "Modern Love" ???? The last few minutes of the movie seem to give an answer, or at least give a hint ... and as I sat down to drink a cup of coffee and then ate my Hershey's, I could only guess that the film's assistant would be Alex Frayne prob have fun with this.
