This is Christmas time! A birth in terms of rebirth, or at least that's what can be hoped for in terms of Italian cinema. It was about 30-40 years that the Italian cinema did not produce a work of this size. This is an absolutely contemporary film that can also be considered at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, without having to give a name. And finally, this is also a big production for Italian standards of that time. In this film, there is a rare balance of different elements, all of which are understandable and enjoyable at different levels of understanding. Real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. No rhetoric, no slight surreal shortcuts, no typical tourist Tornatore-like presentation, no exaggerated acting, no autoreferentialism of directors. There is also a cool use of two heartbreaking songs by Nina Simone, whose music, I believe, has never been used properly for a score. If this is not a real revival for Italian cinema, this is an extraordinary development for Emanuele Crialese after his "Respiro", another definitely beautiful movie. "Nuovomondo" is not to be overlooked, it is this kind of "medical film" that is helpful in making films, watching movies, helping to enjoy and understand life. Francesco Cabras
