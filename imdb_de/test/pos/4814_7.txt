The late director John Frankenheimer shot his first feature film, The Young Stranger, after first staging live television drama in New York City. This film followed the success of Rebel Without A Cause in 1955. James MacArthur made his movie debut as a troubled teenager with a father of the movie producer, who was played by James Daly, who with his not enough relationship with him has a son. Kim Hunter plays the mother who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son. The film uses the popular juvenile delinquent time angle to tell its story. MacArthur gets into trouble in a movie theater with an overzealous theater manager, played by Whit Bissell. MacArthur, in turn, has to deal with a police sergeant James Gregory, who wants to teach him a lesson. The material could easily have become exploitative, ridiculous, and sensational, as was the case any other time. However, under the safe leadership of Frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive portrayal of youth and parent dynamics. The dialogue is realistic and most of the scenes are surprisingly good. Some scenes with Bissell as a theater director and Gregory as a police sergeant are a bit cumbersome and dated. However, the performances are consistently good, which is necessary for a film of this kind and for this success. This is an impressive feature film debut for MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.
