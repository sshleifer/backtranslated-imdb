I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost every day. There is good and bad in EVERY race. Why should they make everyone feel bad? This is true today for all races. John Harper was an educated man graduating from high school, and he even had a year in college before returning to the reserve. How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family during the three years he was in high school and kept in touch after graduation. He was a kind and gentle soul, it could be fun to love him, and he could be serious if the time was right. I was not very old when he left our house, but I still remember him helping me with my homework when my own brother was not disturbed. He even taught 3rd grade before coming to Winnipeg. None of this is mentioned in the film, and the suicide of Constable Cross is a guilty confession for me. What happened to John is unforgivable not only in the native, but also in the white community. Not everyone in Winnipeg thinks like the police, I knew the person inside and how he looked as a PERSON, not as an Indian!
