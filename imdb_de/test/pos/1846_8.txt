I really wanted to see this movie in the cinemas but never got around to it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001, I liked it so much that I immediately bought the DVD. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake have done a wonderful job with the script and can wonderfully listen to the audio commentary included on the DVD. They have done a great job in creating characters that really interest you. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this movie, including sadness, fear and joy. The film also does an excellent job of showing the importance of the family (now a rarity in the movie). This is a reflection of director Bonnie Hunt, based on her comments on the DVD. David Duchovny has shown me here that there is a life beyond Fox Mulder that offers a wonderful performance with some poignant scenes. I strongly recommend you watch this movie. I'm really grateful to the creators of this movie. They have given me a wonderful piece of screenings that I will recommend to all my friends. I've seen a lot of movies over the years and it's very rare for me to get that kind of satisfaction after watching a movie. I will see this again and again. Return to Me reminds me that there are still filmmakers who know how to truly please their visit to the cinema. Many Thanks!!
