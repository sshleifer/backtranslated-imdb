Note the broad release date of August 8, 1945 - about a week before Japan capitulated in World War II. In "Over 21" there will probably be a message for us. Irene Dunne (it happened one night, the 1939 version of Love Affair) is Paula Wharton, who lives on an army base while the husband of a newspaper office works at school. Alexander Knox (the longest day) is her husband Max. Look for Charles Coburn (Monkey Business, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes) as the stuffy, commanding newspaper boss. Also, look for Cora Witherspoon as Mrs. Gates of The Women, Bank Dick, Libeled Lady. War history written for the view of the wives, which was not too common then. funny comment on the shabby state of the "married flat"; Irene's wardrobe in this movie was certainly not shabby. Since they never had to leave their little cottage, the entire film budget seemed spent on their always exquisite clothes and hats.
