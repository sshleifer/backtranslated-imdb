I loved this movie! Yes, it's pretty cheap and I'm sure that many reviews about it will be glossed over. But my goodness, how much they pack for the money. I was reminded of the early work of Sam Raimi. Yes, it's rough, but it has good energy and a lot of fun. Acting ranges from the very good ones in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser to the lesser ones in some of the less good parts. Is it a cult movie? Well, it grew up with me. I liked it the first time, but the third time I loved it. The movie is probably a 7 out of 10, but I give it 8 for the clean cheek. Anyone who can do this for 8 giants is worth seeing. I almost want to visit Scotland!
