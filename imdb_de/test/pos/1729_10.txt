Okay, I grew up with Who, but I have not loved a doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston has made me love again, and I'll be mad at him forever because I left. <br /> <br /> The writing is great, the acting excellent, the directing (which used to be terrible) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this program and just saw it as a compulsion, but now I'm a big fan and I love it (I have a ringtone from a Dalek screaming "Exterminate" at the time). <br /> <br /> Some of the things I love about the new program: 1) People actually notice when Rose (Billie Piper) disappears from the planet. Some of the old shows an assistant dropped off for a while, and then came home as if nothing had happened, nobody noticed. 2) Chris Ecclestons Doc loves Rose - romantic or not will be debated, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares for his companion. He would destroy the world if he had to save her, which the old show lacked - often a doctor would not care if he never saw his assistants again. 3) They talk and think like real people - when Rose is shown something out of the ordinary or new (like aliens), she behaves like a real person - crazy. I never liked it when an assistant from the old show, who has never seen anything alien, would just fit in and adapt immediately. I want to see the surprise on Roses face as she brings a plastic doll to life. She gives that to me. <br /> <br /> The few things I do not like about this series: 1) almost everything happens on earth (London or Cardiff) and I kind of hoped for a more off-beat show. 2) That Eccleston left so fast made the show really awesome. <br /> <br /> But I can let those few things go - I enjoy the show much more than I expected, so I do not mind if they have settled on earth. <br /> <br /> Just do not take this show seriously - it's fun, it's smart, it's entertaining, but it's not a serious serious heavy duty show. It's just fun and pure British and I can not get enough. Watch it with an open-minded attitude, and just set your brain to neutral and enjoy it! <br /> <br /> ps - do not look at Series 2. Series 1 was brilliant, the first episodes of Series 2 were good, but do not look at it when it comes to Love and Monsters. Absolute garbage completely destroys the show.
