The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I've ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo & Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her quest, her fight is extraordinary. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of the dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me, like Gerda, to fight for the ONLY, for the love of my life, for Mr. Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this film. I cry every time I notice all the suffering of Gerda and Kay. And I wish it ended soon ... Snowqueen tells, though my life deeply identifies me with the story and the characters. Thanks, at least, to Hans Christian Anderson and the director.
