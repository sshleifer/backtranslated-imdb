I'm not sure if I want to call this movie a children's drama or fantasy movie. When I saw this for the first time, I could not really see the end, and that's the only part of the film that seemed to me to lack depth and made me a bit depressed for a while. Then I saw it a second time and realized how great the spectacle was and did not know why it got the meager attention it was doing back then. <br /> <br /> Unforgettable performances by young Mazzello and Wood would have made this movie a classic. <br /> <br /> Although the film was probably intended by the original author / director (Evans) as a fantasy / drama, after the takeover of Donner, he probably made a more dramatic impression Ending, which left a lot to be desired, which really was Bobby happened - was he killed? Did he escape and did all these fantastic journeys? Or was it just an imaginary story that was woven by Hanks to make a point in children? <br /> <br /> But it was not the end of a happy ending we got so used to in a children's movie. Maybe because it's not just that. <br /> <br /> To see what a more classic ending could have been, check out the Official Elijah Wood Site, where you'll find the first rough drafting script to finish the movie (presumably by the original author) < Also a touch of the music of Hans Zimmer, which is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, a mix of childlike and dark feelings throughout the movie. A great CD to stick to, if you can. <br /> <br />
