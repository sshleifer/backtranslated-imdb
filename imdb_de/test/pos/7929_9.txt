This film is one of the classics of cinema history. It was not made to please the modern crowd, so nowadays some people think it's creaky or stilted. I found it penetrating. Cherkassov has exactly the right presence to play Alexander Nevskyi, just as he did when he played Ivan Groznyi (Ivan the Terrible) a few years later. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was the bad soundtrack that was pretty mangled. Although I speak very little Russian, it would have been nice to be able to pick out more words than relying almost 100% on the subtitles. I looked at it on an old videotape from the library. Maybe there is now a DVD version in which the sound has been improved. I would like to know if the actors were archaic Russian or even Old Church Slavonic while speaking. The subtitles were strangely worded, and I find it hard to tell if this is an older style of speech or if the subtitles were bad.
