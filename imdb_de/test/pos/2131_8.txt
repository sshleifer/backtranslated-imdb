Although this film has destroyed the career of director and screenwriter Michael Cimino and bankrupted United Artists, it is still considered one of the best films ever. There are many reasons to reject this movie prematurely. Among them: the length, the technical problems, the colossal maltreatment of animals on set - the list goes on and on. Nevertheless, it remains a film that holds something. It's a classic example of naturalistic storytelling comparable to Strindberg - its moments last as long as they possibly last in reality because they were not dammed up for good kinematic timing. It feels real in its moments of anger, love and war (and hopelessness). This movie should be seen by all who appreciate film and storytelling.
