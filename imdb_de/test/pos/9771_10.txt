I saw this drama on cable TV. Although I have only seen two series, I love this drama. I'm waiting for more series to be broadcast via cable. <br /> <br /> Even though it describes a terrible, absurd situation in a prison camp, this scene shows us an invincible spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. They do not know if they can survive or not, but they kept their hope strong without being discouraged by adversity. <br /> <br /> I know that this movie is not as realistic as other war documentaries, but I do not want to blame it. That makes me believe the strong will of the people in the most difficult situation. <br /> <br /> 'Private Invoice', especially this episode touched me deeply in my heart. <br /> <br /> I remember every scene. I always hate math. But after seeing this drama, I can understand something about math. Mathematics is its connection between past and present and also symbolizes eternity. <br /> <br /> 'Time, light and memory framed in a circle.' Like other war victims, he lost his lover through irresistible fate. I was immersed in his time and memory, as if I had experienced the same thing. <br /> <br /> He has experienced the great loss, but he has a pure passion for learning. <br /> <br /> He began his studies in the camp to realize his joy, <br /> <br /> I believe his commitment to study has sustained him. <br /> <br /> I've seen it several times, but the meaning of this movie never faded. Every time I see it, I feel the same deep emotion. <br /> <br /> * Your songs are beautiful and harmonious. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can not hear OST.
