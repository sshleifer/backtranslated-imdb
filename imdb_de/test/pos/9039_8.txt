As a fan of Wm. Faulkner since college, I was particularly excited about Intruder In the Dust and other reasons. My grandfather, also known as Clarence Brown, and his director, grew up in the Oxford area and was born in 1888 nearby. In July 1964, we attended a weeklong family reunion in Oxford, just 15 years after filming the film. It still looked mostly the way it does in the movie, but at the time, as a location for Ole Miss, it saw a phase of civil rights awakening. My recollection is that this summer is a nice little college town, but I was just an 18 year old college second and white. I have just begun to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice, but I still had a long way to go. Anyway, the movie is worth to be seen, but the filmmakers had to walk a tight rope to get it done there, and I'd like to know more about this story. <br /> <br /> Today, Oxford is a larger, more modern university city with all the nausea associated with such things, and I hope I will come back to see how it has changed socially in the last 40 years , Juano Hernandez would certainly have been nominated for an Oscar this year, but Hollywood was still too bigoted to make that happen. Other Faulkner stories were filmed, so look for them and compare them. One of the best was a PBS treatment of The Barn Burner in 1985 with Tommy Lee Jones. It has really captured the intensity of rural white wines that Faulkner has written so forcefully about.
