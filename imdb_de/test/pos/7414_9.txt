How on earth is this movie not considered further is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> I saved him for 1 pound and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best pound I've ever spent A movie. <br /> <br /> The thing that usually leaves movies about the club scene is either the music or the actual scenes shot in the club country. <br /> <br /> Here are the music and club scenes absolutely believable, with some big sounds of the time, and filmed in real clubs, where people actually look like they want to be there. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are of a very high standard Jason Donovan is particularly noteworthy for me (he played around the time this was filmed, ie in the drag phase, so in full swing! ) In the Rocky horror show in London drug land boss convinced. <br /> <br /> Put simply, if you're a fan of British film, you need to see this. It's not a problem when you're in clubbing because the movie is strong ugh like a story. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
