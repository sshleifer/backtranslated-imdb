"Hell To Pay" pays off as a rebirth of the Classic Western ... it succeeds as a Western genre film, the whole family could see and no different than the films that have experienced baby boomers decades ago. The good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad! , Bo Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prine (featured in this movie) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are all great and fun to see again. James Drury really shines in this case, maybe even better than his days as "The Virginian". In a way, "Hell To Pay" reminds me of those movies in the '60s that feature actors you know from so many shows. If you are of a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown, and Denny Miller and William Smith offer a "wow" factor, as we rarely see these symbols today. "Hell To Pay" offers screen legends as well as newer names in Hollywood. Most notable in the cast of "Newbies" is Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), whom I've recently seen on The Young and The Restless, and Kevin Kazakoff, who plays the angsty Kirby, a war-weary man between the two torn is wanting to live and to let live or to "do the right thing". William Gregory Lee is an excellent chance, Kirby's mischievous and happy brother. Katie Keane plays Rachel, Rebekah's sister, a woman who did everything necessary to stay alive, but gave up her pride in the process. In a small but memorable role, Jeff Davis plays Mean Joe, a former Confederate with a rather disagreeable air. I think we will see more of these good actors in the future. "Hell To Pay" is a funny movie that tells a great story? Grab the popcorn, we're going west!
