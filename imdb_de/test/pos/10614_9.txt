I saw this movie over 20 years ago and still remember how much I loved it. It really touched me, and I really enjoyed the work of Noel Coward. Highly recommended: atmospheric and touching. <br /> <br /> I think about this film from time to time and am disappointed that he did not arouse so much as many classic films. I did not know until I sought to win an Oscar for the best original story by Ben Hecht and Charles Macarthur. Basically, this is a bad character that destroys another's career and is cursed because of it. He dies, but is allowed redemption if he can convince someone to tear a tear over him. Most of the films show him in pursuit of this goal. well written and beautiful. I had known him for his plays, and I was surprised to see him in that role late on a television show in New York. A must, if you ever have the opportunity.
