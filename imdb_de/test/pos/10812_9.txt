The film, the 1794, the second year after the execution Louis XVI. Founded French Republic, filmed, shows the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu) and Robespierre (a sensational performance by the Polish actor Wojciech) Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned from his country estate to Paris, where he was deposed last year by Robespierre as chairman of the Public Security Committee. He is against "the reign of terror", which has led to the execution of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are believed to be against the revolution. Danton believes in the support of ordinary people and tries to convince Robespierre to stop the bloodshed. However, Robespierre and the committee fear that the popularity of Danton will lead to a fall, and Danton and his followers will be brought to justice as traitors. This was the first French-language film by Andrzej Wajda after he came to France from Poland. His Polish film company was shut down by the government for supporting the Solidarity union, which opposed the Polish government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His earlier film "Man Of Iron" (1981) dealt with the Solidarity Union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship between Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski and that between Danton and Robespierre. Danton / Walesa is the voice of reason directed against Robespierre / Jaruselski, who continue the dictatorial rule even though they have lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play "The Danton Affair" by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s. At the time of its release, the film was criticized by some as static and theatrical. However, the film focuses on the behind-the-scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the National Assembly and the courtroom, not the activities on the streets of Paris.
