I like Dr. Who seriously. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I do not have to dismiss myself as a "sci-fi person" because I'm not normal. I started because a friend made me addicted when they started to see it. It's really funny and most of the time it's a fast pace. My whole family looks at it pretty closely and that's a miracle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Ecclestion is pretty good, but David Tennant is brilliant. I think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's just nice to have some eccentricity in a TV character again. I do not know what it's all about, but it does all the work like clockwork. <br /> <br /> I'll just say, give it a try. An episode (probably best if you do not choose the second half of a two-parter).
