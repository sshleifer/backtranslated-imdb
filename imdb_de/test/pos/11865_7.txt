If you have nothing better to do, then rent this movie, it's smart and funny. He will certainly keep your attention busy for a while. <br /> <br /> I discover it by surfing a channel boring Sunday, it was on cable, and for the faces I saw, I thought it might be worth the try, it got me going Laughing and for a movie with a Sunday with nothing else on TV it was fine. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler looks awesome in the movie, though her acting is not what I expected, it's a kind of bad acting, and for the rest of the crew, I liked Reba in her role as dr. I found it interesting to play the guy from the sitcom "What I like about you" with a nearly gay lawyer. <br /> <br /> As for J. Goodman, I found it, as always, a very good performance, Michael Douglas plays a small role, but his characterization was difficult to identify. <br /> <br /> It's also a good movie you can see with the company.
