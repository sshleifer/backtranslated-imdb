Compared to Battle of Britain, this is a real movie with real characters and a real conspiracy. Battle of Britain is basically a documentary with occasional Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine, but the real protagonists are the Spits, the Hurricanes, etc. Here you have two well-functioning characters (actually three) and a Real storyline. I highly recommend it to anyone, including those who do not like war films. It's well filmed and I wonder what the director could do if he had the big capitals behind him. And I do not think it's over-sentimental. It's just that you have real people in the fighters, with real feelings and a real life - as real as any fictitious life in a great movie.
