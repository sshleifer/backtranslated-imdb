I caught this movie late at night and never knew what hit me. This was one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen, but I was waiting at the edge of my seat for what would happen next. Alan Rickman is an excellent "villain," but this character beats everyone else. I've never been so affected by a movie! It's been 6 years and I still can not forget Closet Land.
