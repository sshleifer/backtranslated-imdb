I thought it was adorable! Nobody but Kiarostami can do so little and still get so much. You may think I'm funny, but I was so charmed that I could not speak during the movie. During other films I comment a lot. The short film he made for Lumiere et Companie, the one with the eggs that is unbeatable in my heart, but that too is wonderful. I liked it better than ten. Kiarostami is perhaps the best director in my opinion because he can see things! He does not need a lot of material "taken home" to illustrate his pictures, he simply picks up a camera. Not many can do that. Maybe I do not know much about movies, but I do not care about complicated stuff, all one has to do is touch my soul. Kiarostami does.
