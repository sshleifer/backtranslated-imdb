Throw Momma is not dated at all, it is now as funny as it was when it was released. A really eccentric comedy that's not too tempting to be liked, and it's even better for her, full of memorable, loud, loud lines. Even little characters are well written and beautifully played, such as Billy Crystal's best friend and a cute cameo by Rob Reiner as a Crystal Agent. A little crazy and a lot of fun.
