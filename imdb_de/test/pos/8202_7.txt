It was a movie that made you think. Some parts a bit cheesy, others pretty good. The plot thickened sometimes and just when you thought Angella (Sandra) had found a friend, the friend was cheating or dead. All I have to say is that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing, after Angella had gone through everything. He would have lifted me and Angella through the garbage dumps.
