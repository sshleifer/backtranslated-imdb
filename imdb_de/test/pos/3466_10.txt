I got some free passes through the Times to see this little known Irish movie called "Inside I'm Dancing" ... I did not know about it, so had no prejudices before I went in. <br /> <The movie is about two guys sitting in their wheelchairs living in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from muscular dystrophy (please excuse any typos!). They form a connection because Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael says. They eventually leave home to live alone in an apartment in Carrigmore. They immediately put the help of an attractive girl (Romola Garai) to take care of them. The two friends eventually fall in love with the same woman. That's the story in a nutshell, but there's a lot of laughter and tears along the way ... in fact ... as unprepared as I was .. I found that the tears flowed far too often! Actually! I do not think I've cried so much since The Elephant Man when I saw a movie !!! This movie is a HUGE burden on emotions ... fun as well as sad. Acting is absolutely just right! James McAvoy is my tip for great ... he's a great Irish actor and I think he has a great future ahead of him. Steven Robertson who plays Michael was great too ... and I just found out today that he does not have Cerabal Palsy and it was just great acting! Brenda Fricker is also in this film and plays the role of home manager very well. The other great part has to be Romola Garai, she was wonderful as a love interest, and I think we'll see more of her on the big screen in the near future. <br /> <br /> The thing that matters This film is not just about the synergies between the two main characters, but also about the script, which is so funny it literally burns! I can still repeat some of the lines in my head. <br /> <br /> The photography is good, albeit very dark, but it does capture a specific region of Ireland. The music is great in this movie too, as well as the selection of songs ... the use of the Johnny Cash cover of the Nine Inch Nails track 'Hurt' is inspired !! <br /> <br /> If I had to sum up this movie in one word ... that would be 'emotional'. This movie is very funny ... and then it is very sad! I still can not believe that two days after watching the movie I laugh and almost cry! This movie is amazing ... and I hope it goes a long way! Although I can not see that, the advertising budget is probably very small! <br /> <br /> So look at it! I urge you ... you will not regret ...
