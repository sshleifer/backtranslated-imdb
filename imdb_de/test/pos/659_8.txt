I was about 13 years old when I camped near the McCloud River, near Shasta, when this movie was filmed. My family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon when Vincent was filmed as they walked down the river. One small thing ... the scene in which they pulled it out was actually the place where it flowed down its river. And if the stuntman missed the net, there was a 20 foot waterfall, about 1/4 mile on. <br /> <br /> Anyway ... I watched him then and did not understand. Only years later I saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of the film. It's a pretty powerful movie and certainly a good job from Jan at such a young age. His film career never went as expected, but later he found success on television. I wish this movie was available because I would like to see it again.
