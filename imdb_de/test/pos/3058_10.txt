I saw this movie when it was released 50 years ago in the smaller cinemas in the UK. and the memory remains of a great music and the tragedy of the plot. I saw it again on video recently. The soundtrack was bad and the picture grainy; but it's one of two movies I saw again the next day, the other is gladiator. The music theme is extremely tragic and you know from the beginning that it announces failure or death. Certainly one of George Sanders best achievements; as a man working on the black market to repay himself for what he lost in the war, but the archenemy is waiting; Patricia Roc plays a refugee from Eastern Europe, who is desperately eaten. He is attracted to her, wants to help and falls in love selflessly, but she is too proud and hurt to accept help. Her love destroys him and inevitably the girl and the doctor (Herbert Marshall) who brought the nemesis. The plot is characterized by complex interdependencies whose secondary characters are not what they seem to be. This is a movie that has disappointed critics and fought at the box office; but for the teenager who saw it, and for the retired gentleman who saw it again, it is one of the biggest films (considering his age) whose story is more like an opera.
