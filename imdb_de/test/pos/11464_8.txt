Night of the Demons is a great movie and a great example of how well low-budget can be. Sure, much of it is pretty predictable, but somehow it's still a lot more fun than the crap we see these days as "horror." I give the Gore a solid 9, and the Demons one-liners are really funny. I am still of "Do not look at me!" The soundtrack is well done, I was surprised to hear "Stigmata Martyr" from the Bauhaus! There are also some very nice T & A, as well as some good make-up effects. The second movie in the series is also pretty good, but inferior to the third. The night of the demons may be old, dark and low, but it still has a lot of potential. It's definitely worth a rent. Give a chance tonight, stay away from old make-up! (You will understand, if you see it!)
