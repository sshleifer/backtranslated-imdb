I have read many flattering comments on this film and the only things I have seen together are: "boring" and "unrealistic". <br /> <br /> First, they used real Frickin 'Crocs! How much more realistic can you become? No CGI, no animatronics, no miniatures. Just a crocodile and a piece of meat. Have fun, people! <br /> <br /> There is no question that this movie is starting slowly. The character development, how little she had anyway, takes some time, and I think that this film lacks first and foremost in this film dramatically. I do not want to say that there is much to do. If anything, there are more moments when the crocodile layer is not visible at all and people just wait. However, we know that there will be no relief and that crocodile is just waiting for its time. This had a similar eerie feeling to other films that reach their horror through non-action, such as Open Water (another film that some viewers have criticized as "boring"). I personally believe that viewers who feel unable to feel the tension were surgically removed at birth from the attention span, but that's just me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the characters feel real and the situation is so it could really happen to anyone under the right circumstances. In addition, the deaths are completely real, and sometimes it's a bit hard to look at. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a winner.
