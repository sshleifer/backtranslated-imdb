Things that I like. Steve Zahn as Gus nails the piece and copies Robert Duvall's mannerisms, making him feel good for Gus fans. (Some of the other actors also copy their predecessor style in this series). Karl Urban looks grim and tough, but can also make a joke and smile, as did T. L. Jones in the original series. The equipment, the rifles, the clothes, everything exactly or very close to the period exactly. I will never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon lariat in their Chuckwagon in Open Range. The Comanches actually drive bareback instead of hiding a modern saddle under a Navajo blanket. And they are not painted as politically correct peace-loving shepherds, but as proud warriors. There are a few stupid scenes, but it's better than another way to do something stupid not to win Million Dollar Reality Game Shows.
