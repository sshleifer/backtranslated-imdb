As someone who had driven for hours through the back streets of North London to avoid the terrible traffic jams, this movie was immediately addressed. I'm interested in what London was in the late 70's and you have the basic requirement for my version of the TV Sky! On paper, the film adjusted all the right boxes, and after watching The Knowledge, the film itself certainly fulfilled my high expectations. If it was not surpassed, I was surprised at how different London looked at that time (in the 1990s I lived in Islington, long after gentrification had changed the area). It looked really dirty, grubby and down. While London may still have poor housing estates, the overall feel of the place today is much cleaner, brighter, and more enjoyable (based on what this movie shows, rather than my own memories). The acting, arguably best, grades obviously go down as The Vampire Nigel Hawthorne. Absolutely brilliant! He purposely acts unpredictably, switching between absolute rigor and unreal mind games to trouble the Knowledge Boys as he performs them test by test back to a specific time and place that I find infinitely intriguing. But even if you are not particularly interested in London around 1979, you will still follow the witty dialogues and sympathetic characters of "The Knowledge".
