We open in a doctor's room. A girl is taken to a place opposite the doctor. He asks her questions. Silence follows. He continues to ask questions and ignores the apparently traumatized atmosphere of the girls. <br /> <br /> The story is about two girls who are brought home after spending some time in a psychiatric home after experiencing an "incident" before. Upon their arrival they are greeted by their courteous, too hard-to-see, but so totally evil stepmother, for whom the girls obviously resent. With time at home, the evil stepmother finds new ways to torture the girls. And, to top it off, there's a vengeful mind that's far from helping the girls recover ... <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing. It has a twist, turns and definitely makes you think a lot without making sense. The relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming that it almost makes you cry in some places (I know that I had a tearful moment of two, especially "the cabinet scene"). But what I appreciate most about this movie is the feeling of fear right through to the ongoing credits. The soundtrack is impeccable, the decor in the house and the use of color are fantastic. A pure joy for the eyes. This is an absolute must for all Asian film fanatics. Or a kind of movie fan! A simple 10/10.
