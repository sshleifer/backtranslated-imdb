Once again Doctor Who delivers the goods through the bucket load. It has humor ("You only make it if you come with me!" "Yes, but I make it awesome"), action, monsters (in this case even more kick-ass cybermen), tragedies and scare tactics. In short, exactly what the doctor ordered (pun intended). The way emotions move from one to another is done so well that there is no sense of "going on". So chalk 3 out of the last 4 episodes that made you laugh, then cry and "Eek". <br /> <br /> In terms of character development, this is clearly the key point Noel Clarkes Mickey (and Ricky). As one of the doctor's companions, you know he's going to do the right thing, and maybe even suspect he's doing it. However, it is still an emotional mistake to confirm his future path. <br /> <br /> While "The Rise of the Cybermen" had more of the eerie horror to frighten, "The Age of Steel" is all about blast Like "Alien" versus "Aliens" - both classic, but up different way. Can the series keep it at this level? Let's hope so.
