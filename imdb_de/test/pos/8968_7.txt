Konstanz is maybe this movie his biggest problem. The film begins as a quick, stylish and just fun political satire, but in the second half, the film becomes more serious in a kind of Oliver Stone style. It's also a very serious topic, of course, but I would say the film would have been much better and more effective if it had been made entirely in the same style as the first half of the movie that was shot. <br /> <br /> For a biography and a film about this film, the film is also quite short with only 102 minutes running time. The movie feels like it does not tell the whole story. Of course, the continuation of events following the occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union is hinted at in the film, but the film does not go deeper into it and does not explain much of what feels like a cheap way to just glorify Charlie Wilson without the other side of the coin to show. Even the actual events in the film itself are quite simplified, even if the story is sometimes (unnecessarily) told complex. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the movie would have been a lot better if he had not tried it Sometimes be so serious and overall more light with style and atmosphere. For example, the film should have been more like "Wag the Dog" to find a right combination of satire and sensitive political issues. <br /> <br /> Because of this incoherent style and style of narration, the acting ideas are also mixed. When Tom Hanks plays his character more playfully and hilariously, he's just great. However, this makes it difficult to take his character seriously in the more serious and sensitive / shocking moments of the movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent as he plays in every movie he plays. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. Most other actors just seem to be running around in this movie just to be in the movie. This is especially true of Julia Roberts, whose character I found too mysterious to have a clear sense of the movie. It made a superfluous impression on me and is therefore really forgotten in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that the movie is a bad watch, it's actually pretty good and pleasing too, but if the movie had dared to be a little edgier, the movie would be a better and better one had also been more effective film, where he obviously wanted to achieve something. <br /> <br /> 7/10
