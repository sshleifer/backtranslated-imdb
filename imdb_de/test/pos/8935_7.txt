Only the British could make such a movie and make it so tastefully charming! Betty (Brenda Blethyn) wants something more out of life, but she does not know what she realizes when she falls in love with her childhood friend, Boris (Alfred Molina), who owns the local funeral home. An American mortician (Christopher Walken), who "wants to bring fun back to funerals," moves with his assistant (Lee Evans) in this small Welsh community and wants Boris with striking, thematic funerals to fight for his money. (Star Trek funeral, anyone?) Brenda and Boris decide to stage Brenda's death and burial, with witty results. A very entertaining movie - if you're a fan of British comedies like "Waking Ned Devine," you'll love it.
