Where should I start? I saw this movie for the first time in 1995 and had no idea what to expect. At the time, I was searching for films in which Elijah Wood had starred, and this film was highly recommended. I sat down and watched the movie once and did not know what to think. I saw it a second time a few days later and the locks were just opening. Never in my life had I ever really cried when I saw a movie, and I made a bubbling movie that I had driven next to and on an emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> There was such an emotional chord in me on many levels, the intense sadness and joy we see in the movie, the wonder and innocence of childhood, the yearning for a time that once was, but not anymore. This movie reminded me more than anything of my childhood (except for the abuse) at a time in my life when, a few years ago, I had cut off my childhood and did not even really notice. I gave it up and went on a life that is completely lacking. The radio flyer woke me up and suddenly realized what I had given up, without realizing it. From that day on, I immediately set out to change my life and myself, and so did I. <br /> <br /> That sounds crazy, but basically I rediscovered my inner child. I started a path that lasts In the last 6 years I have changed so much, so much for the better, to hug and live this part of me. I found out who I really am. I do not think it was just the right movie at a crucial moment in my life. The Radio Flyer has really done something very special, and I still consider it an incredible piece in every way incredible movie. <br /> <br /> Finally I can not forget the music. I'm a big fan of Hans Zimmer and that's one of his best works. The sheer breadth and depth of the emotional expression he has put into the film music of this film is a big part of what makes the movie what it is for me. Like subtitles of a foreign-language film, its ascending music is a crib sheet for the intense emotions that come with this film. Find the soundtrack at any price. Unfortunately it was deleted long ago. I never expected to find him. Amazingly, he did so after talking to someone I met on a Hans Zimmer Fansite guestbook. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, Get carried away by the emotions, do not get stuck in trivial nitpicking of the end, be this kid again
