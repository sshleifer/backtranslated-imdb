Apart from the "I'm so sure" and "totally crazy" this is one of the sweetest and lifelike romances that are portrayed in the film. deborah foreman (where is she now?) as julie and nicolas cage so horny are as classic as romeo and juliet, tony and maria, jake and samantha ... you can not fall in love with them. and the soundtrack - the plimsouls, sparks, furs, flirts and of course modern English - is also outstanding. For fans of films about young love, I would also recommend the real movie to all the real girls of David Gordon Green.
