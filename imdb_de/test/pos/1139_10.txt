If you hear Ween (The Pod, God / Satan), then you know what's going on with Split. I found that watching the movie under the influence of LSD has helped to perform fantastic editing tasks with audio / video tracers. The action was important only from second to second. The acid helped to interact with the sounds, subliminal and overall tempo of this masterpiece. Do not bother writing about something out of your reach ... There just are not enough of these great independent attempts at expression on its rawest amateur level. I dare everyone to make a film that can equally be confused with my head and change my perspective on the visual arts and the reality of the world. Not to mention the many realities that this human mind has not yet explored. I love the vision of Chris Shaw. I also appreciate the textured terror movie "The Begotten" by E. Elias Merhige.
