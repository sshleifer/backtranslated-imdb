"Showtime" is a funny movie with the jokes Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents and Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: At the beginning of the film, Detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a television business to break some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray (Eddie Murphy), a police officer, tries to arrest Mitch without knowing that he is a police officer. During this scene, many funny things happen that catch the attention of TV producer Chase Ritz. She is so excited about her shared adventures and decides to shoot a TV show called "Showtime" with Tray (the cop) and Mitch (the detective). But that's just the funny part. The rest is strictly exciting and active. There is a foreign man who sells and manufactures extremely dangerous weapons. While they play LAPD on the show and do it in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have quite a bit of adventure in this story. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give seven or eight.
