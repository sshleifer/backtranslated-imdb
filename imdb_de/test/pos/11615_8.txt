When I first entered this movie, I knew two things about it. I knew it was a real extreme movie and I knew it was something artistic. Both appeal to me, but taken together something can be truly unique. And that was damn right, no doubt unique. As I said above, it's an artistic movie. The way they used an intense sound reminded me of an Aronofsky movie. Visually, I have not seen anything like this. The cinematography and lighting were very good. The movie is seriously using visuals and sounds that are better than anything I've seen lately. Above all, considering the experience of these young filmmakers (couple 20 years), you really have to take their hat off. <br /> <br /> The film is not easy to describe or discuss. There is no real story. You could say it's about the right and left sides of the brain and how they control your life. There are four segments or four ideas that come to life through visual and auditory extremes. There is a lot to hear and there, but it is mostly a non-linguistic movie. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the shortest and it revolves around a naked body and an eyeball. Try and guess what happens. The second segment is my favorite. It's a brother and a sister (who looks a bit like Sarah Silverman, but with bigger breasts). The brother is crazy and the sister is a whore. I would say this is the most extreme of all segments and the best done. The gore effects in this one were great. The third segment revolves around a group of naked people messing it up with Mother Earth. It's probably considered the weakest in the group, but it's still smart and well done. The fourth segment is probably the strongest in the film and I would say the deepest. For me, I have to look at it a few times to understand what is really said. I know it fights Christianity in a way that would most likely ruin or throw your mother. Try it. Subconscious cruelty was recommended to me and I am proud to say this is now in my film collection. It's extreme, violent, bloody, very sexual and surprisingly pretty thinking. The next line, of which I want to say now, was used in almost every review that I have read for this film. "This movie is not for everyone." Now that's not the truth. If you're into extreme movies and / or just a movie lover who wants to see something different, take a look. 8 1/2 outta 10
