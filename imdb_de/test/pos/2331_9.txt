A surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure, in which Kelsey Grammer (presumably in his first major role in a feature film) acts as an unconventional submarine commander of the Navy, but who wants to operate his own nuclear submarine. He has earned it by playing in a series of war games against the US Navy with a crew of untested, questionable and amiable men (and also a woman). <br /> <br /> Director David S. Ward ("Major League") and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and optimistic comedy that tries to make the film understandable, which they do very well. Second, apart from the Grammer character, most of the crew provide the humor of the film, which is treated like a double-edged sword. Three minority members - Harland Williams, Toby Huss, and Rob Schneider - provide the funniest scenes, including weird gestures, imitations, and personality. <br /> <br /> "Down Periscope" is more than a Navy version of "Police Academy" or "The Dirty Dozen". What the movie does is get the job done the right way, and I liked it.
