The reputation of "Cold Mountain" gave the impression that his director Anthony Minghella deliberately tried to outdo himself, and his own movie he tried to beat was the virtually impeccable "The English Patient" of 1996 Comparison of the two films, the premise is quite similar. We have a passionate love affair between two people who are in a turbulent wartime, and treat the war more or less as a background disturbance while trying to be in their arms again. The main differences are that Nicole Kidman's character is not married, Jude Law's deserter, and the conflict is the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> "Cold Mountain" is more historical and watery milder than "The English Patient" say, and it's more on the level for people who want a simple love story with a kind of external turbulence that causes a problem , It's a shorter movie that's a plus for people with less patience. However, it is not as spectacular or original or really engaging as "The English Patient". My * only * big complaint about "Cold Mountain" is, surprisingly, the love affair between the characters of Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Amazingly, her love was the least interesting thing in the picture. You have no real relationship; We do not feel any real passion for them and the passion we see is more physical than emotional. I was fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Oscar winner Renee Zellwegger, as well as Jude Law's journeys through land avoiding vigilantes and enemy soldiers. If Minghella had strengthened the meaning of the love story, I think he would have a better picture. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is entertaining, even if the love story is uninteresting. The civil war sequences are absolutely great; They belong to the modern tradition, which portrays the war as terrible and dehumanizing. The reenactment of the Petersburg campaign, which detonated tons of explosives from the subsoil and followed them with close combat, is frightening. Minghella does not hesitate to show blood and blood in an artistic and rational way, and he is not afraid to show innocence and life in these scenes. There are moments when both women and men are killed, often by crossfire. And there is more to it. But the sound design of the film creates tension. There is a scene where Inman and another deserter prepare a meal by sawing off the head of a dead cow. We do not see the cutting, but the sound effects of the blade going through bones are sick. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to congratulate the actors on the performances. Jude Law was great in the movie and deserves the Oscar nomination he received. I feel that Nicole Kidman deserves one too, even though her character was a bit flat. Renee Zellwegger had the most personality and screen-stealing atmosphere. And then there are only the small parts that really help to complete this stylistic world and create a terrible time in America's past. <br /> <br /> Maybe "Cold Mountain" would have been better as a war picture, but definitely It would be spectacular like "The English Patient" if its love story had been inspired with passion and passion by screenwriter and director Anthony Minghella. It is a very enjoyable picture, it does not bore me and I recommend it. All I'm saying is that the love story - though a central plot point - is a bit gentler than it needs to be, and all that's around it has really worked.
