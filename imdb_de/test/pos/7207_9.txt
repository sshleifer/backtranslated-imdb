For those who do not know, the Asterix books are a hugely successful series of comic books about a village of indomitable Gauls that can resist the invasion of Caesar thanks to a magic potion that makes them invulnerable. There were several animated features (just one of them, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix, which captures the wit and spirit of the books despite an original screen story), before Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu starred in two live action adaptations, the have proved themselves colossal throughout Europe, but have made no impression in English-speaking countries. <br /> <br /> The unabridged French version is great fun, but unfortunately does not seem to be available in a version with English subtitles outside the UK DVD. While there is still no sign of a US movie or DVD release, the Miramax version of Asterix et Obelix: Mission Cleopatre is also on this DVD (and has been aired on British television), and you never suspect what worked (at least 21 minutes passed) and dubbed into English. Maybe Harve mistook him for a Hong Kong movie - after all, he never saw a foreign movie that he did not believe could not be improved for a few years by a lot of editing and regulation. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix Contre Cesar were lovingly translated into English by Terry Jones from a very good translation script, but otherwise unchanged, that's not Miramax's. The results are not good. The film was the best attempt to bring the book mix of slapstick, anachronisms and classic humorous side effects to the screen, but many of the classic references have disappeared (such as the Great Raft of the Medusa Gag or the Cyrano de Bergerac references) Depardieu), besides anything that appears too French or could slow down the picture, with the result that the first 20 minutes are now a real Slog. Several punctuation sequences are missing, Depardieus Part was cut (his part was already quite small due to serious health problems during the shoot: the US version was partially digitally reworked to alter the original's unhealthy paleness!) And as usual Dubbing because literal translations do not fit into English correctly, lines are either rushed so fast that they are not funny anymore, or the dialogue has been completely changed (some of these changes are admittedly funny, like a character dreaming of a world in which he is His lips could move in French and hear the words in English. <br /> <br /> Not an absolute disaster, but very disappointing, considering how good the full version is. It would be nice to think that Miramax is a Shaolin Soccer and publish both versions, but since they've been putting back both films for two years after paying them $ 45 million (another classic case of Harvey's notorious chronic buyer: gee, wonder why Disney was so overpowered) and still have no release plans, That may just be too much wishful thinking. <br /> <br /> It's such a pity that making such an accessible and entertaining movie now is only available to non-French speakers in such a clumsy Bowdler version. It seems as if the brave Gauls defeated Caesar's legions, but they can not be beaten with the Miramax pedalboat.
