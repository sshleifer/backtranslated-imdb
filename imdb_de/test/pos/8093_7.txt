Most of this film is an alternate witty and brutal satire about Nazism and fascism that emerged at the height of the success of these movements. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the final moments of the film, Chaplin renounces the semblance of making art (not to mention the comedy) and switches completely to propaganda. And no anti-Nazi propaganda, but some of the most mawkish and idiotic "progressive" propaganda Hollywood has ever had to offer. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that nothing we've seen so far suggests that the barber himself is able to make the speech that we see him holding (ironically) a disturbing wild-eyed fanaticism); It is not permissible that such trifles affect the message.
