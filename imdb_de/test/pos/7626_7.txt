I was 9 when I saw it on TV for the first time. on a Friday night. I remember the full-page ad in the TV guide with the image of the Rex. It's amazing how some things are remembered after 30 years. Anyway, if you're a kid who likes monster movies, this one is especially entertaining, especially if Boone and Keats rage each other. Special effects are not Harryhausen, but it's worth one and a half hours if you find it somewhere on Late Night TV. For some years now, I have not seen it for some reason that these cable TV classics are fading. If you catch it late in the evening, do not be too critical, just grab some snacks and enjoy it. It might be cheesy, but I thought it was a lot better than the Kong remake that appeared in theaters a year ago.
