Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamatha Bhukya plays the 15-year-old Vanaja, who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father. If she wants to succeed in life, she must overcome the commitments of low castes and poverty. <br /> <br /> I went into the movie and expected the portrayal of a miserable girl being crushed by society. That does not show us "Vanaja". The young woman is attractive, intelligent and ambitious. She will not accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to succeed, and it's never clear she will not be successful despite the adversities. <br /> <br /> The acting that Mr. Domalpalli draws from his group of amateurs is a miracle. Mamatha Bhukya plays a prominent role in the title role, and Urmila Dammannagari does an excellent job as Ms. Rama Devi, the wealthy landowner who used to be a classical dancer. In the film, Vanaja learns South Indian classical dance as in real life. I could not say how well Vanaja danced to Indian standards, but the many dance scenes were intriguing. (Do not think Bollywood - that's classical dance, it's also very different from ballet, because in ballet, the dancer lifts her heels off the floor, and in the case of Sound Indian Dance, the heel is the main contact point.) <Br /> <br / > This is a movie that should not be missed. It will work on DVD, but better on a theater screen because dancing is more effective. However, if DVD is the only option, you will see it this way. Just be sure to see it.
