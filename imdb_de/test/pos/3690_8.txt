But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that is just the beginning. <br /> <br /> I am not sure that a description of the movie and the plot will lead you to look at it. Suffice to say that it has something to offer to virtually everyone: death, singing, a sparkling suit, cell phones, a small person (actually a pretty woman), a drawbridge (modern, not medieval), a boombox and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic. And Barry Manilow. <br /> <br /> You must trust me when I say that 50% of you out there will hate this movie because the absurd gene is missing in your DNA composition. It's not your fault; it's hereditary The other 50% of you will probably want to switch channels after 20 minutes, but you MUST keep the watch. <br /> <br /> In the end, you might wonder why you've seen ... but keep in mind this absurd thing. It should grow on you. It is a test.
