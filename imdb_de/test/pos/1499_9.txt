Most of Chaplin's most famous films are full length. And I suppose most people have seen at most a few clips of him playing in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is a pity, because some wonderful shorts are waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> If anyone watches this movie, he has an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself selected these three short films and lined them up with some narrative about this 1959 feature film. That's great for several reasons. First, in Chaplin's first films from 1914-1915, his character of the Little Tramp is still in the earliest incarnations or is absent. And even if he was there, he was often mean and selfish - something very alien of the Little Tramp we love. Secondly, as the selected shorts were in great condition, watching this movie does not make you worry about seeing scratchy movies with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that are not action-packed (a common problem). <Br /> <br /> If you want to see Chaplin's shorts at its finest, give this movie a try. It is sure that you will get some excellent laughs.
