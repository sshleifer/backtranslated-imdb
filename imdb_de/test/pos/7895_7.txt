"Joe" is one of those movies in which, though you think it could be going smoothly, you like beating her ... I can not make an analogy. It not only showed that America's longstanding concept of unity was controversial, but also the various aspects of our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) is the ultimate flower child while her father Bill (Dennis Patrick) is a clear leader. One day, Bill accidentally kills Melissa's friend. Immediately afterwards, Bill meets Joe Curran (Peter Boyle), an ultra-right, angry racist who works hard. As a result, the two more and more connect with the hippies, the Bill feel uncomfortable and hates Joe. But in the end everything has serious consequences. <br /> <br /> Although some parts of the film are a bit dated, it is a good juxtaposition of America's two sides in the Vietnam War. And rest assured, the residual effects of everything that will probably never disappear.
