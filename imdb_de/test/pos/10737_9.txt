I'm lucky I saw a wonderful movie with two wonderful actors. "Kramer vs. Kramer" was great for me because I think I could contact them. Although I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. To have two parents you thought were happy and in the end hated each other is the worst thing. Through this movie, I believe, I realized that my parents are human too, and they had as much pain as my sister and I did. Yes, it is outdated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend it to a lot of people, because I think most of them can relate in a way. There are fun, sad, happy and restful moments that are awesome with these great actors. It's a good movie and deserves more recognition than a 7.5. <br /> <br /> 9/10
