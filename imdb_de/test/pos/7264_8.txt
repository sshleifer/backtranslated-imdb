If you like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, chances are good. Although I suspect that a few British in-jokes (such as two London characters, Dixon and Winterburn, are named after Arsenal football players) may be lost to some, this is still a gaudy entertainment that has been shown to be vibrant with vitality. Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are all excellent and bring depth to their characters, and the interaction between the two protagonists is always well judged. In fact, Scott's direction is very safe, considering that this is his first feature film, and he proves he has the talent of his father to calm us down in a strange environment. <br /> <br /> I convinced myself. I will see it again!
