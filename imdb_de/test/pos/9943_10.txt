Although many people have mixed feelings with this novel Giallo thriller from Argento, it is still a lavish testament to the cinematic brilliance of Argento. A young opera singer has her first outburst and suddenly finds out herself is the subject of obsession for a crazy madman. <br /> <br /> In a way, Opera is like a modern giallo attack on Phantom of the Opera, mixed with all the gorgeous style and color that Dario Argento would expect. Argento relies on original camera techniques, recurring symbols (like these ravens!), Gothic atmosphere and really gruesome murder sequences. Above all, a scene (which includes a peep hole and a pistol) will take the audience straight out of their seats! In terms of the story, the film also creates with tension and great atmosphere of Claudio Simonetti's beautiful musical score. <br /> <br /> The cast makes for a satisfying performance. Cristina Marsillach is good as our lead actress. The late Ian Charleson makes a nice turn as a director, as do Urbano Barberini as an investigator, Daria Nicolodi as Marsillach's agent, and William McNamara as Marsillach's unfortunate lover. <br /> <br /> Opera is the last day of Argento and maybe the last of his great works. It's sure to delight his fans and even create some new ones. <br /> <br /> **** from ****
