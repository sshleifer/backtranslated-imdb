Let me first say that although I appreciate the work of Mike Judge in general, I was only lukewarm in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill and Beavis and Butthead. I generally prefer a smarter comedy, and that's the irony of idiocracy. In a future world in which the embodiment of the views of Beavis and Butthead, the deepest instincts and intellectual faculties form the framework of a chaotic, chaotic, half-crazy Max Blade Runner Company, in which the imagination of every trailer miller Reality becomes, a man with average intelligence threatens and is accused of talking gay, and the mob mentality takes over. And this world is also hilarious. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is obvious that the executives of Carl Jr., Starbucks, Costco and Fuddruckers are appalled at the twisted values ​​that their products reported in 2505. <br /> <br /> There were some missed opportunities with the film, and the relationship between the time travelers - the other was an average intelligence woman worried about the retaliation of her friend (pimp) - could have been stronger; The chemistry is there. And in the future there will not be so many women. <br /> <br /> I went with a grin on my face, but the experience is a bit better than the memories. So it's kind of a popcorn movie, and it's fun to revisit the video. Recommended! For your information, stay for an extra scene.
