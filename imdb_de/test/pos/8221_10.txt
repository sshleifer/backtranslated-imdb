I saw and recorded this idea on TV. My daughter played it over and over. I borrowed at work and everyone was thrilled. It's just a brilliant physical comedy. Bill performed here in California (he worked and lived in New York) and performed the Regard of Flight on stage. I was able to take my daughter and her friend with me to see this brilliant achievement. Bill was honored with a federal grant, and my daughter wrote him a congratulatory letter, and Bill was so kind, her one, make a note and attach a photo. <br /> <br /> People ask me, and I can not decide if he's a comedian and actor or a clown. Actually, he is all three. I really wish that was on DVD, my band is lost.
