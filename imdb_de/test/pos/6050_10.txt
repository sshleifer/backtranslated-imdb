Semper Fi! I saw "The D.I." 1957. Two and a half years later I joined the corps. <br /> <br /> Web and Company got it as good as in '57. Boat in the year '59 was in fact very similar to the boot camp shown in "Full Metal Jacket" - yes. A black recruit in my train was called "Snowball." I was called "stick" because I was as thin as a rail. Each recruit had a nickname, some quite disgusting, who stayed with him through his service in the corps. SOP was when you messed up or pounded your ass. "Drop and give me fifty," had to be ho-hum. Then it turned out, "Let me and give me two hundred!" We stupid MoFos alive when we meet the fight, 200 years of experience were anchored in this "sadism", and everything that the DI had or said he had a purpose <br /> <br /> A bad DI is killed by grunts, a good DI, although he seems to be the biggest asshole in the world, keeps her alive, she can not kill the enemy if They are dead. <br /> <br /> If you did not know, the Marine Corps has one main task: Kill the enemy PFD. <br /> <br /> Everything else is pure Bravo-Sierra. <Br / > <br /> MstGySgt WHT, USMC (ret)
