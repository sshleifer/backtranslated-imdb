I'm not a huge Disney fanatic, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into it, so we've built a whole collection and this is one of my favorites. We only saw it a few weeks ago and have seen it for half a dozen times! OK, as others have said, not the most complex or imaginative actions, but there is more than one movie. <br /> <br /> Great characters, Phil Harris steals the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind. The music is great - my disabled son always insists that I lift him up and dance with him to "everyone wants to be a cat," that says it all. And "Thomas O'Malley" is just as enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why some people in this movie have such a downer, except for an aversion to cats! And yes, it needs a few keywords from "101 Dalmations" and maybe "The Lady and the Tramp" (I have not seen this for a long time, so I will not compare them), and in some ways better during "101 Dalmations" is, "The Aristocats" for me is much more pleasant. Is not that what these films are about? <br /> <br /> Apart from "Peter Pan" (which is now a 10/10 movie), this is my favorite Disney movie. My 7 year old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it, so you can not ask for much more from a family movie. <br /> <br /> Excellent!
