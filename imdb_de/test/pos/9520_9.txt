Or at least you feel pretty high after this movie. It's the kind of movie that the word "rollicking" really can be applied to, though it's word-for-word in that totally laid-back, intelligent and open-minded way that belongs to the French. No, Catherine Deneuve does not spend the entire movie (sorry to disappoint all Puritans with an agenda) .. but the one scene I'm referring to involves all members of a wedding party - AND it's a musical number! Anyway, everything fits together seamlessly, and the unusual, bright, colorful family (Deneuve's mother is a lesbian, Deneuve, her live daughter) entertains and annoys us in turn like real families I do not want to say too much about the end but Deneuve marries a man who is about twenty years younger. This is absolutely believable if we see how the relationship evolves over time and, of course, if both are pulled closer together. The end is a happy one; and like the rest of the movie, satisfying whimsical and perfect as well.
