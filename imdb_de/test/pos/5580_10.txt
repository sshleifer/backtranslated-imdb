This is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential of all series. The production values ​​are in a class of their own. The characters are rounded and interesting. This is entertainment at the highest level. Some of the extraterrestrials are quite grotesque, but there is an underlying sense of humor that makes them unavoidable. I hope this series lasts many years and has many spin-offs. Science Fiction had a bad press, some are eligible, but this is really an outstanding science fiction series, and I thank Henson for that. Top marks.
