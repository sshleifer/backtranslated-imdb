Meatballs have been a staple in my family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since then. Bill Murray is at his best and touches most in the scenes where he finds a lonely boy and makes friends with him as he leads his CITs one after another mischievous plan after another! The characters are fun and crazy and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other. This is not another dirty, stupid teen sex party. It's funny and cute and just fun. Anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves. It is a must. Watch out for Spaz - he's by far the best character! (Especially during the Campsocial - while Bill Murray pegs it for the camera - just watch Spaz dancing with the poor girl he dances with!) One of my favorite comedies of all time!
