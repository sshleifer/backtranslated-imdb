OK, maybe it does not deserve an Oscar. Or a golden ball. Or a reward for that matter. Acting is not outstanding, there's no reason to give credit to the director, and it's just another 21st-century semi-bloody Slasher movie that most people consider decent. Or maybe terrible. But in my opinion it does not matter. And that's because I had a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, the first 40 minutes are pretty slow, but as the movie progresses, you'll like something if you're like me and everyone else should be watching this movie. And that means: looking for 2 hours of fun and mindless violence. (And a crazy end that I can not ruin.) Yes, there are many flaws in this movie, but do not be fooled by the cast list on the front page. Hilton offers a decent performance that nobody saw coming. Even her biggest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us with her barely credible acting skills and a striptease that was not as bad as anything an online pop-up promises of her, but still not unbearable to fast forward or turn off the DVD. <br /> <br /> The violence in this regard surprised me; Nobody in the school or on the horror board talked about it as "these new movies called" Saw "and" Hostel ", but I could say for sure that" Wax "was more graphic than Saw and some death scenes were actually quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I'm not surprised that House of Wax has not found a spot on the IMDb Top 250, but it's definitely worth a look.
