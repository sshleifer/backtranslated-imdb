This movie was advertised as a comedy, but was far more serious than the trailer. Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but expected more laughter. Great performances by Robin Williams and Laura Linney. Worth seeing, but do not expect to roll on the floor. In the movie, I wondered what it would be like if the character of Robin Williams were a real person running for the president. Would we choose a comedian? I doubt it unfortunately. This honest honesty is missing today. This is a movie that I will add to my DVD library as soon as it appears on DVD. The movie has a heart.
