Pola X is a beautiful adaptation of Herman Melvilles' Pierre; or the ambiguities. "The comments surprise me, I'm wondering what led to the overwhelmingly negative response. <br /> <br /> The shock value is the nastiest thing about this movie - a trivial detail that was torn out of proportion The story is about Pierre's demise - and the subsequent destruction of his surroundings - which is evident in his facial features, his demeanor, and his idiolect, the dialogue and soundtrack setting this movie apart from any other I've ever seen and transforming I've heard about this film and I've seen it open minded, I hope you'll be rewarded in the same way as I. About half an hour later, I felt nervous and nervous but the film is anything but scary in the traditional sense, leaving you with 1000 thoughts, that is e are both unpleasant and exciting at the same time. I know that I am bubbling here, but I feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film. It's the best thing I've seen all year.
