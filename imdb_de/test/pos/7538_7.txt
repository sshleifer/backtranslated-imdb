For those of you who are unfamiliar with Alisdair Sims, of course, he is THE definitive scrooge of all these Christmas song films. (I think I'm really bad, I did not actually see the damn thing). I think those who have seen Christmas Carol and are so used to his figure could see the bells of St. Trinians find it rather surprising. You see, Sims has two roles in this movie. For one thing, he plays hard better, and on the other hand, he is as a head teacher for a private school for girls on the move! Once you've made it through your fat skull, this movie offers many pleasures. The plot deals with the way the school tries to make some much-needed money through a horse race. It's actually a little bit more complicated for the little kids, but I think they would deal with their antics and horses to really see it. The adults could also be stumbled upon the thick accents that are also thrown around. But here, too, the story is pretty easy, the action is crazy and frenetic to really get noticed. PS, the kids look like they're from the Eloise School of Cuteness.
