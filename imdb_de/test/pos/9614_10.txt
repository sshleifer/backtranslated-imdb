Published in the UK as KING BOXER. <br /> <br /> This movie was essentially the FIRST kung fu movie that was widely publicized in the UK. Many of us had gone through Kurosawa's amazingly dense and dramatic games, and were used in the Oriental film to be shot and lit beautifully, with a restrained tempo, all in all, like an album of very fine stills that have just moved. With their widescreen production values ​​for "home theater" and amazing parody replay, and all the rules have changed. KING BOXER was the first to step through the doorway, leaving behind a clearly marked path that others left behind with their feet firmly anchored on the flaming footsteps. Despite hokey conspiracies, pantomime acting, kitschy jumps - Western-style cuts and spaghetti, fast zooms - this movie was great. Beautiful without being opulent and with the most brilliant fight choreography ever seen on a screen. We loved the disgusting violence, the fear, the testosterone. The martial artists among us found some of the techniques fascinating, if extravagant and often stupid. It was so different from the Japanese stuff we all knew, and it had a beautiful acrobatic grace that complemented the crushing violence and bloodied floors perfectly. Glorious. <br /> <br /> The scene "KIng Lear" was a milestone in Schlock at the time. "You cruel bastards ... my **** !!" Now it is less shocking, but still a bit brave. <br /> <br /> We did not notice that women in sight were absolutely one-dimensional. Having seen more films of this genre, he now stands out like a sore thumb, but at the time it did not matter. All of them. Take a look at that and remember that there was no genre to match the western screens. It was unique and great. It was the first kung fu movie and is still the best for me and many others.
