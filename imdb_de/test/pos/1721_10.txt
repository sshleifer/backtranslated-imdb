First of all, I was a fan of the show when my PBS station started showing it in 1981. I learned a lot about the show and the people who attended the show. This latest issue of Doctor Who really impressed me. The original series, also called classic series, was made fun of bad special effects and / or shaky sets. Well, that is NO MORE TRUE. The special effects are great, but the writing is even better. You get the chance to learn more about our beloved doctor and maybe a reason why he loves planet Earth so much. Without betraying too much, it's a very rewarding series. Christopher Eccelston brought with him a side of the doctor we never see, a bitter and angry but endearing one.
