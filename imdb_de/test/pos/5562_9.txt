I had just borrowed the Series One DVD collection from my somewhat obsessive brother. I expected to get through the first episodes and return them. I just screamed on the screen that I finished the first season on a cliff edge - just a week later and I've seen it all season. Where I found the time, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This show is great. It's not too serious, it has nice characters that are played well, and the special effects (ignoring the weird puppet here and there) are "extra" enough to give it a polished feel. At first, I did not know that it was mostly filmed here, and it seemed strange to hear so many Australian accents on a sci-fi show - it was amusing for the main character (John) to land in Sydney in Sydney's first season , <br /> <br /> I think the show's biggest strength is the vision the show's makers obviously had. They have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that have explained previous actions, entertaining John's conversations with slang in a fun and informal way. Having seen the entire Voyager and Next Gen series, I do not see much of a rip-off in the storyline - so it's been possible to preserve originality throughout the first season. I hope the rest is so good. <br /> <br /> Farscape is not like any other sci-fi I've enjoyed in the past. I've heard that season four was not as good as the first three, and I'm pretty upset now that they canceled before season five. I hope they revive this show - with the same actors in a movie or another series. It would be a shame to leave as many storylines unfinished as I imagine that I feel deprived of me at a show where so much has been thought to be offended without adequate warning. <br /> <br /> go now ... back to my brother to comfort the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> V.
