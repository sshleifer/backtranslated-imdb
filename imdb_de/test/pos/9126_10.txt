Le Cercle Rouge by Jean-Pierre Melville traces the lives of two criminals: Vogel (Gian Maria Volontè), a murderer who gives the police the slip while being transported by train from one city to another; and Corey (Allain Delon), a thief who has just been released from prison. Fate decides to join these two men for a spectacular raid. In the background, Matei (André Bourvil), the detective bird escapes, relentless in his persecution and sometimes ruthless in his methods. During the film, the viewer encounters other small but intriguing characters, of which Jansen (Yves Montand), a shameful ex-cop and a superb shooter, is the best. Melville has such a unique style that you do not know. I have to see many of his films to win. Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Cercle Rouge clearly consist of the same cloth: the symmetrical angles; the long shots; the silence; the coats and hats and cigars; the quotes in the beginning; the amazing attacks, the fatalism; the unlamorous and inglorious criminal life. Everything that's great in Melville is in great shape here. <br /> <br /> And this time, the flaws did not bother me so much: the illogical, confusing behavior of his characters and the confusing storytelling that hurt my enjoyment. His other films are almost invisible here. Since Le Cercle Rouge went to Un Flic, it does not mean that he got better with time. Maybe I just get used to it and achieve a mindset that does not bother me anymore. <br /> <br /> Melville has made unique thrillers. As old as they are, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than the modern techno-thrillers, where cool thieves use computer systems and James Bond gadgets to distract from impossible crimes. Melville's criminals are not cool: they are lonely, socially impractical and probably know that they can do little more than plan. They are unwanted for society, live at night, and are always one step ahead of the police in a game they know they will eventually lose. There is nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> Astonishingly, the cops are not idiots for a film of this kind. Matei is smart, cunning, patient and even compassionate. He's not an unlikely villain or cliche, he's just an old man doing his job and doing it right. He knows when to use force and when to use brains. Many films could learn from him. <br /> <br /> It is this down-to-earth, unromantic style that makes Melville's films a pleasure and puts him on a special pedestal as one of the great masters of the crime of a cinema.
