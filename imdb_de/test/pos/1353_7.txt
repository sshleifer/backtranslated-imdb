The title role of this western is played by Robert Walker, Jr. He is a young gun that separates with its partner David Carradine after a contract strike against a Mexican general. Carradine and Walker escape their pursuers. Walker encounters the camp of lawyer Robert Mitchum, who likes Walker and makes him a protégé and reclamation project. <br /> <br /> This is the first of two films made by Robert Mitchum with writer / director Burt Kennedy. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. <br /> <br /> Not that the young Billy Young does not have his moments of joy. But it's a tripartite story about the Walker reclamation, Mitchum's hunt for evil that killed his son, and a romantic triangle with Mitchum, Angie Dickinson, and city boss Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of nepotism. David Carradine is John's son. Dean Martina's daughter Deana is in it, Walker is the son of Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones and Mitchum's son Chris plays Mitchum's son in some silent flashbacks. Robert Mitchum had his start in Westernland and always looks good at home in them. Angie Dickinson essentially repeats her role in Rio Bravo. Walker had a brief career playing rebellious teens and doing a good job. I've often wondered what happened to him. He looks like his father tormenting. Maybe he did not want to come to such a tragic early end as his father. <br /> <br /> And that was not enough, because Mitchum fans start by hearing old Rumple eyes singing the title song The Movie.
