I've read some reviews of this movie recently released by Eclectic on DVD. Apparently, the opening titles are in letterbox format, but the rest (most) are full screen. The first release, published in 1982 by Planet Video, is completely in letterbox format. Although it was a primitive publication, the compositions were correct. Later versions had a sharper and better picture quality, but were like the DVD in full screen mode. Any release of this film should be in the form of a mailbox, as it greatly enhances the visual experience of the old Planet band.
