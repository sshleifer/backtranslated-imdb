This is a very "real case" movie that brings you almost everything in your face. I am a Christian and I liked the movie in a way. It was an average acting of the main character, and it was a low budget, as you can see clearly. It may be a bit lengthy but the movie has some pretty nice cars that save it from a lower rating of mine. As a Christian movie, it was pretty good, but maybe a little bit right in the message. The movie works best on a big screen. * SPOILERS * The fight scene with the two brothers reminds of the fight scene between the two brothers in the Christian thriller "Mercy Streets" with Eric Roberts. * End of the spoiler * I give a 7/10.
