Sixth (and last) movie in a box set. Well, it looks like I saved the best in the end. Ghoulies IV. I originally did a review in February but opted for a new one. The Ghoulies series is pretty great. I know there are some people who do not like them, and that's fine. This happens to be my favorite in the series. Yes, I know that the actual ghoulies do not appear and are replaced by two men in costumes. One of them is Tony Cox from Bad Santa. Now for the movie. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Jonathan Graves, the main character from the first film, again played by Peter Liapis, who is now a LAPD police officer and his past of the occult behind him. In the first part of the movie we meet Alexandra (played by the very hot Stacie Randall), who communicates with a demon from the beyond named Faust, who is the dark side of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexandra for a red gem and something goes awry, so she releases the Ghoulies from beyond the grave. <br /> <br /> I think Jim Wynorski did a good job with the director. And the music of Chuck Cirino is also funny. (SPOILER AHEAD) At the end of this movie, the Ghoulies say there will be Ghoulies IV, Part 2 or Ghoulies V. I still hope the sequel will be made and I especially hope that Jim Wynorski will return. I agree with GimboTheGhoulies in it.
