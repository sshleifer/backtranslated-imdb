This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Top 20 of my life. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and cried more since I saw The Notebook. If you're looking for a touching movie with no juicy edge ... this is the place. It is real and powerful. See it and you will not regret it. At first, I was reluctant and just looked at it, because I had to do a school project about language disability. But this movie is so much more than that. It's about life, free and independent of the way the world would hold you down. It's about the disabilities that each one of us has, that keeps us from seeing ourselves, and what we miss, but leaves everything else in the way.
