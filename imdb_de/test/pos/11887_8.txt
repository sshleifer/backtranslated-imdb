This is one of the great modern kung fu movies. Many of the reviews seem to overlook the point that the comedy is sometimes based on a rather subtle (sometimes directly in your face) contrast between the old and the new China. Kara Hui, for example, is referred to as Country Bumpkin and is in trouble trying to adapt to the new, but in the end, to save her families, as an old heroine in contrast to Hsiao Ho's modern military style. Gordon Liu seems to be his Having played role for laughter by declining his serious monk with stupid wigs and a guitar. The final fight is just fantastic and ends up with a defeat for Johnny Wang rather than death. Kwan Yung Moon should be mentioned "invincible armor" for his great racket - just terrific. And Kara Hui makes great spectacles and fights. A great movie.
