The other day I was in Blockbuster with a friend and decided that we are too broke and too lazy to be active. She decided to look closer at Closer, which seemed like a disgusting idea that I had to borrow another movie once she went to bed. Looking around, I did not see much that interested me, but The Doll Master in the new releases. Just on the cover sleeve (A woman with a doll-like face that cries tears of blood) I thought that this would be interesting enough to rent her house with all the lights it was pretty scary. I have to admit that I've always had a bit of doll phobia since I was a kid (and saw a horrible movie called Asylum.) One of the stories was that a mental patient created a doll that would kill people, lame but scary to this time) and the first three quarters of this movie were just right for me. Especially the first half hour was great. The scary, unsuspecting atmosphere made the scene really good, and without moving, the puppets seemed truly menacing. But when they started to move, everything became a bit cheesy. I was a little disappointed when moments that could really be scary made me laugh because of the way they were filmed. For the characters, it's a horror movie. They really do not expect anything reminding. I found that I remembered names and faces better than most of the Asian horror movies I've seen, suggesting that there must have been a hidden character development that I did not consciously perceive. The typical stereotypes are in effect in this movie. Each of them has a kind of character quiz that sets them apart from the others, from shy and quiet Yeong-ha and their doll Damien to the outgoing Bimbo Seon-yeong. <br /> <br /> The storyline itself was pretty cool, although the end where lots of loose storylines came together seemed a bit confused and did nothing for me, although there were some really cool stuff that I did not ruin here. The basic plot is a bunch of kids being modeled as dolls by a famous, retired, old doll maker. You must be decorated in the spooky house (with creepy dolls, some big, small ones), and things begin to evolve as our heroine. Hae-mi begins to explore areas of the house, and some things will happen to the other residents. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would definitely recommend the movie not to watch with too many people, as some moments would probably make you laugh when surrounded by friends, but as something to be alone in the darkness, with the windows and doors open, just in case all the dolls feel like watching with you. It lets you guess most of the movie and allows you to start with wild conspiracy theories, only to destroy them later. If you really care about it and ignore the dairy in places, I can guarantee that you will look under your bed before you go to sleep, and maybe even turn on the lights. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's just me: P As for Closer, it was fine, but I preferred it.
