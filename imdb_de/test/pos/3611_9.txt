"Captain Corelli's Mandolin" is a fantastic movie in itself. It's nothing like the book that could disappoint his fervent followers. By itself, however, the film is a masterpiece. The view is spectacular and the acting is not bad !! Nicolas Cage was brilliant - unlike his usual action heroic characters. Penelope Cruz is great and really holds the movie together. I think that this film has to be judged as an individual project that is not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres has given up the rights to the script, so the film is an interpretation by director John Maddon. Watch this movie with an open mind - you will love it. because underneath lies the touching story of love and war.
