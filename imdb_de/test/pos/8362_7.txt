The journey back in time is weak at best. In this episode, there is a man who has been thinking about the possibility of the date and place of the murder of Abraham Lincoln. He tries everything he can think of with predictable results in the short term. Of course he is thought to be crazy. He is arrested and eventually sent back to the man he tries to stop. Serling was smart enough to return to the present, but is the present the same? This is a kind of predecessor of "The Time Tunnel", where time travelers have the same task every week and overcome what has already happened. Unfortunately, the effects of the distortion of time and future are always ruining the outcome. Unless you have something like Ray Bradbury's "The Sound of Thunder".
