Monster of Mexico I agree that it is the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo films, mainly because of the weak conspiracy and how predictable everything was. However, the Loch Ness monster is a significant improvement, with great animations, frankly, Scotland looked gorgeous. The music is good and the plot is well thought out. There are also some great dialogues, and the speech was fabulous, with Casey Kasem as Shaggy a constant delight and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten a pleasant surprise in a guest role. In fact, my only complaints were some weird accents in one or two members of the voice, with the exception of Easten, whose accent was real, and somehow the Loch Ness Monster was not as well designed as it could possibly be. Overall, a solid and entertaining Scooby Doo movie. Bethany Cox
