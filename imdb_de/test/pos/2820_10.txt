I do not usually like dark / psychological thriller types. SEIZING ME, however, is really an amazing job. The story, the drama, the filming, the psychological issues, the erotic quality and the spiritual understanding are all very complex and captivating. Rose really does play the complexity and displacements of a mentally disturbed woman pretty well. My partner was particularly impressed by the sophisticated way in which the power exchange was handled. It was so intense for us to go through three quarters to get "tea" and I felt compelled to take a shower. The story was gripping, but we obviously were not able to handle all the energy in one shot. (She dives into the dirty and dirty side of people, but does not leave you there). I've spent a lot of time thinking about the characters and thinking about deeper meanings. I would highly recommend this hotel. Be prepared for an experience that you might not expect.
