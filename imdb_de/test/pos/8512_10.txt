People criticize NSNA because it's a low point in the career of Bond God Sean Connery and because it's unofficial. *** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * First of all, this movie is better than any other Bond movie in which an actor other than Connery appears, anything below average in my book. Sean Connery is the only real Bond, no one comes close to his tenacity, his looks and his sex appeal. Yes, this movie is a low point in Connery's Bond career, but he is still the definitely best Bond movie of the 80s. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at age. He did not become a wild mess like Moore, but kept his good looks and tenacity, but got a few gray hairs. So what? He is still the only true 007, and he is so cool and tough as never before. Sean Connery is the only 007. And this movie is definitely worth watching, no matter what anyone says. No gun opening, but you can not have it all right? Great title song.
