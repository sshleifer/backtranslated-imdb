With all the filth outside, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it is true that young love often does more with something than it deserves, but why are not people on "Romeo and Juliet"? Paul and Michelle are models of good behavior compared to them. <br /> <br /> Yes, they run away and build an ideal life, but this is a movie, not a real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who was hit in a bad way. After all, they have sex, but nobody is forced to. The film lets children know that sex can cause babies. <br /> <br /> One thing is the nudity in the movies. The camera does not focus on it, but it is there. <br /> <br /> Paul probably found out the end of the movie. In "Paul and Michelle" they split up for a while. If you do not like the end of a movie, consider it yourself. Alternative endings are not just for DVDs.
