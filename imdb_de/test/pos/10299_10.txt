This is an amazing movie: a romantic thriller with an intricate but perfectly constructed and devastating symmetrical storyline brilliantly supported by recurring visual motifs. Everything is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; But more amazing is the devastating juxtaposition of images, almost every scene has echoes of others. This is a story told in light, color and many parallels. Every time I see it, it fills me with joy. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is great too. As a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown, Romane Bohringer is stunning: Everything about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role than his role in La Haine. but no less excellent: nimble and likeable at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - ah !, Monica Bellucci, well, just put, she plays (is?) The most perfect woman in the world. About three quarters of the way through there is a small scene in which she only smiles. But at that moment, one says more than hours of Hollywood garbage. <br /> <br /> You can not live up to this movie without mentioning the excellent, sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle. However, if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, this is the scene at the beginning of this fabulous breakup, the prospect of which has boringly brought the whole story to mind. But when the moment comes, it is treated so sensitively, so briefly and so skillfully that it makes you gasp while thinking. Only a director with astonishing confidence would dare to underestimate this crucial point. But the trust is justified. Cinema is not much better than that.
