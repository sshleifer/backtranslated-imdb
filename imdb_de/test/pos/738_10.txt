In the 70s, a small Texan filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg led a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget horror films that seemingly developed a small cult over the years. Before I saw his first movie "Do not Look In The Basement," I was not sure what to expect, but I did not expect it to be the only horror in Texas that I thought was better as the chainsaw massacre. I do not know, this could actually be my favorite horror movie of all time. <br /> <br /> We start in an isolated asylum. At first, it seems to be a more relaxed place to become mentally healthy, bearing in mind that all patients are free to walk around and so on, as if it were their house (I think it is). None of them seems so dangerous, just delusional. Residents include a love nymphomaniac, a 700-year-old woman, a man-child, a spaz, a guy who thinks he's at war, a woman who thinks she has a baby, and one who is a judge holds. One day, out of nowhere, the judge kills the doctor with an ax, and soon afterwards the baby mother wishes to kill the nurse. After ten minutes, the movie looks really ugly. Maybe the new nurse knows what she should do, then maybe not. Giving more away would do more harm than good. It's best to head off and know as little as possible. If you can honestly value God without having to do with horror, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you like Scream, if you like Wrong Turn, if you choose this unoriginal, overproduced, overvalued digital Hollywood trash, chances are you will not see the beauty in this case , Do not look in the basement, a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking. The atmosphere and the graininess fit into the situation and the score as if it were a perfect fit. Unfortunately, good old S.F. He had used most of his good ideas in his first film, though the next entry in his Texas quadrilogy is something of a masterpiece, that is, if you're into particularly vile, common Hixploitation like someone I know. If you fall in love with the first two Brownriggs and need to find out what else he has to offer, read "Do not Open The Door" and "The House Where Hell Froze Over". Do not look in the basement - everything that needs a successful horror, no stars, no budget, no digital effects, just an original story that comes to life in a madhouse with a dozen actors and a gritty, subtle score, of course, the twist , For the real horror fan this is a real horror. 10/10
