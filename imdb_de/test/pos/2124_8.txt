This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They let the film appear partially realistic. I did ballet and this movie got me to continue it. This movie was a bit like a Cinderella movie, but a bit different. A father of 12 princesses gets very ill. His cousin poisoned him and wants the throne. Thanks to the stories of her dead mother, the girls find a secret magical land. It is up to them to save their father and society. With the help of her beautiful prince. It was a funny movie and me and my girlfriend had a lot of fun watching. We really enjoyed it and also enjoyed the Indian speaking parrot. The music was very nice and made the movie even bigger. It had a great classical orchestra. The voices were great and the characters were lovely sweet and cute. I liked it so much, enjoy the movie, it's great for the family. All in all, I would take a look at it again.
