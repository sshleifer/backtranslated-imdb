The film is from the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on it is obvious: dialogue, locations, photography, directing, and political philosophy. The photography is especially confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir, and George Miller, you'll love Oz. The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. This similarity suggests that "Oz" was ahead of its time. The critics of 1967 hate it and the public lacks - the 1960s Australia and the 1940s USA were, in a sense, the place where conformity was important, while this film is very different from what those audiences would have expected, especially after reading the advertising posters. This film will most likely be more appealing to the contemporary audience: it is still clumsy and confident, but in a contemporary European way and not an Australian 1960s style. Joy Dunstan (who later appeared in the Australian television series 'Prisoner') plays her role with less raw passion than her contemporary Jacki Weaver, instead Dunstan's character in this film conveys some of the quirkier strength of Kylie Minogue's most famous Australian women than Charlene Mitchell further developed in the Australian television series Neighbors and later in her career. Men will also enjoy this film, which presents masculine themes in a different way than most other mid-sixties films from the US or even Australia. In particular, Bruce Spence (who later played Tion Medon in "Star Wars III", the trainman in the "Matrix" films and the helicopter pilot in the "Road Warrior" and "Thunderdome" films) plays a key role in the enduring role Solid support for the rest of the cast. For Bruce Spence alone this movie is worth seeing. 7/10 for minor continuity issues.
