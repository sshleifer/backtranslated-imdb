Emerging from the same partnership between Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner, who produced The Champions and Randall & Hopkirk (deceased) - the latter named My Partner the Ghost for the US market - Division S remains a classic example of the action-adventure series which the United Kingdom produced in the late 1960s. Like these two shows, the inner dynamics of two men and one girl seem to point to a progressive attitude toward equality (Dept S also has a black boss), but it's mostly a facade: The launch episode "Six Days" is barely halfway before Rosemary Nichols is asked to step into bra, panties and a (yes, a) stocking to get out of a shady situation. Still, it's an interesting time capsule, though the terrible sense of Peter Wyngarde's character (which astonishingly degenerated even further in the spin-off Jason King) should definitely be spilled.
