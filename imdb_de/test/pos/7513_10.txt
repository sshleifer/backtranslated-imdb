Patty Chayevsky was years ahead of the most successful screenwriters and dramatists in dealing with sticky issues. In this 1971 film he followed Sinclair Lewis and A. J. Cronin (in ARROWSMITH and THE CITADEL), critically examining the world of medicine, though his goal is centered on a special stage: a modern hospital in Manhattan. Chayevsky's view is pretty straightforward: it's the places people are in hospitals to get well, or are they organizations that make money, where people often die of incompetence in one hospital too often (and have to return soon ), I find that the hospital is a very timely and rewarding satire. George C. Scott is Dr. Block, one of the leaders of the Manhattan Surgical Center, a large teaching hospital. He just started his day when he is told that one of the inhabitants of the second year died in the night in an apparent confusion. It seems he was sedated and drugged while sleeping on a bed (he had a tryst with a nurse), and someone manipulated an i.v. that should have included water with glucose (later it turns out he overdosed insulin in i.v.). Soon, Scott realizes that every time he turns around, another employee dies of a heart attack or a failed operation. The key to all this seems to be a patient who came to the hospital ten days ago for a regular checkup and has since lost a kidney, nearly lost his other kidney, and is now in a comatose state (Barnard Hughes). <br /> <br /> Hughes' daughter (Diana Rigg) wants to bring home the comatose father in an Apache Indian Reservation in Mexico. Scott is not totally against it, after all hospital failures almost killed Hughes. In addition, Scott is experiencing a mid-life crisis with the collapse of his marriage and family and his growing doubts about what his job actually does. It's not just a case like Hughes'. The hospital is in a constant chaos where the regular employees (Scott, Stephen Elliot, Nancy Marchand, Stockard Channing) are overworked and overwhelmed and are at war with the businessmen (typical of Frances Steenhagen in a really cool performance). The local community is hostile because of the hospital's expansion plans. However, when they meet to discuss things with Elliot, they turn out to be dissimilar types). Rigg (who falls in love with Scott over the course of the movie) is becoming increasingly confident that it makes sense to leave the madness of the city, and Scott is also playing with the idea. <br /> <br /> Scott was with him acting height in this film, what with ANATOMY OF A MURDER, THE HUSTLER, DR. STRANGELOVE and PATTON under his belt before THE HOSPITAL was made. His fear became apparent when he and Rigg met (she prevents him from killing himself because of his desperation). He can not say whether something is worthwhile in the hospital and yells out the words in the "summary row" from the window. Although he later relaxed a little bit about how good his education was for doctors studying with him, Scott is never quite sure, but he fully accepts his sense of responsibility that others simply reject. Rigg was also at the height of her international fame (if not her acting skills) - her career as Mrs. Peel at THE AVENGERS was several years old, but she was also recognized in the UK as a leading stage talent as one of the sexiest female actresses of the day Time. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors are good too. In addition to refreshing Copenhagen (claiming Medicare / Medicaid / insurance information from comatose patients in the EU), there is Hughes as a religious maniac who wins, and Elliot as a sovereign head of the hospital. There is also my favorite cartoon: Richard Dysart as dr. Elwell. Elwell is a butcher who has found a real home in the Big Board of the Stock Exchange and has campaigned for tax incentives. Anyone who remembers his achievements as ethical types, such as the head of the law firm in L.A.LAW or as a friend and doctor of Melvin Douglas in BEING There, when he calls his greedy Dr. Elwell sees, this underrated actor sees another facet.
