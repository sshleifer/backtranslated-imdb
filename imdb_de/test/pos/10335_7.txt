"Summer of My German Soldier" was one of the many television films that became an integral part of the small screen during the 1970s (others were "Brian's Song", "Sybil" and "Someone's Watching Me!"). It shows a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol), who befriends a German prisoner of war (Bruce Davison) in Georgia from the time of the Second World War. The film shows, among other things, that many of the German soldiers were not really Nazis, but were only confiscated. When watching the movie, I got a real feel for what it must have been like in the South. Can you imagine being a Jew accused of supporting the enemy? <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. I believe that it is always important to show the things presented here. Occasional overclocking prevents the film from being a full masterpiece. Mostly they do it well. I hope that the movie will eventually appear on DVD. With Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine (Patriarch "My Big Fat Greek Wedding").
