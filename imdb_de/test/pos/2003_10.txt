(Possible spoilers included, but nothing critical.) <br /> <br /> I just watched this classic low budget movie on video and was turned off by the energy on the screen. All the actors are proud, especially John Daniels, and have to see another of his films. This movie not only offers great performances, but also creates stylish sequences. When the baron throws somebody out of a window and sees shards of glass falling into a swimming pool that is broken by the fallen man's impact, I love the slow path. The motion photography was used in the cinema of the 70s, dreamy and hypnotic. Cool and funny black guys emit great deposits, while slimy, seedy lumps of white trash have an unpleasant purpose. I love it, my rating is 10/10. If this ever comes out on DVD, count me for a purchase.
