Those critics who have complained that this film is not plausible or has design problems miss the point. This is a wonderful camp romance with lots of play, Gypsies! Dance, gypsy! Music that both sends and celebrates exotic love stories. The buttoned Ray Milland makes a funny slide for a trotter with black hair, tattered scarves and tons of jewelry. The zeal of the character to feed Milland and take care of him is more like the good German housewife Dietrich, as she was played by her vampire roles. As the censorship is in effect, it becomes clear that they only share a caravan under Platonic conditions, with Milland warding off Dietrich's advances with a determination notable for a heterosexual bachelor who could be killed every day. His only excuse is that she smells, so maybe a stuffy, demanding Englishman is indeed a deterrent. In the small role of Milland's young fellow in his secret mission, Bruce Lester adds a note to the camp of a different kind. In the beginning, we are told that the hero honors Milland, and in fact he challenges him. When he meets Milland, who is now transformed into a brown-skinned gypsy with a shirt that's open to the waist after her breakup, his ardent appreciation of disguise suggests that not only is Dietrich in love with Milland. <br /> Despite the wonderfully unlikely characters and processes, Milland's growing love for Dietrich and his acceptance of the non-rational aspects of life are more touching. And when, on his last night alone, before he escapes, saying that each of them now contains half of the other, the two of them have become one, and then it gets dark, then we can assume that censorship has decided to take a break! A jerk - at the beginning Milland, who is said to be English, refers to a lieutenant using American pronunciation. (The English say "leftenant.") Since Milland was British, he must have said so because the American filmmakers feared that the American public would be distracted and confused by British style.
