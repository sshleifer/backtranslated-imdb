This movie is definitely one of the most beautiful of its kind. A story from the Victrion Age of Love and Sand. The depth of the plot is one that will awaken the innermost feelings of love, and hate them with some very interesting twists. This is a must for not only the lesbian audience, but for all viewers. I can not say much more or I will spoil the experience for a new, young audience that may just come out. Another good job for Sarah Waters. It's also a great way for Sally Hawkins to win over the audience, who just have a glimpse of her talent in another Sarah Waters work, "Tipping the Velvet." It is also a must.
