<br /> <br /> When I first heard about it in 1997 with a coffee with friends, I decided to give it a go. The only problem was that it was on a small screen in one of my local cinemas. <br /> <br /> But that did not stop him from seeing a simply great movie with a stellar cast in Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. The whole movie held me in place. <br /> <br /> I just have not found any flaws in this great movie, I recommend it to those who love thrillers. I am very proud to have this in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I do not give that easily).
