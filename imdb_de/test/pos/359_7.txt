CARMEN is the penultimate movie of Chaplin's Essanay and is a parody of Cecil B. Demille's drama of the same title. It is obvious that Demille's acclaimed film did not impress the comedy king so much, which he later acknowledged in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin. He had already done several of them, namely HIS PREHISTORIC PAST and HIS NEW JOB, and would do so until the end of his film career (for example, in A KING IN NEW YORK). <br /> <br /> Chaplin portrays Don José very well and Edna Purviance is as good as Carmen. Do not act as we are used to; Charlie is not the lovable tramp and Edna is far from an innocent little woman, but that was not Chaplin's intention. A BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a weird Chaplin movie, very different, but still contains good material. <br /> <br /> The main story is, albeit very differently structured, as in the original drama. Don José is in love with Carmen, but he is not alone in this field. "Carmen, Carmen, the beautiful Carmen, is loved by all men under 96," but he has the great advantage of being an officer, and here we are; This is the famous story of rivalry, love, greed and honor from a humorous perspective. Thanks to the performances of Chaplin and Purviance, and the wonderful, wonderful music of George Bizet, which I admire very much, this could indeed have been an almost comedic masterpiece. It could be. But though it's a good, pretty good comedy, I do not think it appropriate to blame people who claim that A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is not a masterpiece. However, it is important to know that this is not due to a lack of talent, but rather to conflicts in the business world. When Chaplin refused to re-sign Essanay's contract after completing his final film for POLICE, they took revenge by cutting back all the scenes Chaplin had originally cut from CARMEN. Because of this, the film is a bit confusing and has several pointless scenes that are more annoying than funny, and the movie turned out to be more of a Ben Turpin feature - Turpin played Remendados - than a Chaplin shorts. Of course, Chaplin was desperate when he found out what Essanay had done, and he had to stay in bed for several days. Despite its obvious flaws, A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is the Chaplin fan and admirer of beautiful music.
