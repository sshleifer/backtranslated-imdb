I have not been a fan of Madonna for a long time, but I thought I would comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was wrong. One of them, like Madonna, was pushed into the pan by the critics. They were very wrong and many potential viewers were rejected by the bad reviews. <br /> <br /> First, Madonna does a great job in this movie, which was one of her first. She plays a little blonde in the movie, she is anything but a little blonde in real life. Most critics were a little biased by their singing fame and did not shake them. When you watch this movie, I hope you understand that the accent and the stupidity is just acting. She was absolutely hysterical like the movie. <br /> <br /> Griffen Dunne is another person who was not given a proper review in the film. If you take a look at his filmography, you'll see he's a pretty accomplished actor. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie itself, this is similar to a pretty woman, but came 3 years before the Roberts, Great Success. It's a funny comedy with lots of website gags, slapstick and a liner. Part of the comedy is dead and needs a comedy lover to really appreciate the subtler humor. <br /> <br /> I know, that does not tell you much about the movie, but I hope that helps to dispel the belief. This is a bad movie. It's absolutely worth it to be rented for a fun night of fun. <br /> <br /> peace. <br /> <br /> Gary
