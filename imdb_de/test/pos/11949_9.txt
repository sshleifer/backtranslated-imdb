This is classic 80s humor. If you were a teenager in the 80s, this was a summer hit. It was an early look at the now super stars. This and Better Off Dead are just funny and stupid movies to sit back and enjoy. Anyone can admit that they had a crazy summer when they were a teenager. Even crazy family and friends like these characters. Getting to know some of these characters was so much fun. The uncle, who is crazy to sit on a radio every waking moment, waiting to win a million dollars, the grandmother who only likes the granddaughter and gives the children a bill after dinner, the twin brothers, nothing like that See, and it was a great meeting a lot of fun. This may not be a prize, but it's just a funny movie that gets lost in one afternoon.
