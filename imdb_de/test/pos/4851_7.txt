I'm a big fan of legendary director Elia Kazan. His films are often about people trying to overcome their weaknesses. Be it obsessive love in 'Splendor In the Grass', poverty in 'A tree grows in Brooklyn' or racism in 'Gentlemen's Agreement'. In search of other Kazan films, I came across a movie based on a novel by Arthur Miller. The movie called "Focus" consists of William H. Macy (who happened to be one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern. It deals with anti-Semitism in a very realistic way. <br /> <br /> Macy's character seems to be talking to the bigots in his neighborhood and his job until he touches him personally. That's the key here ... The reason he acted was not because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to take a stand, he acted because he was now considered an outsider, and he started doing the same Looks to learn the same remarks and the same brutal that Mr. Finklestein (David Pamyers) has experienced. <br /> <br /> The film is very well written and well played. Meat Loaf plays a scumbag! The services of Macy and Dern are excellent! It's easier to get involved in life than tackle it. Sometimes, for people to take a stand, things have to influence their lives or the lives of their loved ones ... Only then will some find their moral compass.
