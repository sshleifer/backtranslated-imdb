An adorable story about two evacuees was turned into a nice little movie by the BBC. Most children who like a good story will enjoy it. The characters are played really well by a very good cast. Not sure if our American friends appreciate that, but they are mentioned when Aunt Lou runs away with a beautiful American soldier.
