Although it is generally accepted that one of the first martial arts films is played here in the West, its effect is retrospective. Lo Lieh is VERY cautious and many of the fighting scenes that are often described as innovative (which they were at the time of the movie's first release) are a bit short of what came afterwards (especially after Bruce Lee) tame the current standard by which all others are judged forever). This does not mean that FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH / KING BOXER is anything but a classic in itself because he is. Like many of the main characters in many martial arts films, the character of Lieh for one reason plays most of the film, but when he lets go, he effectively cleans the house. You can not ask for more.
