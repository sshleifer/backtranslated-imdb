Looking randomly at random films is that you never know exactly what to expect and where the next big movie will come from. Recently my watching has taken the form of stapled classics like "Raging Bull" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark", but this time my VCR took me away from the modern conveniences and hit me right in front of Lionel Jeffrie's The Railway. " This is a skilful film about three adolescent children, a mysterious event with her father, a move into the open fields of England, and finally the reward that comes with the mere waving of trains ... At first glance, this seemingly straightforward children's film does not seem Too hopeful because he's been lost to VHS rarity for some time, but in the first fifteen minutes of this movie, you realize that it's more than your usual children's film, "Railway Children" was born at a time when purity was more than just saying "no," when family meant everything, and where adventures around every train track were ready, this is more than one Enchanting movie, he uses amazing film techniques, captures the regular viewer with unanswered questions on the screen and gives three perfect companions for this 110-minute journey. "Railway Children" is a lost treasure that must be seen by families and movie lovers alike. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments that stand out proudly in "railroad kids", who turn this from mediocrity to excellence. One is our three children. Bobby, Phyllis and Peter. Modern cinema assures us that these three children can not provide enough darkness, laughter, and insight into the world around them, but Jeffries' children prove the opposite. From intelligently spoken lines (from drama to screenplay), from sincere friendliness and devotion to this little village, to the final meeting at this stop; These children are more than just kiddie stars that drive a story, they guide us with emotion, persuasive power and a realism that today's kids do not see. There's more fantasy in this little VHS than I've seen in the movie for years. A favorite scene that could have been handled with the general public that I've seen in other movies was the birthday scene for Bobby. The way Jeffries hovered between guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing, making our eyes exciting for every scene and mind. Another scene that caught my eye was when the kids worked on gifts for Perks. When Jeffries asked a man for a gift, he simply said, "No, I will not, I do not like perks." The reaction of the kids is funny? Moments for children and adults. This tiny feature, filmed in the '70s, is a real laugh than most modern comedies. It's a creative movie, paired with great choreography and directing. <br /> <br /> So, as much as I loved this movie, it was not perfect. Jeffries does a great job of guessing what happened to his father, but it felt like the event had taken place, the kids were left in the dark and it suddenly dissolved in the end. More of the father, not much more, would have strengthened his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reactions. There's also a scene in this movie, one of those awesome widescreen shots of the English countryside that's simply breathtaking, but if you look a little closer, you happen to see cars in the background. It made me giggle, but I do not distract much from the overall picture. Cinema like this is painfully missing these days, and strangely it seems that only the British have what it takes to produce it. Films like "Love, Actually" or "Vicar of Dibley" demonstrate the power and excitement of cities in communities where everyone knows everyone and we're not afraid to be neighborly. This is more a topic from which the American public could have more? more understanding of what's happening out there than staying away from your own events. <br /> <br /> Overall I loved "Railway Children". I did not know what to expect when I put it into the VHS player for the first time, but from the opening scene to the exploding move to Perk's birthday, Jeffries showed he could easily handle the most kid-friendly story. His ability to make the children actor real characters, less involving adults and involving children like adults was outstanding. This is a movie that can be considered a strong alternative to any Disney release. The recurrent themes of friendship, kindness to strangers, and forgiveness are blasted through television with grace and power. "Railway Children" is more than just a children's film; This is a function that should be indispensable to the modern view of the audience. Not only is there a great picture for the English countryside, but it teaches (and shows) how life with an emphasis on imagination and courage would be greater, rather than fighting with CGI villains. <br /> <br /> grade: **** Â½ of *****
