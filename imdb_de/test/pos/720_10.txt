If you like puzzles and excitement, you will enjoy this movie. To be honest, it was mostly the part of Adrian Paul that got me to pick it up. I knew almost nothing about the movie before. The plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, begins to play a mysterious puzzle game and tries to find out "the reason". Vern (Adrian Paul) is shopkeeper, also a mystery fanatic, who is also involved in the game. Myth says that when you solve the game, the meaning of existence (referred to as "the design") is revealed. Brendan Fehr's character is a "village idiot" who hangs around in the store and turns out to be more than he seems. All in all, I found the movie pretty well done. And it's definitely an original concept, a rare find these days! Personally, I like puzzles and puns, and although most of them were not very difficult, it was still a funny movie. The rent is worth it. <br /> <br /> So, if you have not seen it, get it! :-D <br /> <br />
