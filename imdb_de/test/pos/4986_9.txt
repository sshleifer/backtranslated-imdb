A kind of Western I enjoy very much when the seemingly weak, who refuses to fight and answer the challenge of the strong, finally decides that there is no other way. There's a great moment in this movie when John Parrish (Glenn Ford) enters the saloon and decides to face the gunman Wade Matlock. It's the kind of scene that applauds the audience. The Violent Men is in my opinion a great western, I would count him among the best. It uses the widescreen screens, a spectacular landscape of mountains. The women have a crucial role. Caroline (May Winn) is engaged to Parrish, but you feel she uses it only as a means to get out there and move east. She wants him to sell the ranch at any price. Martha (Barbara Stanwick) is tired of helping her crippled husband Lee (Edward G. Robinson), but she will do her utmost to have an ever-growing ranch and more power. Meanwhile, she cheats on her husband with his brother (Brian Keith). Her daughter Judith (Diane Foster) sees everything that happens, but feels unable to react because she does not want to hurt her father. Parrish unites all the peasants and uses the strategy he has learned in the army against the Anchor Ranch. As if he had warned Lee: "Do not let me fight because you do not like my way of fighting."
