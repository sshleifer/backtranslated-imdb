The boxer John Garfield (as Johnnie Bradfield) celebrates after winning a championship fight with a drinking intoxication, leading to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter. Although his manager killed the man, Mr. Garfield is accused. When the manager dies in a car accident at Garfield's stolen watch, the authorities believe the boxer is dead. Garfield is still a WANTED man, changing his identity to "Jack Dorney" and moving to an Arizona ranch. There, Garfield meets "The Dead End Kids": Billy Halop (as Tommy), Bobby Jordan (as Angel), Leo Gorcey (as spit), Huntz Hall (as Dippy), Gabriel Dell (as TB) and Bernard Punsly (as Milt ). <br /> <br /> Garfield follows on from the young "Dead End" colleagues who were brought along with their sweet "Granny Rafferty" (May Robson) as an alternative to Reform School. deceased priest "Father Rafferty". Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister, the pretty "Peggy" (Gloria Dickson), who is there to keep an eye on the kids. Of course, Garfield's past comes back to haunt him. <br /> <br /> "John Garfield and the 'Dead End' Kids" combine (thanks to the effective direction and photography) beautiful music (Max Steiner) by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictably enjoyable, the Warner Brothers support team is in great shape. Garfield and the "Dead End" kids are a winning combination. Although Garfield did not make any more films with the "East Side" band, in the studio he had to renew a team with Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan almost immediately for "Dust Be My Destiny". <br /> <br /> The boxing scenes are beautifully staged. The most exciting sequence, however, was that Garfield and four of the New York "kids" (Halop, Jordan, Hall and Punsly) climbed into a huge water tank to swim - which unexpectedly put their lives at risk. Other, shorter highlights include the laid-back Ann Sheridan (as Goldie), the whopping Barbara Pepper (as Budgie) and the young Ronald Sinclair (as Douglas), who lost at strip poker. ****** ** They made me a criminal (1/21/39) Busby Berkeley - John Garfield, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan
