This is one of the best lesbian movies I have ever seen! This series brought joy and sadness of true love. Playing in the 1800s was an amazing look at the lives and desires of lesbian women. The cast has exceeded all expectations! Rachael Stirling is an amazing actress. I have never seen her other works, but her portrayal of Nan made me connect with her feeling that she was feeling her pain and pain and love. What seems most important to me is the connection with the characters in everything I look at. If anyone has any doubts about watching this movie ... think twice! You have to see this series. Well done to BBC! We need more lesbian films in which real love is portrayed and hurt, like this one. I live in Canada and have imported this DVD. I'm so excited to have bought her.
