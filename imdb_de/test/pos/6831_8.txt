A pretty enjoyable hijacking caper set in New Orleans, but in my opinion, it's all too much humor that is too much political intrigue and double crossings and not enough sexy young actors, scenes of vivid colors, original cinematographic style and biting behavior , These aspects together make up a refreshingly daring cinema that makes a whole new set of things seem unbearably boring. Let's hope that SÃ©bastian Gutierrez continues this flair - he looks like a talent to watch out for. The mismatched bundle of little crooks in the film is overshadowed by the investigative partnership of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, whose humor makes the film prerequisites as they are. The two take off their obligatory southern flair as much as the Yanks, and it's a pleasure to hear how these two stalwarts of British cinema are clapping at one another with Lethal-Weapon-like flirting. With a little less politics and authoritarianism (!) The film would be almost perfect, so I give it a good 8/10 and hope that a few people remember a bit better than the box office.
