This soap opera film from 1959 leads us as secretaries into the life and the love of three young women in the publishing world. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years ago. This takes place in New York, while COINS takes place in Rome (Italy). Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first leading role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange is doing well and has some strong veterans in the business, Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau. It's hard to believe anyone could refuse this beauty for some reason, but Louis Jourdan, their heart beating, does just that. They somehow come back to Paul Neuman and reject the great Elizabth Taylor in CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, right? Diane Baker, the third girl in need, meets Robert Evans and dates before becoming a producer and husband of Ali MacGraw, for whom he is known. Hope's friend from home, played by newcomer Brett Halsey, promises to marry her. She also meets Stephen Boyd, a colleague interested in our hope. All three ladies have their drama in front of them. Crawford almost steals the movie. Her presence and her ordinary, strong kid are fun. Experienced actor Brian Aherne plays one of the bosses with a yen for pinching the back of the leading ladies. He is delightfully charming. Also in the cast is Martha Hyer, who was wasted in an ungrateful role that was never really explored. Too bad that I like this actress, who never seems to get the part to distinguish her abilities. She has a crush on a married man in the office who was played by Donald Harron, with whom I was allowed to collaborate in some Shakespeare plays in New York. He is an excellent actor who is also wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's great fun in Technicolor and Cinemascope, directed by Jean Negulesco.
