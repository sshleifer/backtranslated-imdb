It is worth to have a look at the Hindu pantheon before watching this movie. Three main female deities - wise Sita, who foster Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer - as well as three main male deities - Grab Rama, playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender - are all addressed. If you know folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience, it lends richness to the story of today's story. In fact, a fairytale is first performed on stage as part of a lesson in spirituality and then in the film's "real life". "Fire" speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society in which the producers live, and this with a beauty that adds the message to several levels of the viewer's consciousness, giving a profoundly satisfying account. This is the most beautiful movie I have seen in the last decade. We recommend!
