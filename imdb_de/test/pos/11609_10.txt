I was able to see this great movie at the Fantasyfilmfest in Berlin and when I left the cinema, I felt like being drugged * g *! I have seen a lot of films and there are only a few that I would call perfect, like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subconscious cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people who saw it in Berlin left the room, and I can totally understand that, because it can be a shock to someone who lives day by day in his perfect world, dreaming about his dreams without the horror to think of us planet in our lives! I do not think I have to tell you the story of the movie because people have already written on this site! It's a movie that shows everything and more !!! Get 10 points + of 10 !!! It would be cool if you would email people who loved it! So far, I've never met anyone who is as impressed and pleased as me !!! Finally, I'm sorry for my bad English - I'm not a graduated person (and that's a good thing !!! :-))))))
