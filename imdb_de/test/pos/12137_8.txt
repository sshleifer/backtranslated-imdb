Not a bad MOW. I expected another movie based on women's issues but was pleasantly surprised by the moment of tension. Sure, parts of the plot were pretty funny, but for the most part I was advised by the movie. Was the crazy rod connected to the ex-husband, to someone in the tavern, or was it the guy she'd cut off? Daniel Magder was excellent. I saw him in Mom's on Strike and in Guilt by Association, both at MOWs and at him. He is very credible, especially the way in which he challenges his mother, as a preteen usually acts the typical mother (ex-wife) to which both men and women can refer. She was frustrated enough to look real. <br /> <br /> See if you missed it. It is worth it ..
