We have all seen the countless previews and trailers. If you enjoyed Knoxville being turned over by the cops, you'll be thrilled with the opening act. However, I have to warn the masses, I thought about taking my (under 18) son, but I'm relieved that I did not do that. This compilation of disgusting skits contains a few that, though appearing so weird to the adult community, some are not meant for immaturity. These guys have to get a big ransom to endure some of the sneaky stunts that are sometimes played at their expense. In particular, Bam Margera and Hon. McGhehey are disregarded by the group in some special stunts. Enjoy
