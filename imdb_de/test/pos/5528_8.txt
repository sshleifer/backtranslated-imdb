I saw Six of A Kind for W.C. Fields - he's only about 10 minutes in the game and has a long scene, the infamous pool sequence that he made famous in Vaudeville, and some other great moments. Fortunately, the more than 55 minutes are fortunate, especially because of the merry Charlie Ruggles as limping banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He is everyone's foil. He stutters and stumbles for our pleasure. His comedy partner Mary Boland also plays his wife Flora. The proceedings involve George Burns and Gracie Allen. Boland is especially funny at the beginning and the end, but Gracie and Ruggles consume most of the picture. Gracie is funny, but she can also get tired. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie over and over again. I do not remember him once laughing at him (though he's got a great scene with Ruggles, in which Ruggles is desperately trying to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with Fields, where he asks Fields, sell him a sweater, but that's just Fields'). The situation is always funny: the Whinneys are going to California, but to help them, George and Gracie are recruited. 8.10.
