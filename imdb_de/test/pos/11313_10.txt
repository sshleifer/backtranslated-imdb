I really liked this movie. I saw it yesterday in the public broadcasting system. The part I liked was the fact that they were dealing with today's issues, not the future or the past. In fact, some terrorists had taken one or two vans to rent as car bombs. I think what the film could have shown was people in different countries at the same time. It has shown that England or any other country is not prepared for an attack on the scale that they showed. I've never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie, so I can not really say if they usually play their part. After the film, they had discussed this panel of experts about whether this could happen in the US. It was a memorable discussion!
