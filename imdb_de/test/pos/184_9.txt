I saw this movie last night on TCM, all eagerly awaiting, after seeing it last (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto. I told my wife, who had never before seen her, that she had to watch out for the exciting, long camera ride, not the cuts where Veronika was seen on a bus on her way to Boris. In a hand-held frame that certainly stems from the modern steadicam, the shot pulls back and suffers (unintentionally) across the street as she leaves the bus, and shoots between the tanks to cross the road. Then I remember that there are no cuts. We follow her close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously searching for him but not finding him. However, we continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of hunted recruits and their emotionally disturbed wives, all the extras, and each of them is a jewel of fascinating behavior by Stanislavskian. As one might ask, Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky have set up this extraordinary sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street to avoid the tanks, the scene ended abruptly and went back to scenes in the apartment before joining the soldiers and their families at the fence. It seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also reworked. What a downer!
