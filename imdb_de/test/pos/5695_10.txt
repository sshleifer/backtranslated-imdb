BLACK WATER is a thriller that can completely overcome its limitations (an indie streak) by constantly undermining expectations to become an intense experience. In the tradition of all well animal-centered thrillers, Jaws, The Edge, the original Cat People, and the directors know that restraint and what's not shown are the best ways to take a punch. The performances are real and thrilling, the Crocdodile is extremely well made, if you can believe the Black Water website, then because they used real crocodiles and the location of the wetland is fantastic B-grade gore fest croc romp Black Water, but if you want a smart, exciting ride that fears you from the water and wondering what the hell I would do if I built that tree, then it's a must.
