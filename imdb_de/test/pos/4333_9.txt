I could not agree more than with the comment from "Coldshitaction" and how this movie is a masterpiece. I've never seen a movie in which my adrenaline flowed like in this movie, and it usually happened when Bronson ran out of a fire escape with an M-60 and plowed off a gang like a guy. Perhaps the best action movie ever made (no exaggeration), it could really be the best action movie ever made. You should know from the beginning that you expect something sweet when the police let Bronson go and tell him to clean the slums. Once again, genius. And again, Bronson is a bad ass. Paul Kersey is just as cool, maybe cooler than John McClain or the Terminator, he's just a bad ass. And what's great is the fact that he's a nice guy, buying ice cream from a child and helping an old couple before he kills a scumbag. Genius. Highly recommended, if you hate this movie, you are crazy.
