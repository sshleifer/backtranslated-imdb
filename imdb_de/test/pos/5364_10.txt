A great movie for those who just want to relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Scotland. The film takes you on a journey of love amidst spectacular scenery. The performers are "disguised" for the parts they play, so no glamorous costumes or hairstyles in this movie, where the acting is great, down to earth and down to earth Time Definitely for those who own even a tiny drop of Scottish Have blood ..... because it tugs at the heart strings and touches the soul. Something that you can share with your family and see over and over again .................. a true classic that will surely never end up accompanying some of the great movies.
