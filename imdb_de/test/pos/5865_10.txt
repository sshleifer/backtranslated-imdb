I went through the heights. I went through the depths ... cried, laughed and puked my always loving courage. But everything made me healthy. I became a better person because I had undergone this experience in self-imposed humiliation. We can not say every day that we have lived through the worst and, on the other hand, come out with something very similar to our healthy and intact mind. Friends ... Neighbors - unite and be one now. Go out and find this movie and languish in its extravaganzas. Put him up on the mantel and kiss the styrofoam box. Take it to bed. Take it with you when you shop or make blind dates with strangers. You will appreciate all the more for your sublime and uniquely schizophrenic affinity in the cinema. And then they will throw their drink of choice into your face (but you will have the last laugh). I ran into Governor with that little beauty under your belt (and you can do that!). It is always a pleasure.
