This is probably the best movie by director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown to foreigners, which is the case in all Latin American countries, poverty and survival instinct. The hardest hit in this reality are the children, who have mostly left orphans, or who are being abandoned by their poor parents, have to make it into a "dog food dog society", many times in the gap between delinquency, prostitution and crime device. Played very well and with a "no-frills" approach, this movie will come to you. Great story, a must in every collection. The main role was taken by Fernando Ramos da Silva, a small boy who fell into the crime wave and was killed in a raid several years later. I would suggest to people to watch the movie "Who killed Pixote?" So you can get a deeper picture of the life of these characters. Some other characters from the film had a similar fate, others died and others are in jail. Nevertheless, this movie will be remembered for a long time
