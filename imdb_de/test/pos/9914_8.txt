I sympathized with the plight of the first man, Schmitter, whom we see killed in this episode. It reminded me of the discomfort of being a lonely watchman somewhere at night - the kind of work I did just about 20 years ago. Of course, I was never in danger of being burned, as the Colony Chief (Lynch) likes to describe. The monster in the dark, murdering members of a deep mining colony, makes a frightening impression in the first act. We do not really see it in the early scenes and, as many of us know, the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination. 'Big and shaggy' is a coherent description, but it resembles a big, chunky pepperoni pizza that runs like a silicon millipede across the floor - unfortunately a limitation on the budget of the show. This is also reflected in the latest Trek fans' famous matt image, the only way to give a long view of the mining process. <br /> <br /> But the whole theme of this episode is about the interior. and not externally. Sure, this Horta, a newly discovered life-style based on silicon, looks like a senseless monster at first glance. Thanks to the telepathic abilities of Spock (probably the best use of a Vulcan Mind Meld for Plotzwecke), we learn that it is a highly intelligent, even highly developed creature. In addition to Spock's instrumental use of his talents, McCoy can replace his usual medical routine - to heal a creature reminiscent of stones or asbestos. He can also utter one of his most famous lines: "I am a doctor, not a mason!" I found it very realistic in his scene to rejoice over his success, though he can not bring Kirk to share in his enthusiasm - Kirk is too busy organizing results. The episode casts unexpected twists in character and motivation on the audience as the story progresses. Spock advocates the need to potentially preserve this discovered life as Kirk takes his usual stance to prevent the death of red shirts (not half measures, as in "The Man Trap"). But later it is Kirk who, for some reason, withholds himself to fire a deadly blast, as if the heat had eased the hunt and he had time to think about Spock's thought (I think it was during the filming of this episode that That was Shatner learned that his father had died Uncharacteristically for most of the first season, this has a happy ending.The conflict stems from the needs of capitalism, such as the attainment of standard quotas, as opposed to the protection of the natural environment Residents - a version of the space age that protects owls from modern tractors - despite many murders and the feeling that anything could go to hell at any time with a raised phaser, Kirk and Spock somehow manage to negotiate an agreement that all I think that humans and silicates are more rational in the 23rd century.
