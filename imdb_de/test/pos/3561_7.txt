A train holding union soldiers transports $ 300,000 in gold, along with a banker Clayton, who wants to see him reach his goal, but suddenly he is robbed by bandit Monetero. But Bahunda strikes off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he is killed by soldiers. The only clue is a medallion, but Monetero is trapped and would soon be executed. A stranger disguised as a priest comes by (Monetero's bonus) and offers to save his life for half the gold. In return, Monetero gives him half of the medallion, but Clayton notices it and discovers something is going on. Soon, all three will cross for the gold, but also the bank's insurance company and the Monetero gang are waiting for them and waiting for their chance. <br /> <br /> Just look at the opening sequence you know. 'There is a spaghetti western with a winking style and the conviction to sprinkle many references (some well done) from other films (mostly the dollar trilogy) of its subgenre. Director Enzo Castellari is striking and usually light, but there is a lot of potential in many of his big, eye-catching set pieces and his quiet rhythm. By and large, there are a lot of quarrels, fistfights (and many acrobatic stunts) compared to all the vicious shootings. However, most of these stunts are very well done and very enjoyable. When the cannons burn, there is energy to burn. Traditional history sticks to conventional details, but as there is always a lot to do and to do, spontaneous nature ensures that you are never quite sure how it will develop between the three. This leads to many effective exciting moments, clever twists and winks. The humor within the starch script is pretty clever. Giovanni Bergamini's dynamically strained framing and Francesco De Masi's rousing music score, which moves favorably between the light and spicy style. The performances are extremely well balanced and form a striking relationship. George Hilton's shabby and restless curve is solid as an ambiguous stranger. Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his impressive Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes as Clayton gives a well-balanced performance that holds up well. Kareen O'Hara does not have much to do but is a worthy eye-catcher. Gerard Herter, Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli provide support. <br /> <br /> A witty and dignified spaghetti parody / tribute that throws one curvy ball after another and lots of fertile cute dirty antics.
