Although I saw this movie in Korean in Korean and therefore did not understand the language, pictures certainly say more than enough. What I can do with it is the story: Two outstanding swordsmen become friends in their service as guardian of the king. One of them faces the ways of the king and begins to murder important men. The other must follow him. This movie is visually great. The sword fight is great. And the movie has a gripping end. I just hope that this movie will be marketed for western moviegoers. And of course be released on DVD.
