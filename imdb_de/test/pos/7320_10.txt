This is the third three-go shorts the team has ever made, and how many of their early ones are this absolutely hysterical! Now as a DVD in the context of the Three Stooges Collection Vol. 1, whenever I feel like, I look at this! <br /> <br /> In this short film, Moe, Larry and Curly play these three doctors in a hospital trying to help everyone, but boy, in the end they make a mess of everything! <br /> <br /> This short is another of my favorite three-stooges shorts, I'm also a big fan of slapstick comedy and the Three Stooges are the kings of slapstick! <br /> <br /> When I heard that it was nominated for the Best Short Film Oscar, I became really curious. When I heard that it lost, I was very disappointed! <br /> <br /> This short is one of the three-stooges that is by far the funniest. I strongly recommend you to see this hysterical uprising! <br /> <br /> 10/10
