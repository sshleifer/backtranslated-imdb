I remember watching this movie as a child, and I was so impressed that I could not keep my eyes on the TV. This movie has everything for horror fans! This movie did not have any funny moments to expect, a few Liners from Stooge (who was my favorite character in the movie). Kevin Tenney has managed this gem and done a wonderful job on a low budget. Retain them by surviving the night when they were unstoppable killing machines! The effects that are done by Steve Johnson, we are excellent. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror movies on a low budget because, as the old saying goes, they do not do it that way anymore. The sequels were also pretty good, but not as good as the original. This is a must in any horror collection. If you find it, you will not be disappointed
