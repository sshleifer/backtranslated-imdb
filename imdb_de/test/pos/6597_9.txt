This movie was great. It's a documentary on how surfing has influenced skateboarding in the early days. It has interviews with skaters like Tony Hawk (my idol) and Stacy Peralta to name a couple. Dogtown is a so-called "Ghetto" part of California, which used to be an amusement park that was demolished. People started riding beside the dangerous ruins of the park. Soon the Zepher Surf Team was formed. This led to the first real start of skateboarding in Dogtown. The Z-guys were a team of ragged teenagers who loved skateboarding and used the phenomenon of vert skating. They started skating in drained swimming pools. That's just part of the story behind it. It even contains rare recordings of Charlie's Angels of Stacy Peralta making a cameo. I think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. It will show you that skateboarding was not always popular. Even if you are not, BUY!
