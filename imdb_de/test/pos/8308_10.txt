Be ashamed if you give this film a low rating. How can you dislike a movie in which Doug McClure, Peter Cushing, stupid rubber monsters and fights (and for the guys, this woman who was the hangman of the baddie) and one of the Sinbad movies of the seventies, did not wear which my mother often said, "She was not chosen for her eye color"), lava, stupid wigs, and a stupid Victorian drill that's very similar to the old Thunderbirds series? Who looked at this film and carried away, has seen him for wrong reasons. It may be crap, but definitely good crap. They do not do it like they used to, sigh ...
