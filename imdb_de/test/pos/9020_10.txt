I saw this movie a week ago and had to persuade my friend to come with me because this movie seems to get so bad reviews. Sure, it's not human traffic or 'lock, stick ...', but it's not a flop. I think the fact that there are so many big budget films right now means it was ignored, but it should not be. I assume that it should do what it wants to do, entertain us for an hour and a half, and let us be happy and content. I would much rather see it as "The Mummy", which looks boring. And no, I'm not a teenager. Do not listen to the critics, Star Wars fans do not. This movie is worth seeing if you only see the beautiful Luke de Lacey and Rupert Penry-Jones. Look at it!
