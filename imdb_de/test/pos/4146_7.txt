Where should I start. Should I say how great the cinematography is? I praise certain scenes that show the creativity of the directors. I'll tell you how realistic the scenes on Ellis Island are. Should I mention that we do not have a cliché scene for a change to watch the Statue of Liberty. (In the meantime, immigrants who look at the statue from the ship's railing are a cliché.) Well, what's not very nice is two main aspects, one is a modern song score and not even a good one. <BR /> <br /> Secondly & almost deadly, the film is boring, it moves so slowly that drying the paint would be an improvement. <br /> <br /> The 118-minute runtime is too long and yet the movie does not seem to have finished yet. We do not see any scenes of this family in the US. Our hero mentions that he wants to find his twin brother, I would have enjoyed scenes of his futile search for maybe happy search, rather than other extended scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie is a near miss. <br /> <br /> Reviews *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
