I saw this on a VHS tape in 1993 but have not been able to find it since. This is a very gloomy and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese army in the Philippines. Anyone interested in the Pacific War would love to watch this movie and see what the other side has been fighting for. From what I can say, this is historically correct and shows how easily men can descend to complete barbarism. I understand that until 1945 the Japanese army was completely cut off from any repatriation in the Philippines. So there are certainly many of the terrible incidents that have been presented here. I may not have been able to identify with the characters of the film, but I appreciate their humanity and the struggle for survival. If I had to compile a list of the ten biggest war films, this movie would be there. See it if you can get it.
