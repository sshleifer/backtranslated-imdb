This movie is incredible. It's funny, sexy, violent and sick, but it holds it all together for a brilliant Troma rendition of Romeo and Juliet. If you do not mind figuring something out (ok, but funny, but weird), watch this movie. It is worth it! There is no level on which it does not run. I've seen it three times now, and it's still amazing. I recommend it. Go! Got it!
