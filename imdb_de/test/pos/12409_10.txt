This picture has no big explosions or expensive chases. However, it has really wonderful performances and an extraordinary script that puts this at the top of my indie-must-see list. Taylor Nichols and James Remar are great together. The young cast surprised me with really consistent actors. Usually indie pictures have a weak link, but there are no weak links here. Impressive. Go and get this here.
