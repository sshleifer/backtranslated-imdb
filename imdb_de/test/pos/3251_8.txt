I'm afraid I do not have to agree with Mr. Radcliffe because he rightly said that this is not a comedy but has many other merits. The plot is a bit crazy about sharing, but I think everything fits together well and creates a satisfying, enjoyable movie. The last scene was pretty miserable compared to the rest of the movie, but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes ago is very interesting and shows what someone is going to do under stressful circumstances. I would recommend fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you're a fan of gangster movies, so long as you do not expect anything as deep as Goodfellas to expect, you should still enjoy it.
