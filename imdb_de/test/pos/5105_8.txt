This 1969 movie was caught on cable TCM one night. I remember seeing the movie for the first time in Hong Kong and enjoying the songs and performances of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. I love Clark best in Francis Ford Coppola's "Finian's Rainbow" (1968) alongside Fred Astaire, Don Francks and Tommy Steele. Simply ecstatic to learn that the wonderful Irish Pot of Gold musical is finally released on DVD! Ah, "it's the old devil's moon (in your eyes)." <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Mr. Chips - yes, he sang - quite a relief. He may not be an experienced musician like Rex Harrison, but he has lived the role wonderfully. The scene in which he ran across the lawn in his flying cape reminds me of the PBS series "To Serve them all my days" - a gracious schoolmaster and a loving man, he's "Mr. Chipey." Clark and O'Toole gave us exactly the right mix of spunk and circumstances, the songs and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse are as catchy as usual, and the songs of "You and Me" and "Walk Through the World (with Me)" stayed with me Years, and there are "What a lot of flowers", "And the sky smiled," "Fill the world with love" - ​​not at all syrupy, sometimes I think, when the world is immersed in Bricusse's songs and words we overcome all conflicts on earth, and "lovable" will be all our days! Yes, "Talk to the Animals" too. ("Doctor Doolittle" 1967) <br /> <br /> Musicals are a blessing to the world of Moviegoers, they are somehow bigger than life, like the music and lyrics of Sherma n Brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.) who gave us "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968) and "Mary Poppins" (1964) - who would not feel completely delighted when they pronounced "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" "Me was tickled by just one featured song & dance number in the Spanish movie "Km.0 - Kilometer Zero" (2000). My absolute favorite is the French filmmaker Jacques Demy's "Young Girls of Rochefort" (1967) with colorful cast of Catherine Deneuve and (deceased sister) Francoise Dorléac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, Danielle Darrieux, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris Michel Legrands music. Long live musicals.
