During the Second World War, a heavily burned amnesiac, known only as The English Patient, is transported to Italy in the African desert, where it joins a convoy of medical troops and others in a deserted monastery. Among them is Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose lovers usually have unpleasant goals; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts who search the monastery for bombs; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian fortune-teller who knows the identity of the English patient and has a rating. <br /> <br /> Flashback reveals the patient's story: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who joined a group of British cartographers in the late 1930s, including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his Mrs. Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), met North Africa. After Clifton leaves her in government, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, leading to an affair that, of course, has a less happy ending. <br /> <br /> If You Can Oversee the illogical parts of the story (for example, why would a patient found in Africa be sent to the front line of the war in Italy?), you can " The English Patient "as a relapse appreciate the intelligent, multi-layered epochs of David Lean in the 60s. Much more than "Titanic" or other epic romance of recent times, this film is reminiscent of "Doctor Zhivago" and "Gone With the Wind" - an epic love story set against a vast historical backdrop. You should not expect a war movie, though there are some striking (though too short) scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's questioning by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow) in particular). <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty ambiguous in terms of everything. The central question of the film is: How far do you want to be in love? As critics of the film quickly discover, Almasy is a far-off sympathetic figure on the surface - he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving the Germans maps and information that will cause the death of his friend Madox ( Julian Wadham) and the torture of Caravaggio, and indeed killing a British soldier who once arrested him. The fact that Almasy is reprehensible in many ways is in a sense the point - he is in love with Katharine and sees the world closely in terms of his love, that loyalty to land (or something else in this regard) is secondary; As Almasy says, he hates "possession. The two engage in a pretty daring love affair (hundreds of people are shot from inside at a Christmas party), and it's clear that Katharine is more interested in the mysterious, exciting Almasy than in the comparatively boring Geoffrey. > The basic story of 1944 is a bit shaky and seems superfluous; The romance between Kip and Hannah is never quite believable and I think the movie could have worked without him. But these sequences add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the movie, so I'm not going to complain too much. As with the epics mentioned above, the film can convey time and place through simplicity devices such as mass scenes, strategically placed posters and military presence. We do not have to think about it being in Cairo in 1938, but it is helpful to know. The direction of Anthony Minghella and the desert movies of John Seale are absolutely great. The sand dunes, sandstorms and haunting caves of the desert are captured in a beautiful detail. Gabriel Yared's score is haunting and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> The drama is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very complex performance as a character that is mysterious, complex and rushed. The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 is remarkable; one exciting and a little careless, the other haunting and contemplative. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the female explorer in search of adventure, and Colin Firth does one of his best as Geoffrey, who realizes he is no match for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does a good job as Caravaggio, the nimble, hunted spy who is being vengeance. Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of Jose Ferrer in "Lawrence of Arabia" (and a similar figure): very short, but more memorable than some of the main characters. Some of the actors of 1944 are unremarkable: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but unobtrusive. Kevin Whately, as Kip's unlucky partner, does what he can with a rather minor role. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is by no means a perfect movie, but the fierce attacks on the film public are not deserved at all. Maybe it shows how film sensitivities have changed since the Lean and Kubricks era, or maybe people have expected something simpler. "The English Patient" is a wonderful modern epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
