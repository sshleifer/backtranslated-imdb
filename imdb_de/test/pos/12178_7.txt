I have not read the novel Anne Rice on which this film is based, but who knows, reading the book may be cheaper than renting QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and probably for your health. It's not that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and will certainly do more with the active part of your brain than this movie. You can count the number of pages of Anne Rice that I read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and the interview with a vampire, I feel like she's writing really good novels. The actions of both films point to a sea of ​​deep and interwoven vampire story. <br /> <br /> However, Stuart Townsend's voice-over narrative becomes all the more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire tale. It can be said that the limited production resources of QUEEN OF THE DAMNED barely give meat to the story of Anne Rice. While the interview decided it was lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low-budget special effects that really need to be taken seriously. You can see that the original novel had potential as a film and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and the rock & roll stage could be replaced by more blood and a slightly sharper soundtrack. <br /> <br /> However, I give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had knocked me down when the disease knocked with my noggin like Butthead. The movie begins with a very cool goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after about ten minutes the director degenerates quickly. It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized there was not enough time and money for a novel by Anne Rice. The result is mediocre vampire scenes and many cheesy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED can not do justice to the genre, just like his colleagues at John Carpenter. Where are the yellow contacts? Where is the light blue make-up? Scene after scene, I shook my head and remembered the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when the low budget was done right. <br /> <br /> There are redeeming qualities that save this movie from garbage. Introduce Aaliyah, and may your soul rest forever in peace. She could have become a famous actress if her life had not been taken prematurely, because she gave this movie a decent performance with a lot of nice belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? It was not too long. The Anne Rice novel could easily have been a three-hour film if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it. There are a few twists here and there in the plot. But all in all, it was a legit rock'n'roll addition to the second-class vampire movies. The director of this film went on to lead a new Battlestar Galactica miniseries, if you know anything about it. <br /> <br /> JY <br /> <br /> Jimboduck-dot-com
