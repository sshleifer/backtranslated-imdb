One of the best movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. He really "fills in" his part, and that's wonderful. He's such a good actor that you can not imagine anyone else to do his part. <br /> <br /> And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are doing well as a normal French people and trying to defend themselves in a fight with a murder ... <br /> <br /> The story is breathtaking and well built. You can feel the ambience of Paris for this time (around 1930-40), between two wars ... the clubs, the old little buildings, the neighbors. <br /> <br /> All these things contribute to a great movie.
