If you look at a movie that has affected you so much the first time, there's a high risk that 20 years later he will not have the same magic as before. I have to admit that I did not expect it to be as good as I remembered, but I was pleasantly surprised. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as I remember when I was 12 years old. This movie has a certain kind of brilliance that does not have many movies. It's captivating, it's brilliantly played and I feel like a kid again and there are not many things that can do that. John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttenden's roles in this movie are 1st grade and I forgot how good they were until now. I urge all parents of teenagers to sit down and watch and see if they have the same impact as mine. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10.
