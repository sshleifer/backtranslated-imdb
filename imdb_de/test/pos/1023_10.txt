Although I do not like cricket at all and I saw this movie 13 years ago, I still think it's one of the best films of old age. I remember the day I came home from my school and settled there. I had lunch, I watched the opening tracks of this movie, and then ... I was so immersed in the movie that I felt like I was there, that really influenced me personally. I still remember how I felt when I saw it for the first time. I felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, sharing the same youth experience that we had back then. What I really liked about this movie is the main theme of a "shy" boy who dreams of "kissing" his dream girl. Not an insult, but if it is an American movie, you would certainly see the climax of a "shy" boy "loving" his girl at some point, and I really can not understand these contradictory concepts ... Me have a simple request. If anyone knows how to email this movie to the DVD, please let me know. I know, I need a shot of memories ... Thanks
