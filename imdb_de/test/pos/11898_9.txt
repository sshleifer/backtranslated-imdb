I just want to say that this movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> I loved it from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The acting was great. The director did a great job and I would like to see him again. Jennifer Tilly has done a very good job, the man who interprets his father (Manny) was another great actor, BUT I CAN NOT CALL YOUR NAME. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for El Padrino II. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa looks so good and I think he is one of the most talented actors. There are many Latin American actors doing their job as well as shown in this movie! <br /> <br /> Rent It !!! Rent it !!! Rent it !!!
