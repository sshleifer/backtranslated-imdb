Since I was relatively young, I did not know how bad anti-Semitism was in Brooklyn, where my family originally came from. This movie absolutely shocked me. I've seen a lot of films about prejudice, racism, and anti-Semitism, but that seemed harder to hit than most. <br /> <br /> This was definitely one of the best indie movies I have ever seen. I had to drive 45 minutes to see it and it was worth it. Almost everything about the movie was great. Sometimes it was a bit slow, but that did not really bother me, because the movie was very atmospheric. It took place in the 40s and looked really like the 40s. Acting was great ... William H. Macy was wonderful as always, as was Laura Dern, and I was pleasantly surprised by Meatloaf's performance as he played the vicious anti-Semitic neighbor. <br /> <br /> 9/10
