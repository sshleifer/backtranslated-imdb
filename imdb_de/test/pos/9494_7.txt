"Do not Change Your Husband" is another soap opera comedy by producer / director Cecil B. De Mille. It is noteworthy that he starred as the first of several films with Gloria Swanson. I think you could call it a continuation of his "Old Wives For New" (1918). James (Elliot Dexter) and Leila (Swanson) Porter are a forty-year-old couple, in which James has gone to seed and become sloppy and lazy. He prefers smelly cigars and eating raw onions. He takes his wife for granted. Leila tries to get him to align himself without success. <br /> <br /> One evening, Leila meets a dashing Schyler Van Sutphen (now nicknamed) at Socialite Mrs Huckney's playboy nephew at a Porters dinner party (Sylvia Ashton). She invites Leila to her home for a weekend so that James "misses" her. Once there, Schyler starts to move her and promises her pleasure, wealth and love when she leaves her husband and goes with him. The sequences in which Leila imagines this promised new life are lavishly staged and predict De Mille's epic costumes later in his career. <br/> <br/> Leila, bored with her marriage and her uninterested husband, divorces James and marries Playboy. James finally realizes that he has lost the only thing of importance to him and is beginning to improve. He shaves his mustache, trains, tweaks onions and acquires a few manners. <br /> <br /> Not everything is rosy with Leila's new marriage. Schyler seems to play it and has started with the gold digger Nanette (aka Tootsie, or a similar name) (Julia Faye). Schyler loses all his money and steals Leila's diamond ring to cover his losses. One day Leila meets the "new" James and is struck by the changes in him. James goes home and becomes aware of her situation and ....................................... .......... <br /> <br /> With this film, Gloria Swanson became a superstar in a career that rivaled that of Mary Pickford. Barely 20 years old, she started her career in Mack Sennett, two role-comedies, as a teenage teenager. Elliot Dexter was almost 50 years old at the time, but he and Swanson make a good team, though it's hard to imagine anyone getting tired of the lovely Miss Swanson, as is the case in this film. Dexter and Sylvia Ashton had done it appeared in the similar "Old Wives For New," where the woman had gone to seed and the husband had done wrong. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are De Mille regulars Theodore Roberts as bishop and Raymond Hatton as player.
