I grew up with this movie. It makes great family fun that the kids love and the parents enjoy too. I wish more films like this were done. It's a great story about a little boy raising a bull with his mother and sister and showing him to the National Grand Championship where he wins! Then he is afraid that someone will grill his bull, so he kidnaps him and makes his way home. I was really excited when I saw this movie for the first time in the theater. I was surprised to see George Strait, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little movie. The music was great with all sorts of big country names like Willie Nelson and the Dixie Chicks. If you do not like this movie, you have no kids or you have never been a kid yourself.
