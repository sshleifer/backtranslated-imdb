If you speak French or can tolerate subtitles, you will really enjoy this movie. On the other hand, if you want to see only the most beautiful creatures of God, this is a must. No ounce of silicon in sight. Zalman King was eating out your heart. Sophie Marceau's body is the epitome of perfection and everything that I've ever dreamed of. Her role is even in English. Even the fact that she was naked with John Malkovich did not affect her beauty. Sophie is a ten, if there was one at all. Chiara Caselli and In√©s Sastre are 9.5s. Oh yes, that's a pretty good story. Several small vignettes are interwoven in a kind of six-degree separation.
