John Huston was seriously ill when he made his last achievement, and this is quite a testament: uncompromising, difficult, a thousand miles away from craziness and fashions, he will be considered the best "last movie" you can ever dream of. no action, no real hero, but a group of people who can cope with the vanity of life, the passing years, and death. The party does not deceive people long. Granted, warmth and affection emanate from the songs and the meal. complete with turkey and pudding. But the passage of time has partly ruined Julia's voice, the first crack in the mirror. Then the camera leaves the room where the guests have gathered and searches the old lady's bedroom. Sure, her one seems to have been A happy life, but it's a life that is coming to an end inexorably. A recording shows towards the end of the film Julia on her future deathbed. Possibly an unfulfilled life because she is a nutcase, with no children to go on. Only a few poor things, yellowish photographs, Bibelots and jewelry s .... But have all the hopes and dreams of a human fulfilled? Look at Gretta. She is a married woman, about thirty-five, she is still beautiful and healthy, but she knows something is broken. What Julia is today, she will be tomorrow, so she returns in her stream of consciousness in her past to find out how frightening her memories are: A young man has committed suicide, a symbol of her waning youth. The last soliloquy, if we listen closely, is all of us in this eternal tragedy, the doomed human constitution, John Huston's masterful lesson.
