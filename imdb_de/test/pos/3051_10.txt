If you're a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star Oldie is a good one. What could you ask for more than Duke, Yak and Gabby. Lots of good ridin 'and shoot !!! I found it amazing that Duke's vocals were Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It was reported that Bob Steele was a classmate of high school and a friend of Duke. However, if you like good, clean, early western movies, do not miss them. We do not have to wonder about hidden meanings or try to figure out the underlying issues. Sit back, relax and enjoy a Western movie of a simpler day and a simpler time. It's called entertainment people !!!
