I have just found a copy of "Mission Cleopatra", which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the United States. So far, I've only seen the first 10 minutes of the movie and I can say for sure that I laughed more in those 10 minutes than seeing the entirety of the * first * live action Asterix movie. <br /> I look at the dubbed version, and although the synchronization job is a bit confusing, I found the movie to be very funny and faithful to the book. I see that people here have said that the dubbed version of the subtitled version is very inferior, which may well be true, and after watching the subtitle version (also on my DVD) I may have to come here and change mine Review. It looks like it's a very entertaining movie, and it more than makes up for the chaos you've seen in the first movie.
