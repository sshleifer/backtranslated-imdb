Normally, I do not comment on movies in IMDB, but in that case, I feel like I should do it. I love movies, and I want to make them, and this movie is a perfect example of good filmmaking. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I have seen on the small screen (originally in the air) I think on AMC and then on the DVD I just watched) I feel this in the pit of my stomach. That little gnawing feeling the director would hope for when you see his thriller. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance is good and Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas follow him. I felt so much empathy in Lemmon, whose character, Jack Godell, that people should only listen to his warning. <br /> <br /> But what impresses me most about this movie is the lack of a score, and that's also what makes me pretty. Apart from the opening songs, there is no background music to increase the tension as none is needed. And while the credits are running, white on black, he silently pushes the point home. <br /> <br /> I use the movie as an example for anyone who says music makes the movie. I think the movie was supposed to do the movie and the music should only reinforce that. But for the China Syndrome, music is not necessary to convey the realism and urgency shown here. The characters are doing a lot better than the music ever could. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie, it's one of my favorites. If you like movies, you will not be disappointed. If you like movie soundtracks more, you may not want to try them.
