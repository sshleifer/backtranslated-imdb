I thought Nick Gomez would take a look at the edgy streets of New Jersey, where the jerks are at an all-time high, which is thought-provoking and entertaining. It's as good as films like Boyz the Hood or Menace II Society or Above the Rim. I found the performers and scenarios appropriate, it felt realistic and was very atmospheric, intentional or random. I really liked this movie, an underrated gem that I found on TV, and I'm glad I got it. Watch this movie if you have a chance. If you do not have a DVD, you should publish one. Well done, Nick Gomez. IMDb Rating: 5.9. My rating: 9/10
