I think it's a great and very funny movie. The story is so funny. The daughter Nicole brings her father Andre in very embarrassing situations. To impress the boy of her dreams, the daughter pretends that her father is her lover. You just have to see !! Heigl is as beautiful as Nicole, maybe too beautiful; I'm not sure why she has to lie to tie someone up? Gerard Depardieu Acts very well in this comedy, he's so much fun. If you like comedy and romantic movies, you just have to see this !!! I think you can see this movie often and you will still have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> To impress the boy with her dreams, the girl pretends that her father is her lover.
