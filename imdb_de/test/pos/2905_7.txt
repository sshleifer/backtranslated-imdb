"The Egyptian" plays during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of antiquity, the Pharaoh Akhenaten, who tried 13 centuries before Christ to introduce a monotheistic religion, the Atenism, in ancient Egypt. The main character is not Akhnaton, but the fictional Sinuhe. As a baby, Sinuhe is mysteriously found floating in a basket on the Nile and adopted by the doctor Senmut and his wife. When he grows up, he follows his adoptive father into the medical profession and works first (like his father) with the poor of the city, but gains a head start after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier Horemheb, the saviors of Pharaoh's life during one Hunting expedition in the desert. Sinuhe is appointed court physician, but is owned by the Babylonian courtesan Nefer. Sinuhe not only ruins herself in a futile attempt to win her love, but is also disappointed when he neglects his duties because he is unable to save the life of Akhnaton's daughter. Sinuhe flees into exile, where he succeeds as a healer in neighboring countries, but returns to Egypt when he learns of a Hittite attack plan. Although Akhnaton gladly forgives his former offenses, the country is in turmoil. The pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil clashes between his followers and those of the priests of the old polytheistic faith, and he is inherently too peaceful to take any steps to counter the Hittite threat. Sinuhe is involved in a conspiracy by Horemheb, the general of the Egyptian army, and Akhnaton's sister, Princess Baketamon, to overthrow the Pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch. <br /> <br /> The film's weaknesses mostly stem from two romantic subplots. In the course of the film, Sinuhe reveals himself as the long-lost son of the previous pharaoh and half-brother of Akhnaton and Baketamon. It may therefore surprise a modern audience that they should fall in love with him; Marriage between brothers and sisters was not necessarily considered incestuous according to the standards of the Egyptian princes, but the standards of the cinema audience of the 1950s were generally less liberal on this point. In any case, the Horemheb-Baketamon-Sinuhe Love Triangle is an unnecessary complication, distracting from Baketamon's role in the film, the voice of cold-eyed, cynical Realpolitik. The Nefer subplot, which takes most of the first hour of the movie, is over-written and overly melodramatic. Nefer is morally worthless, but fascinating, and the role needed an actress of great beauty and dramatic skill to make her credible, especially as Nefer fulfills the daunting task of winning Sinuhe from such a lovely woman as Jean Simmons (who plays Merit) , Sinuhe's rival for her affection). It is therefore unfortunate that the role was transferred to a comically inappropriate actress, such as Bella Darvi, whose only qualification was that she was the lover of producer Darryl F. Zanuck. Darvi was not only a wood actress, but also spoke with a strong foreign accent, which was even more incomprehensible by a Lisp. Compared to the two legendary Hollywood beauties in the film, Simmons and Gene Tierney, who plays Baketamon, she was not particularly attractive. <br /> <br /> The film is better when it focuses on its main political and religious issues. The other actors are better than Darvi, although Peter Ustinov as Sinuhe servant Kaptah makes the same mistake as in "Spartacus", namely, trying to bring comic relief into a movie that does not need it. His voice was far too patrician anyway for a "Comic Servant" role. Edmund Purdom, a little-known British actor, was cast in the lead role when Marlon Brando dropped out at the last minute, but he more than adequately fills the big man's shoes, though his acting style was quite different. He masters the challenge of showing the changes in Sinuhe's character, from unworldly idealists to lovesick idiots to fierce cynics to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes. Victor Mature has never been the most expressive actor, but he is well suited to the role of Horemheb, a practical, down-to-earth man of action. He is better here than in his other epic "Demetrius and the Gladiators" of 1954. Simmons is brilliant as Merit. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding (best known to me as the second Mr. Elizabeth Taylor) plays Akhnaton as a possible philosopher king, ending up as a kind of holy fool. His inability to make difficult choices makes him an unfit ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice that gives him a touch of moral greatness far beyond those who want to replace him on the throne. Although Aten had more in common with the Supreme Being of the Deists than with the Old Testament Jehovah or the Trinitarian Christian God, there is a deliberate attempt to draw parallels between Atenism and Christianity. In the film, the Atenist symbol is the "Ankh", which was undoubtedly chosen for its cross similarity, but in reality it was a common Egyptian hieroglyph for life, not just for the Atenism. Akhnaton's language often has a biblical reputation; His comparison with the "wind whistling in the desert" recalls "the weeping voice of John the Baptist" (hence the title of this review). Sinuhe finds in the river a parallel to the story of the Old Testament of Moses. At the end of the film, Sinuhe, who has become the heir to the spirit of the dead Akhnaton, attains his own moral greatness. The message of the film is that we need practical people like Horemheb, but also visionaries and thinkers who are willing to ask why. Despite all its mistakes, "The Egyptian" is a film that is idealistic and humane in terms of both religion and politics. 10.7
