Count me among those who look forward to seeing no Hastings in this episode. Watson the poor man does not do anything for me as he just pulls down every scene he's in. Japp is often necessary as a representative of the Office of History, and a little Miss Lemon is good for seasoning. Dodge too excessively in different episodes. If I still have another void, "Oh, I say that!" I take the gas pipe. <br /> <br /> Generally, the more Poirot in a Poirot story, the better. Every line for Hastings is removed from Poirot. And I've never read the books, so I really do not care about the fidelity to Christie's characters. Many viewers / reviewers seem to have a problem separating the films from the books. If you want the book to be written, read it. I do not understand the meaning of watching the TV version if you know what's next at each level. Theater is not prose - do not expect transcription.
