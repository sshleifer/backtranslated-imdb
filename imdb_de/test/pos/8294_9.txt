The only pressure of CHIKAMATUS MONOGATARI that I could find was miserable - I almost could not see it. What a pity, since this is one of the best Mizoguchi films. The story, which I believe has been made before and since by other Japanese directors, is a bit stricter than my favorite films by Mizoguchi (SANSHO THE BAILIFF and UGETSU MONOGATARI) and is essentially a story of tragic romance, in this case a transgressive one Romanticism that goes beyond strict class boundaries. As always with Mizoguchi, there is an exquisite expression of defiance, and apart from bad pressure, I was very pleased. As with all Mizoguchi films, I'm looking forward to a restored DVD release - whenever possible ...
