The reports seem to be real, adding a human factor to the mix. A lot of sadness. I am sure glad that I was not him. One more thing is that all the women on this show were not really pretty reports about the real women. But I do not think it was about the women, though it was the passion of JFK Jr. Too bad. Every loss of life is a real shame. <br /> <br /> Seems like a good account of his life. I recommend it for biographies and melodramas!
