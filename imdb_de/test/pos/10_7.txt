If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the movie, I would have told you it's great! However, I left the theater dissatisfied. After thinking a little about it, I think the problem was the pace of the end. I feel like most of the movie has been moving slowly and the ending has developed very quickly. I would say the end disappointed me. <br /> <br /> I thought the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher have both played their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! The different relationships between the characters also seemed very real. In addition, I thought that the different plotting lines were well developed. All in all it was a good movie and I would recommend to see it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Good characters, Great plot, Badly written / edited ending. See it anyway !!!
