I've always liked Sean Connery, but as James Bond, I always favored Roger Moore. Still, it was Connery who set the bond standard, and while he had established himself as something other than James Bond in 1983, the money must have been irresistible for him to emerge even more as 007 and the world ahead of Specter's evil designs to rescue. <br /> <br /> And what designs they have in Never Say Never Again. With the help of a foolish young air force officer who happened to be Kim Bassinger's brother, he stole two nuclear missiles during a war game exercise, and now SPECTER threatens to blackmail the world under Blofeld, played here by Max Von Sydow. <BR /> <br /> Sydows operation guy is Klaus Maria Brandauer, who also woos Bassinger and is a bit crazy. And he has a female assassin in Barbara Carrera who makes Angelina Jolie look like Nora Croft like Mrs. Butterworth. <br /> <br /> But before Sean Connery can even begin, he has to deal with a new 'M' to work for British intelligence. Edward Fox believes Connery is old-fashioned in his methods and over-taxed British taxpayers with his violent methods. I really enjoyed Fox, he's like the great-grandson of Colonel Blimp. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed Carrera, she is something to see and pretty resourceful in her methods. When she dives with Connery in the Bahamas, note how she puts Mr. Shark in the case of 007. Will Connery do James Bond again? He was widely quoted as saying, by whom would they exhibit him as Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery in a wheelchair would still be great.
