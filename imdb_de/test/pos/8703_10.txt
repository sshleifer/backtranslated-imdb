I saw this movie years ago with my daughter who is now 13 and falls in love with the vampire. We both thought it was a top movie, then we watched Sub 11 and then Sub 111. Now I find that there is Sub 1v, which I can not wait to get my teeth, and there is also a fifth in the pipe line. if nobody has seen the movies. These are the best of the best. I think it's an Oscar Oscar. I could watch them from morning to night. i would like to have some nails like him, take care of girls. I love it because all storylines go from film to film. These ant typical vampire movies are better. I would like to live in the life that is in the movies. It would make all my dreams come true
