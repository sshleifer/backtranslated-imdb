This is followed by a fascinating thriller that requires constant awareness to be fully understood. The plot has many twists and uses a shifted chronology. The event sequence complicates the following. When you're ready to be attentive, this is an exciting movie full of noir markings. There is a lot to do with the 70-minute run, but the fast pace helps to captivate the viewer. Bill is a lonely, messy guy who deals with the crew of people and starts to see what they do. However, he is a bit too flashy and eventually gets caught by a well-dressed, clean guy named Cobb. Cobb involves Bill in a world where the poor boy does not want to live. Cobb is a smart villain who seems to be in control of the other characters. At the end of the film, the incoherent story is explained in detail. The film is an excellent first attempt by the talented Christoper Nolan, who would make Memento one of the most original films of our time.
