James Aaron, a chubby actor living in Chicago, is a man who likes to eat things that are not good for him. This becomes clear early on when Dick, a friendly shop clerk, advises him to stay away from junk food. Aaron, an actor working in Chicago's Second City, is a loving man who does not have much luck in the love department. He still lives with his mother, a spunky lady who encourages him to go out and have fun. James has another job in a kind of "candid camera" where people are set for unusual situations, like surprise a mechanic and tell him he's the father of a daughter he never knew. <br /> <br /> On the day he meets his friend Larry, he learns of the casting call for the remake of "Marty," his favorite movie. As a tall man, he clearly identifies with the character in the film. In many ways, James' own life is similar to that of Paddy Chayefsky's creation in the picture. He wants to try it for the role because he knows he can do the role justice. One day he meets Beth at a soda fountain. James has a fondness for the woman who one day invites him to buy her intimate clothes with her. In the end he has sex with her and believes that there is a nice thing, but Beth has another surprise when she tells him that they went to bed because she never had a big man. After his disappointment, James stumbles to an attractive primary school teacher who seems to share his love of jazz. In the end, we see how James has fulfilled his long dream of being involved in a theatrical production of "Marty" in a nursing home. Jeff Garlin, a sympathetic character man, shows a talent for the type of comedy associated with his friend Larry David. Although both men differ in their acting styles, his point of view with James Aaron is on the money. As a director, he has done it before, although this is an original concept that he should pursue. <br /> <br /> One of the film's strengths is the people involved in the project. Sarah Silverman gives an impression of Beth. Bonnie Hunt subjects her role as a teacher to good results. Mina Kolb is considered his mother, a role she has played in "Curb Your Enthusiasm" with excellent results. Director Paul Mazursky is also in a minor role. Joey Slotnick, Tim Kazurinsky, Richard Kid, David Pasquesi, Larry Neumann, Gina Gershon and the rest of the cast make valuable contributions. Jeff Garlin is a talented man whose next deployment is being welcomed by his fans.
