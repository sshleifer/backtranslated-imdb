I felt that this movie had many good qualities. The cinematography was certainly something else and revealed the stage aspect of set and story. The original characters as actors were certainly a feat and I felt that most of them were played quite convincingly, of course they are themselves, but definitely unique. The cultural aspects can leave many disappointed, as familiarity with Chinese and Oriental culture will answer many questions regarding parent-child relationships and the stigma associated with each drug use. I found the story of Jia Hongsheng interesting. The story is in Beijing and some of the fashion and music scents of the early 90s, though this was done in 2001. Therefore, it is sometimes very cheesy (the Beatles crap, etc.). Whatever, no top ten or twenty, but if it's on TV, have a look.
