I get a kick out of the new Who fans who call it, excellent. Your justification for this opinion, but the new series is not quite there yet, it's coming there. It is definitely good. <br /> <br /> First the good things. The special effects are obviously much better almost 20 years later, since the last episode of Doctor Who "Battlefield" aired. <br /> <br /> One thing the BBC has always liked is Doctor Who (unless they tried to stop the movie in the 70s and 80s). The anticipation and the pressure were great, but I think the New series passed the test. She is good. She is still not outstanding because she has her shortcomings. Some of the stories "Dalek" were very poor. I suppose it was written in a few minutes by an idiot who never bothered renewing the Dalek character or looking at the old series. <br /> <br /> "Aliens in London" was by far the best episode so far. So far, it has started a new story about aliens that has been going on for several episodes including "Boomtown". <br /> <br /> Now the other bad things, the companion Rose, Billie Piper, are not great. She's actually pretty annoying, but like Dr. Dr. Who had to choose a young teen Bopper and she got the role. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is pretty serious, he started catching his niche. He tried to play the character, always funny, always missing the right punch line, but he took it a lot more seriously and it shows. <br /> <br /> Continuity still presents some problems that have not been resolved well, Paul Mcgann Was still the doctor before, but he was not thrown back. <br /> <br /> Besides, although the show is pretty good overall, I did not miss any episode and it never gets boring, so I recommend every fan of Doctor Who can watch the new Doctor Who series.
