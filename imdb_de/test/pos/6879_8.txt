The notorious HK CATIII actor Anthony Wong is, by the way, (well ... not even at all - he was a cop in the films of DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS and some others ...), not a psychopathic spinner in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. Usually recognized for his role as a complete Wackadoo in such CATIII "Nasties" as THE UNTOLD STORY and THE EBOLA SYNDROME - this time Wong is on the receiving side of the monster ... <br /> <br /> Wong plays a guy who go to a magician who promises him really good dreams, for a price. In his words, the dreams that Wong brings to smoke crazy ass-sex with hot schoolgirls - but the dreams have a price that's more than money. The wizard can manipulate the dreams and blackmail Wong out of his money and business with the help of a sexy spirit, killing his family and finally killing Wong himself ... Wong's brother comes to the city to find out what's going on, and finally poses It is clear that the murder of his family is the work of the evil wizard - but it turns out that Wong's brother himself is a handsome, crappy wizard and turns the sorcerer's table and plans with the help of the magician's abused wife. .. <br /> <br /> EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the more pleasing CATIII films I've seen in recent years. Absent is the sombre and dark feeling of some other CATIII entries like RED TO KILL, THE UNTOLD STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, even though it is still grubby after sex and themes more serious films of the genre. More like ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a "carefree" CATIII entry that delivers a lot of nudity and a bit of gore without being too weird. Definitely worth a look, especially for the genre enthusiast. 8.10
