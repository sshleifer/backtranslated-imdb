Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It is the most unconventional film by Werner Herzog. It has no action or story. Instead of a story, we get a collection of pictures, words and music that work so well together. It is not documentation either. Some of the people in this movie are instructed to read lines. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting pictures. Herzog shoots real mirages, and we see cars and people roaming in the middle of the desert, not really there, but hundreds of miles away, like in a mirror. The use of music in this film is so brilliant - by Leonard Cohen, Mozart and the Third Ear Band. Imagine Stanley Kubricks in 2001: A Space Odyssey in the Desert; Such is this movie. This movie is so hypnotic that he feels that the mind has left the body. Something you must have seen. This changes the way you view movies. Rating: 10 out of 10.
