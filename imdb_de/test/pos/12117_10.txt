This is an excellent anime movie. It is well animated, has a good complicated plot and very good music. I understand that some of them think a little bit long, but I think it's a good track and the animation is a good traditional anime. <br /> <br /> THREE CHARACTERS: <br /> <br /> The way they use Tenkai is masterful. For example, the Body Double appearing in all these places is added to the ominous tone of the movie. Tenkai's design is also good, just as he looks like a monk and ends up wearing the armor he wears. <br /> <br /> The old man Andou is down to earth and a very likeable character. When Jiro meets him, this is a turning point in the movie. Sanpei, the Satsuma Shinobi who infiltrated the Tenkais clan, saves Jiros twice. Although he remains in the background for most of the film, he is truly one of the heroes of the film. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT: The plot is good. It is traditional without being unoriginal. The historical time in which it is played is interesting, the Meiji Restoration. The treasure is being sought by Tenkai to restore the shogunate, and when Jiro finds it, he helps the anti-shogunate forces overthrow the shogunate. <br /> <br /> The way Tenkai Jiro exploits is interesting and has a kind of "Hamlet" feel about it. It's also sweet irony that Tenkai, if he did not make Jiro a shinobi, would not think he could kill him in the end (maybe with a gun, not with handguns). <br /> <br /> The act of death usually makes it very dark, but there are some moments when we see some memories of Jiro's childhood. All in all, it's a good, dark, complicated plot. <br /> <br /> THE MUSIC: The starting theme, for example, is very good with the electric guitar and the drums. They occasionally use what I call taiko drums, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of good music. Like the one played on the trip to Iga Shinobi. I think the song is called "Numatou" and has an incredible flute. The flute could be a panpipe, but more likely a shakuhachi. <br /> <br /> The final theme "Kamui no komoriuta" is calm and tender. The vocals are beautiful and the song in general too. <br /> <br /> THE ANIMATION: <br /> <br /> The animation is good, but not perfect, and the blood the characters sometimes drain seems orange. The transitions are interesting and I think some transitions are very nice. An example of a beautiful transition is when Jiro and Iga Shinobi are running, the sunset is in the background and the music is playing. The transition is simple but effective and also has a nice feel. <br /> <br /> MY FINAL WORDS: I think the plot, the animation, the music and the characters make this one of the best anime movies I've ever seen.
