The movie is by no means perfect, but it's still fun and amusing to watch. I'm the first to agree that Victor Fox is not really attractive and his music and style are rather cheesy. I also agree that the movie has some strange distractions and some scenes do not work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it, who cares? Does every movie have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could be destroyed if they admit that they love this movie. Again something like that? It has lovely characters, it's well-filmed, acting is mostly good, it never gets too clumsy or dramatic, it's weird. Look at how many people love I Dream of Jeannie. Is it perfect crap no! And though this is very different, I say, and you'll be in a good mood when you see it.
