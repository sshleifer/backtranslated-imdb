This is just a good old fashioned western ... not too complex or long. It is not wrong to think that it was made, but for entertainment. Still, it's one of those westerns that you can look at without having to come back. It shows former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford, whose friendship is strong, although Ford's Cheyenne Rogers was involved in the bank robbery (he even steals Scott's sheriff Steve Uptons horse, without knowing it as his good friend, for whom he is a thief). In the Red Valley, Upton is being investigated for a bank robbery that ended in multiple deaths. Claire Trvor portrays Countess Maletta, a friend of Cheyenne, who gives him and his buddy "Nitro" (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) a place to stay. Cheyenne wants to go straight, but he finds it hard when Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell) and his bad bunch want to rob the bank of Red Valley. It's Jack who's behind the murders, but Cheyenne's difficult past is hard to beat. He and Nitro are accused of the murders they did not commit (the robbery was a Cheyenne who did not commit suicide) and it will be Upton who somehow has to save the day before Lester gets away with the murder. There are negotiations in which Cheyenne falls in love with Alison McLeod {Evelyn Keyes; The irony of the story is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, was actually sitting with banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) in a planned united theft with Lester stealing the city from Red Valley's loot}. Will Upton Uncle Willie and Banker uncover Clanton's insidious plan? Will Uncle Willie be able to stand it without his conscience always disturbing him? This movie has a terrific brawl in the bar hall and a dandy for a shootout. Columbia could not have chosen a better genre to start the dyeing process, as this film has some beautiful mountain scenery while men hunt on horseback. Do not expect your socks to be blown away, but the movie is simple and in a good mood.
