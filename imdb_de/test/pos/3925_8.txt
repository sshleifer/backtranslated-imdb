My college theater just had a special screening of this movie yesterday. I have to say, I think everyone was impressed by how good this movie was. My roommate did not care, but he does not have horror movies anyway and just wanted to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you are worried about it, do not be like that. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I have to be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actors were very good. I'm not going to go into the details, because I'm sure you know about it. Surprisingly, the characters are pretty captivating and you really care about them, especially Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray's characters. We meet them as rival siblings and end up having to work together. Another plus is that it does not have the sleek look of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and feels more documentary than a music video (Do not get me wrong, I loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville). <br /> <br /> Now to the death scenes. In most Slasher movies, whenever a character is stabbed or killed, the scene cuts to another scene, but not to that scene. When a character dies, they die pretty cruelly. But the filmmakers do not stop there and add a little extra for each victim each time. I will not say anything about the death scenes and will let you see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Although this is a great Slasher movie, it has the weaknesses of almost all Slasher movies (exploring a scary house). If you do not, drive with a suspicious character, split up and yell for the killer to hear you. There's also a kind of dumb turn that was unnecessary and did not add anything to the movie. You notice that it was added at the last moment and if you took it out, it would not have affected the movie at all. <br /> <br /> If you are a horror movie you should watch this movie. You will not be disappointed. It has everything it takes to make it a great Slasher movie that may be the best of the year, even if it's a bit early. The tension is palpable and it is sometimes a funny movie. If you hate horror movies, chances are you like them, and if you're divided, I suggest you try.
