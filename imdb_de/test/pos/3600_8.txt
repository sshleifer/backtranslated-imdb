"Capt. Corelli's Mandolin" is an old-fashioned Hollywood war romantic, but with sex and nudity and supposedly no Americans. The story takes place in World War II on a Greek island. The Italians arrive to take over the island, but under German supervision. There is a romantic triangle consisting of a Greek couple and the Italian captain. Nice performances by all actors; Penelope Cruz's best work so far.
