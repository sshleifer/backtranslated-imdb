Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great finale to a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s, the studios had an atmosphere of tolerance, openness, and progressiveness that made it possible to shoot some of the best directors the United States ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (some of which were the violent death of important figures of the American political and cultural scene, the race battles, the emergence of the counterculture of the 1960s, the increase of violence and violence) Street ...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who dared to be different and create entertaining and intelligent feature films. Coppola's film is a strange mixture of humanistic thinking and skilful filming that follows the parameters of war and adventure films, as well as their fluid reflections on the value of life, the cause of death, or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work that was made against all contradictions. It was documented in 1991 in the documentary "Hearts of Darkness: The Apocalypse of a Filmmaker". a film that went beyond any previous reflection of the Vietnam War and reached the screen. This may not be the definitive film in Vietnam, but Coppola opposed the formula of classic melodrama from two Vietnam films shot simultaneously, "The Deer Hunter" and "Coming Home," or in the latter as "Platoon" and " Casualties of War ", before Vietnam became the starting point to produce products of all genres, as horror in" Jacob's Ladder "or comedies like" Good Morning, Vietnam ", among the more prestigious. Coppola had the courage to see this economic and political conflict as a background for finding answers to questions a man faced every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of the war.
