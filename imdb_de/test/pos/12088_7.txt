First, I should point out that I really enjoyed watching this documentary. It not only had great music but also the settings and editing were wonderful. However, all these positive things about the film do not change the fact that he plays the Orientalist clich√© "East meets West," which bothers many Turks like me. Okay, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary Turkish music in a very stylish way, which is a good thing, something that would show ignorant Europeans and Americans that this country is not just about killing Armenians and Kurds. The film's problem, however, is that from the eyes of the "West," he defines what he defines as "the East." I mean, as a jazz musician says in the film, maybe there is no East and West, maybe it's just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of the "Western" countries to keep fear and hostility alive continue to govern the world and "let the money flow"? <br /> <br /> Why do not you think about it?
