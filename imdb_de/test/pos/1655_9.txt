Rififi is a great movie that is overlooked. It's a thriller in which a man comes out of prison and plans another job. It's a much-used story, but it's different from the others. They summarize the usual suspects. This film shows how the family is torn apart over time. The actual robbery scene is one of the best I've ever seen. Instead of an exciting soundtrack, the director decided to remain silent for about thirty minutes. This fits perfectly with the mood and is often copied nowadays. Of course things get out of sight and people die and it ends in a great ending that builds in tension. This is a great pickup.
