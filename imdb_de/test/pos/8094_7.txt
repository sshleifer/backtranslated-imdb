Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the anti-Nazi propaganda of the great actor impaling Adolf Hitler. Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish barber Hynckels spitting image. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen Hitler's news programs will recognize the eerie resemblance of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was starting to slow down with a typical chaplin stick focused on the adventures of the World War I Jewish barber. Having never seen it before, I must confess that after the first 20 minutes I wondered what all the excitement was about. But the movie is picking up speed. There are some very funny moments and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of "Hynckel's ism" to highlight the propaganda point. The highlight of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech that Chaplin made at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> As good as Chaplin is in this movie, I thought the whole thing was stolen by Jack Oakie plays the dictator of "Bacteria" - "Benzino Napaloni". Our first look at Oakie shows how well he studied his subject - he had Mussolini's arrogant attitude behind him. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni were discussing the fate of "Easter" had torn me to pieces. <br /> <br /> This was a very good movie and it is worth to look at it.
