RENDITION is a movie that you should not miss with Kelley Sane and Gavin Hood's Guide. He leads us to a story that is a journey through a man's journey through hell. Once again, Meryl Streep in a compelling role for today's CIA and great performances by a number of superlative performers in Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin, as well as actors from the Middle East who contribute to the reality of the story /> <br /> In RENDITION, you see how "terrorism can bring about terrorism," and how the film progresses when history ties in with what's going on in the Middle East, bringing reality to the screen. The outdoor scenes add to the intensity of the story, and Peter Sarsgaard does a great job as an assistant in the way American politics is guided by "kissing". It is a pity that there was no bigger audience for this film, as RENDITION together with THE VALLEY OF ELAH and LIONS FOR LAMBS plays an important role in showing the public how the fight and the protection of democracy can seriously be misleading.
