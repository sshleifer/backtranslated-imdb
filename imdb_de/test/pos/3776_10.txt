That's cute. The actress who played the nurse with the Gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira, the Mistress of Darkness. Another treat is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring, the landlady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is the most wonderful story ever told. It should sell more copies than the Bible. My parents helped suggest the release of this movie in a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families that could see him. The lady who gave preference (friend of the family) was released from the theater. I was 3 years old. I burned 4 copies on VHS and finally converted to DVD. It is wonderful.
