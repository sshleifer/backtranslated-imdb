Jeff Lieberman's "Just Before Dawn" is definitely one of the most underrated horror films ever made. The film, which is a bit influenced by "Deliverance" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is extremely scary and unforgettable. The tension is almost never felt The cast is excellent, Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are great female lead roles. The inbred twins are really scary and ruthless killers. The film is filmed beautifully - he was actually filmed locally at the Silver Falls State Park in Oregon. There is very little blood, but a murder when Verchel is stabbed in the ledge is quite uncomfortable and unpleasant. A must for Slasher fans. 10 out of 10 - what else?
