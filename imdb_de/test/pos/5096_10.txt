"Chips" is an excellent mix of music, light comedy and drama with a perfect image concept by Peter O 'Toole and an effortless, romantic feat of Petula Clark. O 'Toole can show the shy, uncommunicative teacher who so much wants to be loved by his students and who can only express his love when he marries Katherine (Clark). She brings him the world "What many flowers" and he is forever changed. He becomes the beloved headmaster of Brookfield through the tragedy, but knows that he could have achieved his goal only through Katherine's love. The songs (with the exception of the music hall number) are all "thought songs" that come from the emotions and thoughts of the characters. The more you listen to them, the nicer they become - "Walk the world with me" you and me. "O'Toole's most beautiful moment is the closing speech he gives to the students (which was the reason for the Oscar nomination). As a teacher, we ask ourselves what "book learning" is all about - but as Chip says, we taught them how to relate to each other, and that's what really counts. Beautifully filmed, perfect by John Williams orchestrates and one of the most moving films about love and how she can change you. "Did I fill the world with love?" The boys sing their school song and in the end Chips realizes that he could - but only because Catherine was there.
