This movie was so good that I do not think I actually blinked while watching. An intense situation after another kept me on the set. However, I would have liked to see Corey Feldman more in this picture. He just steals every scene he's in right now. This could be my favorite Corey performance in which you grow up. The end was clever and unlike other films that separate body parts from sympathetic minor characters, this movie is just right for you! I liked that it was not graphic blood and blood, but more the imagination of the viewer was left. Bravo. I literally had to wipe sweat from my forehead with a paper cutter during this particular torture scene. Ultimately, the film works because of its sympathetic main character and the impressive presence of my favorite villain James Remar (48 hours, remember?). I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to break into the sweat <br />
