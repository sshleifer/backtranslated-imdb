What exactly do people expect when watching an Al Adamson movie? Do you expect a classic cinema that is unimaginable and will leave lasting memories? That would mean you by some reviews. Al Adamson's films are filthy and dirty and cheesy, not much more so if you agree that this already helps, and they do not necessarily have to be considered evil, especially if they have an inadvertent entertainment value. First of all, this starts with breaking off the end-theme music from Outer Limits, so you know things look promising. This is the story of a wiggle cult that lives in the hills. While attempting to raise a body, the leader suffers a heart attack and lands in the hospital. Of course, Nurse Sherri takes care of his needs and everything, and when surgery is required she happens to hang around in the operating room when the guy goes on and his mind attacks her. And sister Sherri begins to change. No longer the nice nurse, she has a taste for blood and sharp objects. There are a few minor side stories, like people trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader, and a blinded football star who has become the love object of a Sherri colleague who happens to be playing voodoo. This is not bad if you're a cult movie fan, but it can be bad if you're a "Spiderman" fan because you do not like it. Sometimes this actually staggers in the direction of "respectability" (for Adamson anyway), but then "dissolves again," even with a ridiculous event. If you like Adamson's films and similar garbage, you will like this for anyone who is lost to an addiction treasure, digging 7 out of 10 points.
