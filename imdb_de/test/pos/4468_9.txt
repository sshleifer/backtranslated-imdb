As far as I know, I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of a few later ones that are now on DVD, and I would say that this was his best pre-zombie offer. In fact, it certainly surpasses his later films. This is a story of superstition and mistrust in a small Italian town in the middle of nowhere where young boys mysteriously die. It's no secret how they died, I think, it's more who does it. Is it a woman that the inhabitants of the city have always considered a witch? Is it a young woman who lives in a chic modern house on the outskirts of the city and used to take many drugs? Is it the village idiot who is picked up early because he's in the wrong place at the wrong time? They just know if you're watching, and you should be careful because this is a top-notch mystery thriller, or should I say, a "giallo". I've seen this before, but it was a long time ago and at a second sight it was still as powerful as the first time. For those of you who know Lucio Fulci just for his zombie flicks, make yourself well, because it's worth seeing and the "monsters" in this movie are human. 9 out of 10 stars, see it! You're welcome....
