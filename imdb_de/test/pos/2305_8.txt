In a small village in Japan, the wife of Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki's wife (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), in 1895 has an affair with a twenty-six-year-younger man, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and plans to kill him with Seki. They strangle Gisaburo and throw his body into a well in the forest, and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo has moved to work in Tokyo. Three years later, the locals clap about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is persecuted by his spirit. The situation becomes unbearable for Seki and Toyiji when a police department arrives in the village to investigate the disappearance of Gisaburo. <br /> <br /> "Ai no Borei" is a surreal and supernatural love story. Seki's remorse and guilty complex make her see the murdered husband's ghost and spoil her lover's perfect conspiracy. Cinematography is jeopardized by the quality of the VHS published in Brazil, but there are very beautiful scenes, including "Ringu" and the American remake "The Ring", which show the view of the fountain from the inside at the same angle. The performances and the direction are outstanding and make "Ai no Borei" a great movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Império da Paixão" ("The Empire of the Passion")
