A bunch of mostly disgusting and disgusting teenagers walk into a sinister, secluded, dilapidated, old morgue near a cemetery to attend a Halloween party run by the freaky, occult-obsessed spinner Mimi Kinkade and her emptier Boy is organized. hungry bimbette girlfriend Linnea Quigley. The clumsy, profane, beer-loving, and sex-joyous stalwarts hold a séance as a joke (a very bad idea, since the desolate old dive is, of course, haunted by demonic spirits). Of course, this ill-advised séance awakens those decidedly grumpy and hostile evil spirits who cruelly kill and possess a majority of the children who turn them into ugly, lazy, scratchy, boil-gulled, murderous ghuls who cause the usual cruel ravages throughout the country particularly long, dark and shattering night of pure terror. <br /> <br /> Yeah, this is essentially your umpteenth vigorously graphic and relentless wall-to-wall, cheap "Evil Dead" hashtash crammed with Completed, there's no easy way out for claustrophobic single-enclosures Settings, outrageously over-splattering set pieces, an incessantly throbbing Hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, a total sense of distress and nightmare, and a vibrant look-your face-manic cinematography (the anticipated, stormy, rushing, hyperactive handheld camera work smooth, curvy camera shots, crazy camera angles, even the camera on a dolly gliding carelessly at eighty degrees eight). Fortunately, Kevin S. Tenney's sleek, confident, stylish sense holds the extremely worn and derivative procedures in a quick clip. In addition, Tenny gives the film an attractive, polished look and effectively creates a cruelly energetic and enthusiastically grotesque, ghostly, oogalogoga carnival funhouse atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Steve Johnson's amazingly bloody and imaginative make-up effects, however, are the true star of the show. The bloodthirsty highlights include the sickening fat slut Hal Havins (who played an equally irritating obesity role in the immortal "Sorority Babes in the Slimball Bowl A-Rama" at the same time) and had bitten off his tongue while Quigley took a whole shoved lipstick into one of her breasts (yow!) and cut out a guy's eyes while she loves him (double yow!), a libidinous teenage couple that gets out of bed while doing exactly what you do in a coffin Kinkade set her hands on fire, and in the only unpleasant scene in the movie, a mean old man has slashed his throat from the inside out, after eating a razor-bladed piece of apple. The trashy, non-thrashy rock score also smokes. And then there's Kinkade's incredibly wild, sexy and unrestrained demon dance, a crackling number, accompanied by a flickering flash and amazing jump cuts that Kinkade himself choreographed. Okay, so the whole thing is nothing more than a completely mindless and pointless, if pretty nicely mounted and pleasantly vulgar guy out of outrageous, filthy fright movie, but if you're in the mood, entertaining, brainy, gruesome horror scuzziness juvenile slag does the trick well.
