"Heaven's Gate" is not a masterpiece, which apparently was what it had to be after its first release to justify its high cost, and more importantly, Hollywood's continued uneasy reliance on the Auteur model of filmmaking. 'Heaven's Gate', finally released on DVD in 229 minutes, is a great movie. It is a touch that is lethargic in time. But at least it's a tempo. Apart from the incompetence of the construction that characterizes many films today, there have been many films whose conscious form has been severely damaged because they have been knocked down without any risk of rhythm, making the films informal and confusing. In addition, the criticisms of the film have become pretty lame in retrospect. If the good and the bad are too obvious for a serious movie, and yes, Sam Waterston's mustachioed, fur-faced villain is comic-opera (and not in the multi-level manner of 'The Gangs of New York' Bill The Butcher)) and yes, the locals occasionally seem to be a bit "Fiddler On The Roof", then a couple of dozen serious films, including "Titanic" and the non-combatant "Cold Mountain" (which has some similarities and is notable) failure in convincing qualities in the Compared to this film) can be punished for the same reason. <br /> <br /> Even if the film is accused, the film has an act. She simply does not bow to "epic" quality in standard form, providing Titan heroes, flops of negotiation, and confusion. It's experimenting with stories that look like much smaller, modest films, through carefully captured moments of character interaction, and well-structured pageants like the opening of Harvard and, above all, the wonderful scene. Where the people of Johnson County follow, a brilliant physical fiddler , on roller skates, "The Deer Hunter" was a critical and commercial success, but has given up the inspiration of the first half of the mosaic. I like the accumulation of details, and I think in a way that resembles the criticism of Robert Penn Warren's novel "All The King's Men" and his dictionary of Jacobin stunts, if Cimino did not understand the conventions of the Hollywood epics so well would have created a special rare piece of art based on the honest visualization of people around them. In contrast, "Heaven's Gate" succeeds in screwing up its narrative impulse and tension in a slowly expanding arc until the finale explodes while the mosaic approach is not abandoned. <br /> <br /> The central romantic triangle, for example, withstands standard bends; James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) is a decent, intelligent but mentally beaten man. He competes with a young, astute, young man, the Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) for the hand of a young Madame, Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert); There is no self-assured hopping, no slaps, no accusations or typical moments of sad sacking, but rather a sad and detached decision by Ella to choose the younger man she loves less because he is ready to do that. Ella turns out to be the film's true hero (Huppert's feat, though initially awkward, is really very good, balancing a damp emotionalism with a hard-hammered mind) who first tries to save Nate, and then the immigrant resistance party to an entrepreneurial defense calls. Subsequently, Averill is pushed into action when friends die. In overcoming so many traps of clich√© and style, "Heaven's Gate" successfully and deliberately beats the defeated outsider-heroic touch of so many westerns of the '70s, portraying an eventual, energetic encouragement of the heroes' cheers to an uncompromising, yet nevertheless pleased victory. <br /> <br /> The social conflict of so many westerns of the 70s is finally hardening into a full-fledged war. As Capital seeks a devastating final victory over the rogues standing in their way, they suddenly find a massed and powerful People's Army led by the man who played the totally ruined Billy the Kid a decade ago. As a result, the film was described as the first Western Marxist, but it deflowered a theme of the genre that existed long before the 1960s. So different and classic old-school works like William Wyler's "The Westerner" and even "Shane" tell terribly similar stories. Here, the romantic myth of the gunslinger was simply replaced by the romantic myth of the popular uprising. In a spectacular, exciting but realistic and thus chaotic finale, the Cattlemens' marauding camp is attacked, surrounded by dust clouds interrupted by fallen horses, writhing bodies and gunfire. Averill finally transcribes his classical education by stealing a Roman trick and bringing the Cattlemen to the brink of destruction before being rescued by the Cavalry massacre). It's really hard to imagine a more heroic American vision of grassroots resistance. The film's only real dead spot is an unnecessary coda that points to Averill's later relapse, a rather buried piece of tragedy. <br /> <br /> Despite some weaknesses and a slow middle section, "Heaven's Gate" is an outstanding piece of work, a real attempt to create a contemporary Western and a new kind of epic. If you still have to join the chorus, who thinks Cimino was absurd in terms of sentence and expense, that's unfortunate. With flops like "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" and "K-19 - The Widowmaker" today, when nearly a hundred million dollars go down the drain and there's still a grain of shame in the film, you're wondering what that grim death means , The attempt of an original style, the brutal sexuality, the very hard-won sense of detail, the breathtaking rigor of the film and what is filmed, contrast what is painfully lacking in so much contemporary Hollywood product.
