Very good movie. Very good documentary. <br /> <br /> Very good to see these vermin detectives humiliated and find out how the bigoted, narcissistic, heartless pigs that their one-eyed parents, the community and the environment raised them when. <br /> <br /> I give Pat McGuinness the lid. Can we bring this decent person into any sort of investigative or investigative process for the 911? We need his integrity, perseverance, intelligence, clarity and mind to fight the manipulated game of world politics and big business. All animals come out at night - whores, skunkies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Eventually, a real rain comes and washes all the garbage off the streets. Pat McGuinness should be the first drop of this real rain. The humans who control this earth are animals. They must be drowned. <br /> <br /> I'm just shocked. Running the night is scary. The inhuman howling and cackling is by detectives in Murder On A Sunday Morning. In Pat McGuinness' blazing headlamp, they are terribly trapped, terribly guilty, and ready for a fair and dreadful drowning. <br /> <br /> It's exceptionally satisfying in a world where players play a rigged game. Look at justice and see how every narcissistic criminal drowns like the wretched human rats. <br /> <br /> How does it feel like you are abusing terrible, hideous, ornate fingers of the law? How does it feel if you find out your manipulated persecution, your manipulated confession and your rigged detective work for what it really was? How does it feel? <br /> <br /> I hope it turns like a knife, you miserable, you do not see anything.
