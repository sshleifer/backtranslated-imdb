It's really pretty easy. The name of the movie is Death Bed, the bed that eats. If you are like me, you already know if you will like this movie. I recently stumbled across this gem at Best Buy and picked it up for ten bucks. I have ten dollars in enjoyment from the title and the box alone. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of B movies. This, in my opinion, is one of the best B movies I have ever seen. Well, it's not something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Granted, not even for most people. I even suspect that they will only be a handful of us who really like this movie. <br /> <br /> For those who like B movies, this movie is a diamond in the rough. It has a great condition, A bed ... That's what people eat. It does not work, it does not move, there is no siren call to attract people. It depends a lot on people passing by and sitting on it. <br /> <br /> I've loved every inch of this movie and seen it three times in the few weeks I've owned it. As I said, after reading the title of the movie, you already know if you like it. If you have laughed or smiled, try it. That's worth it.
