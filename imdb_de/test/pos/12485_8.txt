Is it a murder mystery? Is it a police procedure? Is it a glimpse behind the scenes in run-down French music halls? Quai des Orfevres is all of this, but most of all, it's an amusing comedy of infidelity, jealousy, and love that takes place in Paris after the Second World War. It may be surprising that Henri-Georges Clouzot, the director of grim films like Le Corbeau or such exciting nerds as Diabolique and The Wages of Fear, is the director of this film. Clouzot, however, was a smart filmmaker. "In a thriller," he tells us, "there's an element of playfulness, it's never quite realistic, and in this view, I share Hitchcock's view, which states," A murder mystery is a piece of cake with raisins and candied fruits, and if you refuse to do that yourself, you can also make a documentary. "" Quai des Orfevres is a wonderful movie and it's not a documentary. <br /> <br /> Jenny Martineau (Suzy Delair) is an ambitious singer in music halls and supperclubs, she is a flirt, she sees nothing wrong with using a bit of sex and using talent. Get a contract, her stage name is Jenny Latour and she loves her husband Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier). Martineau is something of a sad sack. He is their companion and arranger a mistake: then we have their neighbor, the photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renant). She is blonde, beautiful (think of Rita Hayworth) and capable. She and Martineau have been friends since they were kids. Dora definitely is not. I just think of friendship when she looks at Jenny, then comes George with s Brignon (Charles Dullin), a petite, rich and dirty old man who often makes Dora's "art" photographs of his young female protégés he poses himself. He offers Jenny a film contract and suggests a dinner at his home to discuss the details. Jenny is more than willing. Maurice is angry and forbids it. Jenny calls back to him, "You're jealous of the rich! Well, I want my share of their dough, I'm all for kings!" "You're Daddy was a worker," Maurice yells back. "So what, under Louis XV I would have been Madame de Pompadour! I would have heated her pantyhose!" <br /> <br /> And after Brignon was found dead with a smashed champagne bottle beside his bleeding skull, Dora tries to make things safe for Jenny. But wait. Inspector Antoine receives the case. Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor with aching feet. He saw everything. He served in "The Colonies" at the Foreign Legion and returned with an adopted baby and malaria. The child is now about eight years old and Antoine is writing to him. Antoine not only discovers that someone has Brignon in his head with a bottle, but shot someone in the heart. Who was it? It does not take long for Jenny, Maurice and Dora Alibis to improve, lie and confess at one point or another. How will Antoine discover the murderer? Do we have the chance to sing some great songs by Jenny Latour? Everything becomes clear, but only with the time and perseverance of Detective Antoine. We have many kinds of love that lead to all sorts of motives, from hair loss jealousy to wistful looks ... and all played with a nice mix of Gallic entertainment. <br /> <br /> Clouzot takes us from Paris, from rundown but not threatening neighborhoods, to run-down music publishers, where the sounds of the piano are played for shoppers, to restaurants with discrete private dining halls. Above all, he leads us to the music hall where Jenny Latour often performs. We can see Jenny singing, with couples on the seats and single men wearing coats and hats in the standing room. And everyone smokes. In fact, the first third of the film plays mostly in this environment. While Jenny sings about "Her petite tra-la-la, her sweet tra-la-la", we follow her by trying the song with the publishers, to a rehearsal for a cheeky performance with Jenny in a feathered hat, one Corset stockings and not much else. <br /> <br /> Delair, Blier and Renant all do wonderful work, but it's Louis Jouvet who keeps everything together. He was a wonderful actor who did not like the filming. The stage was his world, and he only took on films when the director liked him and money was made to finance his stage work. Jouvet was tall, with a long face and wide cheekbones. He was not conventionally handsome, but he had what it took to dominate a scene. To see how skilfully he plays comedy, check out Drole de Drame. He is a fascinating actor. Once he said, "I have a penchant for you, Miss Dora Monnier." "Me?" She asks. Because you and I are two of a kind, when it comes to women, we have no chance. " Jouvet brings all sorts of nuances into this line, from regretful regret to gentle conversation.
