How many reviews of this film do I have to write before I understand it correctly? Tom Conway fully inherits the coat of Hawks from his real brother George Sanders. Equipped with beautiful double breasted, buttoned, draped suits and a ride in beautiful, 110% steel cars with huge fender skirts and suicidal doors leading to your armpit, Conway travels from New York to Miami to hold a place there for Formula One Industrial diamonds out of the wrong hands. His "customer" is the pretty, virgin Louisa Briganza, who has beautiful hair, but only lets you kiss for the first two months. Along the way, he encounters the kind of colorful characters that only a B-movie can offer. His buddy on this trip may be the best among the Falcon companions Edward Brophy as Goldie Locke, who gets some really funny lines. He meets scary dishes, Doris Blanding, the kind of '40s chicks you know. Her cohort is Benny, played by Steve Brodie, who was a Presley punching bag twenty years later in two Paramount King films. Both work for cold fish and sailing yachts, carrying Kenneth Sutton, and are ready to do anything to get the formula while sailing to Brazil with his yacht. Saddled with the most petrified Falcon chases of all time, this entry still dominates. Forget these 120-minute melodramas and give me a 1-hour Falcon movie every day. I have a wife and two kids - who has time for a two-hour movie? Shake up some dry martinis and forget about your troubles with this awesome Falcon movie. But if you did not record it in local Toronto television 17 years ago, you're out of luck.
