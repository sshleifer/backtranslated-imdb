How about being accused of being subversive? This is what this film explores through the eyes of two characters, one of whom is subversive and the other the interrogator. It's a terrifying journey from start to finish. This movie is not for everyone and unless you understand the political governments thoroughly, you will never understand the meaning of this movie, as 90% of the reviews here prove.
