This neo-film noir belongs to a genre of American films of the late twentieth century that appear to be corrupt characters, fast cars, a motorway belt, and of course a variety of weapons used by people who never seem to have taken a safety course. The actors are the best reason to see "Black Day, Blue Night". There is the late, great J.T. Walsh ("Swing Blade", "Pleasantville", "Red Rock West", "The Last Seduction" and many more), who has made many neo-films noirs (see also "Breakdown"). Then there is Michele Forbes from the TV series "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Homicide". (In a supporting role, there is even the late Bejamin Lum, who also appeared in a Star Trek episode entitled "The Naked Now.") A kind of spoiler - really a clue: only the innocent survive, but innocence is a huge one The relative term in a movie like this, and you probably will not guess who is innocent of the last role.
