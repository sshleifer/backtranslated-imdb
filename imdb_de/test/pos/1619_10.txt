This is a low-budget stop-stop monster movie by Brett (A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell) Piper ... and it delivers exactly what I would expect from such a production: light-hearted (albeit cheesy) Dialogues, some cute actresses and many stop-motion animals. That's why I rated the movie 10 out of 10 - because it delivers what I expected ... and a little bit more: Brett does not shit when it comes to bringing his creatures to the screen. For the final he hurls many bugs on his occupation. And yet, I LOVE stop-motion monsters that are just so much fun looking at them when compared to CGI creatures in larger budget movies.
