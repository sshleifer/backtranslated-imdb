I do not want to go into a critique of the film, which in my opinion - for a big budget movie - is quite extraordinary and daring. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I am really fed up with the studios and the laws of different states that treat their viewers as children. In the database we find at least 4 different versions of the movie, depending on the runtime. However, it is likely that there are many more different clippings. <br /> <br /> The result is total confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina where the movie is.) takes 115 minutes, which sounds pretty complete) , <br /> <br /> Later on DVD and video the studios try to rob us further by selling us a supposed Director's Cut (in Germany there is already such a version, which runs about 110 minutes). <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the studios would not only think of the money they earn with their films, but also that their products, even at risk, are considered works of art of unfavorable valuation, so that I as a spectator do not have to be cheated and taken seriously, not just as a source of income.
