Since growing up in Czechoslovakia, I've been following the story of RAF pilots and crews in Britain during World War II whose stories and tragedy ended either in combat or in communist prisons and camps. This is undoubtedly more than a dark chapter in our history, though the fact that these brave men we go through all this and recover afterwards is amazing. To all people who want to see a great movie ... that's it! During a recent visit to the Czech Republic, I've seen this movie three times in three days (we only play it for three days ... otherwise I'll see it a few more times!) It's worth it!) I hope you will Although it requires a bit more background and background knowledge, much like the movie "Kolya". It's not a simple movie because of its deep story, and the way it's told will most likely make you cry ... it helped me three times in a row big movie and cast? No doubt, everyone did a great job, I was surprised by Ondrej Vetchy, the great role played by Oldrich Kaiser and all the other actors who just made this movie GREAT !!! If this is not an Oscar nomination, I think I'll strike in Holywood.
