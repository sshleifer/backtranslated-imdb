"Walking with Dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in every way. Kenneth Branagh tells in a way that you really want to hear. The script for the documentary really sounds like the researchers and writers have done their homework, it's so enlightening and it makes you addicted and will not let you go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic, if need be. But the visual effects and the scenery make this documentation so good. The landscape is breathtaking and the dinosaurs look so real thanks to the amazing effects. This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but also children. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a must. Not only did I love that, but it's probably the best documentary I've ever seen. If anything, it could have taken longer than perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox
