The Frozen Limits is a large-scale vehicle for the artists known as The Crazy Gang. They were a group of British entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. The six men in the group were Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen, Jimmy Nervo, Teddy Knox, Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold. Very popular in the variety shows, the group was also favorites of the then royal family. The plot here sees her as the Wonder Boys troupe, who set off for her fortune in Alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper. The problem is, when they finally arrive at Red Gulch, it turns out they are 40 years late! I often get it together when I see the statement, "It's very British," because it implies it's not so. The British Isles might have a hard time getting it. The reason it bothers me is that in this Internet age, I've gained a lot of non-British movie lovers who are known to share their best sides with Ealing, Will Hay and the ruling Terry-Thomas. So, is it true that something like The Frozen Limits is unlikely for a non-British audience? Yes, it's true, so much here is British at the moment, but it must really be said that the classic movie fan has a pretty good history and when all is said and done, visual happiness is universal. With the anarchic "not" so wild West makes an absolute winner. A winner who today has every chance of being appreciated by an American audience more than by a British audience. Not all comedy works, and in truth, the "Big 6" are stolen from a movie that steals Moore Marriott. But there are skits and parodies that deserve respect and are approved by well-known comedy acts. It's unlikely you'd fall off your chair almost like an ovaltine gag, but if you're a classic comedy movie fan? I'm sure you'll admit in the worst case that some very talented people work here. <br /> <br /> Well, are the Mounties always dosing their man? 8.10
