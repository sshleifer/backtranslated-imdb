Everyone has a right to an opinion. The only critic who counts is you. I think that's a great movie. Much better than the original. <br /> <br /> In "Caddyshack," Rodney Dangerfield is funny, but disgusting. He was asked to do the sequel, but things got in the way. Jackie Mason shows the saying "less is more". He is funny, but a man with real family problems, a rounder person. It's not a drama, it's a movie that makes you feel. In some ways you are sorry for Jackie Mason, especially when his daughter leaves him. A good end to the series. <br /> <br /> In the TV series "Alf" Alf says he cried in "Terms of Endearment". Wife Kate Tanner, played by Anne Schedeen, also says he cried at "Caddyshack 2".
