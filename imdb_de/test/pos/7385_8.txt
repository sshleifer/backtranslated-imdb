Rickman is sexy and good, but the "stranger" is less convincing - Reedus is somehow sexy, but he's not a consistent actor - in this case it could be the director's fault - we're just supposed to seduce him in the extreme because he's "pretty" is - but that's not enough. The cramped wife is almost convinced - 7 years of marriage and she and Rickman's character should be more in agreement, regardless of whether their roles are incompatible or not - they must now have patterns. I understand that, though I think that the woman in her role is a bit stiff - and not attracted to the "stranger" convincingly. That's a failure. The unspoken connection between the Rickman character and the "stranger" is better to accomplish, even if we are not sure what it is. I miss Rickman's sexy English accent (luckily he slips in and out of the American pattern). disappointing, but with some great spectacles.
