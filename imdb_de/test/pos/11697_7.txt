Crackerjack is another classic Aussie movie. With so many Australian films like The Castle, The Dish, and Sunday Too Far Away removed, they're being brought to a place that has not worked much in the movie yet. This time it's the game of lawn bowls and bowling clubs. Crackerjack is a much slower sports movie than many you'll find, like Remember the Titans or Million Dollar Baby, but the characters involved are themselves athletes. This film is a showcase for much of Australia's culture and is characterized by a popular sport that is becoming increasingly popular in Australia. Mick Molloy presents a classic, unforgettable character. It is really a must.
