See three colors: blue and three colors: white. They are both wonderful films and will give the finale Three Colors: Red an extra dimension. Red is a fantastic movie. It can be enjoyed in a single viewing, and indeed the climax of the film in this first viewing is very strong. But look at it again. If you understand the use of symbology and character parallels in this movie, you'll see new things with each ad. When you first look at it, you understand that the movie is the work of a brilliant mind. Every time you look at it, you discover that it really is a brilliant job. Red is supposed to symbolize brotherhood in the French flag. The story revolves around the theme of fraternity to be viewed from an angle one would never suspect. The facets of fraternity sharing the different characters are as deep as you want them to be. If you get used to the blatant "symbolism" in most mass movies, you may find Red a bit slow. You may be looking at a screen filled with intensity that you can not fathom ... This is not a pointless, vicarious experience. They do not explain everything. You have to think while thinking. You have to see ... do not just look. Wonderful movie ... wanted to enjoy a wonderful moviegoer.
