Watching the film as a documentary about skateboarding would not recognize some important aspects of Dogtown. Peralta (a well-known skateboard character herself) has developed a film that not only discusses the origins of today's skateboarding, but also examines the socio-cultural and economic circumstances under which the sport originated and found wide acceptance. In addition, his film is rather personal: Peralta's direct connection to this cultural phenomenon serves both the informed film mediator and the participant subject involved. In this role, he is an absolute "participant observer" and gathers a variety of personalities who were crucial to this movement, as well as those who were deeply affected by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture. The film uses a uniquely stylistic form of film and sound editing, and the narrative (by Sean Penn) and the interviews take on a rather unadulterated form that is comparable to the anarchic, nihilistic spirit of surfing the sidewalk. The film shows the kinetic appeal of a lengthy, athletic music video that has been tempered with the sensitivity of an archeologist for the importance of time, place, and circumstances.
