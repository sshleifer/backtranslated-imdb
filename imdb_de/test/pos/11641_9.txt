One of the clearest statements against the death penalty ever filmed was a frontal assault on the most disgusting way to practice justice. The final sequence with this parallel between the crimes committed by the convicted Poncelet and his own execution is simply great. No, what about the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon? It leaves you breathless, they are two giants and their performances reach the highest emotionality. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins makes it clear that he is not only a good actor, but also a good director. > <br /> * My rating: 9/10
