I'd like to start my review by thanking the creators of this documentary. It's obviously a love job, and I think they did a good job of putting together an entertaining documentary about a person who had so little information about him. It's definitely a fan-worship feeling, which is a good thing. <br /> <br /> I had heard of Bruce Haack, but did not know much about him, and I found the beginning of this documentary frustrating because I heard other musicians talking about him, but Bruce Haack himself was in the Far too far away. I wanted to see this Bruce Haack guy !! I felt like the makers assumed that I already knew him and those musicians on the screen well, which I did not, so I felt a bit dark in the dark. When Bruce was finally shown in action it was great and gave me a taste of Bruce Haack, but it was just a taste. We were treated to more musicians and I felt like I was being told, "Look - all these cool musicians are on top of him, so he has to be cool!" I was not really interested in the musician's comment on Bruce. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Bruce as a person. You know, the important stuff - more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life and yes, his use of drugs and other topics. I would like to know so much more about his "Hackula" project. I wanted to get into his mind. Even if they did this over a few "Voices of God" comments and photos, that would be OK. <br /> <br /> The animations were good, but I felt they were not used as filler anything else but I'm allowed to listen to his music and see pictures based on the Dimension 5 plates. I thought it was smart and creative, but I wanted to know more about Bruce! <br /> <br /> Maybe Bruce Haack was so elusive in real life? Anyway - in the end I enjoyed this documentary and felt a kind of sadness that such amazing pioneers and geniuses as Mr. Haack will be forgotten, because the march of time stamps goes on and on. I am glad that this film is about informing people about Bruce Haack, even if they have shortcomings.
