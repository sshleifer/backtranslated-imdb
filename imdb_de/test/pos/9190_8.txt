Fado is a sad, almost bluesy style of Portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly throughout the movie. As explained by one of the main characters (Igor), this also means fate. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is the fate that the two main characters Paco and Alex come together and cause the resulting problems. <br /> <br On the whole, I really liked it. It begins with a drama / road movie "on the down and outs" that turns into an exciting thriller / roadmovement. <br /> <br /> There were two things that I thought were unrealistic, that kept me from making it higher rating (I gave it an 8). The first is the main reason why Alex gave away the stuff. She was so desperate for money that she sold her passport for a small sum and then gave things that were worth thousands to a stranger? Her explanation was unconvincing. And how did they get through the gate, where were the cops?
