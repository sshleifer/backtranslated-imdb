I remember watching this movie a year ago on a C4 movie show, and I was thrilled. I thought the movie could represent such a variety of genres. The supernatural, a love story, the intrigue of crime and much more. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the whole thing in about a minute and was really worried about the characters. I felt scared for Jimmy in a second, and then I had to talk about the gangsters in the next ... and all the while I kept my fingers crossed that it would work for Jimbo! <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are awesome, Bryan Brown is of absolute quality and has hooked me up with David Field, who was both funny and a bad idiot. <br /> <br /> Since watching this movie I have managed to order it on DVD and as a result, every person I show it has been attached in the same way. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy evening, and it's one thing you can really appreciate with your friends.
