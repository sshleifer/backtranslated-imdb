Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is an example of the French transitional cinema. A film between the realism of post-war cinema and the magical and emblematic Nouvelle Vage. With a few spots of American classic films (but not imitated), the director tells us a story about love, crime, and the importance of viewpoints. We can also find great actors (Suzy Delair is impeccable). <br /> <br /> It is also interesting how we can find aspects of this film today. The legacy of the Quai des Orf√®vres is felt in the tradition of Woody Allen. Immerse a crime situation in a picturesque setting. The naive ending is also typical of Steven Spielberg's well-ending films. Finally, I would like to point out the Deja Voo sensation during the photo session between Jenny Lamour (Suzy Delair) and Dora Monier (Simone Renant), in which the first one has to admit that she believes that her husband is unfaithful and exactly with the woman Who is taking pictures? This scene is exactly the scene between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer (Mike Nichols, 2004).
