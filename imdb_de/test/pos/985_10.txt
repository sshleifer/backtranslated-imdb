This was definitely worth watching for a TV movie. The whole drama was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I have not read / seen the original and I do not usually like Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie (the civil war was also very successful). Do not expect to see an epic, but you should move it enough to enjoy it. By the way, on a side note, do not compare this (or any other movie) with the original work. Movies are not meant to transfer a book to the screen, but take the general idea of ​​it and adapt a story. When people say "the book was so much better" (they're wrong anyway), what they're really trying to say is that the book was so different.
