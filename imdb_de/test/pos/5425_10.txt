Richard Condie is a Canadian wonder and should be shared with the world. Be it for the good-natured early work such as "Getting Started" and the Oscar nominee "Snit" by "The Apprentice" and the digitally created "La Salla", Condie is a valued local hero. But no unique work characterizes his career as "The Big Snit". And did I mention that it was nominated for an Oscar? Damn tootin '. <br /> <br /> "The Big Snit", although clearly an obsolete news carrier from the 80s (the short one is about the destruction of the Cold War - it's about atomic destruction, but do not worry, it's funny hell) , has a greater importance, as most Condies work in a subtle way. As the planet of Armageddon scurries for cover, a few argue about the annoying habits of others (in the manner of Condie he chops the furniture, while literally shaking his eyes). And do not forget to look at it again and again, because there is always something to see. Condie invites this guy with countless visual gags and catchy buzz words. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend tracking this incredible piece of animation. In Canada, it is usually seen in a National Film Board video with other stellar shorts (including Winnipegger Cordell Barker's equally funny "The Cat Came Back"). Americans just have to dig a little deeper, but keep it up? The reward is worth the effort.
