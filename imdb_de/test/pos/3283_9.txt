Okay, this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses on a few liberals. The thing is, South Park makes fun of everyone, much like the Simpsons. If you are offended that a politician you like makes fun of, then maybe you need a better sense of humor and take the show too seriously. With that said, this episode is hilarious and one of the best. The portrayal of Al Gore is hilarious, Cartman's scheme is terribly wrong and the results make you roll on the floor. It's basically anything you ever want from a South Park episode, and it's easily one of my favorites. I will not comment on the story because I do not want to reveal anything.
