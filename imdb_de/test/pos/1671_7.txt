In my opinion, this film noir had two completely different things from the noir films I'm used to: 1 - the scene is Paris, France; 2 - There is a 28-minute scene without dialogue. <br /> <br /> Both make this movie a bit unique, at least for English-speaking Noir fans. Actually, an American, Jules Dussain, made the film, so it's not all about a European movie. At first I was disappointed after seeing the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However, as soon as the silent segment started - the actual robbery (you already know what it's about), the movie has become significantly more important and just got better and better story was what happened after the robbery. The best aspect of the entire film was cinematography. That makes the disc too valuable. It's an excellent film noir photograph and a real travelogue for those who have never seen Paris ... and this is Paris in the mid-1950s. There are many bleak, but interesting, rainy Parisian streets and buildings that I was fascinated to see. In fact, there was much more of these great shots in the much better known film The Third Man than in London. The main actor here, Jean Servais, I believe, is also his name interesting to see. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton, and that sums it up perfectly. A warning to anyone who does not expect profanity or nudity in a classic movie. This is France, not the United States, so there is a bit of both here. I appreciate the DVD with the choice of subtitles or a synchronized version.
