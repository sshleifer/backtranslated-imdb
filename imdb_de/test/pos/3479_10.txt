This movie was amazing, he was extremely funny and moving. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have put together a great movie that will appeal to all ages. James McAvoy and Steven Robertson have made this movie brilliant. Their acting was excellent, there was a real realistic feeling between them, what they really believed to be the characters they played. Romola Garai is amazingly great and brilliant in her role. The story of these two physically challenged people and their caregiver is well-established, and you really start to get to know and feel the characters as the movie progresses. In the end it was particularly disturbing. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a really warm movie. Warn the more sensitive viewer, and make sure you have the handkerchiefs you need. <br /> <br /> Another great movie !!
