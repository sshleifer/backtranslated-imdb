For a long time, this was my favorite of the Batman movies. It had the best camera and a distinct feel with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the ever-interesting Christopher Walken. After the final viewing, however, it finally slipped off in my reviews and I honestly prefer the recent Batman: Batman Begins with Christian Bale. <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - Still, this is still the most intriguing of the five recent Batman movies. The stylish cinematography here is the best of all Batman films. Director Tim Burton is known for his films, which deliver impressive images, as this is an excellent example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Among the villains, I preferred Catwomen because she enjoyed watching them before and after her move. Violence is not exaggerated here as in some other Batman stories, but you'll never get bored when you see that. As in the first movie, Michael Keaton does a great job as Batman / Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> THE BATH - For a movie based on a comic that is mostly read by children, I still think of the first two Batman films, both filmed by Burton, were too dark and the Profanity was definitely not appropriate. Although unlike the first film, the name of the Lord was not used here in vain, there was still obscenity and both rogues made too many sexual remarks. That would have been fine if they had not marketed this movie for both children and adults. Danny DeVito's "Penguin" is downright rough in spots. "Grotesque" I can handle, but who wants to "disgusting". In the meantime, few people complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer, who played Catwoman. Generally too much darkness and a few cheap shots on Christian bashing have also led me to rethink my previously high rating of this film. <br /> <br /> OVERALL - Fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this movie one of the most intriguing in the Batman series, but darker edges, too crude and too much anti-religious leanings finally made me look at the movie for half a dozen times from. Sorry, but I prefer a gentler Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most of them will not agree, but I was glad that the series brightened up after this series.
