I think New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best one-line review of In the Mood for Love when he said that it's "dizzy with a romantic spirit that's missing cinema forever." How true are these words! Really romantic films are so rare these days, while there are movies that contain a lot of sex and nudity (which are often blurred and unfounded). Given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest film feels like a much-needed breath. In the Mood for Love is the bloody romance between two neighbors ("Mr. Chow", played by Tony Leung and "Mrs. Chan", played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses have an illegal affair, since they do not try as they are. "But after hanging around on lonely nights (while their spouses are" on business "or" caring for a sick mother "), they fall in love with each other and resist the temptation to go too far.> <Br / > Several factors make In the Mood for Love a new classic among the "romantic melodramas" in the best sense of the term: First, the specific period of the film (ie Hong Kong of 1960) is faithfully reproduced to an astonishing degree of detail Clothes (including Maggie Cheung's beautiful dresses), music (such as Nat King Cole), and the overall atmosphere of this film evoke a nostalgia for that specific period Second, Christopher Doyle's award-winning, breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment that does not surrounds only the two main characters, but in each of their magnificent, carefully assembled frames with romantic His desire to spray seems. Do not fool me: Mood for Love was the most beautiful film of 2001. (It should also be noted that Wong Kar-wai's usual hyperkinetic visual style (understandably) is toned down for this film, though its palette is preserved just as colorful.) Third, there is the haunting score of Michael Galasso, who runs slow-motion sequences of z Chan in her elegant dresses, Chan and Chow "look" at each other when they meet on the stairs, and other beautiful scenes that stand out memorize the memory. The main score, in which the instruments sound as if they are literally crying, is heard eight times in various places in the film, underscoring the sadness and yearning of the two main characters. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung perform well (Leung won the Best Actor Award at Cannes), and they manage to produce real chemistry on screen. <br /> <br /> The elements above merge and work so well together Create a movie that feels timeless, "dizzyingly romantic" and in a word magical. Mood for Love may have reminded me, more than any other movie from 2001, why I love going to the movies. And I think that's the highest compliment I can pay for a movie. <br /> <br />
