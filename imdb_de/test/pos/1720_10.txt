I love pop culture, but I was a bit worried when I heard this for the first time. Then I saw an episode and I LOVE IT! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Eccelson was not going to play Doctor Who anymore. He was probably the best they had. He fits so well with the figure. It is sad to see him go. I really do not think the new guy will go through both the doctor and Eccelson. <br /> <br /> I think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some places and the creatures like the Darleks. The storylines and characters can more than make up for that. I'm currently waiting for the second season and will repeat that if quality goes down for some reason. Anyway, I think everyone should try to watch an episode. I did it and I've loved it ever since. Well written, well cast and produced, this show is worth an hour. Doctor Who gets a 10/10
