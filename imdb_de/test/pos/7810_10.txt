There have been few great comedy films in the history of Hindi cinema. Andaz Apna Apna is one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of getting rich through the marriage of a millionaire daughter (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to outsmart each other and ask for Raveena. The plot thickens as Paresh Rawal & Co. wants to take over all the wealth. The movie is good and very funny. Rarely does one encounter a Hindi comedy that is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only movie!). Unfortunately, it was not possible at the box office and we might never again see a movie of this caliber. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has proven his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a fool. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma, Raveena's assistant / girlfriend, is also funny. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania add to the taste of the movie! All in all the best Hindi comedy ever made, and I wish they would produce more quality movies like this one. You will want to see this movie again and again. <br /> <br /> PS - For those who have seen this movie, I also recommend Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new) etc.
