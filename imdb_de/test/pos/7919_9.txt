I believe that anyone who enjoyed Eisentein's Ivan the Terrible films would enjoy this well-built film. This movie was like "The Lord of the Ring: The Return of the King", but without the special effect, but as a good and better drama. <br /> <br /> We have conquered the Germans who dressed like KKK from Novgorod Russia. The Russian called on Nevsky to lead her to a fight against the Germans to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov, who played Ivan in the films Ivan the Terrible, was charismatic as a Nevsky. The first 10 minutes of passing the Mongol were captivating. <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white. The anticipation of the war did not require a dialogue like "how many enemies will we kill," etc. With the exception of a few speeches, the movie can basically be played as a silent movie. The fight scene can compete with those of the Civil War battle scene of The Birth of a Nation. Another strength of the film is the great music of Sergei Prokofiev. The music gave the film an epic feel in these scenes without dialogue.
