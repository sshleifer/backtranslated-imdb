This film is about a single mother who is happy, to the point that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensible, youthful daughter who is undergoing youth riots from beginning to end. Both Ann and Adele are well described right from the beginning, so we learn how different their personalities are. Inevitably, conflicts arise and they are presented in an appealing way. I'm so attracted to their state of mind and their circumstances. It's like living their lives and feeling what they feel. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon gives another outstanding performance in "Anywhere But Here". She is charismatic, happy, hedonistic, warmhearted and affectionate at the same time. I've always liked Susan Sarandon, and I think she's grossly underestimated. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is a fascinating emotional journey.
