Overall, I give this movie a decent 7.6. In the beginning I say, I love how the character was displayed on the screen and adjusted. If you occasionally read comics or just watch DVD extras, you'll find that the blade character is drastically different from what we see in the movie. Among the changes, Blade is now half a vampire and therefore wins "all strengths, but none of their weaknesses." The merit of this is obviously David Goyer, a fan of the darker genre of comic books. Thanks to him, Blade has become a much more interesting character and I really think he's one of my favorite anti-heroes. Wesley Snipes is born to play this role, though some would probably have preferred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His acting here does not necessarily have to be an Oscar winner, considering the character, but I'm glad he wants to play the DayWalker in the two sequels. Starring Stephen Dorff as the main villain and Kris Kristofferson playing Blades Alfred, as it were. The drama is really good and the plot keeps the story safe. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts that I have to say. Like this movie, there are a few things that bother me, that get rid of this ranking with "Spider-Man" or "X-Men". Stephen Norrington made the villains portray as I honestly did not like them. Their lines were so full of dirty comedy that I did not really feel like a comic movie. In addition, "La Magra" as the last rogue is a little disappointing, but the intense sword fight makes up for that. Not to mention a sense of added non-realism: A black man in a leather coat with a sword coming out of a policeman in the daylight from a policeman seemed to run slightly unnoticed by the people passing by. ..Stupid. The music of Mark Isham was great and suited the movie well. Fortunately, all these issues are resolved and improved in the impressive sequel "Blade 2".
