This movie was great. It had everything a real action fan wants. Many people are shot and / or maimed, minimal romance with sex, a hero to identify with, violence at many intervals, instead of a pointless plot that ends up storing just one scene, and villains just craving it. Bronson seems to have the slightest tolerance in this movie, as it turns out. Ed Lauter is a great cop and has been seamlessly incorporated into Bronson's plot without stealing his limelight. The film does not include any action that is so boring or overly elaborate that you will watch this movie once and never again. Rather, you want to see Kersey in action, and the plot makes it easy. That's great stuff.
