SEPARATE LIES is such an elegant, intelligent and thought provoking film, and I could have seen Tom Wilkinson on the screen forever. The places in the English countryside, the wonderful London locations, the interior design, the elegant wardrobes and of course the writing and the dialogue made SEPARATE LIES an exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> From the American point of view, as the British are much more sophisticated in dealing with sexual escapades, I found it hard to watch Tom Wilkinson's stand when his wife is happily traveling on a sexual journey that she really does not care Pleasure brings much and desperation for her husband, with the Cad, who is Rupert Everett. Yes, I have seen the weaknesses of Wilkinson's character - his quest for perfection, the desire for everything in his place - but in Emily Watson, she would have needed to look deeper into his true character and goodness to see what she threw away. <br /> Tom Wilkinson turns SEPARATE LIES into a powerful movie by watching him experience all the pain, embarrassment and despair on screen while his wife is dating another man. And he himself makes the journey in SEPARATE LIES, understanding his mistakes, embracing his wife in spite of all that has happened and leading her back to London. Bravo, Tom!
