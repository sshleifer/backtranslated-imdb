Not the best act in the world, but the comedy in this movie governs. Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie. Another funny guy is Rob Schneider, who will make you talk to Ken Hudson Campbell, who plays Buckman. Lauren Holly probably plays the more serious character in the cast than Lt. Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this film and probably plays the most serious character in the film. The actor I liked most was Toby Huss as Nitro. Any electrical recordings his character makes in the movie are hilarious. Plot is a bit uneven, about Lt. Commander Tom Dodge, who has wanted to command his own submarine for years. When he finally gets the chance, he gets instead of a brand new submarine a rusty diesel Sub, the Stingray. His crew is no better, the US Navy is a bad luck. He is then used in a series of war games that show how an old diesel engine can compete with the current nuclear navy. Things still do not get better when he finds out that his diving officer is actually a female officer to see how women work on real subs. In order to get the position of the commander he wants, he has to win the war games and blow up a dummy ship. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty good. I have indeed laughed incessantly when I saw this movie in Theater. I loved it when they were in silence and Buckman farts, and every one's reaction to the stench is hilarious. All in all, 9 out of 10, this movie is just fun to watch, it's nice to have a movie so I hate movies that are trying to be 100% serious.
