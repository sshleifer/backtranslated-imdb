Lana Turner proved that in this 1940's charmer, she really did make a storm over the ultimate sacrifice her sister (Joan Blondell) brings to her. When both sisters come to New York, they follow Blondell's Beau a wonderful George Murphy in that movie. <br /> <br /> As fate would have it, the director of the show is impressed by Turner, but sees Blondell but a job as a cigarette girl. Not only is Blondell not only a star, friend, Murphy (Eddie) also falls in love with Turner. In order not to hurt her sister, Turner is ready to marry the show's producer, a wealthy womanizer who has married four times. <br /> <br /> The story ends as well as possible with Blondell, who quickly returns to Nebraska. Look for Paul Ford as a gossip columnist in the movie. He's hard to spot because of the film's date and the fact that it's much thinner. The movie leaves you wondering if Ford and Blondell could ever get together. Blondell, as a devoted sister, sacrifices career and love for her sister. This film is sentimental and could have worked better if shot in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Few realize that George Murphy, later Republican Senator from California, was a true songwriter in his day.
