eXistenZ was a good movie when I first asked what was going on, organic "pods" of mutant reptiles that you and other players connected via a umbilical cord with a surreal virtual reality game. Well, it seems a bit strange. <br /> <br /> But once it starts, it's a pretty good movie, with a few twists and turns with a great open ending and the good aspect of weridness throughout the movie, it's entertaining as you're not sure What's next <br /> <br /> Security staff throws away the metal detectors; They have bone rifles!
