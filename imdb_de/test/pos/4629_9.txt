Well, what can I say. <br /> <br /> I think I will start with a confession. I cried 4 times in my life. Once, when my father died, twice because of a friend in high school and at the end of this movie. This film deals with the real confrontation problems of 6 students and forces them uncomfortably into the public so that the whole world can see them. I've never seen a movie about the human emotional state. Everything here is treated from incest to incontinence, and I doubt that there are many people who are protected from the familiarity with familiarity with at least a few scenes. at 14:37. Without letting you know who died, the story begins to tell from the beginning. it follows the life of 6 students until 14:37. it has been interchangeable and edited with personal interviews of the 6 teenagers so you can learn all about their life. their loves, hatred, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false confidence, self-loathing, corruption and arrogance. The overall result is a kind of "Whodunnit" that seeks to discover the identity of the suicide before it is revealed at the end of the film. without spoiling anything, I have to let you know. do not feel betrayed by the end. It contains a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> And now a warning. This movie is definitely NOT for the faint of heart. When I saw it, many people went halfway out of the cinema. Recognized by some content. Or maybe it is sometimes difficult to face the cold, hard truth of reality. This is what high school looks like to many people. I'm sure most would agree.
