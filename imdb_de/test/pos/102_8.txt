Although Bullet In The Brain is undoubtedly superior to short films, it looks more like shorthand than film. And it's a bit hard to pity the teacher when his smart ass remarks shoot him. But after the bullet penetrates his brain, we begin to understand a bit about why he was so clouded by life in the first place. This fairly short film contains a lot of details, and I feel like it should have been extended a bit - it almost seems to be too much for the details to affect you quickly. A slightly more relaxed pace and a less po-faced narrator in the last section could have helped this movie a bit. Despite these complaints, one can not deny that Bullet In The Brain is a pretty amazing work compared to many short films and even long films. The creators should be applauded as they try to make such a fundamentally emotional and educated film in the current climate of fast jokes and Hollywood action.
