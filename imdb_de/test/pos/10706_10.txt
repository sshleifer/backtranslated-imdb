A dazzling documentary about how a small group of idealistic young men used music, art and dance to unify and heal the community of Vigario Geral, one of the most violent slum areas in Rio ("favela" means in Portuguese) positive alternative to the world of deadly gangsters of drug dealers. <br /> <br /> In her feature film debut, Zimbalist and Mochary have created a movie that is breathtaking because it works on so many different levels. As a social document, there are the facts we need to know to have a context to understand the meaning of each story. The story itself is well-developed, with a strong narrative arc, and in addition, it is pierced with great suspense. There is one arresting, charismatic central protagonist, Anderson Sa: he is a smart, natural leader, extremely courageous, mentally developed, a talented performer, a visionary who gives his talk. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of music and dance entertaining. There are talking heads? Mainly Sa and his closest associate Jose Junior - but they are presented with imaginative cinematographic brilliance. The cut mixes footage on various topics and is occasionally accompanied by some fact-filled texts. The tempo is as lively as the music. Much is achieved in 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> Grupo Afro Reggae, the neighborhood club Anderson, Junior and several others founded in 1993, uses music and dance as weapons to fight against the drug bosses and the double police. They teach every kid who wants to attend a class with drums, dance, martial arts, and a community newspaper. The only requirement for children to belong is smoking, no drinking and no drugs. The movement draws a subtle, softly sold spiritual substance loosely based on the Hindu god Shiva, the destroyer of old habits. Jeff Zimbalist, who is also the senior cinematographer and editor, was a student of modern culture and media at Brown University. He has edited his chops to edit documentaries for PBS and others, and he teaches film at the New York Film Academy and elsewhere. Matt Mochary was, as Andrew Jarecki ("Capturing the Friedmans") recently filmed from the business world a few years ago. Zimbalist and Mochary Won the Best New Filmmakers Award in 2005 The TribBeCa Film Festival and "Favela Rising" were honored for Best Picture of the Year in prizes awarded by the 2005 International Documentary Association. I could go to sites about Afro Reggae, Sa and this movie. A better idea is simply that you see it! My grade: A 10/10
