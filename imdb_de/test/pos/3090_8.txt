As another IMDb reviewer put it: "... imagine in 2001: A space odyssey in the desert," and you would not be far from a brief summary of what you can expect from this piece of cinema (me deeply regret the word "movie"). A lecture on philosophical views on creationism, the myth about the existence of humanity, the before and after, that was what is and what becomes. For some, perhaps a "2001" on sand, but they treat different philosophical points of view, one about evolution and the future, the hope and the potential for humanity, while Fata Morgana itself is a somewhat metaphysical way. I just hope that I can convey it effectively enough. <br /> <br /> Duke's style will not be for everyone, and those who are not part of a hardcore branch of cinematic television will most likely find it tough and can not finish even after 72 minutes go through. Fata Morgana combines a montage of Sahrawi footage, including villages, villagers and various other places, for a somewhat surreal ending, music of various genres and an almost mythical narrative. It is very slow, but ultimately very rewarding. <br /> <br /> With a montage of various filmed flight shots of aircraft landing nearly five minutes, you are already getting the introduction of the movie, which is immensely confused, and the feeling that this will not be like anything you do before the echoes in your head clear. Divided into three sections, Creation, Paradise, and the Golden Age, Fata Morgana attempts to juxtapose images of the natural beauty of the desert with man-made instruments. Its three segments are narrated by different people, each specific to each section, and they pay particular attention to the long soliloquy and desert montages. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana is a film that deals with the existence of mankind our earth. It looks at the natural beauty for which the Earth was designed, and at the same time sees the potential beauty that we have inside us, above all our negative contributions to the world in which we live. Each shot has been purposefully constructed, with what can only be described in the context of this film as "The Holy Trinity of the film" is described in pictures, words and music. Each part of these three pieces offers something special for each shot, but when put together, they make something bigger than all their pieces. They create unbridled beauty and deep thinking in our mind. I will not be able to make this film by mere words if I had only pictures and a score, and I know that this is not appreciated by the masses, but this is profound and I will not use it Term "art film", because this is just art. This is a moving art that moves the mind and moves the soul. Whether creationism is your wish or not is irrelevant, because this film is about intelligent design.
