This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is subtly told what sets them apart from most films with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also good at "coma"), which appears in an initially inexplicable situation. He has been married to Ching (the great Anita Mui, in her last role before being brutally abducted) for 20 years, and seems to be a loving relationship. When Ching offers to take care of her and Mr. Lam's former teacher, Choy and Lam have the opportunity to be together. What makes the movie so good is the approach of director Ann Hui. It takes a while for the Lamsm's secrets to be revealed, and everything makes sense. The movie is very dramatic and touching. You have no dislike of the situation of the teacher / student, something that raises this movie about the same action. It's slow, but stay with it. Revel in Ms. Mui's wonderful, non-glamorous but beautiful performance. She was and is very special and in this movie you fell in love with her one last time. It's worth the time to be a witness and just be with her.
