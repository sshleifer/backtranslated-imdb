Supercarrier was my favorite movie in the late '80s when it came out. My dad took it for me and I've seen it all the time until my stepmother glued Oprah over it and my heart was torn. I would like to know if or where I can get it. I searched for it. I think they even came out with a Supercarrier 2. It was not as great as the first, but I would like everyone if I could find it. I do not think @ all that it was a bad movie. It was a very interesting movie with a lot of action, but it had a kind of love story. The actors in the movie were great. It also helped me to understand that this is not just a male world, but also a women's world. Many women can do the same, if not more than what a man can do and women deserve respect for their duties.
