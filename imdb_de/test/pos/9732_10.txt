Borrow this film if you are incredibly tired or otherwise impaired ... The acting in this film is so bad that it seems intentional, and to let you know how bad the special effects are, there is a scene where the dolls come to life, where you can see most of the hands holding and moving the doll. The film looked as if it had been shot with a camcorder. When I saw this movie for the first time, a fistfight almost broke out when my friends and I made names with this movie. It was so terrible. If you enjoy getting mad at movies, I recommend this to you, otherwise run as if your life depended on it.
