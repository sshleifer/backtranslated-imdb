Hard Justice is a great action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting! For the people who say that they do not do shoot-ups the way they are used to. Well, this one is really tough! David Bradley is really good and his character does a lot in the movie. He is hit by the stick more than a dozen times, stabbed in the back and in a coma for three days, wakes up and fights again, gets hit, recovers and is ready for more action! His character is incredibly tufted! Charles Napier was also very good and he probably steals the show! Verne Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka had a short and an uncredited role in Hard Justice! As far as the action is concerned, it's really great with all the shootings and huge gaps like the scene in the beginning, where cars are blown up and jump into the air! In the 95-minute run so much happens. For the action fans, you'll be overwhelmed by all the firepower and combat this movie has to offer! Hard Justice is a movie that is not easy to find. If you are in a video store and for sale, buy it because this movie is a great keeper and the box is cool! There is a lot of action that must be seen to be believed! Find out if you can find some great deals at Ebay, Half.com, Amazon Z-Shops and Marketplace Merchants! I recommend to any action movie fan who loves to shoot Ems and fight movies who was disappointed by other films that look like a real non-stop action movie, but do not deliver to reach Hard Justice!
