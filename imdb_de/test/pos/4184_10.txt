I just can not understand why people are surprised that this movie does not make sense. It should never make any sense. (Duh! The authors were wasted on Frodis at the time.) It should be fun and fun, and both are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The Monkees are good actors. They would not have been hired if they were not good actors. Mike has something for Deadpan and Darkness, Micky is the best of pure psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran and Peter actually had people who thought he was so stupid in real life. Do not tell me that they can not act because they can definitely do it. <br /> <br /> You can also write. Sure, Jack & Bob will get the only credits, but in fact they've gotten a great deal of help from the screenplays of the Monkees, who were also in that smoke-filled room. <br /> <br /> (it's absolutely impossible to ruin this movie) The head is very symbolic. Among the most memorable elements are the black box, which was actually based on two things: the Monkee image to which the boys were bound, and the real black box on the screen Gems-lot, in which the band stood between two takes. There is so much more symbolism in the movie that I just let you watch and find out. <br /> <br /> The music is great. "Circle Sky" is one of Papa Nez's best pieces, and "Porpoise Song" and "As We Go Along" will delight you. If you prefer weirdness, then "Ditty Diego", "Can You Dig It?" And "Long Title" be satisfying, great songs that they are. And then there's "Daddy's Song", undoubtedly a tribute to Davy's Broadway Days, and the editing / color scheme for this sequence is superb. (At least for '68.) Oh, for those of you who do not see a 'PG' movie, you miss it. Especially since 1968 was originally rated R in 1968. The rating was lowered about twenty years later! <br /> <br /> Where was I now? Ah yes, "We talked about beliefs, beliefs and conditioning ..."
