I saw this movie when it first came out. Patty did not want to be separated from her siblings. However, the system of juvenile justice does not matter. When Patty saw the file, the judge sent her to a juvenile detention center. He claimed that she violated the privacy policy by looking at private files. She just wanted her family together. I could not blame her. The parents were not even fit. One of the smaller children had to have a toilet. The father stopped and let her go. He drove away from him and left the children at the gas station. Patty had to take the authority to protect her as she was the eldest. They were housed in nursing homes. The good thing is that the social worker got her back as a family. The chief social worker repeatedly told him to push and not to interfere. He was power crazy. He was the one who brought Patty to the youth facility. Why did not they go to the father who was released from prison to give up? Nevertheless, the children are caught in the middle and feel insecure.
