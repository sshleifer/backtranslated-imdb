I was a big fan of Charlie Chaplin after first seeing "The Gold Rush" and then "City Lights." I really wanted to see "The Great Dictator" because I was told this was his best movie. I was also fascinated by the fact that it was a talkie. My first, Chaplin-wise. <br /> <br /> The beginning is a typical Chaplin and a blatant proof that Chaplain can cut the sound without relying on the music to set the mood and speak. It's funny, well tuned and the elements of slapstick, like the dropping off of an antiaircraft gun, are well connected with the jokes. It was good to lure the viewer into this 'classic Chaplin' opening, and at the same time start the narration of characters getting to know each other. What was done well was the way Hitler was faked. Every scene that involved Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this movie was funny and even now; It makes you think back because you know exactly who you are faking and creating a kind of inner reaction. The way English is blended with the sham German during the dialogue scenes is further proof of how Chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. My favorite joke was the five-minute speech Hynkel gave, just for the English translator to translate into a few words. You remember Hitler's footage, which you saw at some point in your life and indeed laughed at him. <br /> <br /> Historically, the movie has done a few things right. You can see how Hynkel is photographed with children; Something that Hitler did for the recognition of the media, but here you can see how Hynkel yawns and looks bored; Hitler's underhand technique, with which he has conquered the German public through pity (Oh, he hugs and kisses children, he must be alright!). The film also has the fantastic premise of a Jewish civilian reinstalled in the ghetto under all the travesties that have gone, but with the hook he does not know. Films like "The Pianist" and "Come and See" are two good examples of the cruelty of the National Socialists towards "inferior" people, whom we can all look back on today and shake our heads. The fact that he had the cruelty and exploited makes it even more amazing. Chaplin has managed to replace rifles and truncheons for tomatoes and cooking pots, and still pulls it off. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the movie was the fact that after the opening it became a real story. This slowed down the movie and this is very noticeable as the foot was slightly taken off the gas. The film began to suggest stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the neighbor, who had fallen in love, and the supposed destruction of Hynkel Palace, while none of them was actually developed. Those who "shave a woman" and "who has the coin in the pudding" indicate these action paths, but in the end they only turned into excuses for lengthy, unfunny gags, which was disappointing. <br /> <br /> During the final stretch, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the introduction of the Italian dictator, who adds some much-needed life and apology to the movie for the comedy. It's a treat when we see them arguing, and more tactics are exploited when Hynkel tries to "overwhelm" his Italian counterpart with a series of dirty tricks (though they are humorously thwarted). Despite some weaknesses in the tempo in the middle segment and the fact that in the end the message was pushed a bit into my throat, The Great Dictator thinks it's good today, but that's just because he risked the game to exploit things, that nobody else really knew was there
