Niagra Niagra was certainly not the best movie I have ever seen. However, I can not describe how the film made me look and how I felt in the end and how I feel about it now. Very few films have such an effect on me. I like her or not. I regard Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it and it can remind us of something or it can be scary or fun etc. This movie did not have me in the best of moods. In fact, I somehow felt empty. I think because the lives that these two people led were in many ways so empty. They had no direction. Her only direction was to have no direction. They had a lot of issues to deal with and I guess I had to get away from something that could not have been a happy life. But on the way it really only got worse. A steady decline from the point where it started. It was sad because it was played so well, and I think we've probably all seen someone in a situation that is somewhat similar to the situation in which these people were. They would have had a good life if they had any idea how. But it was clear that they did not know what to do. So they somehow wandered to a place they had heard of. No real goal. They had no idea how they should have a goal. They had no idea how they could overcome the life they had set before them. I felt bad but could not stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel so much like a movie that I do not want to, if only someone plays the roles. These two did a great job until you just did not see acting. I am very impressed and would like to buy the movie if it is available on DVD. You know. I felt a bit like Leaving Los Vegas. But again it's a class of its own. Not a great movie, but worth an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person who has problems, I would not suggest that you look at it. It could depress you. It has depressed me and I do not have the conditions these people had. JimmyJoeJetter
