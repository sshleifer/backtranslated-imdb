I love this movie very much. I have to get that on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so bad that you can not read a written joke about the door of the station. I'm always surprised that Blankfield did almost nothing after that. He has both Dr. Made Jeckle and Mr. Hyde absolutely believable. <br /> <br /> The film is plagued by its low budget. (A disgusting cut jumps in the middle and was described in "Siskel & Ebert.") But there are a thousand jokes, signs of gags to subtle clues that more than compensate. I often quote lines (or sing "I have nothing to hide") and from time to time describe a scene that fits a conversation. There are at least six scenes that are among my favorite comedy pieces. Spectators without cocaine use can miss a lot of gags. <br /> <br /> "Here, take it." * Visible from driving while I blew out of the window. * "I said," Is this place occupied? "" Nice Burn! " Visualization of boys, headdress, jockstrap and flippers. * "Yes, I'm right-handed." * "I i!" says the woman trying to sell 'nads'. * "Bernie will love these." * "These are my feet, Jack." says the black feet. * "Why should we tell you?" ... "IT IS ON THE SUPERMARKET!" * "Ivy!" on supermarket PA. * The entire shopping cart is loaded into the ambulance. * etc.
