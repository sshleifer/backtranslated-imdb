This is an incredibly compelling story told with great simplicity and grace. The story itself is the object of the film, though the scenery is beautiful. Acting is unobtrusive, even though the characters themselves come through in all their eccentric simplicity. <br /> <br /> This artwork is probably not appreciated by those who watch movies "casually" without due attention. It takes work to get involved in the story, but once you get involved, the fascination is complete!
