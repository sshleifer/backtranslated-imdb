Vasili Pichul's 1988 film Little Vera is an important account of the decay of family values ​​and human dignity after Soviet communism. He is a milestone of modern Russian cinema. Pichul's brutal drama marks a strong departure from the images of idealism promoted during the Soviet era (as in Aleksandrov's circus), which brutally puts the social chaos of his time in the limelight. A contemporary Ukrainian scene reinforces the effect further, firstly through the immediacy of the film in its time period, secondly through the use of a theater that fights for identity not only in the place of a Soviet system, but also as a nation distinct from the Russian language USSR dominates. <br /> <br /> Vera, the title character and protagonist of the film, is a rebellious, youthful girl with a "dysfunctional" family, which includes a heavily drinking father and a mother-born mother. Vera refuses to reject evil Andrei and begins a destructive (and especially sexual) relationship with a college named Sergei. Despite her parents' aversion to lazy Sergei and despite Sergei's rude contempt for her parents, he moves into her close quarters. Tensions escalate until Vera's father stabbed Sergei drunk. Vera has to decide if she wants to be faithful to her unbearable family by attesting that her father has acted in self-defense, or continues to support and defend the increasingly remote Sergei. <br /> <br /> In almost every conceivable way unbearable, Little Vera captures and communicates the inevitable emptiness left behind in social life after the collapse of communism. The film's sexual aggression (it was the first film showing explicit sex), combined with the relentless portrayal of social reality (a clear demarcation to the socialist realism that Stalin had demanded), effectively addressed the conditions of the formerly Soviet life. Most interesting, however, was the public reception. While many hate messages to the director and star wrote, the film was extremely popular. Here is the double-edged character of "Film as Social Criticism": if done right, the film will make the audience uncomfortable. Since there is no easy solution, some viewers will hate the movie and the filmmakers because they "bring up" the topic. Many movies seem a bit like me in this respect: Larry Clark's Kids, Harmony Korines Gummo, even popular movies like John Hughes' Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to those who do not feel the prospect of nearly two hours of domestic conflict and social miasma. The movie is absolutely beautiful and incredibly challenging. Despite the difficulties of seeing the film, some moments in it are deeply beautiful. Of course, the film's socio-historical and cultural significance can not be overlooked and is an even more convincing reason to watch this movie.
