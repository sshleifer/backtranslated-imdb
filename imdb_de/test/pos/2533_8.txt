When he was released in the early 1980s, he brought to Brazilian society the problems of young delinquents and their impact on Brazilian society. I can not see the movie at this time because I was too young, but now I had a chance and looked at it a few days ago. It is a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true and sad. Pixote is the name of a 12-year-old boy who lives on the street and survives with offense. He stays in a jail for a while, and as he leaves the house, he continues to plan raids with other buns and a prostitute, played by Maria Pera. The boy is still addicted to marijuana and smells with other teenagers to forget his sad reality. The quality of the pictures is not the best, but the film is absolutely realistic in terms of Brazilian issues and needs to be considered and admired.
