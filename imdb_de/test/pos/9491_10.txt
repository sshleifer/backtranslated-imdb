I bought my first Zep album in 1974 (at the age of 17) and have been thrilled ever since. This DVD has meanwhile found a permanent place in my music collection. It's not often that a band can make four virtuosos in their cast, but here we can. Each member made his own contribution to the band, but on the stage, the electricity they produced was larger than that of the four people. This masterpiece covers the entire career of the band from Led Zep 1 to Coda and this is superbly recorded on this DVD, as each concert shows how the band has been getting bigger over the years. Recently my copy has disappeared, but I'm glad to say it was found in my 17-year-old son's room when the new generation found out how great these guys were. This is a must for anyone who loves rock music. Long live Led Zeppelin.
