"Tesis," "Open your eyes" and "The Others" were proof of Amenabar's talent and skill as a filmmaker, but (in my humble opinion) flawed films were also in their attempt to outsmart the audience and always provide a twist Screw too many and prefer cheap thrills, twists and turns over depth and resonance. Fortunately for all Amenabar chose a theme for his new film that does not allow a surprising end, but focuses on the characters and the emotional bonds that bind them together. <br /> <br /> The result is a small miracle of a movie, beautifully written, photographed, rated, performed and staged. Everyone involved in this film delivers an impressive performance behind and in front of the cameras (Bardem shines, but Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Due√±as give the film an amazing authenticity) to Aguirresarobe excellently to present Lensing. <br /> <br /> The movie effectively picks up on many relevant topics and emotions, speaks with equal force to the heart and mind, and delivers one final punch to stay with you long after the credits end. This is a brilliant movie that will not only be a milestone in Spanish cinema, but will certainly be a pleasant surprise when it opens abroad (Sony Classics has paid a record of $ 6 million for distribution). Do not be surprised you manage to enter the Oscar race ... Amenabar is unstoppable ... <br /> <br /> Buen trabajo, Alejandro!
