Luckily, not all Dutch are so ruthless. I think Jason is judged by most people just because he has a famous dad. Maybe he's not as good as some of these actors, but he's definitely not as bad as suggested. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie a few years ago and I really loved it. I knew Jason from other movies and of course Robin of Sherwood. But I have to say that I liked his acting very much from this movie. It was really good! <br /> <br /> During the movie, I actually forgot that he was the son of. Sean .. who? <br /> <br /> And if you're a lover of Shakespeare, I can recommend this movie. I'm sure you will enjoy it!
