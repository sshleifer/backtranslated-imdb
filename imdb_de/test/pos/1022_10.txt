I was in school in the late sixties and early seventies and this movie is the way my school was. The school play, where the main actors kiss, that happened at my school. A crazy group of boys, my school again until we did a cross country skiing, we smoked! "Get the Whack," one broke into my school through a skylight and broke the sticks! After that they were kept in a safe !!! And for certain nocturnal activities! What should I say ... The film actually came out in 1982, I remember how I bought my house back then and the movie was running at the same time. If you like British movies and movies about school, growing up, and the pieces of the time, then this is for you. Another, very similar film, "SWALK", came out a few years ago and I would like to see that, also "Kes" belongs to the genre. Highly recommended. (But believe me, 1982 came out)
