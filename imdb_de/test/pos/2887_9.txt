Granted, Alex has become a bit podgey, but they are (for me) still the biggest rock trio ever. I can wholeheartedly recommend this DVD to any fan. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed that they canceled their planned last Munich gig (logistics) and did not regret seeing them elsewhere. The DVD is a small consolation - the biggest incentive to buy a correct DVD player. Naive maybe, but I still do not understand the importance of the drum dryer on stage; I would be grateful for any clarification. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Iain.
