The funniest performance was Shalom Harlow, Matt Dillon's girlfriend. She was more interesting to me than all the leading actors. This movie did everything wrong; Even the most reliable actress of the century, Joan Cusask, could not rise above the ridiculousness of the conspiracy. I enjoyed listening to "Macho Man" from the Village People in the credits. The rest of the movie could have been bearable if it rose to that level of energy.
