Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers of his time? Even an actor who, like Michael Redgrave, was usually so cornered, once brought a moody charm to a portrayal of W.B. Yeats The life of the authors is an inexhaustible source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> But of all the poets, it was Dylan Thomas, the wild, freedom-loving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and had drunk himself to death in New York at the age of 39) who was closest to the film industry was standing. During the Second World War, he produced screenplays for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote the script of a vapid melodrama called The Three Weird Sisters, in which three old maids in a Welsh village plan to murder their wealthy half-brother. All this is now forgiven. In John Maybury's The Edge of Love, Thomas is played by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It is not a complete biopic. The film covers four years in the poet's life in World War II when he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and former lover Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley), whom he met by chance during the war. It seems he loved both of them. The relationship of these extraordinary women - to Thomas and each other - is the focus of Maybury's gripping film. How it came about is an almost as remarkable story as that of the lovers themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson, the producer of the film, is the granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killick. William, a war hero (played in the movie by Cillian Murphy), married Vera when she was still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to shoot the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents, Dylan Thomas: A Farm, Two Mansions and Bungalow, by David Thomas, in which they described their confused life. Sharman Macdonald, who wrote the script, is the mother of Knightley. The role requires Knightley to sing, and her mother has recorded songs especially for her. Certainly, no film with such happy family connections deserves anything but success. <br /> <br /> We start in London during the lightning. Bombs fall, sirens howl and Phillips sings to house the crowds in a subway station. In a pub, she happens to meet Thomas and, after all these years, discovers that he has a wife and a child. Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship that is not plagued by jealousy or resentment. Soon they share beds and bathtubs, listen to Thomas reading his poems, exchanging confidential secrets and smoking his head like everyone else in the war. Caitlin proves to be more experienced on the ways of the world ("My first was Augustus John, he seduced me when I was 15"). But it is the refined and soulful Phillips that causes Thomas deepest reactions and finally succumbs to his charm. In the meantime, she reluctantly married Killick, who saw her at the subway station and was immediately fascinated by her beauty (if not her singing). <br /> <br /> However, it is an intense and strangely beautiful movie Thomas himself is perhaps the least impressive character. He is best for Under Milk Wood, his verse play on a day in the life of the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub, whose name was spelled backwards, not something English teachers drew attention to. I once had a record by Richard Burton who read the poem (he appeared in a 1971 movie by Under Milk Wood), and I never forgot the creamy, seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma, the magnetism of the man, I missed in Rhys performance. Thomas looks strangely pale compared to women in his life, even secondary. <br /> <br /> In his previous film, Love Is the Devil, Maybury explored the tumultuous life of the painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model, George Dyer. The edge of love seems to me to be a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what insights it offers in the sources of Thomas's creative inspiration, I would say Llareggub. But as an insight into his egoism, his smoldering moods and his general indifference to other people's emotions, it is wonderfully sad and enlightening. Thomas had a good war, drinking and writing while other men (including) Killick) were traumatized by the horrors of the battle. In a scene towards the end, Thomas's behavior toward his friends seems unforgivably callous. But that's not Thomas's movie. Murphy gives us a great study of the doomed passion and the emotional debilitation of the war. Miller is charming and pathetic as a woman. And Knightley looks almost too exquisite to be real (as she did in Pride and Prejudice). But that's probably her best performance. And in every way the movie is worthy of her.
