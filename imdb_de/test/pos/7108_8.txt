"House of Dracula" is a good sequel to "House of Frankenstein". There is not much action, but the acting is just as good. Onslow Stevens is the benevolent doctor who proves to be ill after a Dracula blood transfusion (Dracula actually received a transfusion to overcome his "woes," but conjures a hunchback nurse and then transfers his blood to the doctor.) It turns out That Dracula really did not come looking for a cure, but instead shed blood from a beautiful nurse, Dracula is destroyed and the Wolfman is next for a cure (which is successful) .In the meantime, Frankenstein's monster is discovered and short burned before death (do not worry, the same trio reappeared in "Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein.") John Carradine plays again an eerie Dracula (Baron Latos is his pseudonym at the beginning of the movie and in the "House Frankenstein") Lon Chaney is the likable wolfman and Glenn Strange returns as a Frankenstein monster Lionel Atwill plays again an inspector, what he often does in the monster movies of Universal Studios. A holder for your collection.
