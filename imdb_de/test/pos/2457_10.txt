This movie is powerful. I saw this movie at 3:00 in the morning, and I was supposed to be at work at 6:00 in the morning, and I do not have to say that I came to work late. I could not get myself up from my bed to go to work. This is the strongest movie I have seen in a long time. And that made me cry and felt the pain of the family. I think Emilo has staged this movie wonderfully. I agree with the previous comments from other views that this is the only film I've seen that brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through what a veteran has gone through. It is almost heartbreaking to think that people thought at the time that you could come home from a life-changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates somehow reminded me of my mother. I think she really showed how women felt and behaved at the time. I'm surprised that this movie was not for more prizes.
