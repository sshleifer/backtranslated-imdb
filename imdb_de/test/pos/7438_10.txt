I play Final Fantasy 7 and this movie is EXCELLENT like the game. All fans of Final Fantasy will love this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic and the story is good, but the best thing about this movie is the visual effects. The characters are the same game and this detail is good for the fans. <br /> <br /> You do not need to play the game to like this movie. All people can enjoy the movie because the story is a bit different and easy to understand. I buy the DVD, I'm EXCELLENT, I'm 100% CONSULTANT, if you do not see this movie, what are you waiting for? Believe me, you will fascinate like me
