This is the best 3-D experience Disney has in its theme parks. This is definitely better than the original acid-trip movie of the 1960s, which was in its place, leagues better than "Honey I Shrunk The Audience" (and far more fun) can even see the original 3-D "Movie Experience "Captain EO beat. This movie features some of Disney's biggest musical hits like Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and others, and smiled into my face throughout the show. This is also a totally kid-friendly movie, unlike "Honey ..." and has more effects than the spectacular "MuppetVision".
