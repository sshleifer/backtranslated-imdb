After watching Grindhouse recently, Video USA was looking for movies that were played in downtown Grindhouse theaters in the 1970s in downtown Grindhouse. The Hong Kong action film Five Fingers of Death seemed to be such a picture. The cartoon-like sound effects and the quick jump cuts initially seemed a bit distracting, but after a while I was so involved in the story and the characters. Parts of the music score sounded like the TV title song "Ironside," which was later used in Kill Bill films by Quentin Tarantino. Some scenes with the hero's fianc√©e seemed to border on parody, but were so brief that they did not ruin the movie. Most exciting are the tournament and then some revenge areas. Worth seeing for Kung Fu fans!
