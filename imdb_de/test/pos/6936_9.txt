OK, I got the DVD set last week and I'm finally releasing my reviews, but I've certainly liked this sequel in many ways. <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the undead. OK. This movie shoots in a quick clip, has some really good gore effects and some really nice atmosphere and style. Actually, I would say that this is one of the most stylish DV shot flicks I have bought. Most of the time I get annoyed with DV movies because they are boring and look like soap operas. Even a movie like Bone Sickness that I like has incredible DULL tracks. Not this movie. It never stops long to catch its breath. Although I would not say that I liked it better than the first movie, I'll say that Sheets has undoubtedly improved technically in the two years between movies. This one has a better gore, the inevitable zombie feeding scenes, dirt characters and a couple of recurring actors (though their roles are different), mainly Jerry Angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet. The footage is more ambitious than the script this time, because you can tell Sheets is trying to slow down a lot more than the first movie. Some of them work and others do not, but I have to say that at least he did not try to make a bigger version of the first movie. This time, there was no mention of a chemical spill powerhouse, only Satanism and the Occult, bringing the undead back to life. That's why I applaud Mr. Sheets for trying to do something different with him. I'll give this movie two bloody thumbs up!
