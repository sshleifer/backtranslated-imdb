The first movie at the Fangoria Festival in Vegas and the most challenging. It is not a movie for everyone. Some of the following films used predictable classic horror formulas to tell predictable stories. This picture seemed determined to do his own thing. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini showed some funny chops as the overblown villain. He dominated every scene he was in and turned his cloak around as if Leslie Neilson was playing Dracula. It was great to hear his explanation after the movie. He had such a good sense of humor about the role. <br /> <br /> I was glad that I did not have too many prejudices, because the movie had many surprises. The story was funny and profane and unusual. There was a lot of love that was paid attention to the look. Above all, it had a strange advantage. Unlike many movies that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, this movie used its look for a specific purpose. <br /> <br /> At the Fangoria Festival, there were a lot of films with a bigger budget, but none that dared to be so different.
