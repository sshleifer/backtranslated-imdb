In the 1980s patriotism, and in some cases jingoism, was fully developed. "Can we win this time?" A line known from Rambo: First Blood Part II could almost sum up how many people felt then. A longing for the style of movies they grew up with, with the balls on the wall, "we're good, you bad ... now let's blow something up and go home" while Rambo, Rocky and For the most part Top Gun seemed to be more geared towards attracting an older crowd. Iron Eagle approached the children directly. Canadian writer and director Sidney J. Furie brings out everything you love and hate at this time. The kick in the pants rock the 80s anthems (never say The, Road of the Gypsy, etc.) and sometimes almost an incredible action adventure. Iron Eagle was successful for one reason ... it was F.U.N - Fun. It's the kind of movie you can turn on and sit back to enjoy every ridiculous 80's moment. You do not have to think about whether it could really happen or if the drama is really credible, it's just fun ... and that's all you can really expect in this movie ...
