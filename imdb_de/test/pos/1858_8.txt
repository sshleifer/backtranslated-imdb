As this film evolves, you feel the mystery of human existence. If you carry around questions, inner wars, unsolved puzzles about the meaning of life, you will feel this movie with every bite of your body. Charles Darwin starts a war with an absolutely predictable ending. War with God His theories are similar to the fact that God has nothing to do with humanity, has nothing to do with the amazing world in which we live, which slowly supplants the hope of God. Nevertheless, as Charles Darwin in the universe of infinite evolution, the film still sees miracles and beauty beyond God.
