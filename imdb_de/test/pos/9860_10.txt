The Museum of Moving Pictures here in New York has recently shown a comprehensive retrospective of Jacques Rivette's films. After falling in love with "Paris Nous Appartient", I decided that this should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Largely through extended shots and flexibly structured scenes, the film features two avant-garde theater companies preparing their renditions of Aeschylus 'Seven Against Thebes' and 'Prometheus'. In addition, we are shown the directionless everyday life of two people who are far removed from the company: a worker named Frederique, who finds creative ways to force men out of her money, and a young man named Colin, who visits local caf√©s, deaf and dumb and plays shrill harmonica with the guests until they pay him to leave. The first four hours are dedicated to defining the characters and their patterns, before finally creating a somewhat loose, bizarre conspiracy with conspiracy and the deciphering of secret secret letters. The film is mainly about life on the margins of society. The theatrical companies are a desperate affair, distracted by their thoughtful, emotionally charged exercises (which are really something to see), to distract themselves from the fact that their actions are unlikely ever staged or even seen. Colin and Frederique both have very few friends who become aware of them shortly after the excitement or excitement after the conspiracy, as they are encouraged to learn more about it. The film meditates on the consequences of a rejection of the normal society in several memorable sequences, including a long shot of Colin as he roams the streets of France calling poetry to himself. Therefore, the film was referred to as an analysis of the counterculture of the 1960s. There is no frame of the film that does not burst with energy and vitality. The fact that many dialogues and movements are improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediate. The camera also becomes an important character in this respect; During the movie, boom shadows are visible here and there or similar mistakes, but they seem natural and fit the action, because the camera is so important that a player plays in it. <br /> <br /> More than anything else I think the movie is a great example of another way to make movies, a place where movies are outside the usual pattern. For me it was an eventful experience, even more than "Paris Nous Appartient", although the latter has many thematic and structural similarities. A must for anyone who thinks about the nature of art.
