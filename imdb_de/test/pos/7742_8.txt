I can not say what the source for this movie is, but this is one of my favorite films by Paul Mazursky (director and co-writer). This is a repeat of the Shakespearean comedy, but completely removed from the stage. Without much text Mazursky and Star Cassavettes visually make a crisis of passion and the goal in the lifetime. Desperate to re-center, Cassavette retreats to a remote Greek island where the locals and the island itself have some magic. Especially with Raul Julia, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually appealing. And funny. It was not a big blockbuster, but if it comes on DVD, it will sell itself.
