If you're one of those people who think Lucio Fulci is about gore, guts, and zombies, you need to watch this (and "The Psychic, too."). Although the film contains some brutal scenes of violence and a disturbing theme, this is not the main issue here. This is a really impressive murder mystery driven by stories and characters that could possibly be the masterpiece of the director. Here he proves that he is a true craftsman and creates a memorable, disturbing, but strikingly beautiful masterpiece, filled with sinister Catholic imagery and interesting social commentary. It also has a great cast, including the beautiful Barbara Bouchet, as well as Tomas Millan (by Beatrice Cenci) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role. Yet it is the Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also starred in Fulcis bizarre "Lizard in the Skin of a Woman") who steals the scene in the role of Majara and performs a brilliant performance of a woman driven by her superstition and her vicious murder scene is especially heartbreaking. The second star of the film is Sergio D'Ofizi's film, which, along with the melancholy Morricone Esquire score by Riz Ortolani, helps to bring the "secluded Italian village with a dark mystery" to life. I have to admit that the fool who hits the rocks somehow pulled me off, but still this is a definitive Italian horror classic - a moving, sad and ultimately thought-provoking work by the genius. 10/10 for me. If you liked this one, I suggest you check out Alfred Sole's "Alice, Sweet Alice" as they are a bit similar and both are undervalued gems.
