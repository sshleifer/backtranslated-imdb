I borrowed this movie for two reasons. The first was all the best I read about it. I was definitely impressed and could not agree with all the reviews I read. The second reason is that I know these guys. I do not know Mark as well as Mike. He has not changed much in the years we know each other. I know him as "The Reaper" from a local Milwaukee radio station (WMSE). As he is in this movie, Mike is 100%. He once gave me a table that he made. It was a small, about 15 inches high, on which Metallica stood. The weird thing was that she only had two legs. Sometimes it's the thought that counts, and Mike always thought of others first.
