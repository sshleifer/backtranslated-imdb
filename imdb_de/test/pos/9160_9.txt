American war movie fans may be bored by this movie, but this boredom arises out of ignorance. Guerrilla oppression operations are always like this. Sit down and wait, get a few hookers, get drunk at the base, turn around and make a deal with the businessman, kick a prisoner and cover up the killing of the street vendor by the green private man. Then, boom, then drive two tankers and 10 minutes long a small arms battle with a high-profile machine gun. Then wait until Brass has found a way to defeat her fortress and kill some civilians in the end. If reality does not work for Western viewers, there is always Top Gun or Rambo (Top Gun realistic). <br /> <br /> The Best of Afganskiy Izlom's realism was the way in which all planes dropped flares like confetti. They had to do that because Carter and Reagan had given the mujahedeen so many rockets. The wave of the Mi-24 was also outstanding, even as an Apocalypse now a better helo attack. The sight of missile launchers and rockets was a scene of impending "death from above" for anyone they targeted. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the Soviets could shoot their honest Afghanistan film within a year of their departure, but it took six years. Afganskiy Izlom is just as real if you apply it to the NATO occupation. Someone will always pick up the gun and shoot you because they are more interested in the country. It's a movie that Westerners should see. Unfortunately, I do not think anyone has ever done English subtitles. I may have to do some.
