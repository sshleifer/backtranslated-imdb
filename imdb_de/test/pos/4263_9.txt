Jarl and Moodysson are part of a dying generation of political filmmakers. The Swedish people should appreciate that they try to uncover the truth when the government and the media actively distort and cover up the events surrounding the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see these innocent children mistreated and drugged by the Swedish police and sentenced to prison terms in political trials for sending text messages and avenging themselves for other actions. The only disagreeable thing about this film is that it will not reach the masses in Sweden, as it will only be shown in theaters and will not be released on video or televised. <br /> <br /> The political film is important because it can bring new perspectives and insights into complex issues and plays a role as a teacher of the masses.
