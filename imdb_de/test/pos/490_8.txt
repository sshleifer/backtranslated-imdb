Okay, sure, this movie is a bit outlandish. It's hard to take characters from comic books and add credibility to movies (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, who?), But that's very difficult. I've never read the actual comic book, but that does not really matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly for its merit, not for a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (Unless it's a film based on a true story, this requires at least an attempt at truth and accuracy.) Why am I going to give this film a pretty high rating? Because it tries. It is very hard. In my book, this is a fair attempt at an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Many movies were shot with vampire motifs. It seems everyone has something of vampire knowledge, be it the cross, the silver, the garlic, the aversion to sunlight, whatever. Some of these ideas are included here. The story is familiar ... a group of vampires who want to conquer the world, with one person (mainly) standing in the way. Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives only for the purpose of destroying the vampire masses who have slowly but surely moved into the world and share them with humanity. For the most part, mankind is blind to the fact that vampires exist around them. The vampires have even taken family members, people who want to be vampires and do the dirty work of the vampires for them to show how valuable it is that they are ultimately "turned around". Now I Remember There are many elements of this film that are similar to the story of the Roddy Piper movie "They Live". A hidden enemy, a hidden group of people plotting against them, the struggle for the salvation of humans ... everything that is also in Blade. <br /> <br /> Acting is not the best here. Snipes is only slightly better at best than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative freshman, is not that bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgotten as Blade Sidekick (he's to Blade, which is chip for The Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best job of the entire cast here, as a "head" vampire you just hate. <br /> <br /> I do not know, but I loved the special effects in this movie. From the blood-soaked vampire rave to the inevitable fight at the finale of the movie, the special effects are not half as bad. There's certainly enough blood and blood to go around, but that's a vampire movie, right? The various shapes and weapon types that Blade uses are quite unique and are generally not used in contemporary action movies. Snipes has more flair with a decorated sword than with a machine gun. Besides, there are so many more considerations to fight with a blade than just blow someone away. (Unless of course you are Indiana Jones.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not the best action movie ever made, but it's not half bad either. As a bonus, the music and soundtrack are pretty cool too. Say, in which other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek ?! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
