This is a great Valentine's Day gift. A gorgeous guy and a pretty girl fall in love trying to beat the competition in a baking contest. Very romantic. I'm a real fan of Costas Mandylor since his days with Picket Fences and he has not lost his charm. Lauren Holly is still lovely and adorable and they still have great chemistry. The side cast was good as well. Seeing all these wonderful desserts was a delicious sight. I loved that Costas and Lauren teamed up to win in baking competition and in love. This is the kind of movie that satisfies all palates, romantic and different. Hallmark always shows excellent programs and this is no exception. The whole family can see this movie. Also shows that sometimes love triumphs over adversity. I sighed and wished for more of this movie and also the yearning for these wonderful desserts. I recommend this movie for all ages. A great treat for all.
