Where should I start? Walt Disney's happiest movie "Lady and the Tramp" is one of, if not the most possible, of my favorite movies in Disney animated film. The sequel is pleasant, to say the least. I enjoyed myself throughout the movie. It was adorable! The Broadway style of the songs and the movie worked somehow, and I hummed the songs for the rest of the night. Anyway, if you ask me, I can sing all the songs. <br /> <br /> But where the film was (really) good for me, was bad in many other places. The animation was sometimes scary. Every time someone's face shot up close, I do not know ... it just seemed scary to me. Where the hell was Lady? She gets two lines of dialogue and only Doggy hugs Scamp at the end. She gets 0% interaction with the plot and her only son! <br /> <br /> But all in all, I liked it. Is it compared to the original? No. The songs are not that good (though a bit catchy), the plot was much less involved, Lady had almost nothing to do with it and it was not as cute as the first one. But if you are open-minded, you will have fun and maybe 'gasp!' I like?
