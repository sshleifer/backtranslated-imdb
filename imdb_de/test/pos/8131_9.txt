This is a thoroughly enjoyable, well-made movie. It's funny and sometimes funny. The finale is a bit disappointing as it tries to summarize everything neatly. The film is better remembered for its priceless vignettes: the Jane Austen staging, the camping trip as examples. B & H does not try to reflect the prevailing attitude towards homosexuality and bisexuality. Most characters accept sexual diversity quite well. In this sense, it is a joyous holiday from the homophobic society. And it's a feast for flexibility, a relaxation of rigid sexual categories - perhaps a happy harbinger of things to come.
