The people of my generation and the elderly know not only from the textbooks, but also from the witnesses and participants of the event about the Second World War (or as he is called in Russia - the Great Patriotic War). My grandfather was a soldier in Stalingrad, and when I was a little girl I heard his stories of how he had defeated the Germans. He also told me some anecdotes, not everything he told me was grim. But it's been a long time, and if I have a conscious interest in what happened there at the Battle of Stalingrad, I have to turn to books and movies to get information. Somehow most of the films I saw were made in the Soviet Union, only a few in Russia today. And "Stalingrad" is an exception. The film describes the war from the other side, and the fact itself is interesting. Everything shown in the film is quite different from what I'm used to. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me a lot of Remarque's "time to live and time to die" because the war is shown by an ordinary German soldier's perception. This soldier or lieutenant is quite obsessed that he is by no means a fascist. The film heroes from the well-groomed and enthusiastic Europe of the Italian coast come to the snow-covered, hungry Soviet Union. They are sentenced to die; It is clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> After the elite unit had participated in their first fight in Stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the sentence that reflected the whole idea for me. He said, "When you start to think, you will go crazy." In my opinion, this also applies to the spectators. You might think OK, I'll watch this movie and the movie will not dispel me, I do not have to apologize to the people on the screen as if they attacked my country and not the other way round. Sooner or later, but inevitably, you begin to sympathize with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant throws back his tears when he sees Kolya's execution. <br/> <br/> "Stalingrad" is hard to watch. All those frozen legs, dirt, executions, snow, hunger and ruined illusions. <br /> <In my opinion, Lt. Hans von Witzland one of the few films in which Thomas Kretschmann played his star roles. I've seen quite a few Hollywood movies that gave him unimportant bits of fries like "Next" or "Transsiberian" (why did he do that ?!). And after seeing "Stalingrad", I can not see that European actors want to get involved in American films, even at second place at any price. The fact confuses me deeply. I think Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better scripts than the ones he gives in Hollywood. And from what I have seen with him, "Stalingrad" is the best and that is undisputed. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the downside of "Stalingrad" is the way they speak Russian in the movie. Of course, I mean those who are supposed to be Russian. Say, the boy who spent some time with the Germans or the girl they wanted to escape with. Was it really that hard to find actors who could utter a few sentences without that terrible accent? At first I settled down to look at "Stalingrad" just to speak German because I'm learning the language. I did not expect anything out of the ordinary. But it impressed me, cried when I did not go at all. I know that I am 15 years too late to look at him, but "Stalingrad" is not a normal movie, and after 15 years he is still seeing and shocking.
