I did not know for a long time whether I liked this movie or not. This is surprising because I usually know it, but because the movie did not go anywhere, I was a little confused. <br /> <br /> Two people move into a somewhat communal household environment. If they find that their spouses are constantly on business trips or traveling, their attention wanders towards each other out of sheer loneliness. After a platonic love affair, the male lead role of Tony Leung Chiu reveals that he has a lover at his side. Su Li-Ten, played by Maggie Cheung, is injured, although her love affair was not physically done. Chiu leaves the country to return years later, when everything has changed. <br /> <br /> For the cynic, the movie is correct. By never actively or actually touching the part of love, but only approaching it, the film says more than so many others about the subject. I also believe that nothing good could have come of keeping the matter alive. At least that's the feeling I get. <br /> <br /> But if we want to believe it, Garica Marquez writes: "... love is a state of grace, not the means to anything other than the alpha and the omega, an end in itself," then misses movie like everyone else miserable. Or, if you tend to completely incomplete minimalism, it hits the mark. Which films in history have reached, approached or received this sentence, if only for a short time? My honest feeling in memory is about two. When Harry Met Sally effectively suggests this romantic perfection; and that's all there is to it. It's interesting that this happens when Harry Met Sally is promoted rather than attained. Can not anyone say something good about love after it has been reached by two people? Nicholas Spark's latest film The Notebook may be closer to this than any other movie; Do we believe that once love is reached, does it fly from radar to exist in perfection in another dimension, or, perhaps more truly, a latent vehicle for other purposes? <br /> <br /> In the Mood for Love is an honest film, with beautiful and generous cinematography, which Almodovar is worthy in every way, but in the end she just says, "Life is sometimes like that." Well, this is by no means a difficult affair, especially if well said, but the problem really comes at the end of the last act, when Kar Wai Wong tries to round out the film by formulating, for the second time, a broader historical theme that precedes the Background of the relationship that has just taken place. This is a worthy effort, and the variety of musical motifs played throughout the film is quite brilliant, but the relatively modest indictment of the subject plays too little to do much more than superficial to the holistically inclined audience so that the viewer gives up the split difference, a mistake in a movie. A director should know where he is going and how to get there. But honestly, it's just a wrong turn. Everyone knows, however, that there is only one notable imperfection to spoil the perfect barrel of honey. <br /> <br /> But the effort is definitely worth it. However, trying to broaden a historical theme and round out the film, beyond the couple's micro-meaning, is the real mistake without any real premonition. In a word, unfortunately it is not too late. I think it's too much of a challenge for non-Asian audiences who are not familiar enough with China's history to fully appreciate this far-reaching impact.
