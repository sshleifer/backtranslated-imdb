Shortly after Karen's death, this movie was made that Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen felt a little guilty about how they could have contributed to their health problems. As the years have passed (to be exactly 25) it must have become easier to deny any complicity. Richard spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the shots he made with her. He married his cousin Mary, and what I've read seems to be planning a next generation of carpenters with his children. He seems to have regretted making this movie, and maybe that's why he's not available in any form. It seemed to me a pretty honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent of Karen Carpenter.
