What do we say to a movie like Rock Star? Actually a lot! This is the kind of film that is almost tailor-made for the critics. It's also a movie I enjoyed as a MAJOR hard rock fan - not really loved at all - while he was aware of the many flaws and that the movie, while a decent assignment in some ways missed its chance, escaped the size and become a rock movie classic. Well .... <br /> <br /> I loved this movie - and would see it over and over again - but I know it's based on my personal taste - Rock Star is a movie that everyone who has experienced elements of rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures the time (long forgotten by many non-rock fans), as I believe Rock Star did. That's one of the movie's strengths, the concert material. You will feel like you there and how can a Hardrock fan not love that? As far as the atmosphere is concerned, Rock Star gets a 10 out of 10 and a 10 in 10 entertainment entertainment. If you want a movie to just let go and flow freely into fond memories of past good times, this is the movie for you. It's also the reason why I loved this movie so much. <br /> <br /> But it's not a great movie. I understand that and if it was my job to review films professionally, I would probably have to be a bit hard on that. The problem with Rockstar is character development. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with character development is this: There are none. None. The film has certain scenes - few and far from each other, but there are them - that appeal to size: WARNING LETTER SCENE SPOILERS: 3 examples - 1) when Izzy makes his debut on stage (including the fall he takes) < br /> 2) The first after-show party with Emily (Anniston and Izzy). <br /> <br /> 3) A little backtracking-In the beginning, when the original singer is laid off casually "Business as usual" sets the stage for what's to come. It is played very effectively. <br /> <br /> But the problem is, nothing ever comes. In this film, there is hardly any character development of anybody, the human personas are only touched, but never fully explored. I do not think that's the fault of the actors / actresses, especially Anniston, who tries hard, they just are not given much work. It's just that the script was weak and was unable to go beyond the "formula" into true film depth. Rockstar was so sugar coated at times (even towards the end) that it was almost ridiculous. And the scenes I mentioned were excellent and very believable. Unfortunately, this was not much in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer mentioned the lack of construction towards the end and I agree, but there was indeed a lack of construction about EVERYTHING. WHY is Izzy at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band does not allow him to write songs? It tests the limits of credibility. And honestly, the end was just crazy. It made no sense and had no reality whatsoever. <br /> <br /> When you see this, it's almost like watching a movie where the creators of the movie said: OK, that happens here and then that happens and then that, and so on. At the end it's not a movie about a boy whose dream has come true, it's just another thickly formulated love story. And you're wondering why so many details are left out ... <br /> <br /> I hope I do not feel Rock Star too hard because I really loved it - but not for the right reasons. I would have liked to like this movie as a great movie about the ups and downs of rock fame. Instead, I loved it for the feel of the 80s, the clothes, the hair, the lights, the life ... Although many others loved it, I suspect that most people live the life of a rock fan, like me or some, they play. I would have loved to see it crossed over and just made sure it's a good, well-narrated movie instead of a clich√©. I think one of the problems was the length. I hate movies for a long time, but this movie should have taken longer. If a film is really done right, the length is not even noticeable - there is just too much in the story as if it were as short as it was - that is one reason why it seems that neither the story nor the im Much further evolving movie portrayed human beings. <br /> <br /> To conclude - this is a movie you can really get involved with - but not a great movie. See it for fun. See it for entertainment. Take a look at the time when Metal was not just a part of life, it was a life - and for non-rock fans - you see a glimpse of a life that means and still means so many of us.
