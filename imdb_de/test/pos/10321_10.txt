This is the very first Three Stooges shorts I've seen with Shemp, and she's one of my favorites! <br /> <br /> I really liked that about Shemp when he returned to Curly's stroke. He did not try to be like Curly, he was his own character and I admire that! Shemp is my favorite third-time henchman, I like him more than Curly, but I like Curly as much as Shemp. Shemp is great, he's funny, he's stupid, he's SHEMP! <br /> <br /> I was really excited about the scene where he dropped the nickel and Moe came into the cabin with him to find her and they got tangled in the wires and were really hurt ! <br /> <br /> But what I really thought was scary was when Shemp smashed his face against the glass of the phone. He looked like a deformed Professor Snape! <br /> <br /> Poor Shemp had him Many bad things happen to him in this short series, but that's just a typical Three Stooges, there are always a lot of bad things going on! <br /> <br /> This short film is another must for Three Stooges fans! <br /> <br /> 10/10
