An apt description of Spock of an omnipotent Fops in whose trap falls the Enterprise crew. This was a sector of space our spaceship should have avoided: first, Sulu & Kirk simply disappear from the bridge; A landing party follows them onto the surface of an unknown planet and encounters Trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man, clothed in an earth from centuries past centuries. But it does show someone's abilities or something that goes far beyond humans, and does not register with McCoy's medical tricorder. The officers manage to escape to the ship, but Trelane keeps appearing like a wicked cosmic penny. He brings them all back, including some women, to continue his games. The dilemma now takes up elements of the "most dangerous game" in space, and there's a shocking, even annoying aspect to the crew's utter helplessness against such unrestrained power as guest star Campbell's memorable performance as an overwhelming, but not omniscient alien. His character is obviously an early version of Q, which was introduced 20 years later in the pilot project of the TNG series. Trelane's confrontational scene with Spock stands out amidst the strange drama that unfolds. As usual, Kirk quickly begins to look for potential weaknesses in his new nemesis, though he's pretty much outnumbered. The answers to exactly what or who Trelane is are all the time ahead of us. So when we learn the truth, it makes perfect sense in the face of Campbell's perfect play. He treats himself constantly, dressing up in front of an unknown audience, commenting things with a contagious, but not quite right flair - we can not pinpoint it exactly, but there is something missing here. Every few minutes, his tone becomes uncanny and the crew seems to be in grave danger now. In a way, you can not take your eyes off him and always wait for what he does next. Actor John de Lancie captured this similar sound as Q in the Next Generation series.
