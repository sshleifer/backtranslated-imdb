The elegant universe brings to light many ideas of the universe and existence. After watching this documentary, one can not help stepping back and revising their view of the existence of everything. On both sides of string theory there are a large number of scientists, mathematicians and others. It is constantly being challenged as unchecked and may be wrong. Next to the proselytization that everyone does, it is best to explain that quantum physics, the set of mathematical ideas that yields extremely good approximations to what happens to subatomic particles, has never made a false prediction. Not so with string theory. Nobody is willing to say in front of the camera that string theory is the truth, and the piece maintains a respectful distance from the subject.
