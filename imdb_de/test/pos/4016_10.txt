A truly unique and breathtaking film by Jules Verne's "For The Flag" by Czech director Karel Zeman. Although the story is played in a rather understated style of the late Victorian style, the visuals seem like a knockout. Zeman uses animations, graphics, painted sets, and model animations combined with live action to create the verne atmosphere the reader connects in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou, who illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies. The animation taken in beautiful black and white is of the highest order and not a Saturday morning change. There are underwater sequences where the fish are drawn so accurately that they can be used in a field guide. There are pictures of ships, submarines, flying boats, locks, and machines that are drawn to the point where you need to freeze them. To stop the scene and study the remarkable details that came into the production, the Victorian atmosphere becomes so designed that she looks like this world that has never been the genre before. If that is not enough, there is also the soundtrack, which is probably one of the best ever created for a fantasy or science fiction movie. A truly forgotten classic worth buying and buying. Always one of my favorite films of all time and certainly one of you. And remember, that was decades before CGI or computer animation. Kudos to the great artists who obviously use their hearts for this. It shows. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this film. A movie that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it love it - and appreciate it. This remarkable movie gets better every time you look at it. A true cinematic work of art by a visionary director.
