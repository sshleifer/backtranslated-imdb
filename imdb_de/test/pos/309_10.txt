Of all the Vietnam war films, this is probably the most frightening and disturbing thing, and that really says a lot with so many spectacular ones coming out. It has that crazy feeling. Everything in the movie is so messy that it scares you. It's not that it shows many different things compared to the other war movies in Vietnam. What pushes you to such a high level is that: <br /> <br /> The direction here was spectacular. Francis Ford Coppola shows his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors, he feels like he was at war. Most others show and show you the horrors of war. At Coppola, however, you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or a story. I have only seen a few times in the film. Of course the writing was amazing too. It got you to write in the middle of the movie. It never bored me and this movie takes three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the director, who has been instrumental in making this movie show all the chaos around you, even when everything seems calm. Look at Marlon Brando, who also shows his last great performance as he plays a stunned, out of balance Colonel. When I think of a crazy soldier, I think of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. You do not want to look him in the eyes with Brando n this movie. Like the movie he was crazy. For me, this idea is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen did a very poor job, and probably the best in his career, which causes you to see everything through his eyes, all the weirdness he experiences, and yet he wants him to reach his goal. It's only a miracle why these two have not received Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall has been able to show part of this craziness with his ridiculous fighting strategies, among those who make music to tell the enemy he will come. Duval's character, who asked one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle, was shocking but believable. Other great supportive accomplishments were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms, and Frederic Forest, all of which summarized the attitude of many soldiers at the time, without becoming a clich√©. Cameos with Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford, both of whom I love, also stood out for the better. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved is best. There's nothing left to expect from this movie with its great acting, directing, script, cinematography and grand finale. Watch and you'll see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now.
