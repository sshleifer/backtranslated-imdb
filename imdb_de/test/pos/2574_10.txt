If you want to see a movie about nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and rape of children, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man who wants to avenge creatively exactly on the treasure of a woman who has left him, then this film has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a history of violence, action and music, a climax can emerge in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech that transforms the film. Look for a final scene that is unexpected proof of the healing of an injured person. Perhaps we wonder why we are rolling in the profane, that love over the loins can be in the heart. Follow the throbbing pounding to the rhythm where love is sacred.
