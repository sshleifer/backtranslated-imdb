After finishing the Zero Woman series, I was looking forward to the Female Prisoner Scorpion series; both are based on comic strips by Tooru Shinohara. Unfortunately, I could not see them in the right order as this is the third in the series. <br /> <br /> It starts well when the scorpion (Meiko Kaji) flees from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) managed to put a cuff on her, but she cut off his arm and walked away. If that is not bad enough, a dog later digs up his arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to indulge. <br /> <br /> Scorpion might as well go back to jail as life is not a picnic from the outside. First, a local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to kick her back if she does not fail. and then she gets the leader of the gang as she gets rid of Tanida. But they do not hold her for long before she escapes and seeks revenge. <br /> <br /> Soon they will fall like flies. Some of them certainly deserved to wear garish shirt-collar outfits that were so big they went all the way to the shoulder. The woman (Lee) introduces herself to avoid being killed. <br /> <br /> The police arrive at their last murder and catch them in the sewer. She has been here for a week and the cops learn that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) has provided food. (The story of O Yuki (Watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting, but only incidentally in the movie.) They try to burn her, but this is the scorpion, and she has an unfinished business. > <br /> Not the usual mix of sex and violence. This is a slow story that is beautiful everywhere.
