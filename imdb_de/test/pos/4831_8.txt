Wicked Little things was a really good movie. I'll say in some places that it really seemed unbelievable, and in others it seemed like there was not enough thought about the characters' actions, but on the whole it was exciting and entertaining I do not understand why the rating of this movie is so low is. Also, I do not understand why all reviews of the Afterdark horror movie are so low. These are B-Movies people and nothing more has many shortcomings. This is definitely worth a look, as you will not be disappointed with the result. Wicked Little Things is one of the best 1st Annual Afterdark horror festival movies and compared to many other films in the series this is one of the best overall.
