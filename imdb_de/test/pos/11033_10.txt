This movie is one of the most beautiful memories I have from my childhood. My mother had always loved me, and my mother took me to see it. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely amazing. It's one of those films that make a lasting impression on you. The picture of Tigers walking through the snow, splashing everything around is still around 25 years old. Not many films have done that. Something you must have seen. I've been looking for the movie for some time without success. :-(. At Amazon is from time to time reveal nothing, not listed. If anyone knows a source, please contact me here or post here. Tim
