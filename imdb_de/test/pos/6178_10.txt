Centers for Czech WW2 pilots? the older Frantisek, the boyish impulsive Karel and in the background the quiet sounding Honza. When the movie starts, it's 1950, the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are locked up in a former convent. In their now soviet-controlled homeland, they are "enemy of the people". Honza is severely abused by his communist compatriots and dies. In 1939, many pilots managed to escape from occupied Europe and reach England, where they joined the RAF. Despite their high level of motivation and experience, they face the RAF aversion and stiff British upper lip. After all, they fight gallantly in the battle for England. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship strictly checked as they both fall in love with the same woman. <br /> <br /> Regarding the romantic subplot, this is very similar to the Hollywood production Pearl Harbor. However, given the film and the possible fate of Frantisek, it is also possible to read the British treatment of the two men as a symbol of the British treatment of Czech and Polish RAF pilots: they are conveniently forgotten after the war. > <br /> In addition, the film is less clich√©d than Pearl Harbor and the characters are more fully implemented. Dark Blue World also scores for its breathtaking dog airplanes created seamlessly from a mix of models, live aerial footage and excerpts from the 1969 Epic The Battle of Britain. <br /> <br /> In short, Dark Blue World is a well-done, moving, thought-provoking and exciting drama that puts people like Pearl Harbor in the shade. Highly recommended.
