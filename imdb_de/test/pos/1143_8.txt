I agree with msinabottle; This is a great movie. Here are some snippets of dialogue: Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): "Do you see the man at the well, how he draws the water? When one bucket empties, the other fills up That's the way it is in the world you are full of power, but you spill it wastefully, and Islam fills the drops as they run out of your bucket. "<br /> <br /> Raisuli: The English paid well in the past. Pedecaris: Well, you will not get along with the Americans. President Roosevelt will have his head for it. Raisuli: Roosevelt. This President Roosevelt - he would try it himself? Pedecaris: He would definitely do it! He is a man of grit and strong moral strength. He does not kidnap women and children! Raisuli: What kind of rifle is he using? Pedecaris: A Winchester! Raisuli: Winchester. Winchester I have no knowledge of this rifle. Pedecaris: You will. <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): The American grizzly bear is a symbol of American character: strength, intelligence, ferocity. Sometimes a bit blind and ruthless, but courageous without any doubt. Oh, and another property belongs to all the previous ones. Newspaper reporter: And that, Mr President? Teddy Roosevelt: loneliness. The bear lives his life alone. Unyielding undefeated. But always alone He has no real allies, only enemies - but none of them is as tall as he is. Newspaper reporter: You think that could be an American feature? Teddy Roosevelt: Sure. The world would never love us. It can respect us. It can even grow to fear us. But it will never love us. Because we have too much boldness. And sometimes we are also a bit blind and ruthless.
