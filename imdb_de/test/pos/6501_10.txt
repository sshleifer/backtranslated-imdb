I just saw this movie at Resfest and was down. I've never been a big fan of scratches, but this movie really got me excited about the Getgo. It's a documentary, but it never really felt that way. (I can not remember the last time I had so much fun watching a documentary). It has a style and energy that is refreshing, enlightening and never to be preached. The production values ​​were up there too. (Film shot with cool cuts and an amazing soundtrack). Overall, a smart, entertaining and enlightening piece.
