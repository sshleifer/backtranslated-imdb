This is one of my favorite westerns. What a cast! Glenn Ford plays his role in his usual mild, controlled, but solid manner. Ford plays one of the smaller ranchers in the shadow of the mighty anchor farm that wants to devour the entire territory. Edward G. Robinson plays the crippled Patriarch of the anchor farm and Barbera Stanwyck plays his crafty wife. There's plenty of action in this Western, which is pretty impressive, the scenery is delicious and the letterboxing area is breathtaking and the soundtrack is stereo! I would say that this Western had a budget suitable for the size. It looks expensive. One of a series of big Glenn Ford Westerns.
