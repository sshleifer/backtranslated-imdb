THE ASCENT is a very rewarding addition to the recently released Soviet publications. Director Larisa Shepitko's 1977 film examines the moral implications of loyalty and honor in occupied Russia during World War II. On foot and in a blizzard, two members of a Soviet partisan group go to find supplies and are captured by Nazi soldiers. At the center of the film is how each man handles or internalizes his moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and integrity, while the other decides to work with the enemy. In the end, however, he can not comply with his selfish decision. The film uses a lot of slow wide-angle pans that switch to extreme close-ups and emphasize the spiritual disruption in each man's souls. This is not a great movie, but it does show an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of a harsh and cold Soviet wilderness.
