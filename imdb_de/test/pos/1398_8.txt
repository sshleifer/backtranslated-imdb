Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce), which was bought by Roger Corman and published by his New World Pictures. Of course, Corman has to carve his initials by letting one of his lackeys (Dan T. Miller) do some extra Hore footage before releasing them in the States. <br /> <br /> L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce is a very entertaining retelling of the island of dr. Moreau. It is 1891 and Claudio Cassinelli is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a few newly arrested convicts. Claudio encounters the outstanding Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Johnson plays the devious Edmund Rackham: a man who can manipulate the scientist Joseph Cotton to turn the native population into amphibious deep-sea diving creatures (they look like a cross between the Black Lagoon creature and one of the humanoids from the deep) by: They have convinced Cotton that the mutations are created for the highest scientific and humanitarian motives. After discovering the lost city of Atlantis, Rackham uses the amphibious creatures to plunder his treasures. Sexy Barbara Bach plays Cotton's daughter, who has a psychic connection with these mutations. In a memorable scene, Bach swims with these mutants, who wear only a thin white cotton dress, and gives little to the imagination. Claudio discovers that one of the convicts with whom he was a friend has been turned into a gill creature, and then hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> At the same time and shot in the same place as Zombi 2, Richard Johnson did not. It even has to switch between the films suits. The house where the experiments take place is the same house where Johnson experiments in Zombi 2. Talk about economic filmmaking! <br /> <br /> The extra material contains some bloody decapitations (Path, Roger!), and a ridiculously bad Cameron Mitchell doing his best pirate imitation. Only the parrot is missing. Spanish title: Le Continent Des Hommes Poissons
