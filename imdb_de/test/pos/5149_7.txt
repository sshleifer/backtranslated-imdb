Roy Andersson has managed to create something that defies almost all the conventions of a movie, a work of art that is both beautiful, witty and evocative. The end result is a moving, if slightly broken, story about humanity in its simplest and most honest form. <br /> <br /> This is unlikely to appeal to anyone, the humor is actually so finely tuned that for many it's unlikely to come on its wavelength. The almost absurdly long takes, uncomfortable silence and consistent medium-shots will definitely deter even the most willing audience. In these disjointed stories and unconventional mental images, however, Andersson creates a world in which every character, in his absurd way, seems to be at the center. Each scene is absorbed by the desolate environment, and the characters seem to be alone in their own weirdness. It is sometimes difficult to look at her, not least because, like many of her scenes, she requires patience. But while some welcome it on an artistic throne, others will simply look confused. It's a movie that combines unobtrusive humor with your own kind of heart
