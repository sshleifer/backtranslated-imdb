<br /> <br /> Oh my word !! I've never seen a movie that lacks any moral judgments or considerations for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here is a valid observation of human desires, showing a world full of heavy and damaged executions. Not only does he feed us with the hell on earth, seen through the face of the mustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he feeds us with and says, "Look at what you see now, take a look and ask the question: do you like it? " And although you tell yourself that it can not be !!!! You will know that deep down you know it's a masterpiece
