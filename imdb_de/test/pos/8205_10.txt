This movie is a warning to all people surfing the internet on a typical day at the office. My warning is, do not tell too much about yourself. 2 Be careful who you cross !! There are spies in this internet thing. I found it so scary what this poor man-woman combination did to poor Angela Bennett. I did not know that someone could kill this mouse with a click of a mouse girl my question is, why does this computer make that sound when it works? my or that does not do like a clicking sound. In this movie you will also learn that there are scams in this internet. Why could not Angela run the virus destroyer program in a CyberCafe? I also thought that, as with all computers, the transfer rate to the hard drive was slow, which is shown correctly in this movie if you save the program to your floppy disk. I also liked Angela's house at the beginning of the movie. Why did nobody believe Angela ???
