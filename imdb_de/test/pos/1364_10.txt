Believe me when I say that this show is just funny. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe, who travels from city to city, taking on part-time jobs, chasing women and learning everything he can about life. Kintaro has to be one of the easiest characters ever made. He brings everything to extremes, and laughs loud and funny every time. From his everlasting quest for the study of life to the tiny things he instantly blasts into life or death matters. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things on this show is simply that Kintaro is constantly extremely focused on the highest expressions and reactions. He spends a lot of time in different, extremely deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times in less than 0.1 seconds, his face will look not only serious, but also from the life or death of a manga fighter style like a weightlifter trying to set a new record. It is funny. <br /> <br /> If that were not enough, the writing is excellent and the English language could not possibly be better. Kintaro's English VA is just perfect and will make you roll if he does not even say something. It should be noted, however, that this is undoubtedly an Ecchi series. It practically defines the word. If you're a grown-up fanatic and can make movies like American Pie laugh, you'll love it. <br /> <br /> - Rirath_com
