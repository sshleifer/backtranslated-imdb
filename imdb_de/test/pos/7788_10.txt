It's the best movie ever released in Bollywood. The best comedy, the best acting and the best direction so far! Rajkumar Santoshi's writing and directing proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry. Aamir Khan was absolutely incredible, Salman Khan looked good as he behaved. Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep behaved as usual! This comedy is still copied by humans, and no other author and director could do this thing again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi could not do this cult classic! This movie was a flop when it was released, but it's been a cult classic ever since it was released and loved by all kinds of people. <br /> <br /> STAR br /> DIALOG 10/10. <br /> <br /> SCREENPLAY 10/10. <br /> <br /> Direction 10/10. <br /> <br /> MUSIC 9/10. <br /> <br /> LYRICS 9/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is strongly recommended. If you have not seen it before, you missed something big! It's a laugh uprising and the best comedy I've seen so far! Classic films like Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not even half as funny as this one. <br /> <br /> BIG FILM, HATS OFF !!!!
