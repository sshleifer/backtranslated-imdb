I never saw anything about The League until the beginning of last year - even though I heard three episodes in a single episode one evening. But last winter I fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric and sometimes weird characters. When I learned that they had made a movie in which the lovable creators of the show had met their own characters, I could not order the DVD fast enough and almost take it away from my postman as he delivered it. I was so excited to see what the gentlemen had done and how they had done it. <br /> <br /> And it was excellent! From the beginning, where Jeremy (Michael Sheen) of Edward, Tubbs and Dad (Dyson, why did not you play yourself?) He is absolutely capable of being a spectator of the notorious Highgate House of Horrors!), And Bernice still scolds one from herd, to Geoff, Mr. Lipp and Hilary, who find out that they are characters, which is a great scene. The scenes from the year 1690 are very pleasing. The Gents turn to more characters and a whole new storyline. David Warner's turn as Doctor Pea. He is fantastic, a little bit fightless and very funny. <br /> <br /> The league has always been great at mixing humor with grief and emotion - and the highlight of this movie that Mr. Lipp is struggling with is the idea that he and the other inhabitants of Vasey are just fictional people who are never going to be able to change their own character or purpose - and seeing how it collapses is really sad and beautiful, while at the same time showing the talent of the gents - something they are terribly overlooked to this day become. <br /> <br /> And then you have this rather clever ending - where you are wondering - with Joby Talbot's beautiful theme music. And you know that you enjoyed a very clever and funny movie.
