I expected it to be good after seeing some other great moments of ozone and reading a lot about it ... but this movie is brilliant - smart, very bright (emotional and visual), perfect for all moments. Every movement is there for a reason, everything fits so closely and originally true and honest. this is the movie about beauty and innocence; about the simplicity.
