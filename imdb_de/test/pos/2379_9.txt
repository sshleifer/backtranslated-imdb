My son Adam (5 years old) is a big Scooby Doo fan. He really likes this movie. He especially liked it when the Loch Ness monster tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The voting score is his choice and reflects his love for the characters. <br /> <br /> After seeing the "Vampire Rock" movie first, this was not surprisingly very similar as it was a worn-out basic plot in a different setting. <br /> <br /> This will attract only a few adults without remembering the TV animated series, and even fewer will see them without children. You either like it or love it. I loved Scooby Doo as a kid for half an hour, I'm happy that my son loves it, I can stand it right now.
