When I turned on my local PBS station last night to see "The War That Made America." I expected a boring documentary, instead I got a very good and credible reenactment of the most important events of the time. Now I see the reasons for the American Revolution and the role that the Indian Wars played. Larry Nehring is George Washington and he is perfect for this part. The narrative about the camera also works fantastic. I am looking forward to next week to see the rest. It's nice to see that PBS really uses the HD format to bring the 1700 right into our living room. <br /> <br /> I hope Larry Nehring will be seen more in the future as he is such a talented actor.
