Hello; I just want to say how much I liked your review and comments on this great movie "Intruder in the dust". I think the points you mentioned were enlightening, intelligent and absolutely valid. It is a pity that this movie is rarely shown on TV anymore and can not be seen on DVD region 2 - I live in england. Thanks again for your rating. The actor Juano Hernandez was in another brilliant film, "Young Man with a Horn", in which also Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall were to be seen. It was a very atmospheric and stylish movie with excellent music. I wish someone with influence could release the entire back catalog of movies like "Johnny Belinda", "I Remember Mama" and "The Yearling" on DVD, Region 2. We love these movies in the UK. I am not retired, I am still quite young and my family and I love classic movies !! Movies like these were so beautiful and they bring back wonderful memories. anyway...! Thank you for your comments!
