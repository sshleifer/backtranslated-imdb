"Americans Next Top Model" is the best reality show! I was entertaining 99.9 percent of the time. I kept my eyes open all the time. (Well, I blinked.) It can make you sad, funny, or addictive. (mostly addicted) "America's Next Top Model" made me want more, and that's actually the point. It is also on more than one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV, sometimes not. I hope it gets more fans and becomes a hit series! It's great for just about any age, so anyone can enjoy it! :) <br /> <br /> If you've seen the show before, have not you noticed that Tyra has a different hairstyle every time in the review room? She will have it short and curly for a week, and then the next long and straight.
