Every story has a lesson for young and old. But what I have to say can spoil a future story. But I think what I have to say is something for everyone; Only for a specific episode: the soldier and death. <br /> <br /> Okay ... of all the stories is the one that stands out for me, "The Soldier and Death," because it was the point of my life that life was endless. I'm not joking. The broadcast was on my 8 1/2 birthday ... and I will always remember it. I could not remember the title until tonight, but I have the summary again. (May 15, 1988) <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part of life. It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. I live (currently 28 years old) that children can accept this fact and remind adults from time to time ... <br /> <br /> I write this with tears in my eyes. Heath Ledger - a wonderful actor of my age - has passed away today. It somehow reminded me of many lessons I have learned in my life. So I write this as a souvenir of young and old ... no one is immune to what awaits us. <br /> <br /> I hate to say that death will happen, but this story was the first time I did not see death bad; but part of life was literal in this story. I can not help It was a life-changing moment for me and always will be. <br /> <br /> And for that ... <br /> <br /> I love you, Jim Henson (and I can still remember your job well until the day you died, and your Muppet memorial show) and thank you, Brian Henson, for keeping the workshop alive !!! Honestly, thank you all your colleagues, editors and interns. <br /> <br /> The stage is just a stage / And a show is just a show / But imagination will create magic / That forever The world will know. <br /> <br /> Thank you !!! <br /> <br /> (And for those who doubt me ... dance, magic dance)
