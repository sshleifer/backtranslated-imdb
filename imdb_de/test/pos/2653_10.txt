There is really no way to compare this movie to another movie because no one has ever done it, and no one will ever do it. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science fiction and wanted to see a "space" movie. Remember that this movie was shot before the first moon landing. <br /> <br /> We sat there and waited for the movie to start. But surprise! There was no caricature, no upcoming attractions. For some reason, the theater owner of the Cooper Theater decided to play "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the lights still on, so we all stood, never did that before or since in a movie and then sat back down over. Then the theater was completely dark and the strange overture began, the blank screen barely visible. The overture ended and my seat began to swing as the blue screen with the MGM Lion and the first draft sounded bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed when I heard "So Spoke Zarathustra" for the first time in my life. The ride had just begun. <br /> <br /> (I urge you to watch this opening in a dark room with your subwoofer as high as possible to get the effect I felt in this theater.) Of course it took for a while, until we got into space, and the following movie was anything but a sci-fi movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, very undervalued and unused these days), and we all looked at each other in astonishment, catching our breath and then the journey continued, wilder than before. <br /> <br /> I saw 7 more times next year, always in a real full-size theater, as all the theaters used to be multiplexes. I may have been "high" once, but I did not see it again and again because I "stumbled". I left because I knew I saw a work of art. It was so damn beautiful; the sound you could feel in your bones, followed by terrifying silence; the sights undreamt of and unthinkable; the affection for HAL who turn to terror. And of course, WTF wanted Kubrick to come to me? Years and years and many more visits later I understand it too, I think, as I always will. Read other people's comments when looking for someone to explain or search the internet. You will find "explanations". This is not my intention to write these comments. <br /> <br /> What I hope to do is to encourage you to look patiently at it, enjoy the beauty of the way you could enjoy the sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know ( eg Gayne Ballet Suite or Blue Danube). enjoy it like a wonderful meal, drink it like a good wine; Look for the clues and hidden symbols that are there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTED to share some things with you that he found beautiful and that he wanted you to think about where you are. A human came out and where you go. <br /> <br /> If that's too much work for your brain and you can not see and hear and think about the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film then please dull me but your life is about it as important as that of a tapir or a monkey from the time before the monolith. If you want a thoughtless escape, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries and sensuality and are open minded, this movie will contribute something to your life life.
