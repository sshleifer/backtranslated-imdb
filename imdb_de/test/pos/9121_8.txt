I love a movie that mixes excitement on the edge of the place, laughter, style, good acting and a bit of self-parody. Hitchcock continued to do so, and in "Le Cercle rouge" Jean-Pierre Melville does the same. I was sorry when this long movie came to an end. <br /> <br /> I agree with the English commentator, who considered one of my countrymen's comments chauvinistic. I love French films, Italian films, English films, Indian films - and the increasingly rare American films. I also believe that the writer who rated the movie as not even a good copy of an American gangster movie missed the point completely. But I guess it's like jazz: Either you understand it or you do not, so you waste time explaining. <br /> <br /> Just see "Le Cercle noir" and be prepared to be deliciously entertained.
