As early as 1950, John Ford had already fully developed the ideas and motives that were to form the core of his most successful Westerns. Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most heavily imprisoned in the Joad family of Steinbeck's The Grapes of Anger (1940). Even in the midst of Ford's racist themes such as racism and pioneering spirit, these communities always have room for the smaller human interactions, the small friendships and romances that make life worth living. 'Wagon Master (1950)' came after Ford released the first two films of his 'Cavalry' trilogy? "Fort Apache (1948)" and "She Wore a Yellow Band (1949)"? and it extends to a similar territory, only without the military perspective and, worse, the strong leadership of John Wayne. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, jr. Are good actors, but they feel like they should give someone the second fiddle, and Ward Bond's cursing Mormon Elder, who may be a candidate for such a role, does not have enough focus to satisfy the bill satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> In 'Wagon Master', Ford seems to be so familiar with its proven western formula that it largely glosses over any character development. Ben Johnson's romance with Joanne Dru is treated above all as an obligation, and Harry Cary Jr.'s charm of a Mormon girl is so superficial that he almost does not exist in the last film, so one can think about the survival of deleted scenes. Only with Charles Kemper's charismatic and shamelessly rogue Uncle Shiloh does Ford try something different, and it works, even when surrounded by a troop of unbearably vicious slave yokes. Where does Ford manage to orchestrate the conglomerate of three different American races? the value-oriented Mormoms, the carefree horse dealers, the eccentric touring showmen? into a closed community of pioneers looking to a bright future. This apparent harmony will become disordered as Uncle Shiloh's criminal outlaws emerge, exploiting the lawlessness of the Western border, but ultimately failing the posh cowboys who "only put on snakes." Ford has allegedly ranked Wagon Master as one of the favorites of its films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with his stock selection of ordinary players, Ford is able to create a sense of community by focusing on a single character, though most Mormon travelers still remain completely anonymous. Although undoubtedly well done, I can not help but feel that this film only does what other images of Ford did even better: the grandiose majesty of the western border was presented more beautifully in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'. The romances and friendly quarrels among the members of the community took on greater importance in 'Fort Apache'. The only hinted here early relations with the Native Americans were examined in "The Searchers (1956)" in more detail. The bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored in "How the West Was Won (1962)" (albeit by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) more moving. 'Wagon Master' is pure John Ford, but it's not a landmark.
