The third part of Miike's Dead or Alive trilogy has nothing more to do with the first two parts than with them, more or less. Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi have returned to starring again, but this time the movie pushes us 300 years or so into the future ... post apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Riki plays a tough cop, an executor for the extreme police politics of the corrupt city, and Show plays a drifter who meets a bunch of repressed city rebels. The film must have been shot in Hong Kong, as the majority of the cast are Cantonese speakers, with Terence Yin and Josie Ho being the most famous faces. There is also a HK stunt crew for the action sequences of the films, which are very cool in a HK via Miike style. <br /> <br /> This might be a terrible low-budget B movie, but Miike's hands are of course getting more interesting. It's a slow, thoughtful movie that meanders and does not try to push the viewer into the throat. The characters are round and interesting, and the storyline provides an interesting, but rather laid-back frame for the story. <br /> <br /> All in all, a pretty small effort up to the action scenes, where Miike's growing abilities as Director are seen and choreograph very nice action. Seeing the short making-of with Show & Riki in Wire Rigs is really fun - you realize they had a great time. <br /> <br /> The finale of the movie tries to bring together the 3 Dead Or Alive movies, which is quite unnecessary as everyone is really self-contained. Miike's explanation of the connection is very funny and limits the series quite well. <br /> <br /> Not as deep or well developed as DOA2, not as vile and intense as DOA1 ... still a good Miike movie though.
