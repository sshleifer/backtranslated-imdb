This movie has "hunted" me since I saw him when I was about 8 years old. I did not know what it's called, so I'm so glad I finally found it. I remember being pretty scared because I had just been in Cornwall when I looked at it. Luckily I did not see any ghosts of dead children there, but I really found the movie very disturbing and frightening when I was much younger. I certainly never forgot it, though I could not find it anywhere. I seem to remember that the Children's Film Foundation's films are generally good, but they do not show them at all anymore. I also remember programs like The Children Of Green Knowe from the same time at the BBC, which are also disturbing in their own way.
