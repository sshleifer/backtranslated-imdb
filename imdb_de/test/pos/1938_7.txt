"River's Edge" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year that saw "Blue Velvet," you know it says something. Today, it has lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated "kids". The previews for "Kids" highlighted the deterioration of the nation's youth. In fact, it was little more than an exploitative film based mainly on shock. "River's Edge" was promoted as teenager exploitation film, but was actually much better. The only time it gets annoying and uncomfortable is the constant image of the dead naked body. Apart from that, the movie is thought-provoking and quite realistic despite all its little flaws. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves, known as a particularly wooden performer, shows his best performance as a burned-out teenager. Ione Skye is also sympathetic and personable. Dennis Hopper (on the comeback trail with "Blue Velvet" and "Hoosiers") does a great job as a scary but wretched hippie generation left over. Crispin Glover is always entertaining, but seems a bit out of place as a manic stoner and leader of the group. The best performance, however, is definitely Daniel Roebuck. As a murderer John, Roebuck is frighteningly emotionless. It's a shame he did not become a big star, as he's a much better actor than Reeves. <br /> <br /> The movie is overall fantastic and daring. Do not confuse this with another lame John Hughes high school movie like "The Breakfast Club". This is a shocking part of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this film should attend a 1981 Canadian film titled "Out of the Blue," directed by Dennis Hopper. It is another shockingly dark exploration of the generation gap and, despite its darkness, could have had an impact on River's Edge. (7/10)
