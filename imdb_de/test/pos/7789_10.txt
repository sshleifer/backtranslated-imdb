I love this movie. Shehzad Khan's presentation as Bhalla a.k.a. "Shut up, Robert!" was so funny Whenever he was hit in a fight scene, you heard him squeak. Viju Khote is the baffled Robert a.k.a. "Rabbit". I love the Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. "Crime Master Gogo". Paresh Rawal's dual role is so hilarious for his portrayal of Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother imitates Bhalla really well. "Relax, please relax." I love the scene in which Aamir Khan laxates Salman's "Muscles" Khan food, which causes the irregular bowel movements that forced him to use the toilet.
