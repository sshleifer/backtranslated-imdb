The silent film masterpiece Battleship Potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1905 uprising and establish the event as a heroic harbinger of the 1917 October Revolution. Ironically, the director of the film, Sergei Eisenstein, was one of the first and most influential proponents of a formalist approach to film art. Eisenstein's formalism and suspicious policies would subsequently result in countless conflicts with government agencies insisting on "socialist realism." Influenced by the Russian film theorist Lev Kuleshov and by him through DW Griffiths intolerance (smuggled to Russia in 1919), Eisenstein constructed his films from a "collision" of fast-edited images, a montage of shots, lighting and camera angles in length, movement and content , The most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the most cited and studied sequence in the history of world cinema - is undoubtedly the sequence "Odessa Steps" in Potemkin. <br /> <br /> In the structure, Potemkin is a "five" reeler ", divided into five narrative parts, an organization that is clearly derived from the five-act arrangement of Western drama." Men and Maggots " Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and dissatisfaction of the battleship's worker sailors as the situation inevitably becomes a mutiny, and even before the seafarers and their upper-class officers are visually introduced, Eisenstein symbolically creates revolutionary conditions through the collision of waves that are violent and threatening On board a ship, we observe overcrowded unhygienic conditions, Eisenstein emphasizes the dehumanization of the sailors by shots of arbitrary whip lashes, hard work and especially the maggot-infested meat intended for supper advanced by the other officers to explain the meat for the preparation of the dark soup, which cooks like the fury of the sailors. In accordance with Marxist maxims, the church also denies the men, and we see one of them shatter a plaque labeled with words from the Lord's Prayer from two different camera angles (possibly in the first deliberate "jump cut" in cinematic history). <br /> <br /> Potentkin's second and third installments are identified by subtitles as "Quarterdeck Drama" and "An Appeal from the Dead" and depict the actual mutiny and burial aboard its leader and first heroes of the Revolution Vakulinchuk , Vakulinchuk appeals to fraternity and the first mutineers are brought together by the entire crew to attack the officers. The result is a chaotic scene whose violent passion is well served by Eisenstein's cutting techniques. The officer quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic cross-sections of the maggot-ridden flesh and his glasses, which dangles metonymically in the rigging. Tragically, Vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the revolt (not to break an omelette without eggs), and it is gracefully placed on a pier from Odessa. Hundreds of ordinary citizens from Odessa gather with the sailors to honor him and "kill the oppressors." Shots of fists clenching and opening signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness. <br /> <br /> The complex and unforgettable sequence of Odessa Steps is the fourth act of the film. It begins with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and medium-sized shots on the happy faces of various people on the shore and on selected objects (umbrella, glasses, stroller). Suddenly (as a title card is proclaimed in large letters), the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the stairs. Here, Eisenstein unleashes the full force of collision processing by assembling nearly a hundred shots to compare the panic chaos and bullying of the burghers with the relentless attack of the soldiers pushing down the citizens to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting Cossacks. The staging is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom, a symbolic metonym for the oppressive institutions of Russia: the Tsarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian Church. <br /> <br /> Punctuation The sequence consists of two scenes in which mothers and children are involved. In the first case, a mother and a boy, who were introduced among the joyful faces of the crowd, are among the first victims of the carnage. The boy is shot but the mother keeps running until close-ups of her face convey her horrified look at the son's body trampled by the crowd. With much slower processing, the camera follows the mother as she carries her child's lifeless body up the stairs to face the soldier (shown only in a diagonal shadow line). They shoot her for a short time. After this break, the slaughter continues a few dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the belly (womb of Mother Russia?) As she tries to protect her baby in the carriage. In a scene famously imitated in The Unouchables, the car slips inappropriately down the stairs. Terrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow path to its demise. When the carriage reaches the bottom, there is a cut into a Cossack carrying a sword, and a classic Kuleshov effect hints at what we do not really see: the slaughter of these pure and symbolic innocents. The last series of shots in the sequence of Odessa consists of three stone lions, one at rest, one who gets up and roars one. The cut animates them into a visual metaphor of people's awakened rage. <br /> <br /> A little anticlimactic, the fifth act brings us back to the battleship, while the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and waiting for a meeting with other ships, the fleet. They and the spectator expect retribution, but when the meeting takes place, no shots are fired, and instead, all the sailors wave and throw their hats into a symbol of camaraderie. Eisenstein rewrote history at this point because the revolution has not been successfully launched for another twelve years. But apart from that, Battleship Potemkin is one of the seminal works of the silent movie era and retains extraordinary filmmaking power.
