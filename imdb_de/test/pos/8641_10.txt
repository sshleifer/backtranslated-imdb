Spoiler Alert - though this is a conspiracy that is almost as impossible to ruin as the full explanation. <br /> <br /> 'Mulholland Drive' is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his 'Twin Peaks' TV series. As lynch enthusiasts know, this is a style and vision that is unique to film noir, horror films, surrealism and parapsychology. with a healthy dose of postmodern self-confidence and black humor thrown in for a good deal. All of these elements are rich in 'Mulholland Drive' and make for a fascinating, hair-raising and extremely satisfying movie experience. especially if you are not too obsessed with trying to fit all the parts of the plot into a logical, mysterious whole. <br /> <br /> The film features wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives overlap in various ways in a Hollywood setting that is itself a hallucinatory mix of contemporary reality, retro Nostalgia of the 50s and satirical self-glorification is. Her seemingly random initial meeting takes place after the film's opening scene, in which Harring's character escapes an assassination thanks to a fortuitous, let alone horrific, car crash. Staggering down from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two archetypical streets of Hollywood thoroughfares), she finds her way to the apartment, which Betty (Naomi Watts) is currently renting to Canada from her "aunt Ruth," a supposedly successful actress to start a new movie. As we learn later, Betty herself had arrived from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest. <br /> <br /> A highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest is one of two prologue sequences before the credit of Betty's lineage, from the chatty star-ape innocence to the dumbfounded madness of a spurned lover and a seedy actress. Unable to remember her own name, the Harring character takes the name "Rita" from a movie poster for the film noir classic "Gilda", which adorns Aunt Ruth's home. (In fact, it turns out that Aunt Ruth has long since passed away and is really a good question in her apartment, which must be clarified in future visits.) Betty definitely wants to help Rita find out what happened and the source of the Money rolls and a mysterious blue key that women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to gather clues that would lead to Rita's true identity. By the way, they also become lovers and radiate so radiant chemistry at one point that I can not remember mainstream treatments of lesbian lovers (if a lynch movie can ever be called "mainstream") at the local restaurant Winkies (a recurring venue with a dreamlike meaning behind his grubby realistic fa√ßade), Rita's attention is drawn to the name tag of a waitress with the inscription "Diane". This brings her to a memory of someone named 'Diane Selwyn', in whose apartment the two women are soon to come and break in at Betty's urging. I will not reveal what they find in it, but suffice to say that the scene is rendered with centuries-old Lynchian ghastliness. Then Rita wakes up while she sweats at night, speaks Spanish and hurries Betty to a nightly magic show called "Silencio," in which the arts of illusion and lip / instrumental dubbing are practiced with manic intensity, and in which the blue-haired lady like her mentioned in the credits, she rules as presiding muse. Framed by the blue-lit, red-draped Silencio Theater, the blue-haired lady takes the final shot of the film, perhaps a symbol of artistic fantasy control. Just as Steven's "man with the blue guitar" was filtered through the bad drug surrealism. <br /> <br /> During the Silencio sequence and as Rebekah Del Rio Cameo lip-synching her own powerful Spanish version of Roy Orbison's 'Crying'), a shattering epiphany when Betty opens her own handbag with a blue box to discover a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's handbag. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of the purses, the moment is a unique Hitchcockscher, in which the correspondence of key and box leads to a complete reversal of what we thought we knew, and to a whole new set of Character relationships and meanings. Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the coveted Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (d. H. Rita). Camilla, on the other hand, is a Latin American femme fatale movie star, whom Diane owes for the few minor roles she has, and above all, for which she is emotionally subject. After these and other discoveries In the last third of the movie, the problem of considering the first two-thirds of the movie is not resolved as easily as in 'Vertigo'. While parts and images of the images and dialogues suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material from the feverish subconscious is projected and displaced by Diane herself, other parts suggest that perhaps a supernatural interaction of a group of characters is taking place seeking direct inspiration "Twin Peaks", including Michael J. Anderson, who reinterprets his sinister dwarven powers and a bob variant that hangs behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the Blue Box and their id-like associations. <br /> <br /> However, the pieces fit together, but the whole 'Mulholland Drive' is much bigger? and more mysterious? as the sum of its parts. Lynch leads us to a wonderfully imaginative, provocative and enjoyably disturbing thought journey. In addition, the film's cinematography is breathtaking, the soundtrack is full of evocative atmospheres, outstanding acting and masterful direction / editing. This may have been the unconfirmed Best Picture of 2001 among the major American releases.
