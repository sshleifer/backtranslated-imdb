Great adaptation of the Christie novel. Surprising Attention to Authentic Details of the Time (Many films from the mid-1970s to the early '80s trying to make the 1920s to the early 30s seem far too much between the mid-70s and early 80s) as I imagined wrong) The costumes and sets are very well done. I really liked this production? This is mainly due to the delightful Francesca Annis' portrayal of a light-hearted, bright young lady "Frankie" and the charming Bobbie of James Warwick. The couple would then make Christie's Tommy & Tuppence, which is funny, as some contemporary book critics have compared Frankie and Bobby with their earlier Tommy & Tuppence characters. The minor characters were just as well done? The towering Mrs. Rivington (played by Miss Marple-to-be Joan H.) and "Badger" is perfectly played as a post-war period, "Bertie Wooster-type".
