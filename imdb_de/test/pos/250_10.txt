"Cover Girl" is the best musical Rita Hayworth has ever made. Ms. Hayworth will always be remembered for "Gilda", the next film would be "Cover Girl". The story is great. It's about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business. She does so without the help of her talented dancer / director (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly has the chance to choreograph the musical numbers. The dances are spectacular. It's fun to see Phil Silvers, a comic, playing the musical numbers with Mrs. Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is perfect. Lee Bowman has the chance to be an interesting third wheel, the other friend.
