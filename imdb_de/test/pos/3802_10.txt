This must be one of the greatest things I've ever seen in the movie. I do not know if it's as serious as it seems, but it does not matter. This movie is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. Packaging and marketing only do it because you * know * that a mother has to reprogram her child so often to accept our reality after checking it out in the video store and expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap! And where else in America can you see a ten-year-old swearing as much as this and then his eyes are being pulled away by the perverse rival of Pulp Fiction's Zed? And this food inspector scene is the best! The amount of well-known, vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things: Soon, much faster than you realize, you'll say, "Is that Meat Loaf? Is that Drew Barrymore?" Is that the holideck doctor of Star Trek Is that a flea? Has the twin sawmill owner gasped squirrels with car exhaust, and is not that the guy from the new Rob Zombie movie? He looks very similar to Shrek. "I think my favorite scene is over with Phil in a complete body cast. I mean, please, why are not such movies being shown in airplanes anymore? This director has little else than Return to Salem's Lot, but in this creation he shows a true stumbling between human and child! If you're an intellectual looking for something you can forget in the evening, I recommend this movie to your satisfaction. The plot of this movie is all too ridiculous, but imagine that it has been taken out of context: * The young arm is wrestling an overbearing Meat Loaf, who is apparently damned ready to stamp out his anger because he is not in Guns N Roses was recorded. He looks over his shoulder and sees Voyager's doctor enter the bar. * Can you imagine what every half-baked surfer who has been active for the past six years would remember? Now imagine that you were actually interested in Meat Loaf or Voyager! Or imagine, you are a flea fan. Rocky horror Picture Show fans, this movie contains remarkable music, but the soundtrack is more putty than Mad Max 3. What does that mean for you? This is the lagooning Mongoloid cousin sister-mother puppy of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. How about Gus' sleeve fly on his arm in a masterpiece with special effects with cable access? When I saw this film, it was at the suggestion of my cousin, who saw half of it in a fit of semi-conscious childhood in the early 1990s and since then has been followed by vague memories that I myself had not slept in three days. It made me laugh! Of course it's also a scary movie. The music does not stimulate the tension, but eventually comes to the point where it is clear that the American censorship committee has obviously completely missed this film and absolutely everything can happen in it. This will probably happen every time Gus turns a corner or the view changes as much as camera angle. I was obsessed with the possibility of these cards flying out of his window every second. Watch this movie Genial!
