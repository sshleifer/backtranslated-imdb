Hard Justice is a great action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting, but he has a very good vampire act! For the people who say they do not do shoot-ups and fight movies the way they are used to. Well, this one is really tough! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was also very good and he probably steals the show! He is really a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was good too. I think that this very good looking actress is very underrated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was really cool to see Vince Murdocco in this movie! As far as the action is concerned, it's really great with all the weapon fights and the super cool fight scenes. The battles in this picture are really the biggest I've ever seen! In the 86-minute run so much happens. For the action fans, you'll be overwhelmed by all the firepower and superb fighting of this movie! Night Hunter is a movie that is not easy to find. If you are in a video library and for sale, you can buy it because this movie is a big keeper and the box is cool! There is a lot of action that must be seen to be believed! Find out if you can find some great deals at Ebay, Half.com, Amazon Z-Shops and Marketplace Merchants! In my opinion Night Hunter is one of the biggest fight movies I have ever seen and the characters are so neat. If you like Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and you want to see Nicholas Guest in a great performance, then I recommend any action movie fan who loves shooting Emups, shooting battle movies and vampire movies and was disappointed with other films. Looks like a real nonstop Action movie, Night Night Hunter does not deliver!
