Shame, is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is about a husband and his wife named Jan and Eve. They live on an island that works as a farmer. There is a war and soldiers are attacking the people on the island. As soon as the war subsides, a little Jan and Eve are arrested on the opposite side. Once published, there are even more difficulties and the film shows how two normal people will act in a situation of war and life or death. Winner of the CEC Award for Best Foreign Film at the Cinema Writers Circle Awards, The Guldbagge Award for Best Actress (Liv Ullman, who plays Eva) at the Guldbagge Awards, the NBR Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress of the National Board Review and the NSFC Award for Best Actress, Best Director (Ingmar Bergman) and Best Picture at the National Society of Film Critics Awards. Schade has a good direction, a good script, good performances by Max von Sydow (who plays Jan) and Liv Ullman (Eva), good cinematography and good production design. Too bad, a well-made and well-made story is how people in a desperate situation sometimes do everything they can to survive. The film has a strong message and is a good movie. The reason why I do not rate this film higher is that it is not a masterpiece like other Ingmar Bergman movies like Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal or Persona. The film did not have as much influence on me as I thought, and Ingmar Bergman's thoughtful and philosophical dialogue was missing. Although it's nowhere near any of his best films, Shame still has a lot to like, and it's a good movie. I probably would have wished more, not to have seen some of these Bergman masterpieces.
