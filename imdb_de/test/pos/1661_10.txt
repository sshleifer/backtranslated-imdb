There are not many films that I would call perfect, but Rififi definitely fits the bill. No other raid movie has come this close to before or after. The plot is simple, but captivates you. It always surprises me how intriguing the movie is every time you look at it. They take care of all the characters, even if they are bank robbers, because they are portrayed as people with all their problems and mistakes. Apart from Jean Servais you can hardly imagine another actor in the role of Tony le St√©phanois. When the crew members talk about what to do with their money and finally come to Tony, his answer and the expression on his face become everything. While the 30-minute raid sequence is the most famous part of the movie (and rightly so), the movie actually gets better after that. Director Jules Dassin knew what he was doing when he decided not to have any music during the heritage scene or in the final, but instead a high score during Tony's final drive towards his fate. Given that Dassin, an American director, would not have been blacklisted in Hollywood and would have to work in France, this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made as it was. It certainly would not have been so good if it had been shot as an American movie during that time. It was absolutely terrible what Dassin had to go through, but he did his best work for the benefit of us all. The thought of the upcoming Al Pacino remake scares me. Most predator films since Rififi have borrowed in one way or another. There is no reason to make this masterpiece different from money. Leave the classics alone!
