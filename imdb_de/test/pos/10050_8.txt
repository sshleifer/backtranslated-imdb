The Custer legend, a Warner Brothers epic. There is no casting against type, with the extravagant Flynn as an extravagant custer in this rousing tribute, not only to Custer, but also to the men of the 7th Cavalry. The story describes the life of the famous "Boy General" from his turbulent days in West Point to his last fight at the Little Big Horn. Great liberties are recorded here with facts and we face a Custer that is much more sympathetic The Redman's plight, which relates to the story, however, is carried out on such a large scale that only in the fight scenes every Hollywood in Hollywood are used could.
