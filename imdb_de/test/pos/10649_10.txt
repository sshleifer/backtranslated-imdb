Eisenstien's "Potempkin" (Bronenoset's Potyomkin) is among the best films ever made, and possibly the best of the quiet times. Eisenstien was a pioneer of film making and his use of montage editing has influenced movies to this day. The massacre of Odessa Steps is as powerful today as it was over 70 years ago. Do not miss the chance to see this movie!
