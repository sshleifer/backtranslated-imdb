It seems all people did not like Steven Seagal: Just look at his nomination list, there are only razzie nominations (with a win) for him, but I think he does not deserve it. I saw good movies with Steven Seagal, I saw bad movies with Steven Seagal. And THE PATRIOT (1998) is one of his best films, almost as good as UNDER SIEGE (1992) or HARD TO KILL (1990). THE PATRIOT shows his activities to protect nature. Surely this movie is not great and I have to say that there is more violence than I like and why does Seagal's best friend L. Q. Jones have to die the death of a victim? The role of dr. McClaren is one of Seagal's best achievements. He has as always a very good charisma. In summary, THE PATRIOT is a good conversation - and with an average rating of just 4 points, it is the most underrated movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Best regards, Hans-Dieter
