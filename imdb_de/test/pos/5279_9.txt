Miyazaki has been making his mojo since the 1970s and only recently has his films made it through Disney to American shores and fans chatting about his great talent. Ponyo is no exception. Although some of his other films were more accessible to the US audience, it could be that this film on the fence is a bit "Japanese" in its presentation. For the same reason, Pom Poko is VERY "Japanese" and makes no sense to the US audience. This also applies to some elements of Ponyo. This should not stop you from watching this fun movie of growth, hope and friendship. <br /> <br /> What is well received is Miyazaki's very sophisticated and magical animation and story that contains elements of wonder and fantasy. This paired with his characteristic use of character development and often with girls and women as the main characters. With Ponyo he steps out of his zone a bit. The main character is a little boy who lives with his mother in a small village by the sea, while his father works on the high seas. Although not lonely, Sosuke is like any other curious boy who loves the adventure and the fascination of the sea. Like Spirited Away, we see the different worlds of humans and sea creatures, and I believe that Miyazaki tries to draw the attention of the audience to the vast and undiscovered nature of things living under the sea and our acceptance of them and The thing is different. <br /> <br /> I managed to see the subtitle version of this release last year and was happy with the story and the plot. Miyazaki has claimed that "this is my last movie" for many years, but shortly after Spirited Away he gave us Howl's Moving Castle. Certainly, Ponyo is proof that Miyazaki has not hung his spurs and continues to inspire, innovate, and pioneer the most creative animated films of all time. Look at Ponyo with an open mind and a touch of childhood fantasy and imagination, and you'll be transported back to catching fireflies and having secret caches more important than boring adults and eating vegetables.
