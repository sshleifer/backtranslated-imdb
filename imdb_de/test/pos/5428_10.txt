This is a masterpiece. "The Big Snit" is a crazy, funny, hilarious, and finally touching look at an old couple and their quiet lives arguing about sawdust and quarrels while a nuclear war raging outside. Everything in this great animation show is remarkable: the eye shakes the woman, the vacuum cleaner, the husband saw fetish (keep an eye on those backgrounds!), The very verbal cat, the crazy game show, the "informative" newscaster, the "beautiful" accordion serenade and the moving and memorable ending. I'm so glad I found 'The Big Snit', one of the biggest cinemas ever produced.
