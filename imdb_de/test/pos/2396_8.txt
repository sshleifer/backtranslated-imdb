Undoubtedly, indie strip Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent films I've seen in a long time. The highlight for me was the performance of Paul Vario. I saw Paul for the first time or "Big Paulie" as he was called in Danny Provenzano's hit "This Thing Of Ours". Fortunately, the "Eddie Monroe" filmmakers did the same, using Paul's undeniable skills in a principle role. The result was a performance (also in front of the camera and the voice-over use), which shows large budget studio roles in the near future. It is refreshing to see a trained actor dedicated to the trade. Keep going Big Paulie and see you soon in Hollywood! Not bad for a kid from Canarsie, right?
