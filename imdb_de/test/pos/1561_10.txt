in the story. It's a reality, mixed with Americana and very original. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is a young girl who is tired of being bored and working for a minimum wage in New England. Her shabby boss suggests she give up and take some cash out of the cash register. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida is not a short journey, and your Ford Escort dies out. She then meets a likeable older couple, who is portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have a camper and graciously offer to help her - it is not certain that a girl is traveling alone. Especially I-95. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is very realistic as Alice and first gets help from the Judith Ivey figure; buy their decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. First, it's a nice holiday for Alice, hoping to meet her friend, who is attending college in Miami. There are interesting cinematographs as the trio drive the motorhome down to Florida: the service areas, the lush countryside, and finally the beautiful mountains of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> At some point there is something out of the ordinary, and the Ivey character seems to have fabricated stories about her daughter as well as about her husband, who now seems a bit scary. I will not spoil the outcome of this movie - but it ends positively when the audience waits for suspense - this movie reminded me a bit of Spielberg's "duel" - while initially it was not so threatening - the moral of the story is - you know Never what people think - especially when you drive across the country. Beware!!. You will enjoy this movie.
