I saw this movie on late night TV in Buffalo some 30 years ago, and I'd love to see it again before I ... well ... you know. The interaction between the main characters after the tiger (Eli Wallach) "captures" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a failed kidnapping attempt is absolutely funny. Charles Nelson Reilly's depiction of a neurotic university decan (?) Or department head is priceless. How many films can you name that can shed light on humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from start to finish? This movie reminds us that we are all in the same fight, regardless of class, race, gender or religion. And who can forget the scene when the homeowner attacked on the hands and knees of the tiny tiny weeds that dared to emerge overnight on his perfectly manicured lawn!
