The beauty. The terror. The poetry. The horror. The innocence The Guilt. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's all I should write in this comment for A TALE OF TWO SISTERS. The best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing it. I did not even know anything about the story of the two girls when I went to this movie. I just looked at the nice cover art, not even read the summary on the back and packed it in the DVD player. I just knew that it won several awards at festivals around the world and that it was highly recommended. <br /> <br /> The DVD cover was "The most frightening movie since THE RING, THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER". Although the terrifying part may be correct, you can forget the rest, because the only thing A TALE OF TWO SISTERS has in common with these films is ... a ghostly apparition with long black hair. It's even a bit unfair to compare it to the famous Japanese movies, as this Korean movie has much more to offer and is actually more complicated and intelligent than the others. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a little masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without saying anything about the story): The movie itself caught me at least twice with subtle surprise twists. And just when you think you've come to the conclusion (whether you get it or not, that's irrelevant right now) and you think the movie is going to end ... this movie is going on a bit longer. The cinematography is amazing, it uses bright colors during the day and dark tones at night. The camera work is excellent, the director sometimes chooses impressive, if not innovative, angles. Some shots are pure poetry (for example, the top shot with the two sisters at the lake). It looks very stylish. There are only four main characters, but the intrigues around them are intense. The story itself begins a little slowly, but there is a great variety of tone and emotions to keep it interesting. There was even a scene (as the girls made their way to the lake) when I suddenly remembered Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES. But if the horror sets in, that's pretty effective. There are also some successful surprise anxiety. Damn, I jumped up straight from my couch. The music is great, and sometimes, if it was not to be scary, I could not help but notice that it had a sort of Italian feel. A little weird for a Korean movie. Nevertheless, a great score. All details of this film have been treated with the utmost care, including a perfectly balanced surround sound. <br /> <br /> I also think that calling A TALE OF TWO SISTERS is just a horror movie that does not bring enough recognition. It's more like a mysterious horror drama that works both psychologically and supernaturally. No matter how you look at it, Asian horror is one of the best in the world. It may not be bloody, but sometimes it gets pretty scary and the topic is pretty disturbed. If you have not seen it yet, look for a copy, put it in your DVD player, follow the process, and make sure you pay close attention to this movie during its 110-minute runtime. <br /> <br There I hope that I have done a good job without spoiling anything.
