Nice description of the situation in the US, it explains different kinds of Islam and not only shows terrorists and extremists. Islam can be anything but killing, showing why some people become terrorists and how Muslim is without being extremist. It's a great show that Muslims and non-Muslims should see. Now we hope that other series or films will be made to change the idea that all Muslims are terrorists and all Americans want to destroy Islam. It interested me to know what Islam is exactly and what the US and European governments are doing to promote the coexistence of people of different religions.
