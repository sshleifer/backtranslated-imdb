This is a film that should be considered and treated as a work of art. This is a forgetful love work by the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima, which is full of artistic elements. The film jumps from color to black and white, from past to present, fictional works of Mishima to him. Everything without being confusing. The only thing that gets me is that the entire movie except the spoken parts of the narrator is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience, but did not win. Criterion, if you read this, this is a movie that should be released under your impression with as many extras as possible. This movie deserves more. 10/10
