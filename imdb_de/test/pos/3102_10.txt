There is a need for this kind of entertainment in our modern world. You can see "Ma and Pa" with adults, with your family (kids of all ages or just like me). They are gentle yet softly refreshing in a society of children killing children, a terrible war, inappropriate primetime television and poverty. We do not even know where all these children come from. Give me modern plumbing and I'll be happy with a kettle. Humor requires NO offensive language. It is difficult to follow conversations in shows. Another word is blown: relax, take off your shoes, and climb into your chair with a good, old-fashioned glass of lemonade, and just breathe, like Ma's chickens Lunchtime sweeps off the table! Pj
