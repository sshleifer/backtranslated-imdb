One of the best ever. Director, photography, an exciting and dramatic story, wonderful soundtrack, and most of all, the incredible credibility of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, the best and most underrated actor in the "U-40 Generation." After seeing this movie, do I think there's someone who has no doubt about killing another man, despite the ugly things he could have done?
