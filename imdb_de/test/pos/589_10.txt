I saw the beginning of the Muppet movie, but only half. Because I only watched it at Mrs. Kelly's house. The songs were the best and the muppets were so funny. They learn that if they believe in the end of the rainbow, anyone can do it, no matter how small, no matter how green (which was included in the trailer). Which means it describes the main character) and so are the other Muppets. Mel Brooks was amazing when he played Professor Max Krassman. The scene in which Miss Piggy rescues Kermit by doing Kung Fu on this guy. It was so cool. <br /> <br /> The Muppet movie is the best Jim Henson movie with the funniest characters and people who appreciate him for his successful movie.
