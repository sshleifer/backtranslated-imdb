Gorgeous! It's never a masterpiece, but it's a mini-gem of British comedy of the late seventies. Considering that the producers wanted to sell it overseas, it plays an American (the late character actor Richard Jordan), but he is not the usual boring Hollywood guy. He is surrounded by the cream of British drama talent, led by a wonderfully waspish and superior David Niven. <br /> <br /> Nivens Ivan the Terrible, of course, gets the best deposits and the best reaction shots. He also manages to be surprisingly threatening and intimidatingly dangerous. The moment in the snooker club, in which he drops the charming fa√ßade and threatens Richard Jordan, will be a shock to those who view Niven as a mere comedy star in the salon. He is full of real power and recklessness when we suddenly see how Ivan earned his nickname. All the more surprising in view of how sick Niven was at that time. Shortly after making this production, he lost his ability to talk to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's Disease). This is the last picture Niven made, where you can hear his own voice, which is then dubbed by the comic-impressionist Sid Caesar. <br /> <br /> Next to him you can see many famous faces from cinema and television of the seventies. Elke Sommer (flashing breasts in a politically incorrect Bimbo mode of the 70s), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kaye, etc. etc. Call. "Who are you calling ?! ... Bloody Dial-A-Disc! You gormless Git!" <br /> <br /> Great shots of the London street situation; The film becomes a patina time capsule of red phone boxes with chunky round hand switches and black, from "Cor blimey, gov!" Cockneys and ladies and gentlemen modeling all sorts of down-to-earth retro casual clothing and hairstyles of the late seventies. <br /> <br /> Unlike the classic era-earlier comedic comedies, the "hero" gets away with his crime and escapes to life in the sun. How have times changed! The moral code, according to which crooks always had to be considered punished in films, had long since passed in the seventies, with antiheroists like Pinky Green receiving status from fat cat users through their bold anti-authoritarianism and determination to curse a clogged capitalist. We are encouraged to rejoice as Pinky gets away with impunity and like a bird with its poorly achieved achievements. Compare that to the end of The Lavender Hill Mob! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, old fashioned in his fashion and attitude and with the stuff of the evening cult sightseeing. Perfect to see at midnight after closing the pubs; If you're a certain age, you'll feel nostalgic and always want to see David Niven in a branch of McDonalds intimidating an American in the background with the help of a retractable telescope!
