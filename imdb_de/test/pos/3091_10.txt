It would be something to try to tell someone what Fata Morgana is all about. Or maybe it's not like this: Duke goes to the Sahara desert and surrounding villages to film different landscapes and the locals. However, this is just the widest stroke. It is a performance that you either give up or not. He goes completely into the world around him, without a story that is only tied to certain aspects of written poetry while his camera (on supposedly discarded footage shot) wanders like a travelogue. You could even jump to that simple conclusion by setting up these immense landscapes and then moving on to a rougher culture (though not the "normal" culture itself) and to a point too abstract to be properly conveyed , Sometimes it takes a while for the purity to be achieved through the "Creation" section, but the purity of how parts are manipulated either by nature or by broken machines. Soon, the narrative, readings from Popol Vuh (which, incidentally, makes the music for most of his films), adds an entirely different level to the gradual processing of highly stylized recordings. It's a hybrid movie, and it's not easy, but the rewards are what comes closest to Herzog's idea of ​​"ecstatic truth." Pictures that he has advertised for his entire career. <br /> <br /> One wonders if the pictures end up until the second section, Paradise, carries the spoken words or if it is the other way around. Her eyes move with the stills and pans, and the wording is almost religious in nature, but there is also the music selection, as the bizarrely saved singing and the reserved classical music match up with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith. I think every page is a compliment to the other, and it seems to be something that does not seem to work. Perhaps that is the attraction, the opportunities that go through the desolate wastelands and the smallest stretches of any civilized life (in this case the huts of the desert) that make it so fascinating. If it's just for the cinematographic sense, it's a miracle, too indescribable for the casual photographer, due to technical shapes and some of the strangest images of a duke movie. There are pans, there are long shots, it is held in the hand as you drive through the cities, there is a bus that lies tens of miles away, which are only a pair through illusions, there are full close ups of fire and A Man Holding a Reptile Talking About Radar (a truly classic gonzo comedy), there are still people who are held in false poses, and a man and a woman who play inhuman music. But above all, it feels natural to me, at least for me, for the personal nature of the approach. <br /> <br /> I'm sure only Herzog would know for sure why he made this movie for the simple "how"; he already shot Even Dwarf's Started Small and endured many dangers to end it. But that's what makes Fata Morgana an amazing performer, depending on what makes you feel like it. It is definitely disturbing, but there is the temptation to want to see it again soon, just to experience all the ideas and realities that have turned into abstract, strange vibes (yes, the word "vibes" applies here). It is one of the truly spectacular "art films" ever made.
