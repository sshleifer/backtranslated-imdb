I'm not a sports fan - but I love Sportflics! So, why ... what's a great sports movie ... this one. And the storytelling style is very good. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a dependable, fantastic 2 hours of entertainment, "Greatest Game" will be highly skilled. Here is a movie that moves. Bill Paxton attended the same school as Ron Howard - Richie Cunningham, "Happy Days." That's not bad. Look at the immense work Ron did after moving behind the camera. Bill like Ron was a great actor, but will be a superstar director when "Greatest Game Ever" is followed by the clue. <br /> <br /> Wonderful camera - fantastic director - fine acting, especially by Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus and Justin Ashforth A must-have movie not just as a "feel-good" or "sports movie" This is a very good movie.
