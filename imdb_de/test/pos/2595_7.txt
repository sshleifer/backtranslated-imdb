... and there were some. <br /> <br /> I do not like this cartoon as much as many others, also because it was made in his day. I prefer cartoons with Daffy and Bugs, which are about fifteen years ago. Many people will like this, especially people who always find violence funny, whether it's cartoon or not. <br /> <br /> The basic plot is pretty well known to Looney Tunes: Elmer hunts, Daffy leads him to bugs and Daffy is shot instead. Also included are pretty clever and very entertaining jokes (some do not improve the episode), ugly shooting and animation that are a bit mediocre. The plot is mainly joke-oriented - every joke sustains the episode. This type of conspiracy is not uncommon in Looney Tunes (of course, if you're such a Looney Tunes fan - or a zealous - like me, you know that). <br /> <br /> For people who love everything about Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck and like the sound of what I said about it, enjoy "Rabbit Seasoning"! <br /> <br /> 7 and a half of ten.
