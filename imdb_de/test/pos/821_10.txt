Van Damme has made some great films over the years, and he has a big ten in my books. From the backdrop of Mexico to the five star fight scenes, this movie was amazing. The film is all about border guards protecting the territory of the Mexican border. Ex-sea lions smuggle drugs from Mexico to the United States of America (USA). Van Damme and Scott Atkins perform impressively as policeman and villain. While not as good as death, this movie gave the action, acting, and movie a five-star look. I am always looking forward to these first-class action films and they are getting better and better. Carry on, van damme. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you enjoyed movies like - To the Death, The Hard Corps and Substitutes.
