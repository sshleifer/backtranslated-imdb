If you are looking for a typical war movie, this is not the case, so a note to all the testosterone-pumped, war-whispering war-reformers out there, do not bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in World War II, you do not expect Nazis, cannons, blood, blood, etc. It's not a movie about people who are making war or waging war. It's a movie about ordinary people with whom war happens and the decisions they make when they handle it. Acting, cinematography, writing: everything perfect 10s here. You will certainly appreciate it if you are a Russian like me, but even if you do not, you will probably love it. If you do not speak Russian, look for the DVD version of RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council). It has subtitles in about 14 different languages, but the English dubbing that I would say is just as good. Of course it's not as good as the original Russian track (some things get lost in translation), but as good as the English subtitles. So, give it a try, especially if you're studying film in any way.
