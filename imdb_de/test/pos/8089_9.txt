This satire is really really dead, and nobody is spared. Although this film has a lot to laugh about in the stupid story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed "Hynkel" and spoken in a pseudo-pseudo-German language), the general tone is rather sad, perhaps because of the place of the Films in the story. And the actors do not exaggerate that much, I think. One of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the closing speech of the Jewish barber, if only things could end like this. It's not really the character who's talking anymore, it's Chaplin who says something he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, the movie does not feel outdated or old, it actually moves at a pretty good pace. And the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing I'm not interested in is slapstick, but that comes only with the era I suspect. This is an incredibly daring, strict attitude towards fascism that is still so bad after all these years.
