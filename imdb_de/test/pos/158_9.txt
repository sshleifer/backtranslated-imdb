Thirsty <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was beautifully designed. The cinematography was far beyond the good. I think almost every frame could be frozen and you would make an exquisite photo. Most noticeable is the use of color. In many cases, the camera slipped through the scene and the work was flawless. <br /> <br /> Park Chan Wook's direction was fantastic. He let me unflinchingly believe in his far-fetched universe. There have been various approaches to verbal and visual humor (of a dark nature) that add depth to the picture as a whole. <br /> <br /> I would not call the acting outstanding, but it suited the movie and worked well enough. <br /> <br /> For me, the only place this movie was missing was in history. At times I will not lie, the processes between the characters just did not make sense. Sometimes the story flow was clunky. Overall, I was disappointed with the muffled narrative, and I felt she was running a little too long. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend this movie for its vision, its visual flourish, its dark humor and at the end of the day it is an interesting movie, even if it is imperfect. 9.10
