For some reason, some shows simply fail ... some rightly, others not ... Buddy Faro was a clever show with interesting characters and dark humor that you would love to see ... Perhaps it was never intended to be a great success his. But it had a "weirdness" that made it enjoyable ... it seems that maybe I was the only one watching ... Dennis Farina and Frank Whaley were perfect in their respective roles ... Production quality and writing was great and Vegas was the perfect backdrop ... hopefully the first and only season will be released on DVD as I think it deserves some celebrity ... maybe at least on TV
