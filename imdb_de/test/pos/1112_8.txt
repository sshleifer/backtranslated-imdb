We see a man change from the city to the "outside world" and change dramatically - his family asks questions, but he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> A strange, brilliant movie shown here in Israel. Wonderful locations, great actors, a movie that disguises itself as a "thriller," but more of a case study about the captain's insanity. <br /> <br /> The film was far above the others as part of the AICE Festival here in Israel. Good luck for the team that came to this film. It is a Grand Guignol, a small masterpiece of Noir. <br /> <br /> My only criticism preventing a "10" is that the sound and music sometimes overwhelm. It tends to disturb the images that speak for themselves.
