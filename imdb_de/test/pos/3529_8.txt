One of the many hillbilly horrors that came out in the early aft, and luckily this is one of the better ones. Yes, it has a cheesy plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, even though the killer might have been a little more scary, he just looked like a fat slut we the local sheriff or whatever he is, who warns them not to go to these mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the kids arrive, it does not seem to be dangerous at all. It's a shame we do not get such movies anymore, and if it does, it's usually a boring, terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is more suspenseful and scary than bloody The factor in this movie is really low, which I did not like, but otherwise it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, you have to search a long time to find this movie you will find it, you will like it and also be careful to end up with the last girl and the killer is absolutely not what You would expect.
