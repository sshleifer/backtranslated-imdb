This movie is about as good as the first Jackass, but with some nastier skits. I would not say that this was as good as the first, but it came very close to me. Jackass fans will not be disappointed, but if you did not like the first movie, you'll hate it. There are scenes that are seen as Jackass classics (older suits with "supplements", "cab ride" and many others), and those that you never wish to see (eating dung, drinking seeds, etc.) , Overall, this movie was a good watch and I'm glad I could see it. I'm sure this movie does not have the best rating due to critics who rate it (I was in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted), but do not let that stop you.
