It finally occurred to me how I saw my Christmas VHS in Connecticut, which the other movie reminded me of. If the other one would not finish 20 years later, I would say it's a remake. <br /> <br /> Just like Rock Hudson was an inveterate fishing expert for Abercrombie & Fitch who had to buy something Barbara Stanwyck plays a professional training in a fishing tournament and plays a 40s version of Martha Stewart. Stanwyck is a cook columnist who has built up all this picture of living on a small farm in Connecticut with husband and baby that wonderful delights. The problem is that she is unmarried, childless, writes her column from her apartment in New York and does not know how to cook water. Her writing, however, is an audience success. <br /> <br /> Anger is when she cooks a house Christmas dinner for a War Hero sailor played by Dennis Morgan, who also sings a few songs. I have to hold the picture up at any cost. And her publisher Sidney Greenstreet likes the idea so much that he invites himself to dinner. So, with a borrowed farm, baby and Reginald Gardiner, who like to do it with Stanwyck, she tries to be outrageous by <br /> <br /> Christmas in Connecticut is a classic at Christmas, and rightly so. The leads are warm and human and are greatly supported by the assembled players. S.Z. Sakall as a Hungarian restaurant owner / friend of Stanwyck, from whom she gets her cooking information, and Una O'Connor as a housekeeper have a nice chemistry. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry at all, obviously for everyone except Reggie and he's funny in his way with cloth towels. <br /> <br /> Most people remember this movie as one of the few adventures of Sidney Greenstreet in the comedy. If he's not a vicious villain, a cynical life-watcher, or a tyrannical tycoon, there are few other things on Greenstreet on the screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him the rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the best of it. <br /> <br /> In a biography of Barbara Stanwyck, she mentions that she has enjoyed making Christmas in Connecticut a welcome respite from some vicious parts like Double Indemnity that she had recently made. One of the things that made the movie so enjoyable was that director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet made spontaneous entertainment between cast and crew with English Music Hall numbers between takes. Made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly. <br /> <br /> Well, if only someone filmed these numbers.
