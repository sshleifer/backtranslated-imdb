Like many horror fans in search of the next big fear movie, we plundered the Asian horror market for everything we got our hands on and did not leave behind a dark-haired ghost lady. We had good reasons for this; the Asian market had produced such terrible wonders as Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon - the grudge and a fairy tale of the two sisters. By the time Takashi Miike was taken out of the genre with One Missed Call in 2003, the market seemed to dry up, leaving him open to ridicule and ridicule, though Hollywood Remake Machine was still in full steam ahead of him. Do not get me wrong, there were still many good Asian horror sounds. Marebito and Shutter, to name just two, will one day be considered smaller genre classics. But the slender-haired ghost lady had definitely gotten her food at the party, and it was time to bring the successful drunkard home! Then comes a movie like Noroi - The Curse. A movie clever enough to pay homage to its roots subtly throws the rulebook out the window. What I want to describe in Plot will probably make you think that there is nothing new here. The film is a documentary about one of Japan's best paranormal investigators as he receives stories and clues about spooky events. He begins to investigate a woman's claim that she hears regularly that a baby is crying in the house next door, but there is no baby there except a middle-aged woman and her son. These two disappear sharply when the reporter pushes his nose around, but strange other coincidences crop up. A young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a pretty young actress who had a strange vision, many dead pigeons, and a very sinister demon called Kagutaba, who led to a truly fearsome showdown in a small historic town. , <br /> <br /> Saying more on the plot can ruin the fun a little bit. The film is shot in a kind of "faux documentary" and contains footage from television programs and news reports. The subtitles show where you are in relation to the timeline. The movie has made more than a few comparisons to the Blair Witch Project, but apart from the recording format and the scary journey through the forest late at night, the comparison really ends there. <br /> <br /> Refreshing Noroi is as it does for modern horror viewers. If you expect croaking ghost women to jump out of the attic, look elsewhere. The film's strength lies in its slow, gradual build-up of terror, a terror so profound that it will stay with you for days upon viewing. The climax is pretty damn crazy, but just when you think the movie is over, you get the "real" ending when the credits start, and the sweet saintly guy is a killer. When it comes to acting it is usually convincing. The crazy clairvoyant clairvoyant looks a bit "comedic," but that soon dries up in the middle of the movie. The movie also feels a bit "uglier" than a lot of Asian Ghost horror, as some events are also violent. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can watch Noroi alone. late at night. Since seeing Ringu for the first time ten years ago, I'm not so excited when I saw a horror movie. It's one that will scratch you until it's too late, then it's under your skin. Just let yourself go to this topic. And no slender-haired ghost lady in sight? No wonder it was barely released outside of Japan, let alone an American remake in the series. Check this, if you can, in my books!
