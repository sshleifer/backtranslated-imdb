The idea won from a real diplomatic incident "The Wind and the Lion" is a very good adventure movie that takes place in the deserts of Africa. El Raisuli (Sean Connery), head of an Arab tribe, abducts an American (Candice Bergen) and her two children to give some concessions to his country to US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith). From this simple act John Milius gets a very complete and entertaining movie in the genre. <br /> <br /> The outdoor dessert locations, stunning color photography, well-handled action sequences and perfect settings make the image appear epic with an undeniable sense of grandeur. The music is also remarkable and fits accordingly. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is very good as an Arab leader and proves that he can handle almost any role. Thus, Candice Bergen is the woman who shows strength in dangerous circumstances, but is deeply afraid of her inner self and has her weaknesses; She can admire Connery and even understand his very different focus on the life that comes from her very different cultures. Brian Keith plays one of his best roles as US President Teddy Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and very good movie sample of the genre. Give it a chance, you will not regret it.
