This production was pretty good. The usual fabulous scenery, interesting, quirky characters. It was just so strange not to have Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon, and Poirot's office / residence, which were so prominently represented in the original secrets of PBS / BBC's office. Hastings reads the newspaper while Poirot "trains his little gray cells". Miss lemon, whenever needed. Poirot without Captain Hastings would be like Holmes without Watson ... he can certainly solve the crime, but is not so interesting /> And what would a Poirot mystery without Hastings, with its impeccable manners, fall in love with a beautiful, unattainable woman.
