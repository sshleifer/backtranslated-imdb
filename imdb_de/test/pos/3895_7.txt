I can not say that this movie was hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face all the time. I like this dark kind of comedy; "very bad things", "8 heads in a duffel bag" or "cold-blooded" <br /> <br /> The way the main character gets away with murder is a lot of fun. For me, it was not a big surprise what the end would be, but the way this end came about was. Another thing that stands out is the way they've managed to engage the audience. The way Terry looks at us is hilarious, you can almost pretend to be his accomplice.
