George Armstrong Custer is known throughout history as an incompetent general who killed his battle at the Battle of Little Big Horn. "They died with their boots," paints another picture of General Custer. In this film, he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier, whose mistakes and misdeeds are mainly due to his love of adventure. Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer, whom we meet for the first time in West Point as confident recruits. Custer is different from other cadets quickly as a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. Somehow this does not seem to bother Custer and seems to confuse him, as he really does not know how to get into such predicaments. Despite his bad reputation, he eventually graduated and becomes an officer in the United States Army. Due to an error Custer gets a ranking. Before this can be corrected, he leads a union regiment into battle against the Confederates. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marrying his sweetheart Libby, played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a very supportive understanding wife, who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the border while he takes over the leadership of the Seventh Regiment of Cavalry. Custer becomes a man of honor seeking peace with Native Americans. To prove his intentions, he signs a contract with Crazy Horse, the leader of the Sioux. If this contract is jeopardized by a plot to spread a false rumor about gold in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life and the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers /> <br / > Errol Flynn dominates every scene in which he appears. He successfully portrays Custer as extravagant, arrogant, romantic and witty, depending on the mood of the scene. Olivia De Havilland's portrayal of Libby Bacon Custer as the love of his life shows us his tender, gentler side. The chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who have worked together in several other films, is so smooth and it almost feels like they are playing themselves and not the role of Custer and his wife. The portrayals of her other actors enhance the performances of Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, Sidney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott, Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining. <br /> <br /> The reviewer would rate this 4-star movie. Although it is not historically accurate, it is very entertaining. The film has something of everything. It has adventure, comedy and romance and therefore appeals to a wide audience. The casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give credible performances, making them forget that it's based largely on fiction rather than fact. The reviewer particularly likes that the Native Americans were not portrayed as the bad guys, only that they wanted to protect their holy land. <br /> <br />
