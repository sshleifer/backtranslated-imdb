That is precious. Everything is illuminated is sweet and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue. Oh, how I waited for this to arrive in Austin. While Elijah Wood is as charming as Jonathan Safran Foer (author of the novel Everything Is Illuminated), it's Eugene Hutz (who plays the Ukrainian tour guide and translator Alex in Jonathan) who really steals this movie. Alex is a Ukrainian hip-hop lover-breakdancer who helps Jonathan and his grandfather find the woman who saved Jonathan's grandfather in World War II. The Ukrainian landscape has never looked so breathtaking. I am thinking of putting everything together and moving to the former Soviet state. <br /> <br /> However, the tone of the film changes as Jonathan and Alex finally meet the woman they are looking for, and suddenly this delightful comedy transforms into a heartbreaking historical drama about a Jewish village that was created during the Nazi occupation was destroyed. All that is illuminated is about history, heritage and the wisdom that can be gained by uncovering the past. It's perfect.
