Well, I'm a big Italian horror fanatic and I love movies by directors like Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, just to quote the most famous ones. "La villa delle anime maledette" is one of the most unknown films of this genre, which was filmed when this kind of cinema began its ongoing crisis. Director Carlo Ausino sounds completely new to my ears (although he made six films, this is the price that Italian directors have to pay to avoid working in Rome ...). But the movie is not so bad. It is absolutely not correct to talk about "garbage". OK, the plot is not that original; It reminds me of things like the Amytville series (the year is the same of "Amityville Possession" by Damiano Damiani) or "Shock", the last work by Mario Bava. However, one has to think that this is the movie of a cameraman (like Mario Bava movies); So the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or the characters. Atmosphere very well generated by the use of light and by the camera movement. The rest stays in the background. I think the movie works. not so good, but works; it's certainly better than many Hollywood productions like "the Haunting" that have a bigger budget, but no bigger ideas ...
