Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred and a few days later Carl is very depressed and leaves her to cleanse the fog in her life. Joline sees her marriage as an important commitment at the end of her life and decides to look for Carl in Texas. She is very much supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets her in the Mexican border. There, Joline meets the confused Carl and realizes that she can not change his mind while Jay Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) knows and goes out with her, and in the end, life goes on. This movie is very unpredictable and has a very different story. I believe that it is an independent production. In some parts it is a bit slow and boring, but there are certain dialogues that make this movie worthwhile. I liked it and my voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Rebeldes At√© o Fim '(` Rebels to the end') <br /> <br />
