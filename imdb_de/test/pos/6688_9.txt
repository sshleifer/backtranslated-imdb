I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges, so I recorded that on DVD without having seen it before. I immediately became a fan of Kevin Spacey. <br /> <br /> The general conspiracy of "alien in human body" was, in my experience, made to death, but I liked the approach of K-PAX which seemed to me very different and much more sensitive than most. Bridges is an excellent doctor (you want to tell him what you have in mind) and Spacey's expression and gestures are perfect in the role. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Prot and the totally human characters in the clinic is delightful, especially the subtle manipulation of their behavior. <br /> <br /> The end is bittersweet - I like Prot's decision, but the final scenes (with bridges) made me cry.
