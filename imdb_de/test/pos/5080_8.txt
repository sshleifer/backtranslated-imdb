Imagine you were on the plane for 18 hours. They were on a business trip to South Africa. You are a highly paid professional. You lived in the US for 20 years. You are in your thirties, you have a wife, a little boy and another baby on the way. One thing, though you have a green card, you are still Egyptian. On the transit you will be asked to come with two security guards. Next, you know you're overwhelmed, hooded, and chained, and after a brief (but still quite civil) interrogation, you're safe! This happens at the beginning of the movie with Anwar el Ibrahimi. His is a story of pain and (literally) torture. It is one of several storylines. One follows his wife's attempts to get more information. You follow the (cold) bureaucrats behind the transfer. Another story is about the family of the man interrogating Anwar el Ibrahimi. There are also some other stories and in the end everyone gets together neatly. Although the more well-known actors, such as Reese Witherspoon (as desperate pregnant woman) Jake Gyllenhaal (when the CIA rookie was forced to watch the interrogation in North Africa) and Meryl Streep (as CIA hot shot Corine Whitman) are, it's really the lesser known Actors who are the story and give their hearts For me, the actor who played the unlucky Mr. El Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) was the heart and soul of this movie. His portrayal of a man in distress was shockingly well done. It's almost like he was really tortured! Israeli actor Yigal Naor was also very impressive as the family member and the extremely cruel torturer were worried. Hard to look at and not exactly funny, but still very worthwhile.
