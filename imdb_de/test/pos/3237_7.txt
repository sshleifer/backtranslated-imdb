I just watched that on BBC Channel 4 again. It's by no means the best novel by Jane Austen, but the movie is a sensible interpretation. I suspect the meeting rooms in Bath would have been crowded rather than shown. Maybe they could not afford the extras. Why does everyone shut up so the dancing couple can have an audible conversation? I have never heard anything that someone told me when I danced, and I suspect that in the 18./19. Century in Bath would have been the same. <br /> <br /> I can not believe the US. Canada reviews; They completely miss the ironic element that is in the film. The "gothic" scenes are presented quite cleverly, but you have to read them correctly. I'm sure Jane A was slightly amused by these reviews. A suggestion of nothing, does anyone else believe that Peter Firth looks more like Colin Baker (a former Doctor Who) or, conversely, the older they get?
