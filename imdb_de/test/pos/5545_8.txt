This is a fun movie with subtle intent. His off-beat comedy is funny to me, not funny for my friends. The soundtrack is perfect. <br /> <br /> I own this on VHS and have seen it many times, often because it's just a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the principals (though only Joan Cusack was used) as a big-ear perch Waste of their talent. I know, I know, she was still young ...). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I opted for a DVD last night (instead of watching my VHS cassette) and was shocked to find many important scenes. And with the copy I looked at, there were no peculiarities for deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes would never exist !! I am so glad that I bought the used VHS at a flea market. <br /> <br /> It's clear that there was a lot of choreography here, which is why I love her so much. It takes a lot of skill, talent and genius to move from scene to scene in scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine. (Note the scene in which the food carts converge, the rolling while shooting on the floor Miami, the chicken lickin 'debacle, the foot massage, the salon shampooing.) This movie feels very "theatrical," which for many Distraction can be, whose bad reviews follow: I know some viewers Who does not quite understand this style, confuses the exaggerations and exaggerated achievements with bad spectacle and bad direction. Not so. Jonathan Demme does an excellent job of bringing the entire company and its respective roles to life. <br /> <br /> The opening and the first scene are also among my favorites of all time (another popular opening title / scene: Fly Away Home). <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Matthew Modine was so eagerly torn out of the public eye; I really like him and found his casting PERFECT in the role of Mike Smith. Actually, this film is well populated from soup to nuts: everyone is believable and true to his role. As for the question of whether the public accepts Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought that they did it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Charming, funny, exciting ... what's not to like? If you want to have a bit of fun, check out this quirky, colorful adventure Mob love story.
