I found this film excellent, quirky and unlike the normal course of the mill 'cop catching serial killers'. Kiefer Sutherland was as brilliant as ever - I do not think I saw anything he did, where he did not do brilliantly. The dialogue was sometimes funny to lighten the mood and rousing the plot. Many thanks to other reviewers who showed the connection to Alice in Wonderland - I did not understand them. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Kiefer Sutherland (like me) and anyone who wants to watch a fun movie for a few hours. It was a shame that it was not released to cinemas for a wider audience.
