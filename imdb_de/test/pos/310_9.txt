Following the success of the first two Godfather films in 1972 and 1974, Francis Ford Coppola made an ambitious effort to highlight the reality of the Vietnam War, which ended with the overthrow of Saigon in the Viet Cong in 1975. ? The plot was loosely based on the book "Heart of Darkness," a story by Joseph Conrad on Kurtz, a salesman in the African jungle who has gained mysterious powers about the natives. Coppola retains much of it, including details like the severed heads in front of Kurtz's headquarters and his last words: "The Horror of Horror ??" <br /> <br /> In the film, Sheen plays a military captain who has been given the mission to invade Cambodia and eliminate with "extreme prejudice" an embellished officer who has become embarrassed for the authorities. On his journey up the river to the Renegade camp, he witnesses the demoralization of the US armed forces, ramped up or drunk with power. <br /> <br /> Although the film was accused of inconsistency on its first release due to cuts enforced on Coppola, this was the most serious attempt to deal with Vietnam's experience and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre ? In 1980, the film won an Oscar for Best Camera and Best Sound. <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" was restored in 2001 with fifty minutes. As a result, the film can now be seen as the epic masterpiece that it is?
