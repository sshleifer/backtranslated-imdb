It is a shame that the movie was no longer played in cinemas. It's a rich, structured love story with believable, too-human characters too preoccupied with games, protecting their hearts to recognize The Real Thing when they hear it. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the attitude in Chicago, between hip, artistic, educated and middle-class African-Americans from the middle classes, who deal with poetry, music and literature. Another is his Royal Fineness, Larenz Tate - and if you're just a half fan of him, you MUST see this movie! His boyish claim and vulnerability are perfect for the role of Darius. Nia Long also shines as Nina, who wishes to tell Darius that she loves him, but is afraid of breaking "the rules". A great movie that you can see on the couch with your sweetheart!
