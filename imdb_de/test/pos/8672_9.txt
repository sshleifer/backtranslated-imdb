One of the best films I have seen in a long time, precise in its vision and beautiful and very resourceful in its implementation. I can not say much without giving it away, and I can not recommend that you read so much about this movie before the movie. Just see him. <br /> <br /> But ah, you have to come up with ten lines of text to list a check in IMDb. Mystery. What can I do? Are you telling about the movie? Nope. Can not do it I think I enjoyed this movie because it was seen without prejudice. Please do the same. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that acting is excellent and understated, and what I have come to appreciate about foreign films is that the films are actually about the films, not the films stars.
