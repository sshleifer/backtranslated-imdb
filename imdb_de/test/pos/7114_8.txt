This is another universal fun fright festival. Many people want to compare it to House Of Frankenstein. Even if it has a similar cast and director, it can stand alone. (It seems that Alder C Kenton directed the bulk of the Universal horror movies of the 40s). <br /> <br /> The action review: Baron Latos appears in the house of Dr. med. Eidlemann, who is looking for a "remedy" for his vampirism. Larry Talbot (who somehow survived House of Frankenstein) also appears at the doctor's good door, which seeks a cure for his suffering. After a failed suicide attempt, Talbot and the doctor find the Frankenstein monster. Shortly before he bites into the dust, Dracula infects the good doctor with his blood. The doctor becomes a bloodthirsty madman at certain times. Where this leads you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Carradine actually performs very well as Dracula. He does not chew the scenery like in later roles. It's hard to suppress a giggle when it appears in a cylinder. The cape / coat is traditional, but the hat has to go. Where does the hat go when it turns into a bat ...? Onslow Stevens gives an excellent presentation of the doctor. He is torn between his basic friendliness and the increasing bloodlust he now tended to. This is a very underrated performance. Chaney gives the Wolfman even more life in his fourth appearance in this role. <br /> <br /> The monster is not very busy this time. Just lying on the table is the end (some stock footage of Ghost Of Frankenstein is used). At least he was a bit close to House Of Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Yes, this sticks to the basic universal pattern with the trouble Dorfmob runs amok with torches. But it's not a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes. It will be a low 8.
