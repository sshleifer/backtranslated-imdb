In 1956, the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party was held, and Soviet Prime Minister Krushchev made a speech denouncing Stalin and the Stalinist purges and Gulag work systems. In doing so, he revealed information that had previously been banned, revealing terrible new truths that opened the door for a new Soviet cinema under the direction of Mikhail Kalatozov, once Stalin's director of film production. This movie shows a Red Army that is NOT victorious. They are surrounded in a retreat mode. Many people are dying, including the hero, in a movie that was introduced after the 06.02.41, the German invasion of Russia, when Germany plays the Barbarossa Plan, an invasion of the blitzkrieg, a quick victory and the final enslavement of the Slavs which was almost successful in actually getting within a radius of 20 miles of Moscow, wiping out a Red Army, wreaking havoc on human casualties, 15 to 20 million Russians or 20% of the entire population. In the past, this was a moment of great dream and suffering, a psychological shock to the Russian people, but the Red Army held and prolonged the war for another four years, until they were finally victorious. <br /> <br /> During the war, Stalin used the war genre in films to increase morale and introduced female heroines who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic. If women could be so successful and patriotic, then Russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers. Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with a single, courageous leader who succeeded in killing many enemies, an obvious reference to Stalin himself, who was always portrayed in the film as a courageous, wise and victorious leader. However, Kalatozov changed this depiction when THE CRANES ARE FLYING was created after Stalin's death, causing political thaw and a worldwide sensation. He won the Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or as well as the Best Director and Best Actress (Tatyana Samoilova). and awakened the West for the first time, since Eisenstein's IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 1940s, to Soviet cinema. <br /> <br /> This film featured brilliant, stunning and extremely mobile camera work by his exceptional cinematographer Sergei Uresevsky. He used spectacular crane and tracking shots, war images, battlefields, Moscow and busy streets that are extremely vivid and real. Another brilliant scene shows the main heroine Veronica, who has heard nothing of her lover Boris in the four years of the war. He is thought to be dead, but she continues to love him, expressed in a scene in which she runs onto a scene Bridge with a train behind her, a moment in which the viewer wondered if she could throw herself in front of the train, instead, she rescues a three-year-old boy named Boris, who is about to be hit by a car. Another scene depicts the death of Boris on the battlefield, who dies a pointless death, and his thoughts spin and twirl in a beautiful montage of trees, sky and leaves, all turning in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams, including one imaginary wedding with Veronica. In this movie is the famous line "You can dream when the war is over." In the final sequence, when the war is over, the soldiers return in a crowd scene on the streets. Veronica learns that Boris has died. Everyone is happy and excited about the return of the soldier, but Veronica is desperate and distributes flowers to soldiers strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness that reveals "white and gray cranes hovering in the sky". <br /> <br /> The film was released in Russia in 1957 and, according to some reviews, "the silence in the theater was profound, the wall between art and life had fallen ... and tears opened the doors." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
