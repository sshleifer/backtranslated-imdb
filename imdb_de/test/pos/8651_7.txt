A man comes to a strange, beautiful, sterile city where no one feels emotions and instead deals with interior design. The essential equality of his days is reminiscent of "Groundhog Day"; The strange passages in and out of this world are more reminiscent of the being of John Malkovich. But in truth this is a Scandanavian film, a self-satirical piece that is also Scandanavian-style: the tone is austere and even the most fantastic scenes are played in a straight line, which makes you laugh at the absurdity. In my opinion, the combination is not quite successful: there are not enough real laughs to compensate for the difficulties, if you consider the piece as a pure drama. It is certainly original; Maybe my problem is that the world she satirizes is not one that I recognize. Maybe I should move to Scandinavia!
