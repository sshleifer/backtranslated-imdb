This movie is definitely a case of style and substance, but the style is good and certainly more than unique to make "The Cell" a memorable and above-average movie. <br /> <br /> "The Cell" is gorgeous with impressive sets, costumes and makeup looking. Yes, it is a real feast for the eyes to see everything. The film has some perfectly "dreamy" sequences that are strange but also very beautiful and imaginative. This movie is a perfect mix of an art house movie and a typical Hollywood thriller accessible to both fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite far-fetched and does not always make sense. That's why the movie is not always pleasant and likeable, but as I said earlier, the style compensates for that. The style lets you watch until the end and delivers the best moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as a serial killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really little used as an actor and this movie once again shows his talent. I'm not very happy about the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know she can play in some of her films, but she really was not fit to play the main character in this movie. Her character was not strong enough and was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Still, I felt that Vince Vaughn was a mishap in this movie as well. He did not fit well enough and no, I'm not saying that because I'm used to seeing him only in comedies today. The rest of the minor cast is good and still gives the movie a certain credibility. <br /> <br /> The music of Howard Shore was surprisingly good and was, so to speak, "Se7en". It went well with the film and gave some scenes a little extra mood and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie and the concept is far-fetched and not always handled properly. Nevertheless, "The Cell" is a perfectly playable film that may even be a must because of its style, originality and creativity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
