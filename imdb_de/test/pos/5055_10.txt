"Labyrinth of Passion" - with the possible exception of "Matador" - is Almodovar's best film. It shows its unique personality at its best and least censored before using more mainstream. Almodovar is about the only modern director who can deal with Preston Sturges' wonderful madness. It's useless to try and explain what the movie is about. The real point is that Almodovar is Almodovar's willingness and ability to bring his situations to the very limits of reason and sometimes to plausibility and taste.
