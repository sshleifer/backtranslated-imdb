Sometimes you've got up late into the night, browsing through the stations, bored and wanting a light and fluffy romantic comedy that will not make you feel bipolar. And this movie fit exactly to this billing. Sure, the plot was torn right out of the 1930s. The script was as slick as the legendary seal of the Hallmark Greeting Card Company, and the one-dimensional characters were played by a cast plucked directly from the main casting. and exactly what I needed last night. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor have great chemistry - I liked it on "Picket Fences" and I'm glad to say they still have it over 10 years later. Costas Mandylor, age 41, is probably still one of the prettiest men on the screens since old Rudy Valentino kicked 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Bonus points for the casting of this funny man who was on the cartoon lady's roller skates in this show. I always thought he was something direct from a Hepburn Grant comedy. BRAVO! <br /> <br /> Some people will probably say that this was the craziest piece of cinema that has ever been made and I would probably have to agree - but come on! It's on the Hallmark Channel. What did you expect? Sit back, relax, eat some sesame sticks and watch a cute little movie with two nice people and a bottle of Zinfandel. Believe me, you'll love and accept Schmaltz even more, and then you can go to sleep and dream of Costas Mandylor floating in a sea of ​​tempered chocolate feeding you petit fours with fresh, minty chocolate icing. YUMMO! (PS Now I have a craving for Petit Fours. Thank you, hello!) <br /> <br /> I really wish the bad girl had been cast with Rachel Ray, and maybe this rude food nerd Alton Brown Announcer instead of the scary guy with the Van Dyk beard. Shudder! <br /> <br /> That would have made my night. But hey, look at "Just Desserts".
