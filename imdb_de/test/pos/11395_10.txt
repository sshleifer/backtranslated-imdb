I rented Boogie Nights last week and I could tell you, when I saw the movie, I had a great time. If you think, when you watch the movie, you get sick of the porn. I mean, if you're not a porno who can not handle it, this is not the movie you can see. But the thing is, the whole movie is not really about porn. Half of the film is about the porn industry, the other half is about character development and the bad situations these characters are going through. The actors played perfectly roles there, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly and William H. Macy. The sex scenes are great, of course, but mainly focus on the hype of the characters in porn movies until it comes to trouble. Excellent movie, one of the best! <br /> <br /> Hedens view: 10/10 **** A +
