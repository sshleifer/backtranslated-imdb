Annie Rooney lives with her officer, her father and her brother Tim in the slums of New York, where she is constantly involved in many fights with the other neighbor's children. Annie secretly has a crush on Joe Kelly (whose little brother Mickey is the head of the gang Annie is constantly battling), who is in a gang waiting for trouble, Officer Rooney says. Kelly is sponsoring a dance where Tony wants to shoot Kelly to take him because he makes him look like an idiot in front of his girl, but Officer Kelly is instead fatally injured. Tim (part of Kelly's gang) is told by Tony and his friend Spider that Kelly shot his father, so he pursues him vengefully. Annie learns this and goes to stop her brother if she comes in time. Very good mix of humor and heart in this movie, even if the plot starts after 40 minutes. Pickford is fun (even though she was 33 years old and a girl played no more than 12-13) and really gets into her character. Haines does not play Kelly as hard as he should, but he can make the audience feel emotional. The scenes in which the official tells Annie about her father's death and the end really have a lump in her throat. The mix of all sorts of kids throughout the movie is fun. Rating, 8.
