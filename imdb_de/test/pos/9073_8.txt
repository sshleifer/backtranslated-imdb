Flatliners left a pretty noticeable impression in my head. The story is fast and always lets you sink in and is often very tense. There are five notable undergraduate physicians (notably Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon), one of whom has developed the mechanism to stay dead (or lay flat) for a few seconds and then be brought back to life. The process is quite "complex" and includes a variety of medical bells and whistles, electric blankets, oxygen masks, and a variety of esoteric medical terms. I strongly suspect that the doctors have coined all these words so they never have to be fired. But oddly enough, they follow the KISS philosophy (original version for engineers: Keep It Simple, Stupid). (Advanced version for physicians: Keep it Stupid, Simple). At the risk of being euthanized by a vengeful doctoral reader, let me continue. <br /> <br /> The first guy who rubs flatly hopes to find the answers to life that philosophy and religion do not convincingly answer. He hopes that it will be answered (and made famous) by applied science. It flutters for about two minutes and then comes back to our world, which is pretty shaken. During death he has a vision of an incident when he was young, leaving the strongest impression in his life. He killed another boy when he was a kid, and he still feels responsible for it. <br /> <br /> With the success of the first flatliner, others follow anyone who extends their flatline time after time to test the limits of how long you can stay dead and live a life after death. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, monsters from the past and the future keep coming back to track them for their Flatline experience. The first flatliner is chased by a young child who tortures him when he is alone. The second, who photographed all the women he put to bed, watches TV sets playing his videos everywhere. The third is followed by a young girl he raised at school. The fourth is persecuted by her suicidal father for whom she feels responsible. Everyone is crazy about these haunting and obsessive things, thinking that the past wants to avenge them. The main focus on flattening is that your entire life goes through your eyes, at the moment of 'dying', no matter what stage, and you usually have the strongest impressions of life in your head. Since they did not die, these strong impressions have somehow reappeared and become the center of their lives. <br /> <br /> Everyone somehow gets on with their former demons (and erases them). Except for the first, who realizes that the only way he can move through life is getting shallow. During this flatline session, he sees himself flat the first time and also sees the boy he killed to kill him this time around. The boy kills him this time for a few minutes and has been seeking revenge. For a few minutes you will wonder if he comes back. Luckily (because most of us like a happy ending) the boy frees him from his past and he can come back to life.
