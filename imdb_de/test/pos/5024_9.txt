An unusual but very enjoyable performance by John Travolta sets off this very funny comedy. His interpretation of the Archangel is a clumsy, female, overweight female man. And he has a fascinating effect on the women he meets on his trip to Chicago. John Hurt is very weak in his role as chief reporter for Chicago tabloid owner Bob Hoskins. Angie MacDowell plays a role, just as she played her role in Four Weddings and a Funeral. Maureen Stapleton is neat in a cameo. Her comment "Michael does not suffer from fools" is just one of many memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only leading artist who does not connect, just off the wall. Mainly you are there to see Michael a bull, to fascinate the waitresses and dancers in a western style restaurant, and to fully prove that he is a perfect soul. It is a memorable comedy worth more than a visit.
