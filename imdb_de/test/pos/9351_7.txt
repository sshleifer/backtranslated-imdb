** SPOILERS ** Based on the novel "The Brick Foxhole" about a gay man who was assassinated by a GI on leave for his sexual orientation. The film "Crossfire" is about a violent anti-Semitic GI that exudes Jewish conviction because of its own failures and frustrations in life. Who he obviously feels threatened. <br /> <br /> He is kept sober in a local gin mill in DC barley. US soldier Montgomrey, Robert Ryan, discovers Joseph Samuel, Sam Leven and begins to become overly sarcastic, friendly with him. It seems that Montgomery was a bit crazy with Samuels because he talks to his best friend and GI buddy Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel also gets through what Neanderthal Montgomery can not do, to the sensitive young GI who is interested in art, he is an artist and painter from outside, about war, the war that just ended. As well as the shaky peace, if that's what happened with the onset of the atomic bomb, it now follows in this very dangerous and unstable world. What really appalled Montgomery more than anything about Samuels is that he is obviously Jewish. This, more than anything else, is reason enough for the racist Montgomery to want to make Samuels into. Samules, Mitchell to herself and his girlfriend Miss. Lewis, Marlow Dwyer, invites to his apartment to have a few drinks and continue the deep and stimulating conversation that they have started at the bar. This has one, it seems, very jealous and feeling hurt and rejected Montgomery along with his equally intoxicated, but somewhat unsuspecting, in what Montgomery's plans for Samuels are. Friend and colleague GI Floyd Bowers, Steve Brodie, will not be invited to Samuels' place later. <br /> <br /> After the party was over, Mitchell and Miss Lewis left, the two very drunken GIs crashed out of the way. The fact that in Montgomery's sick and anti-Semitic mind Samuels had stolen Mitchell from him made him whip into a hot white frenzy. Montgomery and Bowers break into Samuel's house and raid his well-stacked liqueur cabinet, while Montgomery takes some sips against Samuels' strong objection to Samuels very sprawling and refined wines and spirits, which is unlike the watered-down and cheap liquor Montgomery does used to devour. All this soon led to a violent and brutal assault on Samuels by the angry psychotic and drunken Montgomery, Bowers was cold on the sofa of all the alcohol he consumed and beat the poor and innocent man to death. <br /> <br /> The movie "Crossfire" then goes into a lengthy and boring one, as Samuel's killer is obvious from the beginning why Samuels was a wounded and adorned World War II veteran in the Battle of Okinawa Herz got murdered with Montgomery, as if he was really interested, sure to find Samuels' killer, who is actually himself. This so-called voluntary action on the part of Montgomery to refute the suspicion about himself that he might be the man who killed him. <br /> <br /> Montgomery is so ridiculous and even stupid for someone who thinks he is very clever, he keeps opening his big yap and spits out anti-Semitic and racist epitaphs and slurs on the murdered Samuels! That only raises mistrust and no one else. I guess the guy just could not help it. <br /> <br /> It's not enough that Montgomery murdered Samuels, who was one of them in his sick mind. He even murders his friend, who is scared to death because he's involved in Samuel's murder, Bowers! Who in Montgomery's racist mindset is one of "us"! Just because he was afraid that Bowers would talk to the police to save his own suffering neck and put Montgomey in the limelight in Samuel's death. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for the detective to capture the case. Finlay, Robert Young, who has seen through Montgomery's obvious lies and deceptions and then set him up with another GI friend, "GI." Sein Leroy, who was the stumbling block to all the stupid and racist hillbilly jokes, put the arrogant Schleicher down on. As a result, Montgomery returns to the scene where he murdered Bowers, where a trap was set for him. That was all that Capt. Finlay needed to panic Montgomery when Montgomery saw that the device was ready and ran right into the crossfire of a police ambush when he was released in 1947. "Crossfire" dealt with the horrors of anti-Semitism when he was kept under cover by the evils of racism in the US and Europe in almost every post-World War II Hollywood movie. Even after the Second World War and what happened to the Jews in it. If there should have been the very complete and honest exponent who went public in the movie he rightfully deserved.
