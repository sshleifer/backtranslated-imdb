This film is about a group of four friends who ruined a car while driving. They build a campfire to get through the night and wait for help. To pass the time, they tell each other scary stories. To tell about it, the movie would be ruined, so rent and enjoy! I'll say it starts a little slowly, but every story keeps getting better. In this film are some of today's hottest actors, Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Films), James Marsden (Disturbing Behavior) and Ron Livingston (Office Space). So you see, there are big stars, just not the big ones. GO or rent it as soon as possible !! This movie is fantastic !!
