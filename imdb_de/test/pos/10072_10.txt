If you like Madonna or not, this movie is hilarious !! I'm a Madonna fan and saw it at the time of its release in the theater. Over time, however, it has not lost its stupidity and fun. Sure, there are a few bad lines and cheesy acting, but the whole movie is just a screwball comedy, in which Madonna actually carries the whole movie with great bombast. She is cute, funny and the only comedic role of her film career. Madonna normally only plays "herself" in roles, but when she is considered Nikki Finn in this film, she really does look like another person. Of course, the film is filmed by James Foley (who starred with Sean Penn and Christopher Walken in the dramatic and haunting "At Close Range") and co-star Griffin Dunn ("After Hours"), who is also brilliantly cast and enjoys material , The story is not a genius and does not expect a climatic end, but if you ever feel like watching a fun, clean 80's hype or if you're a Madonna fan, then this is a must see. The soundtrack is also very noteworthy and contains 4 Madonna songs: the # 1 hit "Who's That Girl", the # 2 hit "Causing A Commotion" and the beautiful and one of their best ballads "The Look of Love" (Top 10 hit in the UK) and "Can not Stop", a pop-rest from last year's "True BLue" sessions, available only on VHS and soon to be released on DVD.
