King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) of Romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing but to live in peace and harmony with humanity. But his son Radu (Anders Hove) is a cruel creature in his heart (which is pretty obvious as soon as you see him). Three students have come to study native folklore, but at the wrong time are drawn into the legends of the vampires: Vladislav was killed. Who can say something bad about a movie with a Cameo by Angus Scrimm I can not I had some low expectations after seeing other Full Moon pictures (especially "Puppet Master" and "Demonic Toys"). But despite the demons' really bad animated effects, this movie was really well done and fun to watch. Lots of blood, a good plot and backstory (the Bloodstone story was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new aspects of the vampire myth that you think are already dead. (Maybe I'm wrong, but this is probably the first movie in which rosary balls are fired from a weapon.) Apart from vampires and blood, you get some nakedness (gratuitous, but welcome), and I had to notice the outstanding score of the Composers (not sure who deserves merit, but among those involved are Stuart Brotman, Richard Kosinsky, William Levine, Michael Portis and John Zeretzka). This is horror 101 all the way. Heck, you even get two sequels, which is the sign of a real horror movie. (Of course, there are also some bad movies sequels - did I mention "Puppet Master"?) The Romanian theme was well done, and the film even seems to have been made by Romanians, if I judge their origin correctly. And the score - the music - really struck me as a nice change, very atmospheric. I like Richard Band, but I am glad that another composer got a shot because he nailed the atmosphere upside down. If you like vampire movies and want a light change (one of the Eastern European varieties), this is worth seeing.
