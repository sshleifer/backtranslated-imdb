It opens with your overly long ship flying through space. All I could think at the time was "spaceballs" and hoped there would be a sticker on the back saying "we're breaking for no one". The film then shows some cryogenic freezers with Vin Diesels tale. I've always thought his voice sounded cool since I saw Fast and the Furious. When I found out he was a criminal, I thought the movie was cliché. It was. It was very clichéd and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. Black every 22 years. Luckily, they land on this day. Aliens can only be in the dark, hey, it's a solar eclipse. As much as I thought it was too simple and just a cliché, the movie pulled through and kicked Major @ss. I even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after I saw it. I really can not wait for Chronicles of Riddick.
