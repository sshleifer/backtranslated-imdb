A story about a little boy, Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) with AIDS, who befriends his opposite with a rough and staggering boy (played by Brad Renfro) With his heart in the right place. For this fact alone, this is a recommended view. The highlight could be when they just watch how they find friendship and deal with each other when nobody accepts them. <br /> <br /> However, since the real story focuses on the boy's AIDS problem, one thing is clearing up, when one day at the local supermarket, Dexter looks down at a tabloid magazine stating that there is a Doctor from New Orleans has discovered the cure. Both, obviously a bit naive, make it a plan to travel to New Orleans wherever possible. Which somehow pulled me in two directions. It's a mite heartbeat, and I hate to do nicks, but I found the plot in a melodramatic, predictable sense, and the acts have a touch of glamor that only movies can. I could not escape the slow idea that I saw a road trip movie about self-discovery, illness and growing up. For example, I know they are young, but I think it's a real job to believe in the things these guys do. Like drinking tree leaves and drinking hot tea, or eating an experimental diet with chocolate bars, because they think they will fight the devastating disease. Not to mention those who travel all over the country because they have no legal or even uncanny consequences. Apart from the concerns, these film conventions you expect are a story that can be seen especially in the family.
