I have mixed feelings about this film, especially compared to its predecessor, "An American Werewolf in London." This movie had fun moments, it was still more horror story than anything else. This updated version, now playing in Paris, does not have that "edge" at all and just is not in the same class .... but there are some good things the first movie could not offer at all It's still fun to watch , <br /> <br /> So, apart from "werewolf purists", most of whom think this film is rubbish compared to the London version, I still give decent grades, as I do not care what others think. I liked it, although I agree that "London" is better and I also prefer this version. <br /> <br /> The first 30-40 minutes of this movie are played exclusively to laugh, including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in a restaurant. It also introduces the main female character played by Julie Delpy. I do not see enough of this actress. She does not seem to make that many movies, or the least I hear here in America. This French actress has a face that is of classic beauty, so the movie got points because he brought her and she looks great. <br /> <br /> When the horror starts it can get weird and the special effects are good. I also liked the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first: no f-words and no lord's name in vain - amazing! <br /> <br /> However, there are many sexual remarks and there is a scene with a man who ran out of a bar tied to a cross that was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal, which is not attractive to a middle-aged man like me. This film is more geared towards 20 year olds, if that helps everyone. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining ... just do not expect it to live up to the first movie.
