Documentary films in which sons and daughters want to understand parents and their own lives are not uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that represent a lack of talent, a failure of self-observation, an abundance of narcissism, and possibly an unrelenting pursuit of publicly-injected revenge for countless past, real, and fantasized injuries. Unusual is a brilliant, fair and captivating portrait of a fascinating parent and "My Architect: The Journey of a Son" is this rare accomplishment. Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparable and brutally drawn by an accident. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia, where the talented boy loved art and music. Soon he was in love with buildings and decided that only the career of an architect would answer his creative abilities. <br /> <br /> Kahn became an architect, but as this movie shows, it took a long time to catch the attention of the leaders in his house. An architect suspects that he was a victim of the "yellow armband," anti-Semitism, which, in addition to prejudice against women, has long been an unsightly aspect of the American architectural profession. He gained notoriety. He was clearly seen as a confident workaholic prophet who challenged relentless demands that his vision and only his vision should be realized. This inflexibility was the reason why, while he made wonderful plans for many buildings, only a few built. The interview with an old gentleman who dismissed Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a converted downtown where people have left their cars on the perimeter and walked into town is funny. <br /> <br /> Kahn was a born teacher and some of the extensive archive footage shows him with students, his voice is calm but passionate, their looks are respectful and intense. Many architects were interviewed by director, author and project contributor Nathaniel Kahn, the only architect, son. Some are world famous - I.M. Pei, Robert A.M. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry and still-active non-nationalist Philip Johnson. Her comments show a vivid picture of this idealistic, but ultimately financially unsuccessful, planner of buildings that blended the castles, fortresses, and grand buildings of past centuries into contemporary designs. Kahn's buildings are shown. Among the most impressive are the Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla, CA. For me, his style has a neo-romantic atmosphere, muffled by too many blank spaces that repel rather than attract human interaction. <br /> <br /> But Kahn's son was more than just the story of his father, the architect. Louis Kahn had three families for many years: a wife with whom he had a daughter, and two long-term relationships, one of which produced a daughter and the other the son. Kahn often visited his son at the mother's house, but at the end of an evening, mother and son Kahn drove back to the house of marriage. Clearly, Nathaniel wanted to know something about these unusual relationships, but he does not seem to have been drawing a stranger's affair for a little boy. <br /> <br /> When Nathaniel was a small boy, Louis Kahn died of a serious heart attack in New York's Pennsylvania Station men's room after returning from India where he had launched one of his massive projects, one of which, that never existed. By this time, his Philadelphia-owned company had at least $ 500,000 in debt, and if he had made a trip to federal bankruptcy, Kahn was probably on the rise. <br /> <br /> Kahn left behind several monumental structures, of which the government building in Bangladesh is clearly the largest. A weeping architect greets Kahn for creating a building where democracy can flourish (and hopefully flourish). Another architect, Mosche Safdie, believes that something akin to Kahn's life might have been the station because of his never-ending cosmopolitan life. I disagree: it is ironic that Kahn dies in the faceless replacement of one of America's true architectural gems, the old Pennsylvania Station, which has made way for a sterile replacement with no character and no continuation of the Civil Memory. <br /> <There are a number of emotional moments filmed during the younger Kahn's journey, including his half-sisters and his mother, but they are sincere and moving, not maudlin and staged. Architectural historians will always study Kahn. His son found reasons to remember him as a flawed, but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
