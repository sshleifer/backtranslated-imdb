I've waited nearly 25 years for this horror thriller to be hard to find, and I've finally made it since it's been a proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it did not have the same impact on me as if I had seen it in the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film "Squirm" is excellent) takes good advantage of the scenic location in Oregon and takes time to develop the characters, not only to send them in a creative way. Remarkably, the whistling music of Brad Fiedel is truly scary and contributes to the desolate process. A must if you like underrated horror movies. To describe it, it would be an intelligent "Friday the 13th" sprinkled with some tasty portions of "liberation". Apart from that, there are some really cool and original moments like my favorite, when a couple is swimming in a lake and the guy disappears under water to play a trick with his girl - just when you think it's the usual fear, look they suddenly go to the coast and ... I honestly can not spoil it - you just have to watch it yourself. Also, the end is just one of those you just have to see to believe? it came out of nowhere and it's weird and wild! The DVD contains a commentary by Lieberman.
