Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde. <br /> <br /> Michael McGuire was the father. <br /> <br /> Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon. <br /> <br /> Have you ever seen this movie? ? I doubt it! <br /> <br /> Blankfield was quite popular at the time because he played Pill Doctor on Fridays. Thomerson was funny in everything he does, from feature films to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD, I will definitely buy it. I recorded this '82 movie from HBO and pretty much worn it out. One of the funniest topics of the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever. <br /> <br /> Of course. With all the cocaine references in this film, it would be too politically incorrect today, as well as Cheech and Chong. A pity, because it's FUN, FUN, FUN!
