Nynke is a classic film in the same style as the Oscar-winning film Character (1997). But this comparison immediately prompts me to add that the latter was more exciting ... <br /> <br /> Of course, Nynke is a beautiful historical & costume drama (with fantastic acting by Monic Hendrickx!) In which you Witnessed personal growth of 'Nynke van Hichtum' in her marriage to Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitle of this movie is "a love story". That's how it starts and ends with her marriage. <br /> <br /> But here the director makes a crucial mistake! Nynke's exciting, independent life began with the end of the marriage. She wrote several children's books and traveled around the world. What a great life she lived. But Pieter Verhoeff puts Nynke back in the grip of the convention that has depressed her and out of her struggles: the thought that her life only extended her marriage to Troelstra because she was none other than the mother of her children /> Let us all hope for Nynke II!
