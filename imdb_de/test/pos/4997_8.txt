In the IMDb there was some sharp criticism of Comanche Moon. I think that has three reasons. First, purists are disappointed that the mini-series is not exactly like the book. Second, it's not as good as the original Lonesome Dove. After all, people like to complain about IMDb and the greatest movies in the world will have bad comments. <br /> <br /> I want to say that no movie will be as good as the book. That's the way it is. Lonesome Dove was not as good as the novel he's based on. In addition, the film by Lonesome Dove had left out some things and was reorganized. That's just how it will be, with a movie adaptation of everything. So it's a vain argument to look at Comanche Moon. <br /> <br /> I agree that it is not as good as the original pigeon. But nothing is. I know people who live their lives according to the teachings they have learned from the dove. If I wanted to compare every book I read, the movie I saw, and the TV I watched Lonesome Dove; I would be constantly unhappy. <br /> <br /> This is a TV mini-series series based on a prequel by Lonesome Dave (the novel) and the sequel to Dead Man's Walk. It's the best TV I've seen in years. It's fun to tune in to Lonesome Dove. We get to know the story of the rangers we met and loved in Dove. Zahn is doing a fantastic job in restoring Gus McCrae. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (sp?) Also do great jobs creating characters that help fill the past of Ranger and Newt. <br /> <br /> If / when it comes back, I promise you that you will enjoy it more than a freaky reality show.
