cool strip. nice to look at. I hope to see more of Fred Carpenter soon. I like the location with all the New York references. It was interesting how everything developed in the end. The suspense factor was effective and the spectacle, while kept simple, was also effective for the portrayal of the characters. In this movie, there are some nice little tricks that make it even better. I think that the supporting actress has done a good job in her role. the casting and direction in this film seem to be stitched together seamlessly and the quality of the footage is impressive. The film is also not without soft moments, which gives it a nice balance.
