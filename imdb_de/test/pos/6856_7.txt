For me, "Anatomy" is certainly one of the better films I've seen. I do not think that "anatomy" was meant primarily as a horror film, but as a film that questions the ethics of science. If you look at it with this thought, it becomes a really good movie. The only annoying thing was the terrible dubbing of the English version. How can you expect a non-German to listen to these unbearable German accents for two hours? Let the native English speakers speak or use subtitles instead !!
