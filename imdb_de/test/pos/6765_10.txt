This is actually a brilliant movie. The story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. Especially the performance of Mads Mikkelsen as Svend is great. It's a simple story about two guys who feel the urge to do it on their own, but it turns into a strange and absurd story, with many people accidentally killed and served as chicken steaks. If only more people understand Danish ... This could be a good candidate for an English version. Noteworthy is also Ole Thestrup, who always brings with his slightly crazy character Holger an extra momentum into the story. I can only recommend this film to the Danish audience. Also check out Adams Ã†bler (2005), a film by Anders Thomas Jensen, also starring Mads Mikkelsen, accompanied by a well-played Ulrich Thomsen.
