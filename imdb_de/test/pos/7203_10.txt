I loved this movie, the audience that I belonged to love this movie, and the little 7 year old girl who was with me loved this movie. We all laughed at the puns, the visual humor and the good feeling with which you left the cinema when it ended. I could easily see why it was such a big box-office success in France. I plan to buy the DVD so I can see it again and laugh at what I missed when I first laughed so hard.
