This is really the only chance to bring the magic of James Joyce's writing to life. His novels are all (in the truest sense of the word) not filmable, and this is the only long story he wrote. It was John Huston's last film that reached the screen only after his death, and it's easy to see how great he is. The Dead is poetic on screen and tells us more about Ireland than any modern movie about the IRA and "The Troubles" could ever tell us. Hopefully, more people will watch this movie to see the best of John Huston and James Joyce, and you may visit this story at your local bookstore (and discover that this is probably the biggest short story ever written on paper ).
