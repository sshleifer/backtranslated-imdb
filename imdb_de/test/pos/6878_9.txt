"House Calls" is a wonderful romantic comedy best described as "how she made it". It is Walter Matthau (in one of his best roles) as a recently widowed doctor who goes back into the dating scene and beats paydirt, as he seems to have a different woman every night. Then he meets hospital patient Glenda Jackson and soon develops a relationship with her. But it is one who is rigorously tested when she tells him that she is a one-man woman and expects him to be a one-man man. <br /> <br /> This is a cute, very funny movie, in which Art Carney is also seen as an actress senile hospital administrator and Richard Benjamin as a friend and fellow physician of Matthau. It's a must for any Matthau fan or fan of light comedy. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
