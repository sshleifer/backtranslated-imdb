This film, a former William Wellman, has just today an important message. It is believed that sometimes things are more important than your personal safety or well-being. The film, starring Walter Huston, is stolen by the performance of "Chic" Sales as Grampa. He is the most drawn character in the film and a pleasure to see. You know some familiar faces when you watch a lot of films from the 20s and 30s. What time to look if you get the chance. Recommended.
