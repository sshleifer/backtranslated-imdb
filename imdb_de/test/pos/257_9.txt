I saw this movie at a local festival, the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida. What a nice movie. A simple, uncomplicated morality that a young, carefree young man must take responsibility for his actions. It was neither pretentious nor intrusive that my two teenage daughters loved it, and for a change, I was not embarrassed by the content or language of the movie. A real family movie and the best British comedy movie I've seen since Billy Elliot. The film did not surprisingly win the best festival awards from Best Film and Best Director. Ten out of ten.
