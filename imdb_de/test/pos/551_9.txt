Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play each other out like a symphony in this story about a young girl who is condemned to life as the daughter of one of the craziest women you'll ever meet. Sarandon has this ability to call talent, if you like, to play some of the most unusual characters and bring her humanity to the top of every movie she does. As the mother of this obviously brilliant girl, far beyond her young girl, Sarandon alternates between mother and child with the ease of a ballet dancer. More importantly, she does it with power and flicker, without stepping Portman's portrayal of the daughter in all directions. The question is always asked when we deconstruct the film presentation. Who changes? This movie is certainly about the daughter, but if you look closely at the dreams and sacrifices that make Mama understand that she is changing with her daughter. I am willing to bet that this will change us all in the audience as well. The trademark of fine drama
