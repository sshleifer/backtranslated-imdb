The Closer She Gets ... is an elaborate documentary that deals with the death of someone I actually knew. It provides an insight into the private moments of the family involved in the most difficult time of their lives. Parents tend to support their children's work, in which case the subject of the documentation went beyond that. She was ready to share her death experience as a love affair for her son. It is a very moving piece of art that defines the serious, quiet, and easy sides of life for this family. History is one that can make you laugh, but also weep, because it addresses issues that we all face. I recommend this documentary to those who are not afraid to cry, and I am prepared to treat the issue of mortality in a very human way. This movie will touch you.
