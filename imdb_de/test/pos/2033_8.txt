I have to admit that I did not expect much in this movie. I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did. The script was not Oscar material, but it was not terrible either. The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great supporting role and looked pretty as always. What this movie did for me was the music. If you do not like 80s glam metal or hair bands, you probably will not like this movie. It's about being a rock star. Some clich√©s were present, but did not bring down the movie at all. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Rock'n'Roll and do not forget to get up and scream !!! 8 out of 10 for great plays and great music. <br /> <br /> Jason
