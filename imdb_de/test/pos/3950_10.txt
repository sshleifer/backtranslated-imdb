I can not get this streak from my brain. It's definitely something different than anything out there. I've seen a lot of movies over the holidays, and while some are okay, nothing has shaken my world as much as BlindSpot. It's just cool about the actors and how they put the movie together. It's like some really scary stuff mixed with a pretty funny black humor. Franco is great, but the older, rough guy steals the show in a few scenes, as if he's beating the boy in the muck. I guess some politically correct people will not appreciate the atmosphere (do not bring your grandma), but it's absolutely fantastic. The best is the Kaliedescope style. There are some really serious things mixed with very interesting shots of the road. The movie really makes you sad and scared, but he also turns his head to what happens and how he is filmed. WTF has grown in the world? So many critics rave about all the supposedly revolutionary groundbreaking films, and when you see them, they're boring and predictable and not everything. I do not understand it, because there are many other better choices. Blind Spot is really great because it gives you thrills and chills and the up-and-coming star power, but it does it in a totally fresh and totally radical way.
