Lucio Fulci was one of Italy's most prolific directors until his death in 1996, but his career had long since plunged into a downward spiral of increasingly pointless genre entries that could barely stand in the shadow of his previous work. From the 70s to the mid-1980s, he had released stylistically distinctive horror scenes such as "City of the Living Dead," "The Beyond," and the brutal giallo "The New York Ripper." Fans like to remember myself. And while "Cat in the Brain" goes hand in hand with Fulci's decay as a filmmaker, it's a shocking, grim fun that, while a significantly lower quality work (framing, effects, and acting are below average) proves to be interesting, open meditation on pop Psychology and desensitizing ability of the film. Make no mistake: "Cat in the Brain" is a total gorefest and as incoherent as the previous films of Fulci. However, it deserves the merit of being something more. Fulci plays herself with a delicious, tongue-in-cheek note: a director who is filming another violent horror film that is falling to the ground with perverse / murderous hallucinations; After visiting a shrinker who hypnotizes him, his dreams and reality begin to overlap until the viewer can not recognize them. Grindhouse Releasing's recent DVD mentions "Cat" as an heir apparently perceived by "Eraserhead" and carries a similarly disquieting, awkwardly comical quality with the finest surrealist art.
