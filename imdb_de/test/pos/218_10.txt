I remember for the first time that Zaniness from the brothers Zucker and Jim Abrahams, who were in Comedy Central at the beginning. Back in the 90's, their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with bearded host. <br /> <br /> Capt. Frank Drebin (played by Leslie Nielson, the disfigured stiff-faced movie-bust) is a process that first spawned famous police TV shows and scenarios from the amalgamation of various stereotypical protagonists of police television shows (such as Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch's show). This is distilled three times to produce the purest policeman. Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now, save it for later). Frank Drebin is mostly ignorant, a terrible driver, a terrible shot, macho, but empathetic and vulnerable. He is a master of police investigation methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy). That does not make him a bad cop. Cops are also lucky. Capt. Drebin (note he's a captain here) perfected it. Together with his partner Nordberg and the rest of the violence, he parodies the police drama perfectly during 6 golden episodes. <br /> <br /> The show is a treasure trove of witty dialogues and quotable quotes. Most visual gags are a bit dated and stupid. The magic, however, never came from the visual gags. The focus was on a nonsensical and straightforward conversation and activities in the foreground, in the background crazy things. The films are best described as 90-minute compilations of the best gags in this series. Think of Monty Python's and now for something completely different ..... <br /> <br /> If you like Aircraft 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3 or Top Secret, you'll definitely enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I've always liked the show better than the movies, even though I first saw the movies. Why? 2 words: No O.J.
