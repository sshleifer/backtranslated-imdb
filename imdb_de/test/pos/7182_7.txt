Cleopatra (the delicious Monica Bellucci) is challenged by Cesar (Alain Chabat): To prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, she promises to build a fancy castle for Cesar without delay within three months. She calls the one arm architect Numerobis (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives him two options: if he accomplishes his mission, he is covered in gold, or if he fails to become a crocodile. Numerobis asks for help from Panoramix, Asterix and Obelix with Ideiafix. This movie is very funny, especially the parts featuring Obelix and the Red Beard pirates. However, the scriptwriter and the director should have noticed that French is not a universal language like English. Therefore, words jokes (such as in Austin Powers movies) do not work well for people unfamiliar with the French language. French people and people who speak fluent French will certainly like these jokes, but for me who do not speak French, it makes no sense. My voice is seven.
