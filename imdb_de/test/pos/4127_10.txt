This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance in the house. It's a very positive and happy kind of music. The movie has some sad parts, but especially the music makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly continued, though his pastor, parents, and Nashville record producer said no. Buddy Holly did not give up what he liked. I did not know much about Buddy Holly until I saw this movie. I was in the Surf Ballroom where he last played, but I did not pay much attention to him until I saw this movie. It's an incredible fun-filled movie, so get up and imagine this movie.
