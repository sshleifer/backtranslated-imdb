Each time the supposed explorers and we, the public, are, for some ungodly reason, enabled to spotlight one of the wonderful new worlds for the first time, the filmmakers decided on an "emergency" or a false alarm or to distract an artificial drama tension. <br /> <br /> So instead of enjoying the surface of Io quietly, standing above the rings of Saturn, or focusing on the magic of flying a comet or asteroid, we are distracted, looking after wellbeing and survival to worry about the characters. Big disappointment !!!! <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem to be unsure what they want. A documentary about the natural wonders of our solar system or an exciting thriller, in which the viewer cares more about the characters than about the theme. Come on. <br /> <br /> Hello. If I wanted excitement and tension, I would see a real sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a documentary drama. But the characters and their survival here (the risks of such a mission - should be subordinate to the subject). Waiting. Yes, the risks of such a mission are an important part of the issue - since it is essentially a movie about a space mission, not just about the solar system. However, it was distracted and distracted by the discovery of new worlds that we were supposed to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the film was notable because it gave the human elements of a space mission, the quarrels, the tensions, the weight of responsibility, the almost deadly mistakes, the victims, etc. a very realistic feeling very well fit into the hard sci-fi subgenre - in fact it would be one of the best, because science was almost closely followed. <br /> <br /> But the distractions were terrible. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I have missed showing the effects of space on the astronauts after landing on Earth. Not either
