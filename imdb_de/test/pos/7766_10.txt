I try to be diverse in my films. I can easily get into "Pride and Prejudice" as I come in "Vanishing Acts." Love Jones is my favorite of all time, it is the standard by which I judge every Modern Urban Romantic Comedy. Well recorded, the shot of Nia and Darius riding the Lakeshore Drive on the bike is one of the classic 3 second movie shots of all time. Of course nobody will remember it. When it came out, I thought it was a new paradigm for Modern Urban Film, good actors, no weapons, and so on. The film industry has disappointed me to some degree. You will occasionally get a Drumline or Roll Bounce or Tyler Perry's "Why did I get married". Whenever I have to see "my people" on the screen in a very professional and stylish way, I come to Love Jones. There is no best movie ever made for many people and opinions for it. But it's my personal best. My favorite line from Love Jones "Baby, I just want to come and talk !!"
