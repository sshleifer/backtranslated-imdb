Chris Nolan's maze like Noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish. A first movie is as complex as "Memento" or "The Prestige," though perhaps more difficult to handle. Nevertheless, it smells of originality and creative drive and has a "twist" that is both intellectual and realistic. Few filmmakers have used their editors as well as possible for Nolan's story. The story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street until he follows someone whose attention he has noticed, and then follows him, from where complexity increases and identity begins to re-establish itself organize. More naturalistic and realistic than Nolan's later work, but equally razor-sharp.
