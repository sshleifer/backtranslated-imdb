I really enjoyed this movie. I have a real sense of justice and an eye for an eye, and this movie brings that up. Glenn Ford is being offered by the big rancher in the valley for his ranch for a very low price; then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot "to help him decide to sell". When the ranch hand dies and the sheriff does not want to do anything, Ford initially seems reluctant to do anything and warns his men not to take matters into their own hands. But that's exactly what he's doing right now. I knew this movie was about to hit the fire as he walked into the saloon and confronted the guy (Richard Jaeckel, one of my favorite characters, who is his worst character) who had killed his ranch hand; after a gentle exchange with him, Glenn strikes Ford and shoots him. Something decent, but a bit more fairness, he kills this guy with the gun that belonged to his murdered cow dealer. In a short time, we get Ford razing his ranch so that his men are allowed to raid the crew of the other ranch. then Ford and his men knocked down all the horses and cattle of the big bad guy's ranch; then they turn up and burn the outbuildings and the big, chic house to the ground. Talk about whether you'll be great, too. Lots of action in this movie. There is more in the story than this, but I only recommend watching the movie. Glenn Ford was someone who has shown time and time again what can happen if someone misjudges someone, and I've really enjoyed watching him get old-fashioned justice.
