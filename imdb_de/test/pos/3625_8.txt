If you have never experienced anything of Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu Zinger! In 1933, Mae Questel Pitts drew voice for the character Olive Oyl for the animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye by the Fleischer Studios. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) makes her best "Olive Oyl" personalization, walks around, whines and rings her hands or ties herself to the cops. I've always waited for her to say "ohhh myyyy," but instead, "someone always happens to something." When I saw this movie for the first time, I loved Zasu and found her character really funny. I've seen her in other films since then, doing the same weird, sincere, fragile flower routine. After watching this movie again, I started to get annoyed with the constant whining and hysteria near a piece of dust. But there are a few funny comedy pieces and it's also a mystery movie. It's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works. The mysterious plot goes well together through the camp of Zasu Pitts and James Gleason, who plays the cop Arthur Crimmer. The haunted house is fun with many secret passages and even a skeleton in the attic! Worth the clock. For more public domain movie reviews, visit: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
