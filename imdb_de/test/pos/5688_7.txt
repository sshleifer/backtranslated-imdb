I had never heard of this Australian horror before Michael Elliott had received his enthusiastic review. After reading it, I decided to check if the DVD was available at my local sales outlet (in a German edition, ie without the R1 extras). Therefore, I decided to try the movie right away. <br /> <br /> While I would not go so far as to give full marks? Only a few titles, they get from me, let alone an obscure modern strip? I have to say that I was quite impressed with BLACK WATER. Instead of looking back to earlier crocodile films such as ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1999), it recalls two, in which a small group of people were seen, who went on a journey, lost their way and were at the mercy of the elements and the creatures that inhabit the place? LONG WEEKEND (1978), itself a neglected but impressive Australian production, and OPEN WATER (2005). The compact, single-plotted movie features a couple and the woman's younger sister opting for angling in a remote and forbidden part of the Australian wilderness, known as a crocodile area; very soon (in fact, before even 15 minutes have passed!), has your boat capsized and the guide killed by an alligator? so our hapless adventurers are looking for a tree. The DVD Talk Reviewer believes that the movie spends too much time at this one location? The three of them are arguing over what to do, trying to retrieve the boat, finding a way out of the jungle through the trees (only hitting water), and the monster's occasional attack. However, I think that the creators of the situation go as far as it goes, without getting bored: This is due to the noticeable tension and, as Michael said, the credibility of the characters (especially the two women), but also the fact that the crocodile is responsible for one of the scariest and most memorable events of recent times (I wonder how it was made to play it)! <br /> <br /> I also agree with Mike that the film contains some really powerful shocking moments. the alligator jumped out of the water and bit off the petrified heroes; His head suddenly appears in front of the women as they head for the boat. Although one of them reaches the vehicle, the monster manages to lift his enormous weight and get on board with him! Towards the end, when the same girl can find a weapon (on the mutilated body of her leader), she charges herself and lurks for the alligator to appear. The latter sneaks up behind her (coincidentally, the creature is given the shrewdness of the shark in JAWS [1975]). Against this backdrop, the finale is just as popular (albeit on an apparently smaller scale) as that of the classic Spielberg blockbuster. Even if it has a downbeat follow-up. Another important advantage is the sparse score of the film. This is generally pretty, but gets nervous at the right times. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, BLACK WATER appears like a breath of fresh air in the face of the demoralizing slump in the horror movie has fallen lately; For this reason alone, does it deserve more attention to remind us that there is still hope for our beloved genre (without the need to resort to the gimmicks of a CLOVERFIELD [2008] to attract attention)?
