I have enjoyed this movie since I saw it for the first time in the theater. Some movies have a set of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters show some truths about how to get the most out of people, work together harmoniously, build a team, and achieve goals without ever preaching morality. The situations are well designed and in line with the opening requirement of the film. The tension builds up well and the humor is consistently clean and constant. The movie manages to get me straight to the root for the characters and laugh all the way over. This is a feel-good movie that is as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> What astonishes me is that a movie that seems so easy can be entertaining in the long term. The music is a perfect copy of the music in the typical post-war marine films that help to create humor and to point out that size is in the eye of the beholder. The scenes in the credits are a great music video from "In the Navy," which deserves its own full-screen special feature. The scenes and cuts are well done, and the casting and acting is just right. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic, just about anyone who has ever been made without any pretensions. In fact, the lack of presumption makes it so much fun to watch. I love these guys and gal. <br /> <br /> Recently I thought about the movie and wondered if it was available on DVD. The luck has come, and the DVD was released in May 2004. I went to the store and grabbed a copy. Then my wife and I enjoyed another fun night in front of the big screen. I rated this movie as 10 because it meets at all levels, much better than many high-budget movies and Oscar winners. This is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Listen to the Fox home video: You have a great movie in your vault, and it's a shame to find a cheap DVD with badly deteriorated hues just 8 years after it was released. So why not restore the colors and present the movie as it should be seen? I would like to pay a few dollars more to get the picture right. I am grateful to have my own copy. Now let us have the eye candy that the movie deserves, and how you can restore the credit sequence as a special video for music videos in full-screen mode.
