Stephane Audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small Danish community at the end of the last century. Two beautiful and musically gifted sisters give up their own prospects for happiness and marriage to take care of their aging father. One day a French girl, Babette, comes to work for her. After a few years, she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her. Their solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous celebration that changes the lives of all invited guests. This is a film about human and cultural interaction, reflected in the changing language of the Danish-French dialogue, and especially between the dutiful sobriety of Protestant Northern Europe and the sensuality of the Catholic South. It is also about human needs and how warmth and friendliness can be expressed and stimulated by the cultivation of the senses. A deeply uplifting movie.
