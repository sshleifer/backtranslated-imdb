The Brighton has a traumatic drama in her family's chest: twenty-year-old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) has fallen behind due to a fall when she was one, and her over-protective mother Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan) is making her careless responsible . Seventeen-year-old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Her father, Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives with his train and rail models in the basement. Evie sabotages Evie's rejection of interviews for various universities, and teaches Emily her own poetry. When Martha hears Emily repeating the poems, she takes notes and shows them to English teacher Stewart Worthy (Christopher Lloyd), who believes that Emily had a moment of genius. When Evie's only friend James (Fran Kranz) reads the notes, he immediately reveals the truth about the authority of the poems. But when Martha realizes this, she finds the reality of Evie and triggers a series of revelations. <br /> <br /> "Admissions" is a very powerful drama about needy and guilty feelings. The performances are stunning and this is the first work of Lauren Ambrose from "Six Feet Under" that I see and she is amazing. This independent film is an excellent choice for audiences looking for a refreshing story based on acting. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cumplicidade" ("Complicity")
