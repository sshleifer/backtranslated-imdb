This is a charming movie, to say the least. The main character Fanda is an old man who refuses to be one of the living dead that surrounded him. He and his accomplice do tricks and get into trouble all over the city. Meanwhile, his family is in suspense, what to do with him. From there you can see how Fanda's relationship with his wife, best friend and son develops. It eventually leads to one of the best movie endings I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are rich and deep. They develop well in the course of the film. The movie has a whole lot of moods. It goes from bright and funny to grim and dark. All the slow parts in this movie will be made good in the end. <br /> <br /> Autumn Spring carries a message similar to many other European films - do not miss the small pleasures in life. If you enjoyed Amelie, The Eighth Day, or Life's Nice (all the good movies, by the way), you'll probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
