Unfortunately, if Family Guy offends you or you just do not get humor, this show is making fun of you and the masses of overly religious, boring, and politically correct people in America. So put aside your morals and have fun with this show. FG is a fun entry into the reality of today's society. Who says that this show is for a young, not yet mature audience, is very wrong. With all the references to old films and politics 10-80 years ago, I could not imagine that a young immature child would find it funny. Family Guy is definitely for a mature, open-minded audience that is not afraid to criticize American society. Hats off to Seth and the whole crew who were able to do this show.
