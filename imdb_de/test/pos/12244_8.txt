I loved this movie when I saw it for the first time. As detailed as news executives will do, just to air a story: Jane kisses Kenny to finish the piece to finish, and then Joan Cusack tries to find William and William Hurt, who, according to Jane, committed an incredible ethical violation, tears his tears during his rape-rape interview, a mistake that Aaron draws attention to. Another highlight is when Tom uses Jane to his own advantage and then turns around and sleeps with Jennifer. The script is brilliant and the director is almost as good. All three leading actors were great at portraying their characters, especially Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, who is the funniest in the movie. William Hurt is also very good. This earned at least three Oscars, best actress (Holly JÃ¤ger), best supporting actor (Albert Brooks) and best picture. I liked the last parts of the movie where they are reunited 7 years later. <br /> <br /> 8/10
