Here is a movie full of adventure, determination, heroism and bravery. Moreover, it is settled in the late 1800's, which makes it even more interesting. It's a wonderful, adventurous plot, and Alyssa Milano plays wonderfully the healthy, confident and meaningless Fizzy ... a great role model. This is one of my favorite movies. It is a film that has to be seen time and time again and will undoubtedly inspire you and enrich your life. The plot is not only outstanding, the film also has a fantastic backdrop and music and is wonderfully staged. This movie is as good as gold!
