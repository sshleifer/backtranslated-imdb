Jordan leads us into criminal criminality in Sydney, Australia after 19-year-old Jimmy's (Heath Ledger) desperate attempt to bundle a job for a local gangster and make changes before joining him. The gangsters (led by Bryan Brown) are a menacing bunch with a humorous track. That's what makes the movie work, because we always see gangsters as a rough bunch that makes you sick. But this mob also tickles your funny bone. A neatly structured script from Jordan has characters that cross paths and get stuck in the web plot.
