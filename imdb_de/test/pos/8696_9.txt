So many early British sound films that I've seen on video either suffer from poor print quality or poor sound or both. Fortunately, I was able to get a copy of this film in a video of excellent quality so I could focus on the story itself. <br /> <br /> And it was an excellent story. At first glance, the passengers on the ill-fated bus looked pretty boring (apart from the always-fond Jessie Matthews). When the film showed the story of each passenger the day before the accident, I discovered that the cast, contrary to the first appearance, was a talented group of performers who were skilfully guided to give their distinctive characteristics a true individuality to lend . <br /> <br /> Viewers may have different preferences about which two passengers will end tragically and which will survive. But the movie arouses your interest because it lets you guess. This movie deserves a much wider audience - a true gem of early British cinema.
