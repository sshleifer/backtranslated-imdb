When referring to independent cinema in the United States, it is often assumed that the filmmaker or the people behind the project had much more creative freedom and did what they wanted. This is not always the case these days, unless someone is a solid "Auteur" and the creative freedom still has the disadvantage of having to be driven out to one of the independent departments of the big studios or somehow for some kind of thing must be picked up by low-level deal at a worthwhile film festival. But Putney Swope, Robert Downey Sr's film about a hard-nosed African American who was inadvertently promoted to chief production guru, is * an independent cinema, a kind of work that worked well with like-minded people or the Romero night The Living Dead and Cassavetes Faces at the same time, that they do not get a typical studio distribution, but waves, beat ass and names in the cinema world. For all its moments, which are crude and raw, it is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It is also a movie that is funny, very and torturously funny. Sometimes the sense of humor is so ridiculous that it's almost impossible not to laugh, from the mere presence of President Mimeo with his wife to the lines of dialogue in the commercials that put Swope's team together like "I can not eat air conditioning" real "soul" voice. It's as smart as the audience that aspires, that is, anyone who has two brain cells that can see that this work is not offensive or * too * shocking to rattle the cage, and that makes them pretty good in the first five minutes. Once that's over, Downey Sr goes as far as a filmmaker who has nothing to lose: his protagonist is part of Fidel Castro, part of Isaac Hayes around 1972 (and yes, it's 1969 in the movie) and part hard-core Ad Exec with a shootout to make Mr. Spacely look good on the Jetsons. And do not forget these minor characters, dear God. <br /> <br /> There are so many memorable lines and moments that it's hard to keep track. From perhaps the weirdest failed assassination attempt in any movie to an advertisement for "face-off" skin cream, which contains lines that would lend money to South Park for its filthy mouth, to a small part of Jack Hill's films Muslim, who always keeps Swope's lips, and a boy with the nun, who insults a storm and impresses Swope with a quick blow. It's a pretty straightforward message in terms of media and advertising, but there are also a lot of powerful moments where it comes straight to the point about racism in America, sometimes without having to do more than one gesture and sometimes a little HUGE Black must do Panther guys go that way and that around the Swope advertising system. And for a low-budget production (I mean super low, hence the comparison to Night of the Living Dead and Faces), Downey got some really good actors, all of whom were not unions, and it's hard to imagine that some of them her own had the first time in front of the camera here. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that Downey's style does not make it perfect: it's crude and sometimes too crazy and obsolete for its own sake, and I'm sure I did not. I've gotten some of the underlying humor from a few ads, since I have a full generation after having aired these ads (though the "Miss Redneck Jersey" was definitely not lost to me). In general, this is one of the most beautiful of its time, a satire that stands out and a feature with a predominantly black cast that knows only too well what comes from an excess of power, regardless of the skin color. It is, as someone might say, "good shit".
