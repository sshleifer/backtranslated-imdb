Despite its age, this film retains its undisputed charm and appeal, and is a beautiful, preserved example of early British cinema. There is an eerie atmosphere that is interspersed with non-humorous puffs of humor and demonstrates the assured direction and production values. So many episodic films are incoherent and messy, but this is not one of them. The standard of acting helps a lot and the different characters are interesting and believable. All in all, this long-forgotten little gem is worthy of attention, despite the grating remark in the movie, which surprisingly escaped the censorship's attention!
