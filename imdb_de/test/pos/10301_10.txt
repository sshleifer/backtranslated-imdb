This movie is mainly based on people's emotions and interactions. There are only three locations (school, shop and coach house) that are really used. However, it is primarily in the home of the coach. A movie does not need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself. Four friends who teamed during their basketball days meet. One is rich, important and has no real love out of the money. They want to become mayors again, but their competition makes him angry. You want to supervise the school and take care of your family. One is a traveling alcoholic. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love the actors in this movie. They were all familiar to me. They have proven themselves here. <br /> <br /> One of the most important moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, blows up the coach. He screams and complains about how the coach cheated in the raffle. He whistles the trainer's whistle and calls back his phrases: "Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned!" It's amazing to see with energy that just freezes you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for anyone who understands human emotions and does not need shiny effects to interest them.
