It's hard to know in which category this film can be classified. Most of the films filmed at this time in US history are Western, but instead of the vast expanses of the West, the action is almost exclusively limited to a claustrophobic girls' boarding school in Louisiana. The film begins with Amy, a young girl who was killed by the Forest goes out to pick mushrooms, and at the same time she comes across Corporal John 'McBee' McBurney, a wounded Union soldier, to whom she returns to school. We know he's not a particularly nice person when he kisses her lips to keep her from alerting a temporary Confederate patrol, even though she told him she was twelve. Back to School Though some disagree about what should be done with their new guest, some think they should take care of him until his wounds are healed, while others believe it is treason, not him at the first opportunity to surrender to Confederate forces. The former group prevails and gradually recovers. His presence has an impact on all the girls who have not had a man in the field for a long time, including a young teacher and the headmistress, who seems to have a relationship with their own brother. McBee tries to seduce her, emotionally, if not physically, leading to considerable jealousy among the girls. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is rated at fifteen, it is definitely not suitable for younger audiences for both the sexual content and for the small content it is shown, but much is hinted at, and for a very grueling scene in which I wound myself more than any other scene in a movie that I've seen for some time. It's interesting to see how Clint Eastwood plays against the guy. Instead of being heroic, his character is both uncomfortable and most of the time at the mercy of the women around him. Acting is consistently solid, not only by Eastwood, but also by all the actresses, including the young Pamelyn Ferdin, who played Amy.
