In KPAX, Softley combats the intricacies of Eastern religious mores, from the small archetypes embedded throughout the film to the very purpose of Prot. Spacey (Prot) plays a predominantly didactic role throughout the film - it's as if his statements are general truths embody a culture of peace that is very prevalent in Buddhism and Hinduism. It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm - the world is disordered and 'bright' and the false veil of reality is what everyone else sees, but Prot sees the truth - he sees the minute - and appreciates it Some points fear that he will transcend his social construction of reality and become more human. <br /> <br /> The film is particularly detailed. Therefore, I would recommend that you watch it at least twice to see how Softley casts nuances. Listen carefully to the narrations at the beginning and end, as they really touch concepts that are not common in Western philosophies. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 - Superb - with nominal improvement potential.
