This is undoubtedly a good movie, but with some strange aspects. Without spoiling anything, it only takes place in 3 locations - a Sicilian farm, the boat and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up, so we never see a big sweep of anything. I wonder if that should save money? There are no street scenes and we only see the boat in close-ups. And the music ... what in the world was playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they went out? I could have done without the milk flow ... But before you consider me a pure misanthrope, let me say again, this is a very good movie with heartbreaking moments, wonderful photography, great characters and more accuracy than the usual (American ) Efforts for the immigration experience.
