a very surprisingly underrated film. very realistic. and authentic .with great dialogue. since I'm Italian, I can definitely relate to the situations and phrases. I thought Joe Cortese was great. as a crazy mob cowboy guy, and Pesci and Vincent were great too. I liked the actor Criscuolo, who played the boss. He was very authentic. I think director Ralph Devito was on the way to big things, but was cut off too soon, maybe because he knew too much. I thought it was great. it deserves more airplay and recognition. it was a sleeping movie. Great. very well. it had really good authenticity. it was well done.
