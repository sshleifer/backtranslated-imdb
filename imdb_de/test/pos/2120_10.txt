My kids, DD 7 and DS 10, enjoyed the movie so much that they squirmed on their seats. It was good, old fashioned, rated G, family fun. This movie was made for kids ... somebody really understands them. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see Julia Roberts, Brice Willis, Garth Brooks and the other stars making their appearance As someone who lives in the city was modeled on the fictional "Big Texas", I can say that he has made an honest and accurate presentation. The kids looked like kids, not like superstars. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to Hollywood that we need more movies like this one. Look at it and spread the word!
