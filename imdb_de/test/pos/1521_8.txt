Closet Land is an amazing, terrifying movie theater. It only contains two actors in one movement, but never loses your attention. The stage setting is imaginative and disturbing, the staging of scenes gets your attention and increases your own sense of confusion and terror. The acting is outstanding. Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe have a duty to wear every scene. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in 1991, shortly after it was released on video. It did not play in theaters where I lived; not surprising given its political content. It should be seen, however. It provides a brilliant staging of the torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to convey fear and obedience to citizens. The country is never mentioned, which makes it all the more conspicuous. It could be anywhere; East, West, 3rd world, 1st world. It shows what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone. Madeleine Stowe is a children's book author who was pulled out of bed at night and subjected to terror and torture. She is in a room with Alan Rickman, a seemingly pleasant official. At first it seems a terrible mistake and she can go free; But fear keeps them and terror escalates. She is increasingly being subjected to physical and mental torture. The interrogator uses sensory deprivation, temporal manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, role-playing and twisted logic to break down the author. She is humiliated and brutalized, forced to endure strenuous body positions, without food and water. <br /> <br /> Through everything she refuses to give in; to do what the interrogator asks. She is told that everything will end when she just signs a confession. A simple little act. She refuses. In all of this, she uses defense mechanisms that have evolved since childhood. It is slowly becoming apparent that she has been the victim of childhood sexual abuse. In order to survive, she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would dissuade her from the abuse. These mechanisms allow her to overcome her torture and turn over her interrogator's table. She attacks his own beliefs and profession, forcing him to examine his own life and his motives. In the end, she is free because she maintains the freedom of thought. The interrogator is caught by the state. <br /> <br /> This movie was written during the Cold War, apartheid, and at a time when the crimes of many governments around the world made news daily. In a world where "enemy fighters" are being held in secret prisons and interrogated, legal rights or legal counsel denied, it is even more topical. "ethnic cleansing" wastes entire societies and humanitarian aid is denied. It shows that the individual can stand against the state or another oppressor by refusing to give in to fear and terror.
