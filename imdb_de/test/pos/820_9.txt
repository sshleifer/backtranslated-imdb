When I first heard about this picture, it was simply called "Shepherd" and was supposed to be the movie that would put JCVD ​​back in the spotlight on making plays. I was very excited about the whole piece. <br /> At the time when it was called "The Shepherd: Border Patrol," I was excited for this movie. With Isaac Fluorentine directing and JJ Perry coordinating the stunts, I almost peed myself in the pants. Pictures of JCVD ​​were released featuring 8 different types of asses, and Scott Adkins played what I thought was the bad guy, and I was so excited. I thought it would be another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuade. <br /> <br /> Then it came out. I ordered it online at Blockbuster for $ 20 and was ready for everything. The reviews from vandammefan.net had changed my ideas a bit, but I was prepared for it. The post came on the fourth day and I tore open the package. My original plan was to storm up, tear off the face of the cardboard box, and then smash the suitcase with the right dynamics to make the CD land in my DVD player. I stared at the case for 10 minutes, put the disc in my player and watched the movie. When it was over, I was cool like a jerk in the pool. The Shepherd Dog is certainly one of my absolute favorite movies of all time and makes Derailed look even more of the toilet mess it is. Sure, some of the fights were a bit short, but they were still VERY fantastic. The shootings were outstanding, as was Scott Adkins, who unlike the forgotten Steven Lord should have been the villain. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this strip. Serious.
