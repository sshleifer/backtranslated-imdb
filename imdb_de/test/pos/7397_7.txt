The problem with so many people watching this movie is the way they think about it. People are looking for a B grade horror movie or So Bad It's Good movie. Jack Frost 2 is none of this. <br /> <br /> It is, quite simply, a very good movie, cleverly hidden in a very bad movie. If you think of it as something other than a screwball comedy (slightly weird when combined with all three absolutely worthless "scary movies"), that means misinterpreting the film on a fundamental level. It would be like watching Shawshank Redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple; The characters from the first film, who are haunted by memories of Jack Frost, holiday on a tropical island. A new, improved Jack follows them, now essentially with the powers of Spider-Man's Hydro-Man; In essence, he can easily and quickly turn from water to snow, divide, multiply, and worst of all succeed in building immunity to his only former weakness ... AntiFreeze. What is sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first Jack Frost (a simply HORRIBLE movie) can not understand the sound change for the sequel. Just as Alien was a horror movie and aliens had nothing to do with action, Jack Frost was a feeble attempt at making crook horror, and Jack Frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre. Most entertainment options come from the live action actors who serve admirably. Especially funny among them are Ray Tooney (who plays a caricature of a former British colonel from the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (who portrays an insane, hilarious twist on his wood performance from the first movie), and David Allen Brooks (who once was serious the role of manners to new, completely bizarre heights). <br /> <br /> The lack of "memorable quotes" bothers me. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie Jack Frost 2: Revenge of The Mutant Killer Snowman, rated a zero. But you have to understand, it's not a horror movie.
