I saw this for the first time on British television, with good musical accompaniment. The elevator scene is great, especially when it's done shutting down in the phone booth and then fiddling with the bottom indicator. The jump through the stern is really impressive and there is much more. Apart from all that has been mentioned before, there is the fight with the man who bullying the woman with the dog - it just looks so easy. The only downside is the plot - it mixes with Dead Eye Dan, who then escapes but does not reappear, even though some gangsters are later involved. The scene that looks like he's shooting at the fat inspector is funny, but it would have been better if Dead Eye pulled the trigger.
