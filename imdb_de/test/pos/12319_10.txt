Easily one of my three or four favorite films. Definitely one for the lonely island. There is nothing "brilliant" about this film. Rather, it shines warm and inviting. The audience is invited to a party, and like any good party, the joy comes in the interaction of the guests and what they learn as you move from one to the next. With an apology to Joyce, the title of the film evokes a series of ideas that keep the audience away. The movie is not terrible. It is not depressing. It's a nice look into a bygone era where people grow up and others cool off. Some are frustrated and others are relaxed. And all around the evening are the people and the parts of the people who were laid to rest. The words attributed to these exquisite actors are perfection and, in keeping with the music of the Irish Brogues, a feast, especially for us Americans who have become flabbergasted. I take it back from the lack of brilliance I mentioned above. There is no other word to describe the final scene between Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann. It talks quietly about volumes ?? Well, everything. On a beautiful snowy evening, lend this movie and just let it happen in front of you. No shootings, no chases, no dinosaurs? simply film in its most sublime form.
