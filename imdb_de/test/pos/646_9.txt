I love this little movie that reminds me a bit of the original Japanese gem, SHALL WE DANCE? (Not the exaggerated Gere / Jlo remake ...) Luckily I found it and recorded it when it was shown on a STARZ Promo Weekend, because as far as I know, it's not available on DVD. I'll look into everything with Yancy Butler (anyone can remember the short-lived TV series MAN AND MACHINE ???), and it shines positively. She performs a dance routine to a disco song that is HOT !! verrrryyyyyy !! Loved all the other characters, especially Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where was she all those years?). This is one of those movies that I throw out every now and then and always smile smiling after seeing him. We recommend !!!
