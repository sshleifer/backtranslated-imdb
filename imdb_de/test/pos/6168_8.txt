I came from "Dark Blue World" and felt (sighed) "so sad", but it was definitely a movie that had to be done, and it's really well done from the Czech Republic. It is entertaining despite the "sad" premise. It is full of feelings, the bond and undeniable true friendship between the two main characters - a mature lieutenant (Ondrej Vetchý as Franta) and the young and ever so eager pilot (Krystof Hádek as Karel), the inevitable triangle and the occasional Memories of the cruel prison situations in Czechoslovakia in the 50s. It's all in a movie put together by the father-scriptwriter and son-director Zdenek and Jan Sverák (the previous accomplishment was the endearing "Kolya"). <br /> <br /> It's not as long as "East-West" (French "Est-Ouest") 1999, a heartbreaking, multi-layered story about a returning Russian doctor and the fate of a post-World War II French woman Russia. The plot of "Tmavomodrý svet" (Czech title) is quite uncomplicated and has light humor. Music, World War II songs sung in Czech, modest special effects of pilots and aircraft in the sky - not as sophisticated as Hollywood - it is not necessary to constantly show bing, bang and boom when air combat scenes are shown. The sadness was declared at the beginning (two English paragraphs) above and completed with subsequent paragraphs. The film is not fully subtitled, only when translating the Czech talks - the rest is in English, be it British or in Czech accents. (This is a foreign language film with English language and includes British actors.) <br /> <br /> The three main images, especially of the two Czech pilots, have been beautifully shown. There are nuances between the two, even if it is the steady maturity against the eager boys. I always treasure Tara Fitzgerald: Yes, in 1996 there is "Brassed Off" alongside Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite; remembered her from "Hear My Song" (1991) against Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty; Against Hugh Grant in "Sirens" in 1994 and "The Englishman who climbed a mountain and came down a mountain" in 1995, alongside their appearances in the PBS Masterpiece Theater miniseries. <br /> <br /> "So sad" - the fact that heroes defending the country can be treated so unhappily and for so long (40 years). Thank God for precious memories and unforgettable impressions of friendship. Hence the break for a sunbeam through a glass window (ironically or coincidentally, that it is a church in which the hard work took place) - symbol of hope, never give up? Other recent feature-story films have said, "Kandahar" (with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas, the Canadian from Afghanistan, on a journey to Kandahar, with a personal mission in mind) Looking behind a Burka of the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. "Everything Put Together" (starring Radha Mitchell as new mother before SID - Sudden Infant Death) - a revealing film by Swiss director Marc Forster and his much talked-about movie "Monster's Ball" (which I still have to catch) with Halle Berry, Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. Watch the movies without any previous expectations or comparisons with previous movies. Just see it.
