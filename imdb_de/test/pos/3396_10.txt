Maybe one of the best movies ever made. The friendship of Orry and Goerge is deep and the war is burdening their strong friendship. As a Southerner, I can honestly say that this epic is as accurate as it gets. Brothers fight against brothers. Can you imagine what life must have been like at the time? The best part of the movie was for me when The South surrendered; General Grant urges President Lincoln to really keep it to the south, he says, "Mr. President, many people want the South to bleed on what they did ..." very tired voice says, "The South has bled enough ... and we too ... "I burst into tears and took a deep breath. What a president! It's like a father who says his son has been punished enough, and despite his anger, realizes that his point of view has been made. This war was a very dark time for our young country, and it had to be fought. President Lincoln knew that. I ask everyone who reads this to watch this movie and add it to your DVD collection. Then I thank God that our land has been preserved. As Jesus said, a "house divided against oneself" can not exist.
