If you've ever seen Open Water, it's the same kind of edgy, edgy, indie style of the movie. I liked the action, excitement. the slow building of everything, I just hope they do not do with what they did with Open Water, with this sequel .. but in any case, the only thing I did not like was the annoying younger sister 'I rooted all the time for Croc. The film starts pretty well, as it should, children pack for a trip, they hire a leader who mysteriously left 5 minutes behind. Before they get there, I suppose his assistant takes the two sisters and their friend out on the water. Now it is the second day of their adventure. Strangely enough, the first day they appreciated hmm a crocodile farm ... so they're out there and everything is alright for a while, then bang, crocodile time ... very intense, you know something in this movie, you see the crocodile not a whole lot of crap, but if you do, it's very scary, I love the snout and the eyes of the crocodile, and the veil of fog that seems to envelop the crocodile every time he pokes his head over the water uplifting, very scary, but alright, overall this is a great movie if you pass the annoying little sister.
