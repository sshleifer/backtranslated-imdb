My God, that was a fantastic movie. Every time we watch, we get to another place "WOW". Rhett & Scarlett were brilliantly played by Joanne & Timothy. They did a fantastic job reworking the roles of our two favorite heroes. Everyone! It's a must ..... Do not take this movie. If you loved Gone With The Wind, you'll love this miniseries. Go Rhett !!! Go Scarllett !!!
