As I said in previous comments, there are some programs that are "light entertainment". I'm a bit frustrated when commentators seem to expect a program that reveals the meaning of life. You will not get this from Cleopatra 2525 and it is not supposed to be offered. What you get is a girl who was frozen and brought back to life 500 years later. Their adaptation to this new life is realistic. She does not get involved within 10 minutes, as is the case with other time travel adventures, and she is not the female counterpart of James Bond willing to accept all of the competitors that would be most of us. However, it is light entertainment, the stories have a beginning, a middle and an end in a short time and there are surprisingly good moments of acting. The episode in which Cleopatra appears twice is particularly moving, and Jennifer Sky, I think, shows one of the best performances of a person who has died for a long time, and as a film and television connoisseur, I know what I'm talking about. To prove my sincerity, I have bought all but four episodes and am completely satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I do not have the complete set is that I bought the other episodes before I realized there was a complete box set. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio well, and Cleopatra 2525 certainly entertained me.
