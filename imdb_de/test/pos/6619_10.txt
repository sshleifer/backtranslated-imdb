At that time I was one of the RNs in the emergency rooms where these skaters occasionally landed. They were not treated well and some were caused by their antisocial personalities - but we all knew that they were a talented bunch of "wonderkids" even then. You deserve better care than you got, I'm afraid. They had "attitude" in spades. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw this documentary at the IFC tonight - it will be back at 1am and I'll be back! <br /> <Little attention was paid to them until the rich dying child persuaded their parents to drain the pool - and the film really underlines that this is the starting point ... it was an amazing time had earned. Stacy Peralta deserves this praise, and these Z-Boys may enjoy their memories and their contribution to skateboarding for a long time. With the few "sour grape" ratings included here, there were always and always "wannabe" and hangers who never dreamed more ... The Z-guys lived it, breathed it, they were. <br /> Nice to see the vintage movies and even the lonely girl "Peggy" who was said to be the only woman who got her respect. Thanks to IFC, I get to take the occasional drug-free childhood journey of my youth and relive the palpitations.
