I described this movie as surprising ... that is true in many ways. The subject material (Black Man falsely accused), the characters (people you expect to be clich√©s often show uncharacteristic attitudes during the movie), the production ... <br /> <br /> All of these factors do refreshingly unusual film, especially for his time (1949). The only possible spoiler is the sometimes cheesy dialogue and an occasionally high moral attitude. <br /> <br /> However, if you come across a movie if you did not intend to watch a movie, you may feel like I am - staying in the middle of the night, just to see what happens. <br /> <br />
