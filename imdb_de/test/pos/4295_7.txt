A well-written script. A moving story that shows middle-class English at its best. Some great plays by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He can be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I did not know, but to her credit, she does a great job as a ****** wife. The director Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film a meaty plot. It has not overly dramatized the representation of the English middle class. The speed of the films does not fluctuate, although it is not a confronted film. A good turn in the plot that is unpredictable. A lovely English village village. I really liked this movie. The locations were also very well selected. If you enjoy movies about relationships, you should see this. Better to have some handkerchiefs ready!
