My original title for this review was "Ending disappointed, film triumphs." But on the way home I thought about it. It's not the fairy tale that most of these films are, it's alternately different scenes, and while the ending is initially disappointing, it slowly sinks and hits the gist in a satisfying tone. <br /> <br /> The story The following is a guy named James Aaron (Curb Your Enthusiasm's Jeff Garlin, who also wrote and directed). A fighting actor who lives with his mother in Chicago and deals with his obesity and his inability to find someone to love. <br /> <br Yeah, it sounds trite, but it's experimenting with elements that make it unpredictable, and in fact makes you want it to be longer. The end somehow came abruptly and let me say, "That's it !?" But once it starts to challenge it, it's really a smile. <br /> <br /> It has many serious tones, but do not worry, because it is also very funny. Some scenes are laughing, and those who have seen Jeff Garlin's stand-up will see a couple (especially if on the Career Day he gives a speech for his niece's kindergarten class and bombs). It starts with a certain serious note that you do not expect, but the following is very funny, entertaining and quite poignant. It's the kind of movie you constantly watch and enjoy. And as I said, while the end may seem absurd at first glance, it is a real pleasure to take the time to think about it.
