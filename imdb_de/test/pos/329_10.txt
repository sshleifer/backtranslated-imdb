Hello everyone! I went to this film without expectation, although I knew that Maniratnam would have made an excellent movie! I was shocked!! The background is the struggle between the Sri Lankan Tamils ​​and the government. The story is about how a young girl, Amudha, who lives with her foster parents in Chennai, India, goes to Sri Lanka to find her true mother. The highlights of the film are the performances of each actor and actress, of course the cinematography, the editing and all the other technical details. Full score for the cast and the crew. I have to mention the film art as it expresses the war so that you feel there. Excellent work! Although the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such work was never attempted on Indian Screen. Overall, the movie is great! And to Mr. Maniratnam. <br/> <br /> Mani Ratnam proved once again that he is a director who can bring Indian cinema to great heights! I would like to see this movie again and again. An excellent movie and a must.
