That was very funny, even if it fell apart a bit in the end. After Hitchcock, it's not a tribute - Owen (Danny DeVito) was fortunate to play Strangers on A Train at the local cinema. The movie tells you that this was the inspiration. <br /> <br /> DeVito is very funny, but also a bit sad. He has no friends and he just wants to write and have someone like his writing. His teacher Billy Crystal goes through some serious writers, and his wife has stolen his book and made it his own success, which has also frustrated him. <br /> <br /> The best parts are the book suggestion by Mr. Pinsky ("One hundred girls I like pork") and all the scenes with Anne Ramsey, which is so terrible that Mother Theresa would have wanted to kill her!
