I recently became an adult with my mother, her best friend and my adult sister in the Magic Kingdom. Disney World is often falsely perceived as a place for kids, but if you see quality shows like Mickey's Philharmagic, you'll find that the magic of Disney is something for everyone! It was such a great show that we left the theater, turned around and got back in line. And then a third time. It was absolutely breathtaking. I would encourage anyone who goes to Disney World to watch this show. This is not just a show, but a world trip with Donald, which is fun and fun with Donald.
