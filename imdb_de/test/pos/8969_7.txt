Charlie Wilson's War, based on a true story, tells the story of a Texas Congressman and a CIA agent working to secure funding for the mujahedeen's covert support in Afghanistan in the 1980s following the USSR's invasion of the country. This conflict played an important role in the last years of the Cold War between the US and the USSR. <br /> <br /> In terms of filmmaking, Charlie Wilson's war is a clear winner. It's well written, well played and well shot. While most of the attention was on Tom Hanks for another good performance, I was even more impressed when it was Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn to be CIA employee Gust Avrakoto's. Scenes of Soviet attacks on underarmed villages and the refugee camp effectively drag themselves into the heart. The film also gives a good look behind the scenes as Congressman Wilson needs to raise the necessary funds. <br /> <br /> However, there are two complaints I have about the movie. The first is that there is a subplot that involves a scandal investigation that is not well developed and, as such, only a minor distraction to the plot. The second complaint is that the film lacks part of the context of the war. The film makes the mujahedeen look like innocent victims, and while they suffered large civilian casualties, the mujahedeen were actually rebels trying to overthrow the Afghan government. This government, completely ignored in the film, did not surprisingly fight to repress the rebellion and later called on the Soviet Union to support its efforts. The film also ignores the fact that the US helped the mujahedeen avoid the Soviet effort in Afghanistan. The film pointed to the unintended consequences of our covert actions - consequences we still feel today - but it seems that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols are willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a coherent narrative. (I have not read the book and I do not know if George Crile made the same compromise.) Despite these complaints, I enjoyed watching and recommending the War of Charlie Wilson. I would have preferred a film that better describes the complexity of the situation, as Stephen Gaghan did in Syriana, but the audience was better connected with the coherent narrative of Charlie Wilson's war than with the ambiguity in Syriana.
