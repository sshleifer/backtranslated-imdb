This is definitely a movie that will make you think about the daily struggles that a person can go through each day. The great show of the two main roles is an example of this, and you will not regret having seen this movie in any way. <br /> <br /> It's a heartwarming story of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life from the US seated wheelchair. Their friendship is tested, as well as their spirits, when they get their own apartment outside the nursing home. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who likes buddy pictures or just wants to watch a wonderful and heartwarming movie that avoids all clich√©s and pitfalls and does not even get soggy.
