I caught this at the Chicago IndieFest and have to say that YOU ARE ALMOST much funnier than the other reviews and even the website would make you think. Not HA HA Wedding Crashers' funny, but sick, twisted, I can not believe she just said that, but it's so damned funny. There's never a moment when you think, oh, I'm watching a movie and she's an actress. She's too damned real for words. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are two scenes that I'm still ganking about, and I'm not going to tell them, but in one of them, she's in the bathroom talking about how much she gets for providing a particular service paid and how "fantastic" it is. (I almost wonder how many people secretly think the same thing in the audience !!!) <br /> <br /> In another interview, she talks about a definition of "sex" versus teenage adolescents, and if it does not the case is the truest dialogue I've heard in a movie for a long time, I do not know what is.
