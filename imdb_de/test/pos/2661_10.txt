The awakening of humanity is the subject of "2001: A Space Odyssey," a process that takes place along a space-time continuum. We "see" our original past and "close" a cosmic future. Intuition forces thus become doors of perception in our ongoing collective journey. From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric conspiracy seems superfluous. Our mad conflicts and our self-important dialogue are consumed in an evolutionary shift and are irrelevant in a cosmos that goes beyond understanding. It is a difficult lesson for a futile and aggressive species. No wonder some of us coughed about the film's slowness and minimal history. For attentive viewers, compensation is an inspiring sense of wonder and awe. <br /> <br /> In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arches represent nature. Right angles stand for conscious intelligence. Some people believe that the slender black monolith is one of Neumann's probe. Could be. Undoubtedly, the monolith is a visual metaphor for extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. The mystery is deeper than the explanation. <br /> <br /> "2001 ..." is unique in content and content. The cinematography is out of this world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking and the classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a movie. But Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" is art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" or Vincent Van Gogh's "The Starry Night".
