Deep Water (2006) **** <br /> <br /> "It does not matter ... it's waiting for you to make a slip-up." These words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best summary of the nature of the ocean that I've ever heard mumbled. Their furies are limitless, not least their loneliness. These words come from the fascinating and heartbreaking documentary Deep Water. It is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur governor who attended the Sunday Times Race around the world in 1969. If you do not know his story, you can best finish reading now. Do not read this or any other information about Crowhurst or the race. Find the movie and just watch it. <br /> <br /> After the first round of the ocean in 1967 adventurers and adventurer adventurers began the next one-up. This time the journey would have to be done without landing or stopping on the way. Crowhurst saw the race as a great opportunity to get his family back on track. He had experienced financial difficulties as a child and wanted to do something to return to such a life. So he went in search of sponsors and soon afterwards in Stanley Best and Rodney Hallworth. The two men spelled out the potential cash cow and gave Crowhurst a boat, on the condition that he was forced to pay when he got out of the race. However, his boat was in dire need of repair, and he feared that it would not be ready in time for the final departure day. However, he was informed by his sponsor that he just has to leave? After all, they baked the dough and expected it back in time. <br /> <br /> The details of the story are notorious: Crowhurst's boat began to be busy with water, and his progress slowed to a crawl. In light of the decision to round off the Horn of Africa (safe death in such a boat) or reverse (financial devastation and misery), he looked for a third option. He hid alone on his yacht and waited for other competitors to circumnavigate Cape Horn in South America. From there he would join the race. He reported wrong positions and recorded the speed. Then he stopped communicating for fear that his position would be wasted. For every day of a journey he did not undertake, he had to laboriously create fake logbooks. After all, Crowhurst was too heavy with loneliness, guilt, and the realization that he was likely to get caught. His recent log entries make the considerations of a Kurtz seem perfectly healthy. Only a few weeks from home, he turned his boat away from home and is said to have gone overboard soon afterwards. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst's odyssey is intriguing, and its end is heartbreaking, but inevitable. Our dreams often turn into fears, and the consequences of our actions often leave us few options for a happy ending. It is the story of a descent into madness, attracted by the infinite depths of the cruel seas. The filmmakers are doing a wonderful job to tell this story. It consists of chilled audio and video recordings that Crowhurst made, and stories of his crazier log notes. The story begins slowly and may distract some viewers, but the rewards of the story pay off in the process. <br /> <br /> There are also inquiries from some other competitors, such as the Frenchman Bernard Moitessier, who probably made it to win the speed competition and then make a second world trip. Also in the film is Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the winner of the contest. He donated his prize money to the Crowhurst family. <br /> <br /> Just reading about the Crowhurst saga just will not do it justice. It's of course interesting, but a quick rummage bypasses the raw emotions and oddities presented here. The last moments of Deep Water are breaking the heart, listening to the thoughts of his widowed family and the worship and understanding of his friends. This is a fascinating story, and it is what brings the documentary into such great channels.
