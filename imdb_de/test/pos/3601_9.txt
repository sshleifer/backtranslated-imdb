This film shows us the history of World War II along with touching romance, a little imagination and meaningful feelings - and a beautiful landscape. Nicholas Cage never lets us down and does a great job here as well. And also the other main characters. An important draftsman, the doctor / father of John Hurd, provides (his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I have ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I apologized for knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantasy. My wife and I really liked the movie. And it's nice to see people take the risk to love the enemy. A man who left the theater nearby said to his wife, "This is how you lead a war!" I think you will see what he means when you observe the Italian occupiers of this beautiful Greek island.
