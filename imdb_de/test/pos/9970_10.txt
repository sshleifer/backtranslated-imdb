I'm always impressed when a director (and this director / scriptwriter) takes a classic text - and brings it to life. Sure, Shakespeare's text can give you goosebumps, even if they're worked out with great importance, but seeing a production where true ingenuity makes wonderful words - by providing context or nuances that are not found in the stage directions it just impressive. There are many disturbing things about the piece. It's a racist game about racism - and that remains. I never accepted Jessica's desertion of her father without good reason. I have never accepted the position of Christians as peaceable self-righteousness. But brilliantly, there is a textual prologue that helps us understand the times and politics in which the story takes place, and luckily part of Jessica's part is cut. <br /> <br /> For many, the text is cut rather reduced passages. However, I only noticed one line that was interrupted the moment I expected to hear it - and it was replaced with a look that said everything. This economical and careful editing has given us a gripping film - not just a film of the play. <br /> <br /> And finally there is a reason why Antonio is so loyal and generous to the undeserved / unrelated Bassanio - One can almost feel that Antonio's pulse is starting to race as he sees Bassanio in a gondola passes by or comes to visit. But it is so subtle - nothing more. I was banned. <br /> <br /> There were many other highlights. I felt that the arguments during the process were heartbreaking. And the exams of the applicants are hilarious. <br /> <br /> Add all this to the beautiful cinematography and costumes that are in tune with the times and you will understand why I can not wait to see it again. And again.
