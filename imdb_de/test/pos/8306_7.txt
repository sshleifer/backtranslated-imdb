Due to the fact that there was no CGI in 1976, I felt that the film was good to see. The studio productions were very good and very elaborate. The background effects were very believable and always looked like they were part of the whole set. The actors were fine, considering that the movie is set in a kind of Jules Vern atmosphere where imagination and possibilities for future exploration were highly unlikely. If I had seen this movie in 1976, I would probably have had the reverence for man's ability to build a machine that could travel to the core of the earth. I still wonder why we do not all fly around in our cars, but I digress. McClure and Cushing have their funny moments, mostly from their facial expressions, which of course makes the movie a bit moody, which I loved. The "monsters" left something to be desired, but the story was a good one, although I think another "thing" could have been more credible in those circumstances. All in all, for his time and fun now to see a lot.
