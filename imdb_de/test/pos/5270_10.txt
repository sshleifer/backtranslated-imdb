I consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. It has so many highly intelligent thoughts that anyone who considers the film terrible has not understood it and can not recognize any truly profound philosophical themes that are undoubtedly present in it (in all 3 Schneider films). Several colleges in germany and europe have studied studies on schneider's approach. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and one of the jazz musicians in Germany (maybe also in Europe). He is mainly inspired by the great M. Davis and T. Monk. If you do not like him, that's fine, but do not try to convince others that he's stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and you were really immersed in the art of H. Schneider, you would have to "surrender".
