Hey there Army Sgt. I'm sorry, but as an SGT in the Army and National Guard of the Army, you're not qualified to comment on a naval movie. You are not a Marine and just because you are wearing a uniform does not mean that you can be a Marine. We're just the best, we have the toughest training, yes, we have big heads about ourselves, but if you're the best, you like to harness your stuff. I was in the Iraq invasion and Fallujah. I fought alongside soldiers. You are not "qualified" to say anything about my Marine Corps. I hate to be the one who starts the whole thing "which branch is better", but you have no right to say that you are qualified to judge a marine movie. Oh yes ... we are drill instructors ....... no drill SGT's. That's the biggest clue you have no idea what you're talking about. Yes, we do not "curse" on recruits. Tell me, how does a joke about someone make him a better Marine? How can I beat someone who makes a Marine a better Marine? Yes, it's a kids boot camp of what I've been through. But we have different times and people. We train people who have all the next generation of our generation. We want smarter recruits, not mean. And if you register as a Marine, the goal is to be the best your country has to offer. We do not have to reinforce that in the boot camp. Marines come to the boot camp and want to be murderers. We do not have to teach them that by demoralizing them by cursing and hitting them. At least that's how I feel. And yes, I'm "qualified" to say that. I've been on the battlefield several times, training marines and recruits who ended up on the battlefield. But what else do I know. I was just there, got the T-shirt. SGT of the army ....... get a hint!
