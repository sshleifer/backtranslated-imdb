Some time ago I saw this when HBO showed it and from what I saw, it seemed like a good movie. So I'm in blockbuster today and I see it there with the dvd's and I decide what the devil. So I rent it. After I finished it, I was shocked how good it was. <br /> <br /> This movie touched my heart. Everything was so great. The stories, the actors, the dark humor, the MUSIC !!! Oh, do not get me in the music in this movie. PT Andderson is one of the greats. Definitely the best thing that has come out since Quentin Tarantino (a god). <br /> <br /> After finishing the first visit, I looked again at Anderson's comment. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in watching movies should watch this movie if they have not already. Anderson is obviously a movie lover. In the movie he breaks off so many other directorial techniques. Such as the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water. Obviously demolished by "I Am Cuba". But I do not have beef with me. The film is very respectable with its prints. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie to anyone who can deal with the content of the movie (porn). <br /> <br /> 10/10
