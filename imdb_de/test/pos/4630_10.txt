I think this movie has to be one of the most moving and heartbreaking films of the last time. <br /> <br /> The movie basically starts with a suicide in a school toilet. You do not see who it is, then it goes from there to the beginning of the day, and we get to know 6 characters, and they go through some pretty heavy things. Anyway, one of them will commit suicide /> <br /> I have been teaching physical education in schools for 8 years and never in a movie have made such an accurate representation of what "really" is going on in school life. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully filmed and sounds incredible. <br /> <br /> The end is so shocking, and what you would not expect is something that will haunt me for days to come. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one to look at. <br /> <br /> I think the fact that the director / writer was in school only a few years ago is a major contributor to the oppressive honesty in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie will be shot in two separate modes if you want. First, there is the smooth observation style, where we get to know the characters in their school environment as they go through their drama, but the amazing part of the film is the deepest, darkest, in the interview sections where we get to know the stories of the characters and their stories Thoughts. <br /> <br /> You always wonder who it will be (who commits suicide), and when the drama unfolds, change your mind until bam you face meets face last five minutes. I write everywhere, but I just saw it in a media screening in Australia and I'm still a bit shocked. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best Australian movies I've seen in recent years.
