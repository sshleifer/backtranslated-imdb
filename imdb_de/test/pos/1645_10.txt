One team varied between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot and the man who plays Bana on Seinfeld, and go to a research post in the Arctic, where all the members have died, either killing each other or killing themselves. They discover that there is a worm - a virus - that is parasitic to madness and death. The problem is that someone could be infected after a specific wound, but who? This is not only my favorite season one episode, but also one of my favorites from the series. The Arctic surrounds the characters, and of course, like Carpenter's the Thing, it's a lot of fun to watch these balanced characters suddenly freak out in dramatic scenes. And the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cheesy, I did not care about it at all. The drama between the characters has ultimately meant that it works more than usual because of the tension and the fact that all the actors (including the Bana man) understand the events in the story. And as always, I loved the ambiguity of that end. Highly recommended.
