I'm not sure which version of the movie I saw, but it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I did not know who the "twins" were (Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi) before I saw this movie and myself I think the English translation of the title is a bit misleading. <br /> <br /> The martial arts are very well done. I especially liked them because there was a lot of judo / grappling that was filmed very nicely. Donnie Yen (see him in Hero, great performance) as a director is great because he knows how to shoot these scenes. <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to flow for me, except there is a scene where the girls are on the roof fighting with bamboo poles. It really has nothing to do with the storyline, but it's still entertaining. Overall, this is one of the better (modern) HK action flicks I've seen for some time. Although cheesy in some ways, it still pulls it off. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 9/10
