This seminal film is now available in two different versions of the Grapevine video release, which also includes the English translation of Selma Lagerlof's novel based on a Swedish fairy tale. The first version is the Swedish edition entitled THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the United States under the title THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT as published by Metro (previously M-G-M). The actual US release has long since disappeared, but a detailed New York Times review shows us how the scenes have been rearranged for inland publishing - and both are intriguing to see. Each version of this movie was featured on The Organ Loft in Salt Lake City with live theater organs by artist Blaine Gale. A live recording of these performances was made and is included with the novel and notes on the two versions on the Grapevine Video DVD. While THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of Lagerlof's novel, THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT is in some ways easier to follow. The two different edits show how silent films can be effectively changed for publication in different countries. <br /> <br /> Some viewers consider this movie a horror movie, which certainly is not. This is a morality game with shadows of the supernatural that has struck his strong message. The direction and lead performance of the great Victor Sjostrom were far ahead of their time. It's easy to see why M-G-M brought him to Hollywood to make films like Lillian Gish in THE SCARLET LETTER and THE WIND and Lon Chaney in HE WHO GETS SLAPPED. In America, he became known as Victor Seastrom. He would also star in the lead role of Ingmar Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES and give a masterful performance. Bergman was heavily influenced in earlier years by KORKARLEN or THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. <br /> <br /> This is a strong movie worth discovering and studying. The release of Grapevine Video is an excellent way to do that.
