I managed to get a BBC premiere of this movie as a video, and I liked it so much that I had to find the original video in the original box. Thanks go to Ebay. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary animal film has not been available in any format since 1990. He is well constructed and well played. Staged by Stewart Raffil (MAC & Me), the scenes of jumping tigers through the Alaskan wilderness are downright breathtaking, and their timeless story of a trapper who wants to survive alone in the frozen deserts with two young tiger cubs moves on each time. <br /> <br /> Why no big company bought this movie for distribution on DVD is a big miracle; makes it special, it's also hard to find. <br /> <br /> If you happen to find this movie or at some point add it to your collection, make sure that it does not disappear from your movie handle. Movies of this caliber, as shown, do not come often. <br /> <br /> A true masterpiece in the true sense of the word that deserves its praised comments: "WHEN THE NORTH WIND HITS" will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it.
