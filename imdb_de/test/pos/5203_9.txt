This movie shocked me. It was so realistic and the story was incredibly touching. You speak German and Russian, which makes it more credible and real. This is a movie you must have seen. The actors are great too. Really a good job. The action takes place during the Second World War within a German troop. They have to go to Stalingrad, Sovjet, to fight the Soviet armies. They are better connected with each soldier in this group and follow them through all the dangers when they are caught in Stalingrad. They are met face to face with death, blood, grief and the cold of Russia. This is a must-have movie and you can not afford not to see it.
