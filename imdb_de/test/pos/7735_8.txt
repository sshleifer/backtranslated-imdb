Paul Mazursky's Tempest - Interesting, weird and strange movie about a midlife crisis. Sit down in New York and on a remote Greek island with John Cassavettes as the world-renowned architect who wants to quit lounge singer (Susan Sarandon). A nice transfer of this 25 year old film on the DVD - but without extras - not even the movie trailer. Lots of great scenery and razor-sharp dialogue make this two and a half hour long film interesting trip.Raul Julia and Gena Rowlands complete a strong cast. A good drama, mixed with comedy and suspense and almost madness. This new DVD release is worth a loan. B +
