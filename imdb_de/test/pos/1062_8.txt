Given the roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signor Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, ex-Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple), many of his fans are surprised to learn that Sidney Greenstreet an original made a name for itself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually a total villain or a serious actor in public, ignoring his weird talents. In fact, he actually made four comedy appearances (a parody of his vicious depictions with his rogue partner Peter Lorre in a cameo). His best comeback in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher Alexander Yardley in "Christmas In Connecticut" (though his autocratic, half-crazy soap tycoon in "The Hucksters" is barely behind.) Despite some scripting issues, it's a good movie and is usually revived during the Christmas season. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column in Yardley's American Housekeeping magazine, where she gives household tips and cooking recipes, and is the 1945 version of Martha Steward, except that Mrs. Steward is a cook and homeowner, she can vouch for her trying and testing what she advocates Stanwyck can not, her cooking recipes are those of her friend Felix (SZ Sakall), a gourmet chef and restaurateur House, which she calls her home (a model farmhouse in Connecticut), belongs to her unofficial friend, the architect John Sloan (Reg Gardner Gardner). Gardiner really would not mind marrying Stanwyck, but she's not ready to consider a final commitment for him. <br /> <br /> As the movie begins, an American is shipwrecked by the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. He spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued. Greenstreet senses the ad's value and decides to fulfill Morgan's desire to have a really old-fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. Basically he tells Stanwyck she'll entertain Morgan and herself on their farm for the holidays. Stanwyck can not explain that the pillar image of herself (including her ability to turn over flap boxes and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband) is a lie - if she does, she gets fired, as does her immediate boss Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne). In a moment of depression, she accepts Gardiner's marriage proposal, and then Gardiner realizes that his home in Connecticut is being forced to become the "home" of Stanwyck and of himself and "her baby." Of course, aside from Greenstreets curious curiosity, Stanwyck and Morgan find that they fall in love (much to the annoyance of Gardiner - he actually expects Stanwyck to still marry him). Complications occur after complications, as lies pile up and neighboring babies follow babies before Greenstreet wonders if something is missing. But it's a comedy, so everything works fine. Even Greenstreet at the end of the whole madness is amused - his famous, hearty chuckle, which reflects for a change of Santa's. This is not a classic comedy, certainly not great, but amusing enough to see the season in December.
