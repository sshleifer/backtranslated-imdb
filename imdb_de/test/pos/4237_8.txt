Sexy murderer Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) is still looking for a blissful life with her ex-boyfriend, crazy killer Charles 'Chucky' Lee Ray. After getting hold of the maimed Good Guy doll who had last felt her spirit host and repairing, she performs a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toy. Unfortunately for the poor Tiff, the revived madman, shows no interest in marriage, and so she encloses him in a cage with a bridal doll as a companion. Finally, a rather angry Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) escapes his confinement, killing Tiffany in the bathroom, and putting her soul into his "bride" in retaliation. In the same situation, the plastic couples put aside their differences and decide to drive to Hackensack, New Jersey, where they can lay their hands on the magic amulet that theirs Turning ghosts into human hosts. The Trailer Park Hick Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his delicious friend Jade (Katherine Heigl) have been tempted to take her to their destination, and the psycho dolls embark on a murderous rampage with their ignorant companions holding the blame Idea that a child's doll is obsessed by the mind of a mass murderer, was always funny, the creators have only in the fourth movie in the series Child's Play fully accepted the madness of the premise and decided to play There is much more to laugh than fear ( although there is still a lot of OTT splatter for us to enjoy gore-hounds). <br /> <br /> Talented Hong Kong director Ronny Yu oversees the procedures and cleverly translates the witty tongue-in-cheek script into a smooth and thoroughly enjoyable movie ride. Similarly, the excellent cast handle the stock material perfectly, with Stabile and Heigl being a sympathetic couple, but smoking hot Tilly's show as Tiffany's blonde, buxom, sulking, PVC mini skirt temptress. Kevin Yagher's stunningly expressive doll effects also make a major contribution to making the film a success. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is unlikely to find many fans among "serious" horror fans, but those who like the weird. A place of mindless popcorn entertainment, full of twisted, black humor, crazy death scenes and Great cleavage should have a great time.
