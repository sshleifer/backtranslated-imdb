And I would have rated it higher than one out of 7 out of 10 if Barbara Hershey in the lead role of Mother Madalyn did not have the uneven Irish accent. The accent came and went unfortunately, which I distracted more than a little. <br /> <br /> However, William L. Petersen's role in Joad's role was outstanding. Despite some periodic hokey dialogues he brought warmth and depth to the character. Fascinating and sincere, I found him quite amazing in the way he captured the character. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is pretty simple: the construction of a forgotten staircase in a church. It's pretty loose based on a true story, I believe, and I had heard about this staircase before I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> It was a phenomenal technical feat - a floating double helix made without nails or screws. It still exists today, although it is now privately owned. <br /> <br /> ** Minor Spoiler ** Good supporting role and Barbara dies so well in all her films and she does not disappoint. Many special moments. <br /> <br /> 7/10
