Watched this movie on Saturday afternoon cable. Man, did it pull? I got the metaphors, the symbolism and all the stuff. No, I was not interested in the sexuality of the characters. But the pace of the story and the scripting almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> That's ... until Ruth Marshall gets naked. If you are a breast musician who is not homophobic, you might want to hire him. Ruth has a lesbian sex scene that is pretty hot, and then a heterosexual sex scene that is a lot higher than most standard movie awards. Their shaky D-Cups made the movie worth the watch. <br /> <br /> - The Mighty Avatar
