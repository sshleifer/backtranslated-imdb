Favela Rising is a documentary about the slums of Rio, the favelas, especially the most violent, Vigário Geral. According to this film, in the last decade in Rios favelas violently more children have died than in Israel / Palestine during the same period - an amazing fact that shows that this social problem is not recognized in the US rest of the world. This is an important issue, especially for those hoping for the grassroots effort to bring together the most needy and vulnerable through a dynamic cultural program. This is a compelling documentary when it is occasionally compromised by a somewhat personality-based version of events and grainy digital videos and movies that sometimes make you think you need to get your eyes examined. Drug Lords In the favelas and in the truncheons raging teenage boys, as in parts of Colombia. Fernando Meirelles's City of God / Cidade de Deus film was accused of violence (Cidade de Deus is one of Rio's many favelas). But the early part of Favela Rising shows that favela boys actually want to celebrate violence and deal with drugs, where the money and the action are. It's cool to have a weapon with you, cool to work as a drug smuggler: it's fifty times more profitable than the otherwise available profit. <br /> <br /> Mochary first spotted the AfroReggae movement and its leaders Anderson Sá and José Junior visited Rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor cim- inal to give up his job and with his own promise to fund a film to help to make a movie. Sá's eloquence and charisma and a surprising twist in his life make him the focal point of the film and its main counterpart, but like the favelas themselves, the film teems with other people. No doubt that Sá is a remarkable leader, organizer and artist. Vigário Geral is compared to Bosnia: the shooting there was very dangerous. Anderson Sá's friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in filming allowed the filmmakers to gain access and detailed recordings of their subjects while (mostly: there were close attacks) engaging in serious confrontations with drug lords or drug dealing cops to avoid. They trained boys for the use of cameras and left them there on their way home. This resulted in 10% of the footage, including rare footage of violent incidents, including police beatings. It is hard for an outsider to persecute the police massacres in Rio. In the early 1990s, there was one who outlived history and inspired Sára, who ended his previous involvement in the drug trade to lead his cultural movement. The cops are all over the drug trade and if they do not like it, the poorly trained police paramilitaries (often wearing black ski masks) come in and shoot a neighborhood killing many innocent people. <br /> <br /> This is pretty much the picture we get in Meirelles' City of God, except that this time Sá, Junior and the other guys who start in Vigário Geral come in, but finally get into a row other favelas spread to give percussion classes that assert themselves dozens of teenagers - girls and boys. Their AfroReggae program (Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR), founded in 1993, is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the ghettos of Rio. They allow smoking, alcohol and drugs (that's the rule) to explode in expressive, galvanic performances in rap, vocals, percussion and gymnastics. The best of Sá's listed artists eventually performs in front of local producers with local producers, and their Banda AfroReggae has an international record deal. <br /> <br /> Other centers and groups were founded by or through the GCAR Over the years in Vigário Geral and other favelas, to achieve the improvement of youth, by providing training and staging of music in the GCAR centers , Capoeira, theater, hip hop and dance performs. <br /> <br /> The performing arts are not everything Just the focus. GCAR is also a movement for broader social change. Centers are sensitized to such public performances and offer training in information (newspapers, radio, internet, e-mail links), hygiene and sex education to fill gaps between poor and rich in black and white and workshops for audiovisual works, including the production of documentaries. The program is currently active in four other favelas. <br /> <br /> In Favela Rising, there are many scenes of favela street and domestic life, and they look very similar to the images in City of God, with the important difference that they are the center of attention and the result much more positive. Not that it's not a tough battle. And the corruption of the police, the injustices of the social system and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not directly addressed by any of them. However, there is a scene where Sá talks to some young children in another favela, cynical boys who are not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and who are determined to work in drug trafficking, like Sá himself as a boy. Sá does not seem to convince any of them, though he points out that traffickers can not make it to the age of fifty. But we learn that the most negative boy in this group, Richard Morales, joined the movement five months later. There is also the report of an unusual accident that hindered Sá but with a positive result. <br /> <br /> It would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and the story would be a bit shy, but that's the case of lively, inspirational material that is engaging, risky documentaries, and it's nice that Favela Rising has been screened at seven film festivals and has won a number of awards, including the Best New Documentary Film Maker at the Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently being exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in London. A broad art house audience in the US, however, seems unlikely. <br /> <br /> Included in SFIFF 2006.
