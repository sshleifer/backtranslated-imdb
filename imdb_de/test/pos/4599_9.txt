Pity about Fox, because he has dumped this movie. It was a total uprising and I just hope it finds a second life on DVD and cable. <br /> <br /> This is a funny satire. The "what if" situation is extreme and no punches (or kicks to the groin) are made. It makes you think ... what will become of this empire when we become completely lazy and stupid? Everyone is hit in this case. a number of big corporations, and even Fox News is a headline (which is why the movie probably never had a proper release - aside from the marketing department, because he was considering the campaign and did not know how to market it, "so we just give up! ") Some might find the movie sophomoric due to the kicking and groining of the groin, but the movie is much more than that. You either get what Mike Judge says or you do not. Most of the negative reviews I've read seem to come from people who just do not get it or are movie snobs. <br /> <br /> There will probably be a week to play in the selected markets if you miss it If you are looking for the DVD, the rent is worth it and I will have it in my collection sometime. <br /> <br /> Good job Mike Richter, it's a shame you messed it up but you I had to laugh out loud and look forward to the next movie you make.
