With Alison Hayes opening the doors to women as dangerously dangerous as men, "Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman" was obviously an open market for other films to record and wear the torch, which is more of a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine "It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" to play the role. The downside is that sweet and blonde Provine is just too cute and innocent to step into Allison Hayes size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with a certain smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more like the girl next door. Maybe she has taken on this role and done to prove that she could be sexy, but the material fails her. However, Lou Costello proves that he can shoot a movie without Bud Abbott adding lines to it, and he even takes a dramatic role in some of his scenes if he does not turn to Gale Gordon as front man for gags. However, Gordon realizes that everything he can be is stormy, troubled, and intrusive, similar to what he later creates in "The Lucy Show." Charles Lane plays the same role in everything he does: a pure man, and his screen time is limited. The special effects are compelling for the time, but I would have wished that Dorothy was something more than just cheesecake and dressing and at least could be dangerous. As the main character of the film she takes the second reckoning to Costello, who is present in the entire film with Dorothy, who disappears several times like a subplot. The entire movie just can not decide whether it's science fiction, a comedy, or just a parody of the Allison Hayes classic. There are many good scenes, some humor and a very ridiculous camp that influences the rest of the movie. Still, I like this movie because it makes women stronger. There are not enough films like here. If this movie had a chance to be re-recorded today, I would warmly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander to the lead roles and allow me to completely rewrite the original script. Courtney cites my list of actresses whom I believe could and should play splendid giantesses; I must admit, though, that if any of the titan beauties Allison or Dorothy came after me, I would go quiet !!
