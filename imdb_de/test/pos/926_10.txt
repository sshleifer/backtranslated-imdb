Master Kieslowsky came up with an idea in 1993. The idea was to portray what human relationships look like in the world today, from Blue (a visual masterpiece about a woman's life) to White (a visual comedy film about marriage) and finally arriving at Red (A Masterpiece, that deals with human interaction). <br /> <br /> Although I do not want to ruin the move, I can easily say that Red is the best movie of the 90's because he has one of the strongest messages a script I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie starts a little slowly, but it finds its rhythm early enough to get you through the movie. <br /> <br /> The performances are perfect, sublime. Since the characters are absolutely realistic and in no way clich√©d and you can not expect less from the actors, you will not be disappointed ... seriously, I think Jean Louis Tringtignat deserves at least an Oscar nod. <br /> <br /> The music of Zbiegnew Preisner is amazing, it is one of the best scores ever. Piotr Sobocinsk Cinematography is also outstanding, earning him an Oscar nomination (and deserving to win). Overall, the movie is a perfect 10's movie and is loved by people who love foreign cinema and people who love to go to the movies. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> How did the terrible Pulp Fiction beat this masterpiece in Cannes is incomprehensible to me
