Passion In The Desert is an example of spatial beauty. It's a visual narrative illuminated by great cinematography. Passion was shot on location in the deserts of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Namibia and Tunisia. We are in Egypt, 1798. Augustin, a Napoleonic soldier, accompanies the writer and artist Jean-Michel Venture De Paradis to an official mission to document, measure, draw and paint the cultural landmarks of the city Egypt: its dunes , amazing ruins and mysterious people. <br /> <br /> Can you truly "document" truly majestic sand landscapes, broken buildings and wild Bedouins? Can you really capture the essence of Egypt, nature, man and time? <br /> <br /> Jean and Augustin lose themselves in the fascinating, sparkling, golden desert whose vastness overwhelms their senses. <br /> <br /> "In Egypt you can not lose yourself! There's the Nile and there's the sea!" says the dehydrated Augustin, and soon he discovers an old, winding cave that leads to a palace ruin. <br /> <br /> Delirious and almost crazy he tries to rest; a startling tone awakens him; His eyes, body, and emotions become hypnotically tied in time as he stumbles into a sensual sensory experience. A wild, slender female leopard stares at him and her love affair begins. ... <br /> <br /> A daring love affair, a daring film.
