I found this movement beautiful, enjoyable and uplifting. At first, I was fascinated by the local sides of the movie that was filmed here in Buffalo. Later I found myself lost in the power of the movie. How do you pay back a gift from God? The ability of the characters to rise above their basics and respond to the touch of God warmed my heart. The entire audience applauded at the end of the film. I left the theater with a small step, with joy in my heart and hope for humanity. What can a movie do more? Hollywood, I hope you take care. America likes positive, optimistic films.
