This film brought together some of the old Spinal crew for another mock-up movie, this time around the world of the Dog Show, as their owners prepare and train for the show before going to the show itself. <br /> <br /> We meet several teams to win the grand prize - The Fleck's, Cookie, who seems to have slept with every man ever, and Gerry, who tries to cope with his wife's old escapades, and the fact that he literally has two feet. Harlan, whose dog talks to him, and enjoys ventriloquists. The swans who drank too much coffee and shout at each other. Donalan and Vanderhoof the gay couple and Cabot and Cummings who have won the last two years. Fred Willard comments on the show and as usual is very funny. Funny scenes include "Look at me!" Scene and everyone with Levy. Unfortunately some of the best scenes were deleted or later shot - Willard interviews Leslie Cabot and the alternative epilogue with Gerry is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. If these were recorded, I would give the film an extra touch. But ... <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
