This show is incredible! I love every single episode. Carrie is a Spitfire and Doug is adorable and sometimes an idiot. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Deacon and Carries Boss give the show a nice ending and tie all the funny, pinchy moments in the pants. In one season, Doug Carrie tries to get drunk because she's nicer when she's drunk. Nice man, right? Carrie is not much better when her boss needs an IPS driver to testify in a minor case at work, Carrie hesitates because she sees Doug as a slut and does not want him embarrassing her, so instead she poses Dougs Friend. Woman of the Year But who I think is funny, is the fortuitous Arthur. He is amazingly funny and angry. Hey, you would be too if you had to live in a cellar where the mold has a funny smell and gets dizzy. This show is hilarious, and if you have not seen it yet, then you have not lived!
