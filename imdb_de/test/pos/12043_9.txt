Darr (1993) was an incredible movie. In my opinion it is one of the most beautiful of Bollywood. The film itself evokes feelings of compassion, fear, confusion, happiness and sadness. Shahrukh's role was incredible, in fact he gave the obsession a new face. Juhi Chawla's innocent and girlish character was in sharp contrast to Shahrukh's fiery and passionate character. The role of Sunny Deol showed the role of the "good" as a "villain". The fact that Shahrukh, not Sunny, has caught the attention of the public proves that everyone has that helpless inner urge to pursue something that is not really in his hands. Although the film is several years old, it surpasses every new one. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality fits perfectly with the role. He should seriously consider playing the lead role in a similar film.
