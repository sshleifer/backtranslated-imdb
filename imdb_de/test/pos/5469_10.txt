There is almost no information available about this movie or its flight data. After a comprehensive and comprehensive search, I found that the DVD for the 3.99! Date is available on February 28, 2006. Try Yahoo / DVD and Video. To publish this information, I will continue to say that this is a well-made film with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter building a very unusual staircase in a church. It's a chance to see William L. Peterson in front of C.S.I. turned him into a star. Also included in the story is the venerable Barbara Hershey. Does anyone remember when she was Barbara Hershey Seagull? I have to keep writing to receive this message. Many thanks to the previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure TV movie, which obviously leaves a lasting impression on many.
