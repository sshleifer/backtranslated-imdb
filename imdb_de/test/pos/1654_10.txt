The ultimate movie about hearty raids. Elements of Bogie, Welles & Sinatra make you sweat and be satisfied. By comparison, the proverbial Apple Cart really bothers him when he sees recent films like "Oceans Eleven (Remake)," which are so highly regarded, especially in Europe. Films like Rififi need to be shown, talked about, and kept alive to remind younger (pathetic) critics what the true classic Noir is. <br /> <br /> Criterion should be recommended in its flawless and stylish transmission.
