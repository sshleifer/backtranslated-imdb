I was not even born when this series was released in the US. It took another decade or so for British TV to conquer it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was lucky enough to see the very first episode in which The Lone Ranger belonged to a posse that ambushed and slaughtered in a scene. TLR was the only survivor. Although badly wounded, he was rescued by a passing Indian named Tonto. I think he had to wear a mask to hide his true identity for fear of reprisals. Instead, he made himself all the more recognizable. No idea if he wore it in his sleep. <br /> <br /> That was Saturday Teatime staple. The fanfares of the William Tell Overture let the glaring appear with a shot of food in his hand. Although it became very repetitive, predictable hokum very quickly. Nobody ever exposed him. No one ever landed a blow, nobody beat him. He was a bit too good and for most kids just a little too much in his dress. Poor Tonto, on the other hand, became his aunt Sally. He was always beaten and tied up and kidnapped and all that. <br /> <br /> And what did he call The Lone Ranger? "King Savvy" was the general consensus in which I lived. It seemed to mean "the great knowledge" in Indian language. But it sounds like something else, as if Mr. Silverheels has a speech defect. "Kemosabe"; what the hell is that? <br /> <br /> A later, less well traded duo called "The Range Rider" and "Dick West" finally won my vote. It featured a naked face, Jock Mahoney, who was beaten pretty thoroughly in each episode, and was less stock, less super credible, and less. <br /> <br /> Still; I can not even hear William Tell's overture today without waiting for the gallop of hooves and a hearty hi-oh silver. Devine stupidity.
