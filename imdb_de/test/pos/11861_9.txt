Okay, maybe this movie is not a revolution. But it's a very good entertainment object, and it's the variant of Alicia Silverstone's "Clueless" by Camerin Diaz or "There's Something about Mary" by Liv Tyler's own house and all the material comforts in it. And she's doing everything to achieve that ... even crime. Many crimes. And she drops every friend who does not notice these things. Besides, she does not mind having a few more lovers next to her current boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is even funnier to look at, knowing that Liv actually has a Cancer Sign - and cancer reporting will be very domestic. The character Liv played here is actually a parody of a cancer! <br /> <br /> I was alone in the cinema when I saw this one. It was quite enjoyable because I could laugh so loud all the time I wanted it to be - but it also felt strange, as if nobody really cared about this movie. The acting was between very good and excellent, especially the main actors were brilliant. There were enough jokes, many of the blacks and good dialogues. <br /> <br /> This is a trash movie and it is full of black humor. If you like this kind of movies, try it!
