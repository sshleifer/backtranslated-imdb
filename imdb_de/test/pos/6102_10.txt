I just watched this movie on TV and it was fantastic. <br /> <br /> had just planned to watch it while working, but I watched the full movie without doing my job as it was so good! <br /> <br /> Actors can not know very well, but the action makes up for it. The fact that the actors are less well-known only makes it more credible that the events could happen. I did not feel biased towards a character because I have no appreciation of the character types as I've never seen one of the actors in a movie before, which made it even more fun.
