The film seemed a bit slow at first glance. But it picked up speed and brought it to the point. It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity, and the reasons for the "gadget." I enjoyed it. It's as realistic as any movie about the atomic bombs that should be dropped on Japan. I recommended it to friends. I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.
