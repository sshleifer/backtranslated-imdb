I honestly do not know which words IMDB will allow me to use in this review, so I find it hard to describe these shorts. Let's just say, there is a lot of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a lot of masturbation and some artificial ... members. And I loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> Not that it's ALL gross humor. It's not you who mostly take off from fart gags, except for a sketch titled "Pizza," in which they use one very well. "They" are 3/11 of the short-lived sketch comedy group that aired on MTV titled The State (David Wain, Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black) playing themselves and meeting strangers and unusual people, people who are often more normal are as you. The side occupation is also fantastic. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Sam Rockwell all perform in various sketches. They are also supported by other The State alums such as Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek. The music selection is also very well placed. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed these sketches over and over again, but they are not for everyone, as they are usually pretty vulgar. If you like a clever sense of humor that is not afraid to go beyond the boundaries of good taste, I can only recommend it. If you enjoyed Wet Hot American Summer (director and lyrics: Wain and Showalter) or The State, you should really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I think it can currently only be ordered online. Take a look at the website and stream some sketches to get an idea if you really want to, and find out how to buy the DVD.
