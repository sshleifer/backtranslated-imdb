This is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and I always thought it would never really be. Until I read the glowing reviews here. It seems like many have the same feeling as when I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> It's a damn creepy movie, and I spent most of my life watching creepy movies. I've always found dolls, mannequins and so damned scary! Take a look at the dolls in "Beyond the Door" and of course the big "Trilogy of Terror". And what about the terrific Twilight Zone episode "Living Doll"? Hell, dolls are scary! Tourist Trap has some moments when your hair is on the neck. All this is supported by an excellent soundtrack, which brings Connors' performance even more heartbeat. <br /> <br /> I remember watching the trailer for this movie on late night TV and "Wow, I have to see that!" It was unforgettable. And it's one of the few followers I remember when I was a kid who crawled out. It took me years to see it, but it was a treat. <br /> <br /> Stephen King also mentions this film in his book "Danse Macabre" and gives him a glowing recommendation. Pretty good company. <br /> <br /> This movie is always at the top of my list of must-see attractions. It's a really solid addition to the genre of time and earns a place alongside the best of the 70s.
