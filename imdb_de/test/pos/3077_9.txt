This movie was great, if you want a movie with constant wordplay and laughter then this is the one for you. This movie was great because it tasted the serious Robin Hood and it was fun for the whole family and she has a good laugh. I saw this movie for the first time at about 10 years old and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything, "By order of Kings Financial Secretary H and R Blockhead?" <br /> <br /> Everyone needs a bit of Cary Elwes (Robin Hood) in life, whether or not his liars are liars with the "claw" or saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing
