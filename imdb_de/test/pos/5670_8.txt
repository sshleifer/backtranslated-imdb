This movie is a sleeper, because Rod Steigers is the only big name in the credits. However, all supportive actors fit well with his character. It was fitting that Rod Steiger once again reminded us in his last film of his creative power as an actor. He portrayed the impulsiveness, the stubbornness and the acceptance of a grandfather's end of life in a characteristically individual and convincing performance. Because his character was close to death, history brings us closer to the most precious things that are granted to us: the privilege of life, relationships with family members, and the empathy of those who care about us. His search with his granddaughter for one of his sons provided enough excitement to keep me waiting and awaited a high-pitched climax, such as meeting two long-separated older lovers who were also on the verge of death in Forever Young. "I was wondering how the meeting would take place and how much my feelings would be hurt when he and his granddaughter reached the end of his search, and I was very pleased that the story brought more than I expected, the satisfactorily satisfying climax Gave me a greater appreciation for the value of the precious gifts of life, love, and family that are enjoyed by me and all of us today.
