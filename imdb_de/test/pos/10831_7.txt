It's a war drama from the Second World War, with French, Jews and Germans, but this is somehow fun. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau wrote the screenplay for his well-received film "Bon Voyage" (2003). Unlike director Bertrand Tavernier's "Safe Conduct" aka "Laissez-passer" (2002), Rolf Schubel's "Gloomy Sunday" (1999) or Claude Berri's "Lucie Aubrac" (1997), "Bon Voyage" is equally hipper title-sounding - c'est la vie (whatever) - and we owe it to the beautiful and talented Isabelle Adjani. It is her delightful performance that, as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of everything, has made the movie as enjoyable as it is. Hell, what's another derailment of their plan and their expectations? The backbone of the story revolves around a pair of young enthusiasts: Grégori Derangère as Frédéric and Virginie Ledoyen (of Francois Ozon's "8 Women") as Camille. The incomparable Gérard Depardieu, the witty Yvan Attal (of "My wife is an actress") and the versatile Peter Coyote (here juggling French, English and German) are some of the outstanding stars. <br /> <br /> In this plot of a movie, there are many characters that come and go, and how to juggle everything is a skill that requires no analysis - Rappeneau is simply a genius. The story simply builds on itself, episode after episode or even with overlapping events, but never confusing - that's the great joy, somehow every detail on the screen comes to the fore and we grasp it like a tastefully presented French dessert together , literally. There are thrills, trills, tender, hesitant moments and tense, ominous escapes, all of which take place before our eyes. <br /> <br /> Reading the Director's Note on Sony Pictures Classics' official Bon Voyage website, Rappeneau said that this is his most personal and successful work ever. To portray Bordeaux from his childhood memories in 1940 is very close to his heart and he "edited and revised the script for almost three years". This film is a round-the-clock love work, cast and crew complement the director's passion and an impressive script by writers along with the director and his son Julien - Adaptation Efforts by Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano and Jérôme Tonnerre. <Br /> <br /> Music by Gabriel Yared (varies in tone from his previous film scores, such as "The English Patient" or "Talented Mr. Ripley"), which provided a fitting theme that captures the tempo and rhythm of the action Gang kept - almost like a train without interruption, which reflects Viviane's vivacious energy (even when she is tired), lets her go on, when she encounters what is coming on, with her head held high and stylish clothes going on, not looking back let alone time for remorse. <br /> <br /> Ah, do not forget the wonderfully translated, nifty subtitles by Ian Burley, who also made subtitles for Italian films: "Bread and Tulips" (2000), also known as Pane e Tulipani, "The Last Kiss "(2001) aka L'ultimo bacio and Tom Tykwer's" Heaven "(2002). <br /> <br /> If you find this too-light wartime relationship drama, try Mäx Fäberböck's" Aimée and Jaguar "(1999 in German, based on a true story) with brilliant performances by Juliane Köhler as Aimée and Maria Schrader as Jaguar.
