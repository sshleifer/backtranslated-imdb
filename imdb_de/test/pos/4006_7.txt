I can not hate the show. When the old (and better) tech TV had to hit the bricks, the station was reformatted and new shows started. "Attack of the Show" is the replacement for the screensaver with three co-hosts at the beginning. It was Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran was also something of a co-presenter, but mostly did pre-recorded pieces for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show, and there was a competition to see who the third host would be, but that was not the case for some reason. IMDb messageboard) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on, because the two got married. That was a big secret for me! Now there's a new co-host who's not that hot (in my opinion) Olivia Munn. She hides something in the tops she wears while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she was not afraid to show it. AHEM! Sorry. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Show" deals with everything that young people want to know. It's music, movies, comic books, internet and television. That's the beauty of the show. If you do not want to bother with washing the net or wasting time with MTV, you can get everything you expect from AOTS. Some segments and bits are funny. They have regulars and contributors working in the industry, as well as guests ranging from insignificant internet stars to real big names. <br /> <br /> Even though the hosts are not as geeky as I would like to be, I still found Attack of the Show entertaining, even with its latest cast.
