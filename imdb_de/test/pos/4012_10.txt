This is probably my favorite show on TV. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feels good when I watch this show. There is simply something that is amazing and hard to describe. <br /> <br /> It seems that some or all episodes sync with music albums. Here are some examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but do not play until the end, but always the starting credits.) For most episodes, the album is played once and the episodes are played twice, but some continue.) <Br / > <br /> RADIOHEAD, PINK FLOYD, BOB Dylan. <br /> <br /> 2.02 'Double Bogey' Child A / OK Computer (Episode plays at least four times) <br /> <br /> 2.14 'Saturn' Child A / Interference / Love Game <br /> <br /> 2.19 'World without Alex' Child A / I wish you were here / Pablo Honey (Episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> The episodes contain hints about which albums are being synced. Child A can sync with EVERY episode!
