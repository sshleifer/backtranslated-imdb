** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Macleane (Miller) experiences a raid by Plunkett (Carlyle) that goes awry. Plunkett's partner is shot (and killed), but only after swallowing a large ruby. Plunkett and Macleane then meet in the cemetery as both try to get the ruby. Unfortunately, they are captured as grave robbers and put in prison, but only after Plunkett has swallowed the ruby. The ruby ​​is the key to freedom. Once they are free, they form a predatory partnership. Macleane should pretend to be a gentleman and find out who is worth robbing. But Macleane falls in love with the niece / daughter (?) Of her first victim, Lady Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And a Mr. Chance (Stott) wants to catch them, and his methods are not very nice ... <br /> <br /> Comment: A good action, which is characterized by comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller form a good team with a lot of friction and friendship. And then there's the relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson. The scene with the ball is very good, especially the (anachronistic) use of the music. Besides these interesting characters, Cumming plays the best of all, Lord Rochester. Both the character and the acting are outstanding and are among the best in the film. Overall, the movie works very well, a nice balance between story and special effects, action and comedy. Very entertaining. <br /> <br /> 8/10
