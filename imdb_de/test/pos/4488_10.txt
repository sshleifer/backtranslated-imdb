It seems that there are two types of people in the world: those who believe that "Five Characters" is one of the best episodes in the series, and those who are so cool that they know they shit because they were so smart and already had the predictions. "Lame" Twist in the end (which seems to be the only reason why their Twilight Zone exists: with twists). <br /> <br /> There are many lame episodes in the series and I can not rate all the TZ episodes with ten. But this one is certainly one of those who deserve such a rating. It is claustrophobic and colorful. The tension is built up and we can not wait for the revelation of the secret in the end. Whatever this secret is, what these people are, it does not matter. The nicest thing about the episode is that they lead to it. It would be equally powerful if we would never find out what these strangers really are in a strange place.
