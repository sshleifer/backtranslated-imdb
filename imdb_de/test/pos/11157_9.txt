Okay, I know, that's a clich√©. On the surface this is a bad movie - maybe in a league with "Plan 9 From Outer Space". The dialogue is suspicious (but the singlish is very pleasing ...), the plot is not entirely believable, Gavin's character is too strong. As you watch the movie, there are some things that really surprise you ... Good-looking and Kim turns off a tank, Gwen eats a banana in a bath, pretty much everything Gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssso Psycho !!" Those things that are looked at individually may be mistakes, but when taken together, they are just quirks, and if you watch this film open-mindedly (especially if you're not familiar with Singapore's culture) and an open-minded group of friends, you're guaranteed You can not go into this movie if you expect a masterpiece or even expect to take something seriously - if you can take this movie for what it is - an underdog movie about Outsider who is filled to the brim with his own quirks - then you should watch this movie well! I have seen it three times and would like to have it three times l see !!
