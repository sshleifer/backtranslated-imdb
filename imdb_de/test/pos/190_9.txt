The fantastic film art of Sergei Urusevsky makes this work an impressive piece. The opening scenes are like flipping through a master photographer's album, and as the story unfolds, we get carried away with both the depicted events and the beautiful look. Everything is well-filmed, but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking. Hard to describe without "pampering", but suffice it to say that an air raid is a very intense scene and the lady left behind and her lover's brother are in disagreement while the sirens whine and the windows shatter. Another superimposes a swirling staircase and a spinning shot of treetops and even evolves into a fantasy sequence. Soviet filmmaking of the highest order.
