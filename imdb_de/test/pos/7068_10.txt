Some people have the ability to use only 3 neurons, one to eat, one to breathe and the other to suck ... This is not a movie for them ... <br /> <br /> But for those who like to work with the brain ... the whole movie is a metaphor, everything is there for a purpose, every detail, the coffee cup, the red couch, everything ... is an underrated masterpiece ... <br /> < br /> It's weird, it's raw and totally realistic, so we actually interact ... it's a royal comedy ... total causality ... <br /> <br /> Get shocked by the first scene .. ... stay tuned ... and enjoy the show ....
