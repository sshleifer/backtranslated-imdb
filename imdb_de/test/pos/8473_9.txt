A masterful performance by Jamie Foxx is just one of the highlights of "Ray," a 2004 film starring Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau, and many others who excellently support the film. <br /> <br /> The film has several focuses: the first is Charles's childhood - the drowning of his brother George, who persecutes him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the power his mother taught him - Do not bend, do not break, never be a cripple. She finally sends him to a special school where Charles' music gift is discovered. The next focus is on Charles's artistic development as a Nat King Cole singer, his arrangements for gospel music, his ramble of country music and the unique sound that became Ray Charles. The third focus is on Charles's private life - his marriage to Bea, his many affairs, his heroin addiction, and eventual rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> Because Charles was 74 years old, much is skipped. Although Charles was orphaned at the age of ten, the death of his beloved mother, his skirt, is not in the movie. While being shown on the Chitlin circuit and refusing to play in separate clubs, his near-hunger as a musician is not covered. Once he found a jar of jelly and tried to eat it, but the jar broke. He was so down and out. Bea is shown with him when the state of Georgia, which banned him, accepts "Georgia on My Mind" as a theme song in 1979 and welcomes Charles in his home state. In 1977 he and Bea were divorced, but this is not mentioned. But she was probably there. She was not his only wife either - he was once married before he met her; This marriage is not covered. The film tells us about an illegitimate child - it was 12 years old. It would be impossible to get all this and more into a movie. <br /> <br /> What he does not skip is his glorious music, which seems to be constantly going on throughout the film, constantly reinforcing his genius and artistry. Charles's story is captivating and keeps the audience in all interest. Those who spit it out as a television movie do not give it the merit it deserves. Taylor Hackford's direction sets "Ray" at a good pace, and the film has a lot of atmosphere and beautifully wows the different decades. <br /> <br /> As Ray, Jamie Foxx inhabits the character and lets one forget that he is a comedian part. Foxx wore prosthetics, played his own piano, and spent a lot of time with Charles to prepare for the role. He nails him, but it is not a change of identity - he is a man of flesh and blood who has hallucinations of standing in the water and finding his brother's body; a man who is full of his addiction, hates the word junkie and believes that he is not addicted; and he denies his home life and thinks his wife knows nothing about his various affairs and illegitimate children (in the movie, child); and a man took advantage of a terrible advantage at the beginning of his career because he was blind and would not continue running later. He demands to be paid in 1-dollar bills so that they can be counted; When he discovers that he is a bratade for a club owner and his partner and was almost cheated out of a record contract, he makes his own deal and leaves his job. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly Foxx's performance accepts him as Ray from the first time he appears in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent biography interrupted like "Walk the Line" with the fantastic music of the artist. Whether you are a Ray Charles fan or not, "Ray" is something to experience.
