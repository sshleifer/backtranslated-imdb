I use OPERA as one of the better Argento movies. Plot holes and inconsistencies? Sure, but I do not think they affect this movie as many reviewers seem. Many of the elements that appear in many of Argento's films are somehow "off-the-wall", but that's part of the draw of his films ... <br /> <br /> Short story: Psycho pursues the new leading role of Opera Lady. The typical Argento twists and turns follow, resulting in a neat payout of a high point. Not the best of Argento, but I still pull that out. Definitely worth a look if you like his other stuff - do not mix this with the awesome PHANTOM OF THE OPERA remake that Argento made, that's really awful ...
