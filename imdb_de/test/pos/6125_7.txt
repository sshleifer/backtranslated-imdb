Babs Johnson (Divine) lives with her son Crackers, her daughter Cotton and her mother Edie (Edie Massey) in a trailer. She competes with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles (Mink Stole, David Lochary) to be the dirtiest person alive. The film shows their attempts to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT for everyone. It is an unrestricted attack with bad taste in your face. Crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister is watching; The marbles pick up female impregnators, impregnate them, keep them tied up in the cellar and sell the babies to lesbian couples. Divine and family have a party that includes cannibalism etc. It is disgusting, but in some ways not unsurpassable. It is so exaggerated and so uncomfortable that it is fascinating. Director John Waters could say the bad taste is good. It's kind of weird to watch too - the drama is so miserable (especially by Massey) that you just see it in disbelief. A friend laughed aloud at how bad Massey was (she improved in later pictures). <br /> <br /> This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Although it is over 30 years old, it is still shocking. However, if you are open-minded and can show extreme behavior, this is a must. The only part that was really too much is what Divine does at the very end.
