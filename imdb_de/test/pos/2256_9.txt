This is a beautiful but simple film about a man who seeks an answer, an answer he does not really need, but has structured his entire life with. It's heartbreaking, it's weird, it's lovely, it's agonizing, it's sensitive and dynamic, I say it's awesome. <br /> <br /> I read Jonathan Safran Foer's book Elijah Wood played the lead role in the film adaptation, and I was thrilled with the characters. I laughed out loud more than once. And every time someone talks about what it's about, I hear the same clipped answer, almost as if it were a big, long word: yet this story is so philosophical. it goes deeper than that. The conversation about the ring and "in case". It really makes you think. Suddenly, this story blends from a simple search to an inner metamorphosis, and I look a bit different now. <br /> <br /> I recommend renting these, if any, because the book had many obscene, downright perverted stories that were not included in the movie, mainly the story of Jonathan, which was not necessary for the movie , <br /> <br /> Something worth knowing, I've heard, is that Wood's current girlfriend has a cameo as drummer in the band that Alex arranges when Jonathan gets off the train to the Ukraine. > <br /> You spend half of the movie figuring out what it's all about and what Jonathan is about because his character is as withdrawn as a turtle in a shell. <br /> <br /> It's great and, in my opinion, one of Elijah Wood's best movies.
