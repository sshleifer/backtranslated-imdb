I'm not a big fan of music videos. I think music videos take personal feelings about a particular song. Every song. In other words, creative thinking emerges from the window. Likewise, throw aside personal feelings about MJ. This was the best music video ever. Just wonderful. It was a movie. Yes, people, that was it. Brilliant! They had a fantastic acting, a fantastic choreography and fantastic vocals. That was spectacular. Simply an act of a beautiful young woman dating a man, but was he a man or something sinister. Vincent Price added his point to the song and the video. MJ was MJ, enough said about it. This song was on video what Jaguars are for cars. Front-runner PERFECTO. What's even better was that we got the real MJ without the thousand facelifts. Ironically enough, there were more than enough make-up and costumes to go around. People go to Youtube. Take 14 minutes. See for yourself, what a wonderful piece of art this video really is.
