When I heard that there would be an ABC miniseries (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) based on life in the Changi camp [WWII POW] focused on "elements of comedy," I was deeply skeptical and somewhat critical of my father served in World War II. That was the barbarism of the Japanese, until recently he could talk about the horrors in and around Labuan (where he was stationed). Together with my father, I had been fortunate enough to meet many great men (of a stronger character and spirit than I will ever have) who had witnessed inexpressible barbarism by the Japanese Empire and never fully recovered. The name "Changi" is meant to create vile images ... <br /> <br /> But looking at it, I was very impressed with the cast, characters, and complex storylines of this wonderful series. I consider 'Changi' to be the highlight of my week (remember, I've only watched three episodes so far ... I hope the remaining episodes will match the standards set by the first three). <br /> <The black humor works incredibly well (though the flatulent jokes are a bit exaggerated), and while much of the horror has been suppressed, the series comes close to the intrepid spirit of the survivors, who could later continue their lives despite the restraining ones Memories. <br /> <br /> The "Flashback" format of this series will be difficult for some, <br /> <br />, but I can not imagine anything better. So we can give the men who have gone through deep emotional scars to show fair justice when they are interned ... when painfully suppressed experiences are remembered, sometimes years after the horror. <br /> <br /> One of the Darkest Chapters of World War II The 20th century, and (I would say) in the history of mankind, is being relocated to a new world I hope it serves to overwhelm the adversaries of the war generation pass. <br/> <br/> If I'm following 'Changi', I do not think I'll ever be able to hear that poignant melody 'on the road to Gundagai' the same way again. Turn on...
