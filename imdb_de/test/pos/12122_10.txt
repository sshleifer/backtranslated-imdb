I just got it in the mail and I was pleasantly surprised. As a big fan of the 70s cinema, I'm not content to be satisfied with these films. Despite the apparently low budget in this film, the acting is good overall and you can already see why Pesci should become one of the biggest actors ever. I'm not sure how authentic this movie is, but it certainly makes a good contribution to the genre of the mob.
