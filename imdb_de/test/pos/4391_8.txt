I saw that a few years ago when I sat on the couch and got stuck. With the remote control out of my reach, I decided to join in, waiting for a pathetic movie I'd avoided for a year. That's how it started and I was not optimistic, but after about ten minutes I laughed. The complete opposite, as I expected. The comedy was smart, the acting pretty good, the cast worked very well and the story (though a bit awkward and fake) was actually quite entertaining to finally go in search of their luck. The film takes place in the 1930s. Along the way, they encounter a number of funny and interesting characters. Everyone has a different story or achievement to seek. The majority of the movie may seem random. Some may say it's pointless and boring, but if you're looking for the intelligent comedy (which is sometimes stupid) that's included in the movie, you'll be thrilled. <br /> <br /> I liked the performances of George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Everyone has done very well in their roles and they have worked great together. But to finish, "Oh brother, where are you?" is a clever, funny and cinematic adventure that I would not miss.
