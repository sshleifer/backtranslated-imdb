If Keaton (as I just pointed out in THE GOAT) follows the tradition of comics that disagree with the law, then this Langdon Short (the last one before he released TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) is based on another Comic trick - being married to a rogue spouse and trying to escape for a secret two-time appointment. Laurel & Hardy did this in several films, as did Fields and Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with that - why do these characters always marry such nasty women? And there is an interesting sociological side issue - why do not you find female comics married to male colleagues of these spies? I can not remember any of them, except in a Carol Burnett sketch where the two nastier members of two couples find that they prefer to return someone as best they can (a kind of mutual sado-masochism, but also one Assurance that she is not married to a namby-pamby-type). As for the fact that the comics marry shrew, you can probably imagine that they get what they deserve. Or do Ollie really deserve a woman who throws him with pots and dishes? Yes, he went to this assembly in SONS OF THE DESERT, which ruined their plans, but he wanted some time for himself - there's nothing to suggest that he and Stan cheated on their wives. Actually, he is framed by Mae Busch for lying to her while Stan collapsed and told the truth to his wife. Here, Harry's wife (Alice Ward) is shown in the beginning as she talks with her mother about keeping him under strict control. We see Harry at his job (it's Saturday morning and the job ends at noon for the rest of the weekend - this was the idea of ​​working five days a week, 40 hours a week in the industry). He works in a foundry where he molds red hot metal (an early joke about Langdon - he's a small, light man, not the muscular guy swinging a sledgehammer). He's missing his tram trying to light a man. He calls home to explain things, and he listens for the two minutes delay. <br /> <br /> On the way home, Harry meets his buddy Steve (Vernon Dent), who has met two cute, sweet girls who would like to have a date. Harry hesitates, but agrees after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay the foursome hot dogs - he has a 1926 silver dollar in his pocket). But his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers his hidden "cache" of coins. He hides it under the living room rug and finds it by walking along the edge of the rug. But his wife spies on him and confiscates everything. Later she heard him talk and scold him. In contempt she gives him a penny back and says he can treat his date with a soda. <br /> <br /> But Harry has a second supply of coins and dressing up for the date - and goes out. He and Dent are obviously late and Dent charges Harry, but Harry tries to make amends: he spawns two prostitutes. They argue when Dent (wisely) says they are not girls they would call "nice." Eventually, the girls turn up and the date begins. But soon Harry hides in the rumble as his wife drives past in her roadster and the girlfriends of the girls show up - angry at her two rivals. <br /> <br /> The Short works well and is amusing gives a better idea of ​​the persona that Harry Langdon has developed in his short career as a comic book master. He is constantly attracted to others. He misses his tram because a stranger constantly asks for smoke and light, and in the end the stranger gets his own. The cute girl who is Harry's Date has a little dog chasing him out. He stands between two cars, both of which drive off, and ends with a pole. This undoubtedly shows that Langdon did not have his screen person until the time he created his facial features. If only he could have held together the complex whole beyond these three first features.
