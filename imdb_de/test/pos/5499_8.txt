In The Line of Fire there is a great game with cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this fascinating movie. Malkovich says he'll kill the president, and he deliberately calls Eastwood and presses his buttons. He asks Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings a cold but very intelligent attitude to his character. He does everything he does for a reason, and he does not hesitate to kill. Eastwood must overcome the suspicions of his superiors to catch Malkovich, but nobody wants to listen to him. The result is a film that crackles with excitement and leads to a tense scene in the ballroom of the Bonneventure Hotel. Wolfgang Peterson tenses the tension and we feel every turn.
