Although this movie looks like a crime thriller Noir, the plot is actually a bit simplistic and with very few surprises or twists - and those who show up are not exactly in shock. <br /> <br /> However, if you slip out of the "intense action-thriller" mode and into "thoughtless conversation", then this is a pretty funny movie with some funny moments. Most of them can be traced back to the witty dialogue between Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's characters - but that's what Sadie said to Friedman in her funny opening salute, and there was little else left to do but develop something between those two characters. I did not find these esteemed British southern accent actors so bad (Ok, Thompson sounded like she was rolling marbles in her mouth when she tried to speak south, but Rickman was surprisingly good with only a few minor mistakes in it his custom English accent) - if you want to criticize accents - let us talk about Coco - she speaks only south south! <br /> <br />
