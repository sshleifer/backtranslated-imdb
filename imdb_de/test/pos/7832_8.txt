OK, first of all, if you're not a fan of the entire low-budget horror genre, do not worry. You really have to be a fan to get the gag. <br /> <br /> The train is essentially about snakes ... all at once. Many of them. <br /> <br /> There is an old curse and a crazy ending that I will not spoil. The gore effect is full and real icky ... but the movie is primarily a big gag-gag about snakes that scare hell out of a bunch of people who are trapped in a train and there are some memorable ones and well-composed scenes .. some of the spectacles are a bit of a hammy (watch the surf-dudes), but that's not the point ... give this movie a look. Know what to expect and you will not regret it!
