It's pretty good, all in all. A must for anyone who is baffled by the opposite sex (ie all of us!). The trailer betrays nothing of the plot for a good reason. <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd, so it's nice to see that he does not take himself seriously. It's as if someone from the BBC Children's Department has decided to shoot an adult movie. That's not a bad thing, IMO. <br /> <br /> 7/10
