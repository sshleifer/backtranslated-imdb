I'm a big horror fan and enjoyed this remake a lot. With all these horror remakes, I think this is one of the better attempts. <br /> <br /> I have seen it with my two little sisters and I think it has made it even better because they were pretty scared. Even with the screaming on the screen "Do not do that!", "Not so!" Etc. I thought there were a couple of good, sparkling moments and it did the thrill, absolutely stunning in the lead role and a very good actress - that's how she keeps her attention good. <br /> <br /> Overall, a decent movie.
