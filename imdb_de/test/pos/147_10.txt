Of the Korean films I've seen, only three really stayed with me. The first is the excellent horror A Tale of Two Sisters. The second and third - and now also the fourth - were all films by Park Chan Wook, namely Oldboy, sympathy for Lady Vengeance) and now thirsty. <br /> <br /> Park somehow reminds me of Quentin Tarantino's disrespect for conventions. All his films are shocking but not unfounded. It's more like showing us what we do not expect - typical situations that radically turn against the morality of society, such as incest or a libidinal, bloodsucking, but pious priest. He is also very cinematographic in artistic terms, and his films are among the most beautiful I have ever seen. Thirst is all that - it's about the said priest and the oppressed, nonviolent woman he falls in love with - and more. It's horror, drama and even comedy as Park disarms its audience with many inappropriate but humorous situations. As such, this may be his best work for me, as his other two films I've seen lack the humor that would make her more comfortable for repeated visits.
