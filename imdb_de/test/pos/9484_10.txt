After watching this DVD, I was down. It is so wonderful. Not only does it capture Led Zeppelin during its performances, it also spans several years. This only shows the growth of the band and the growth of their great music. This DVD is a must! The DVD is over 5 hours with extras. The extras are also great pieces, some of the band performing in Denmark, and other promo spots. This material contained once-lost material that, thankfully, was restored and carefully restored to 5.1 Dolby Digital under the direct supervision of Jimmy Page himself. Contains many timeless classics like Stairway To Heaven, Going to California, What is and should never be, Moby Dick and so many more. Great acoustic songs are also included. This will correct any thought that Jimmy Page is not an absolute guitar legend!
