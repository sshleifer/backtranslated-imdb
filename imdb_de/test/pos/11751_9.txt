Directed by veteran Hollywood director Henry King, who began his career in 1915, Love is a Many Splendored Thing was one of his last great films. It is based on a bestseller by Han Suyin, simply called A Many Splendored Thing. This sentence was borrowed by the author from the poem The Kingdom of God by Francis Thompson, where this much pompous word "love" was used in a very different and more transcendent way. Context means the love of God. The film, written in the 1950s, together with works by directors such as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli, marked a kind of revival of the melodrama, its heyday, and once again reached a peak of popularity. <br /> <br /> The story begins when a handsome American reporter, Mark Elliott, played by William Holden, arrives in Hong Kong once more in one of his irresistible "Playboy" roles and meets a young and handsome Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones), half-Chinese descent of England, works as a doctor in a hospital and her husband was recently killed by Chinese Communists. Mark immediately feels a strong attraction for her, but in the beginning his deep feelings are not properly answered by Han, when he became cold after the death of her husband ("I believe in a human heart now only as a doctor"). But very soon she succumbs to hell's persistent courtship. Mark and both enter into a passionate relationship that seems to be unstoppable, even though Mark is unhappily married and his wife does not want to divorce him. Differences and prejudices caused by Han's Chinese origins. But it is still fate that has one last word to say when it comes to determining the fairness of the eternity of such a blissful love affair, no matter how long the two assume it is a merciless time Waiting in a rather alarming form of death At any given time, prove its impermanence. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly one of the most romantic films ever made, Love is a Many Splendored Thing performs excellently by William Holden and Jennifer Jones, a wonderful Oscar-winning starred by Alfred Newman and an extremely romantic, Touching, heartwarming and ultimately heartbreaking story. Do not miss so many great movies. 8/10 <br /> <br />
