One of the BEST movies I have seen in a long time. Bechard has a whole new perspective, and this film does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> This movie lets you guess, and with its seemingly taboo subjects, it keeps you on the screen. There are no bad guys or good guys, that's what Bechard does. The characters are so perfectly complex that you feel for each one of them, you care about what they've been through. <br /> <br /> Bechard's dedication to detail is in this world of "FAST FOOD MOVIES" and unrivaled in some areas may seem a bit uncomfortable - you'll love the feeling that comes with it. <br /> <br /> I've heard that it has been said too often that there are no NEW stories to tell. Thanks, Gorman Bechard, for proving the wrong thing. <br /> <br /> Run, do not go to see this movie.
