The theme is banal even in 1942. It is war propaganda. The fascists are among us and they are doing everything in their power to sabotage the war effort, to prepare their victory and seizure of power, and to establish an effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock has to make a real thriller. He invents a first sabotage that is successful, but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the main suspect and escapes to sabotage. This enables him to visit the country, so to speak, and to discover the tricky organization of the local Nazis, who have acquaintance and support in the most benevolent society, and who use the small, small, dissatisfied whites for the dirty work. The persecution of the real saboteur leads our young false suspect from Los Angeles to New York and at the head of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who believes that his senses do not know that the guy is not guilty, his niece, who is a star of the billboard, but also a frenetic and fanatical patriot who only thinks of the police. Then the rich rancher and his conspirator's nest. Then on the road a sympathetic and friendly truck driver, the long caravan of a circus and her dwarf, a bearded wife, Siamese sisters and several other grotesques of that nature. And he discovers the target in a soda city, an electric dam, the Los Angeles and provides its war industry with the energy they need. He will participate in the sabotage of a USS Alaskan military ship as gravel in the organization when it is launched. And finally, he and the pianist's niece manage the cleanup with a bit of ingenuity, creativity and elbow grease. Most of them are arrested and the first saboteur, a certain Fry, falls off the torch of the Statue of Liberty. This one will not fry on the old electric sparking chair. But Hitchcock does not have the habit of making a personal cameo appearance in his own films, so do not look for him. It's well built and well performed, but it's just a propaganda movie with an extra style. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
