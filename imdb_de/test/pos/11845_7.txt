"Seeing Other People" is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson) who are engaged and want to marry soon. They live together but have doubts about their relationship. Alice realizes that she has had so few sexual relationships in the past that she may have married Ed because she had never felt anything else. They agree to hang around with other people for a while to test their own relationship. <br /> <br /> The film makes up for a preliminary question by focusing too much on the "what if?" Can it actually do the opposite and only force you to feel more forced? When Ed starts having sex with a college girl, he becomes addicted and almost forgets Alice. When he realizes that, it scares him. <br /> <br /> I had not heard anything about this movie before, but I enjoyed it. It's not very well done and definitely has the intentionally low-budget indie feel, but it's way better than most romantic comedies that exist in the mainstream these days.
