The connection with James Dean: In short, Emilio Estevez plays with a teddy bear (remember the first scene of Ray's "Rebel without Cause"). The main conflict is Estevez vs Sheen, father to son, as in "East of Eden". The soldier came home and nobody could communicate with him, even his sister (a psychology student, what a joke). The mother, a raw matron (a great Kathy Bates), gets buried in nougatine, she can not understand that her values ​​(religion, family) are a thing of the past, especially for someone like his son, whose innocence was betrayed. The father, an undecided man, under the thumb of his wife, wanted to play the macho, but wanted to make up for the mediocrity of his life. Therefore, he saved his "honor" by forcing his son to give up. The scene It is very violent how Estevez's hatred for his father explodes. The actor-director makes a restrained performance, internalizes how Lee Strasberg's students did it, and his last outburst tenfold.
