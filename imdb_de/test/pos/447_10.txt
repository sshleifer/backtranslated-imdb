The "canvas" is freshly polished with this beautiful movie about aging happily and enjoying the rainbows of life. There is plenty of silver hair on this canvas, but the name of the film is more than 85 years old, with its energy, humor and love of life. The story of entertainer Uncle Frank, his dedicated wife, Aunt Tillie, and the lively residents of the local nursing homes inspires us to "live each day as if it's your last" and to give hope to the often dreaded golden years. A great movie for young and old audience!
