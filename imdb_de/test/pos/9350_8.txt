Film Noir at its finest. Immediately after the Second World War (1946) "Crossfire" shows the good, evil and ugly of this time. Monty Montgomery kills Sam because Sam is a Jew and therefore automatically perceived by Monty's slender lens to have been a negligent who has stepped out of the war. Monty does not like such people. The truth is that Sam was also a soldier, but the truth is something that disappears when you feel right about the ideologies of hatred you've been immersed in and the world is full of filthy this and that and She urgently needs brand of "cleaning". <br /> <br /> Monty is a sadist who wins soldiers clothes. The losers of World War II had more than their share and hateful, biased leaders and soldiers. Some of them were hanged for war crimes, such as the beginning of a "war of aggression". <br /> <br /> This film got into trouble when America's other sadistic cleaner, Joe McCarthy, brought his hearings into the early hours of the 50s. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" to see how good an actor Robert Ryan was. The real Robert Ryan was not a Monty. He was a great, if underrated, actor. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" and get to know the dark side of the post-World War II America. Take a look as well to get an idea of ​​the good side of late 40's American America. Robert Mitchim and Robert Young also play leading roles. Mitchim could have played Ryan's role, which he did when he played the psychopath in "Cape Fear."
