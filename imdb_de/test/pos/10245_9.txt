Leading actor Yuko Tanaka does so much in the extraordinarily meditative "The Milkwoman", a quiet opportunity to highlight missed opportunities in the life of a 50-year-old woman and portray her routine with truly poignant motives. Akira Ogata's unconventional, romantic movie, which is played in the quaint, tranquil city of Nagasaki, is less of a direct melodrama than a deliberate look at the characters who indulge in their current lives because of a tragic past that was enforced. They had the choice that they did not demand. <br /> <br /> Tanaka plays perfectly the necessary world fatigue, which is subject to a mindless routine, and plays Minako Oba, a middle-aged woman who shifts in her grocery store in front of her working shift takes it on, milk bottles between the residents to deliver the hilly Nagasaki. One of the houses she constantly comes by to make such a delivery is Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a local government employee who takes care of her terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were high school highschools who have since parted with each other thanks to a nefarious parenting incident. <br /> <br /> Opened his film with the unsuspecting narration of a young Minako who vows to leave Nagasaki, Ogata does as such with the narrative, patiently staying with Minako while he, sent by Tanakos inconspicuous but highly effective Supported by performance, she follows - whether she is talking to her aunt (Misako Watanabe) about a single, or going up and down countless steps of her hilly town to distribute milk - as she and Kaita have gradually overcome the obstacles that they had separated for years. This undisturbed development may not suit viewers who are weaned from fast-paced stories, but for the rest, it is an intimate introspection that is powerful and emphatic.
