Betty is a sergeant in a production of Verdi's Macbeth, who is asked to continue if the Diva is injured in a car accident. In the great tradition of "The Scottish Play", however, the production seems to be abused with problems, of which not least a madman cuts the crew. Unfortunately for Betty, the killer seems to have special plans for her ... <br /> <br /> This is one of several unconditional Argento bats, especially for the extraordinary photography of the great British cinematographer Ronnie Taylor. I did not measure it, but I estimate that two-thirds of the footage in this movie is either pans, dollies, tracking or cranes - the sheer amount of camera movement is amazing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller. The images are wild and dizzying - close-ups of the heroine's eyes are opened with nails, an opera house glides from a raven's point of view, shots of the killer's brain, a bullet shot through a peephole, a swallowed chain of a victim's trachea. Conceptually, it is just amazing and could only be realized by this director. The film is not without flaws. The cast is variable at best - Marsillach and Barberini are both a bit shaky (and his English-language dubbing is disgusting even by Italian standards), even though director Nicolodi of Argento is joking and Charleson a thoughtful performance in a more pretentious role offers as a bit autobiographical (a horror director who was much ashamed because of his seclusion and his reliance on technology). The material is a beautiful three-way mix of The Phantom Of The Opera, Shakespeare and Slasher movie written by Argento and his usual collaborator Franco Ferrini, with dodgy suspects and the usual disdain for boring exposer scenes to explain what is really going on. Full of different music - Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini and of course Verdi. The scenes in the beautiful opera house were filmed at the Teatro Regio in Parma. For some bizarre reason, the UK print of this movie has the alternate title Terror At The Opera.
