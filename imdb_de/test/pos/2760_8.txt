Graphically, it's the same game as the first, just different levels and some new features added for fun. <br /> <br /> The PS1 version still has a problem with giving skaters enough room to do some floor tricks. The Dreamcast version, which is rarely seen anymore, was the best version of the 4 versions (Xbox finally released a fifth with 2x), it had the clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and were better suited for PS1 and N64 , <br /> <br /> The levels are really amazingly well done, from start to finish, as the first, the school was my favorite. I enjoyed this level so much, not just for the golf cart, which would sometimes overrun you but for the length. I liked that in the first two games, they do not graphically improve these games, they just focus on the length of the level, which is cool. <br /> <br /> All in all, as good as the first. and it's worth playing.
