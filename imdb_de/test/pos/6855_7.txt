I saw Anatomy years ago - dubbed in a house of friends I do not remember well, and then I saw in the video library that there was a second - not really related to the first, the Franka Ponte with a small cameo makes. And that was okay, not as good as the first. I see the first one tonight again - not referred to as a collector's edition. I really like German movies, it's very interesting and people and cults like those in the movie might exist, I think, I do not know. But it is very scary and scary. Anatomy 2 is a bit different and the characters are not as good as the first ones. But if you really thought that anatomy is interesting and good, you should see the second one.
