For everyone who enjoyed the show, this movie will be something to see. However, it leaves much to be desired. I loved how each character (detective) performed. At least with the end of who the fourth chair is because they leave a reason for another movie. My guess is of course Bayless. Just like the series was a very well composed series of scenes. This is a series that I wish she had lived. Thank you to the cast for a wonderful TV.
