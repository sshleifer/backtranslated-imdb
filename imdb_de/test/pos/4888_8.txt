Whether you are a fan of the series that inspired them or not, there is no doubt that this is a patchy piece of work. But in the best sense. Messrs. Pemberton, Dyson, Shearmsith, and Gatiss did not quite cope with the tricks of old sitcoms that made an unpleasant transition to the big screen possible. inevitably to rehash some of their favorite characters. It is a pity that they did not stick to a more consistent League of Gents movie, because as ingenious as she herself is included in the script, the finished film weakens. It is worth renting.
