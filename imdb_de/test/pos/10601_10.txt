I loved this movie and I see it every day. I think although the acting is not great, it's really just a group of people who enjoy a script. I had searched for this movie for almost a year, and when I found it for thirty dollars, I just had to get it. It is now by far my favorite movie of all time. It's about relationship failure and at the same time makes a joke about it. I loved all the parts with Don Vito, especially the one in which Valo asks him about a grape when they sit on the porch. IT really represents him as he really is. The role in "Making Of" really touched me when they talked about Brandon Novak's heroin addiction and how much his friends and family wanted to help him. A new movie called "Dreamseller" is in production, which is about the story of Novak's dreams, which is shaken by his addiction.
