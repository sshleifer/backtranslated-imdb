I only gave him seven, because the acting is good. And of course that's Wilkinson. The other two clients were "decent". But the characters themselves ... what was so bad about the character Wilkinson was playing (James Manning)? I did not see him like the Martinet Emily Watson accused him of. On the other hand, Bill Bule was an unbearable jerk I prayed would experience a most brutal and protracted downfall. Who did I kid off? Tom Wilkinson is not Paul Bettany. So, what on EARTH have Emily Watson's (Anne) character SEE in him ???? She admitted that he was a bit of a dizziness in his treatment. Why did she even want to be in the same city as he, not to say the same "room"? <br /> <br /> I've noticed some other reviews, one person said she ended up "crying" to witness James' tragedy. ??? WHAT tragedy? You mean losing an idiot who finds someone like Bill Bule AMUSING ??? !!! Give us a break.
