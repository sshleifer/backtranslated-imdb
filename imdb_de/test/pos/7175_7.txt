How important is the director anyway? In this film, which was made in the politically turbulent times of the late 1960s, in which issues of social organization were major conflicts, he poses this question by making a film that distracts the camera from the action and only director William Greaves revealed. It is an important work, because it shows the difficulties of blocking, organizing and setting the scene like no other film; it shows the role of the occupation, something that most directors frankly like to completely disappear, and that invisibility is essential to lift unbelief; and it also takes into account the role of performance and scripting and how they fit / disagree with reality and what that has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality (if at all). <br /> <br /> The documentary, or pseudo documentary, or fictional narrative (whatever you prefer, about your interpretations of the subjects) has its brains in the over-educated, over-intellectual crew, its guts in the lost performers who try to understand the vague and ambiguous directions and his heart in the director, who is as the desire to represent, portray, express, without suspecting how he should do these things or why he wants it. It is a film that deliberately repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities. It's a film that sometimes shows several shots at the same time, just to let the audience work on it, and to show how awkwardly different shifts the perspective. <br /> <br /> It is an important work and something that everyone is interested in the industry and the process of filmmaking should be watching and understanding. Like many experimental films, there is no real crowd magnetism - it's not for them. For the industry and the 1960s, the question is what to do with a group work medium that still relies on a single "voice" and "author". <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
