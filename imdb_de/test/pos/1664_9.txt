I've wanted to see that since my French teacher recommended it to me over forty years ago. Maybe the long wait was worth it, as the DVD restoration of the Criterion Collection is impressive. This film follows in its outline the well-worn script: A men's quartet eagerly planned a difficult robbery on a vault The attack takes place, a small, seemingly insignificant event leads to the final downfall of all. Although the robbery material of the robbery is only fixed, it occurs quite early and is ultimately not the focus of the film. This film is different from the typical heirloom movie in that it gives us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations - it plays both a drama and a thriller.

Luckily, this scene occurs outside the camera, but you probably will not forget it. After this sobering event, with little hope for a revival of this relationship, Tony encounters two of his old crime partners, Jo and Mario, and decides to make one last major raid.

But Cesar's feminine inclination is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for everyone involved. However, we can understand his attraction for the nightclub singer he fell in love with, because there's a brilliant set where she performs a sexy and cinematic nightclub act - it must be one of the most memorable scenes of a Noir movie. <br /> <br /> Very early on Tony has shown a close relationship with Jo and his family. In fact, Jos's son calls him an uncle. I think it's partly to help Jo's family that Tony agrees to the raid. The final scenes in which Tony rescues the life of Jos's kidnapped son alleviate some of his more brutal and amoral actions. But only partially
