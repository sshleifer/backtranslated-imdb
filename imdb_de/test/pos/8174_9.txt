I've found that this epic is amazing, striking, even heartbreaking. A kind of monumentality in beauty and decorative richness, a great dramatic movement and dynamic. The choreography is very pleasing, the actors are absolutely enjoyable. I was a big fan of CROUCHING TIGER? also, but this one was even better. They have Kitano's ingenuity in enjoying what is pleasant. This beauty-conscious adventure cinema is an act of courage. When was the tension so exquisite and genuine? And the art of showing huge crowds, huge armies? The film has something very satisfying and a good taste. It's a huge pleasure to make such a deliberately impressive and clean show. Few, few adventure films, let alone epics, made me so enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> Fan can be monumental. is not a monumental art, but makes monumental fun, like Leone's films like some epics from the 60s; I also like the hobbits trilogy. It's great fun.
