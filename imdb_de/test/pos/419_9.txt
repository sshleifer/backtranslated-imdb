Everywhere I hear that people call this show bad because their premise is too far-fetched. Maybe a good-natured taxi driver in Philly drives them on (at least the taxi drivers who met), but that makes it great. The show is great. <br /> <br /> The fact that this show is a bit out of touch is an issue, but it's still fun and fun. It's very good to see and although you know Mike wins in the end, he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does an excellent job in the title role. His side cast is great and I have to say that the location of the show is especially great. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm watching this show, not because I'm looking for a good dose of reality or a show with a lot of action. I watch this show because they have great acting, a good one Condition and every week has a great story. It's also a plus if I can pick the sights he passes by or know which intersection he's on. I love this show and I love Philly !! Give this show a shot!
