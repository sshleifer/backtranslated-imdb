Before I forget it, let me say that the artwork here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this were not animated, critics would praise the "direction" here because it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story: Sylvester picks the garbage in the yards, but the pickins are slim. While brooding on the dock next to a large ship, he spots Tweety in his cage in a porthole. Tweety discovers him too, and you know his first comment - the same comment he always makes when he discovers the cat. Anyway, Sylvester runs over, opens the porthole and says, "Hello, breakfast!" Tweety slaps the bull's-eye window on his face and says, "You nasty old yummy hangover!" The cat falls into the water. <br /> <br /> The intrepid New Year's Eve sneaks back on board quickly, dips into Tatty's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - "Grandma" is standing at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester is beaten when the old lady protects her bird again. But, "flippety gibbet," says granny, "I've dropped my glasses, I can not see anything without them, Heaven for Betsey, where are these cheats." Now Sylvester has done the upper hand .... and the normal cat trying to catch a bird is back on, like grandma's glasses. Sylvesters smartest act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on her. If she woke up and put her on, she would see the bird and think it was alright. <br /> <br /> a very entertaining animated shorts that was a lot of fun. As you can see from the quotes, I love the dialogue in some of these old cartoons.
