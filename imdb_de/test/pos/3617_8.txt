I have to admit that I approached this film with a sense of expectation and fear. The bestselling novel by Louis de Berniere is one of my favorites, and anyone who reads it will find that there is no way that screen customization can be 100% true. <br /> <br /> I convinced myself all the way that the movie was not successful, and had the plot of the book so far away that it became superfluous. The end, however, is much better than the one in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie. Still, the accusations (John Toll's great cinematography, Stephen Warbeck's great score, etc.) were, in my opinion, no bigger than my initial negatives (Cages Miscasting, a heavily diluted screenplay). But two days later, I was back in line to see Corelli, and although this is not perfect, I must now admit that the movie is the best that anyone would have expected. Cage is truly brilliant in a role that even de Berniere was not exactly a round character: his carefree mind giving in to broken remorse is just right and perfectly complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt. David Morrissey is quietly operating as Weber, the Nazi officer who tries to reconcile his feelings for his newly discovered Italian friends and inbreeding superiority complex with those of his surroundings. And the subtle Greek-Italian side occupation makes de Berni√®res sun-drenched world of Cepholonia flash. <br /> <br /> When I left the cinema for the second time, I finally let go of my passion for the novel, which kept me from fully appreciating the book's history of World War II cepholonia in cinematic terms. My hat goes to John Madden, who despite the anticipated critical drumming he receives from the British critics (any director who has had a great success like Shakespeare in Love is always a target for those groaning dwarfs!) Is a tremendous one to translate this difficult book with so much passion, verve and humanity (the core virtues of the novel in fact) to the big screen that he has created another classic love story that will probably be fully appreciated only when the dust has settled down a bit some years. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the book like me, it's hard, but do not try to make the same mistake at first sight. Try to put the book out of your mind for two hours, take a dip in the beautiful Mediterranean atmosphere and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, dr. Iannis, as if it were the first time (pretending to see something from an original script). And I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, you're looking forward to your own copy of this wonderful movie on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> 8/10
