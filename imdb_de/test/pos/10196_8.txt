Looks like robocop writer The The Vindicator plundered plunder. This is a very solid horror / action movie about a man who was set up in an accident to be used in cruel experiments. Everyone who has seen Robocop knows the story. Watch out for Pam Grier as a bitchy and damn good-looking assassin. This highly effective, violent and bloody horror movie may not be for everyone, but this Canadian excursion is well worth it for anyone who loves the genre. 8.10
