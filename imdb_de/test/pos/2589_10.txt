Having just received the "Loony Tunes Golden Collection" (which, by the way, I highly recommend), I will try to comment on most, if not all, of the cartoons individually. Therefore, the start statement may seem superfluous to those who read multiple reviews. I apologize for that. <br /> <br /> Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two are "Rabbit Fire" and "Duck! Rabbit, Duck.") Bag and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd is shorting That makes me laugh EVERY ONE TIME! On the DVD there is a comment, a choice and just music. <br /> <br /> My Note: A + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Disk 1: An Introduction to Chuck Jones, The Boy of Termite Terrice Part 1, clips from the films "Two Guys from Texas" and "My Dream is Yours", both with bugs-cameos; Bridging sequences for an episode of the "Bugs Bunny Show"; the Astro Nuts audio recording session; 2 vintage trailers; "Blooper Bunny: Bugs Bunny 51st and a Half Jubilee" with optional commentary with author Greg Ford & Stills Gallery
