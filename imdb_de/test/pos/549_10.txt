I saw "Anywhere But Here" last night as a free preview. I absolutely loved the movie! I was attracted to the realistic portrayal of a mother-daughter relationship ... there was definitely a connection between Adele a and Ann. I think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was just the right actress to portray Adele, and after leaving the theater, I could not think of any other actress in the role. Portman was also excellent as Ann. She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that, in my opinion, no other teenage actress can. I think that the Academy of Arts and the Sciences of Cinematography should give recognition where appropriate and nominate both Sarandon and Portman for awards in the categories "Actress" and "Supporting Actress". It would be a pity if they were overlooked.
