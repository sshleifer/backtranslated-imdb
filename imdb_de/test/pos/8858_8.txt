The Thing has to be one of the best movies ever. Of course, it was groundbreaking special effects at the time of release that impressed me so much. In 1982 I was blown away, I had never seen anything like it! Although the effects themselves made the movie even more terrifying, it was the story itself, the music score, the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic, and the interaction and tension between the members of the convicted research station that make it a classic. <br /> <br /> Movies will not be better than that! In the opening scene where the helicopter chases after this Husky, just assume that bored scientists were at a station releasing some steam. However, if you see them continuing their hunt at the US base, then think that the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme stress on cabin fever. However, this is compensated by the menacing opening music that sets the pace! They only know that something is wrong! At this point it is a mystery until "the thing" reveals itself. <br /> <br /> However, the mystery returns because it becomes a kind of Agatha Christie's "Who Dunnit" (ie, ten little Indian movies) in the sci-fi style, because the members do not really know who their team is is an alien. The suspicion goes back and forth between them, they are gradually beaten off or revealed as aliens. The mistrust between the station crews increases with the progression of the film until the final showdown. <br /> <br /> After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film production, the special effects in "The Thing" have no effect The same weight as in 1982, but otherwise it is very good with some great performances of the cast.
