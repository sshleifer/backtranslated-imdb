The railroad children are perhaps my favorite movie of all time, simply because of the brilliant acting of the performers, the warm, humane interaction of the three children and the people they meet near the railroad in the beautiful English countryside. Jenny Augutter is particularly credible in her role as Bobbie, the older brother of her sister Phyllis and brother Peter. The adventures they discover and the relationships that emerge in their new homes and surroundings are very real and fascinating. The scenery is lovely, the trains part of Britain's great history and the soundtrack is very moving. This heartwarming movie always brings tears to my eyes, and I often feel homesick. I often wonder if I was born in this era, thinking I would have been a good fit if people treated each other with such chivalry and decency. <br /> <br /> In short, I consider this film a masterpiece and a must-have for anyone who considers himself a 'sensitive or caring guy'. Edith Nesbit wrote this story in the beginning The kids of today need to read that or watch the movie instead of playing violent video games. If we had more films of this kind, the world would be a better place.
