This is another Western about a greedy cattle baron who wants to supplant small ranchers and farmers. It has certainly been done before and after. But The Violent Men is special. <br /> <br /> What makes it special is Barbara Stanwyck, who often plays the role of the vixen in her later films. She is married to the crippled Edward G. Robinson, who is the cattle baron here, but Robinson is crippled and there are indications that his injuries may have rendered him powerless. No matter Barbara, whose needs are met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith. This does not fit with Dianne Foster, the daughter of Robinson and Stanwyck, nor with Lita Milan, who is Keita's Mexican girlfriend of Keith The sturdy little rancher, a veteran of the Civil War, who came west because of his health, can assert himself here. He is every inch the quiet western hero that people commit to push once too often. I almost expect the famous words of Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Ford's mouth: "I am a peaceable man." Very applicable in the Vioilent Men. <br /> <br /> The 1950s was the age of the adult western. Themes entered into horse operas that had not previously been explored. The following year, Glenn Ford made another Western, Jubal, one of his best, which also explores infidelity as an action component. <br /> <br /> There's plenty of traditional Western stuff in The Violent Men and a lot for those who are addicted to soap operas.
