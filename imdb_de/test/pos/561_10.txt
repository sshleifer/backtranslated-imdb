Art imitates life imitating art. Atticus Finch is in the D.A. born again. In this tragic and exciting gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how it happened. The authenticity and sometimes hesitant honesty of individuals make this story into a compelling story in many layers. Although racism is one of the issues, there are other elements, such as work ethic, integrity, and grief, that have led me to watch and review this film over and over again. The music is driving, but not intrusive. The pace and the visual elements are such that the fact that they are real people who make an authentic experience is not to be confused.
