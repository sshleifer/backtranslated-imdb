I think that's a great, classic monster movie for the family. The mole, what a machine! The big creature with its beak, the flying green lizards, Ranthorincus / mayas or whatever they are, and the monkeys talk telepathically with them. The fight of men in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast! delicious! Great, what else can I say? How would you make a remake of this in 2002?
