I watched this movie on TV after 30 years or more. Some aspects of the film were remarkable, though he looked at it so many years after its creation. <br /> <br /> The story of the little-known C Virgil Georghiu is remarkable, almost like a Tolstoy-like story of a man who has made a buffy through a cosmic scheme he can not understand. Compare this film to more well-known contemporary works such as Spelberg's "Schindler's List," and you begin to realize that the trauma of World War II is against the broader dimension of racism beyond the simple National Socialist notion of Aryan Vs. Jews should be seen. This film touches the dislike of the Hungarians against the Romanians, the dislike of the Romanians against the Russians, etc. and even the questionable relations of the Jews to their Christian-Rumanian friends while they are under stress. <br /> <br /> Like me I have not read the book, it's hard to see how much the director and screenwriters have changed. For example, it is interesting to study the view of the Romanian peasant, to emigrate to the US to earn money, only to return to Romania and invest his income there. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the character of Johann Moritz was probably one of the best roles Anthony Quinn played alongside his work in "La Strada", "Zorba the Greek" and "Barabbas". <br /> <br /> The most beautiful and memorable sequence in the film is the last one where Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi try to smile. The father, who wears a Russian-born daughter's daughter, is a story of its own, but the director can show reconciliation with a simple gesture - carrying the child without getting into melodramatic shots. <br /> <br Today, after the death of Princess Diana, we often talk about the insensitive paparazzi. The final sequence is an indictment of the paparazzi and the insensitive media (Director Verneuil also makes a similar remark during the courtroom as the cameramen prepare for Moritz). <br /> <br /> The interaction between church and state was so nicely summarized in the laconic statement of the Orthodox priest: "I pray to God that he leads those who have power to use them well." <br /> <br /> Some of the short shots, such as a secretary of a minister scribbling while listening to a petition, have said so much in so little footage. The direction was so impressive that the cut recedes into the background. <br /> <br /> What impressed me most was the exquisite, colorful texture provided by cameraman Andreas Winding - from the brilliant credit sequences to the end. I remember being the cameraman of another French favorite movie called "Ramparts of Clay" by Jean-Louis Bertucelli. I have not seen such use of color for a long time, except for the David Lean epics. <br /> <br /> There were shortcomings: I wish Virna Lisi's character was more pronounced. I could never fully understand the character of Serge Reggiani - the only intellectual in the entire film. The station scene at the end seems to stand out from the west by Sergio Leone. After all, the film was essentially built on a love story that unfortunately takes a back seat. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie impressed me in several sections. History is as relevant today as it was when it was made.
