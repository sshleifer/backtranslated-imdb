First of all - what do some of you think? This is the best movie I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Second, I do not think about a British movie because he plays in Dublin and has mostly Irish actors - Moran, Gambon, Aisling O Sullivan (Rita), Deirdre O'Kane, etc. <br /> Third, I found Moran excellent. He was weirdly funny. Micheal Caine just seemed to be there to understand Moran's context. He perfected every figure he took. <br /> <br /> Abigail Iversen I thought it was better than any other child actor I've ever met. She was credible as a smart kid and also as a child and adult (yes, I know that sounds weird, but hey ...). She even managed to put Caine in the foreground. <br/> <br/> Iversen and Moran worked very well together and were very funny in the preparatory scene. <br /> <br /> Barreler (Gambon) was very funny in his inability.
