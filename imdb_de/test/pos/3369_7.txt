Even for science fiction, this movie is a bit out there. Okay, more than a bit ... My first thought after seeing it was that I had just lost my mind. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie and expect another Darko. Darko fans will never like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freakish cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, overcome that. <br /> <br /> Richard Kelly loves to make movies that make you feel stupid because you do not understand the "deeper meaning" when you first hear them see. To be honest, I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it. <br /> <br /> The deeper meaning (to save you some sociological psycho games) people are selfish, we make decisions that can destroy our lives, and open no post office without return address. <br /> <br /> Summary: Creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz, if you push the button, I'll kill someone you do not know and give you a million dollars. Of course, she pushes it and as promised, the creepy old man gets a purse. Then the film dives into the unusual. To save my fingers typing ... To push the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural beings in a lavish experiment to judge humanity's morality. <br /> <br /> I liked: The film's willingness to ignore the general movie guidelines. It is different. It's intense. It has a deeper meaning (though its philosophy is material). It lets you guess. NO Hollywood Ending! <br /> <br /> I did not like it: why would any creature with the technology to inhibit another form of life put up such a ridiculous scheme? Which god like alien has the patience for it? Diaz was good, but did you need the country accent? They live in Virginia. <br /> <br /> I'm giving a 7 because Kelly did not pay much attention to details like his other films. Overall good movie.
