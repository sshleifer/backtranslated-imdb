Barbora Bobulova's depiction of Valeria in this story was absolutely captivating and heartbreaking at the same time. It's been a long time since I've seen so much hidden passion and mystery presented by every actor, just using her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth as Barbora did with that figure. It was absolutely believable as Valeria and I were carried away with their characterization of this role. The film was suddenly real life and fantasy, the clever use of limited dialogue fascinated me. I was forced to read between the lines, and each of the main actors used the art of body language and emotional intention to convey a powerful action. In particular, Barbora was visually stimulating in an almost asexual and sexy way. This comment can easily refer to any of the many emotions that are caused by their performance. Unconscious in dialogue but strong in terms of presence. I was captured by these actresses and eagerly looking for more of her work.
