Wow, "The Curse of Michael Myers", what a great movie. Exciting, entertaining, creative and a clever plot that I love. Many hate the "Thorn" concept, I love it. I think there is an action to the Halloween series. Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and performs excellently, especially for her first movie. Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are great too. My only complaint is, why was not Danielle Harris in this movie as Jamie? She wanted to return, but the producers said no. I loved J.C Brandy, but I love Danielle Harris. Nevertheless, I love Halloween: the curse of Michael Myers. I think The Shape's mask looks best in this movie, and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers ever. Incredibly scary and exciting, Halloween 6 rules! <br /> <br /> I love this very violent but incredibly enjoyable movie. The Halloween horror series - by far the best in the genre. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
