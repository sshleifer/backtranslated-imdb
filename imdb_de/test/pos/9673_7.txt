I've had all seasons of the family so far and I have to say Vol. 6 was the biggest disappointment of all. There is still a lot to laugh about, but I think Vol. 6, like the last volumes, is slowly making less and less laughter. At least for me. <br /> <br /> The biggest trouble with Vol. 6 seems to be very difficult in the left politics. I am firmly convinced that if you can laugh at other people, you should be able to laugh at yourself, but this band REALLY seems to be putting their political views in the neck, and I think it takes a lot of that Show. Assuming all the conservative states are terrible places, subordinates, we need more gun control, schools are underfunded, hired religious people are crazy, Bush is friends with the devil br /> <br /> Sure, some of them were funny, but it will a point if you do not make a comedy and you really just push your political views on other people.
