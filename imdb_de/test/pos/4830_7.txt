This is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival and undoubtedly the best the festival has to offer. I went into this film with little or no expectations after learning that the director was responsible for the horrible vampire movie The Forsaken. and I was pleasantly surprised. Movie star Lori marries In Crowd as a young mother whose husband has just passed away. She moves to an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that was a burial place for overworked children. Unfortunately, the children return with a vengeance and kill and eat everyone on their way. The film works on many levels. It's well done, exciting, it has particularly good spots and good performances from Compton. The atmosphere is scary and a bit unimpressive, the score is decent and the make-up effects are cruel and simple. The movie remains scary and disquieting, and the children themselves, with pale skin, wide-open lips and hollow eyes, are pretty scary and unyielding. The film is original and imaginative, without being too artistic or complicated. I can not see how this movie becomes a broad release, without a few trim and slight tweaking. But they definitely have a good product in hand and should pursue some kind of theatrical distribution. The theater in which I saw it, however, was terrible. The sound was terribly messed up, which I had taken out of the movie and stopped in the middle, because they could not center it on the screen, which somewhat lessened the mood. All in all, though it was the most satisfying entry into horror testing, perhaps because it had the least expectations, but was nevertheless a welcome addition to genre films.
