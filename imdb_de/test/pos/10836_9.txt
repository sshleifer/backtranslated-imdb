This was recommended to me by a friend who said it was cute and cuddly for a "lesbian sexuality". Boy, he was wrong. I think he just did not understand it. Growing up, gaining incomprehension and discovering oneself through trials and tribulations is more like this. <br /> <br /> The characters are full and lively and the story has enough fun in the theatrical performances to get everyone interested. <Br /> <br /> Rachael Stirling as "Nan" goes through so many attempts to find the love she desires, only to find that it was the only person she was afraid to reveal, and ran away. Johdi May as "Flo" was remarkable. I spent a few hours reminding myself of where I had seen her before, only to find that she was the quiet sister "Alice" in "Last of the Mohicans". So many people are missing such stripes. I am glad that I accepted the advice of my friend and tried it. But I'm sure I enjoyed it more than he did.
