Well, as you can see, I came to this party late. However, you have the advantage of reading all previous entries before you leave my comments. I found this page by accident when I was looking for other Marine Corps movies. Let me tell you that I played a naval boat in the movie Pvt. Labarsky and at that time was stationed in MCRDep, San Diego. Jack Webb and his crew selected 15 permanent employees, some of whom had the talking parts, and another 15 Marines who had just completed the Boot Camp. These were the Platoon and the Marines, who represented the various "DIs". For the benefit of my memory The Capt. And Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) did not belong to the Marines. We spent about three weeks in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), California, to film the section of the movie we were involved in, and then they took the other shots after we left. <br /> <br /> Just like me Let me roam here, and let me clarify some of the questions posed in earlier entries as best I can. "Cuff Daddy" commented on our train's ability to scream "Yes Sir" without moving and so on. Yes, we were screaming for the Sound Guys, and that was during the shoot. As you know Marines, when the DI or who ever started asking a question, and before completing it, you already took your breath away and could scream the right answer to your lungs. That's how it was done. <br /> <br /> "74Sooner" commented that he had walked through the same building on the Parisian island. As mentioned, all scenes were shot in Studio City, California. They are based on photos taken on the island of Paris, as well as on-site excursions and marine advisors from Paris. Sorry, you were in the real buildings, not the sets. <br /> <br /> "schappe1" produced a lot of good points, but about the incident on the train to Paris Island at the time Jack Webb said everything We were: "The film was made because of the accident and that The Marine Corps did not want to say anything that would affect the family members of the Marines who died that night, even though the Marine Corps would provide Marines and help for a movie that would answer to the public why a Marine DI does what he does does ". <br /> <br /> As mentioned by some of you, I also thought about myself at the time we were making the scenes. This dialogue was over-cleaned and obviously not as it is in the real world Life is over. This had to be done in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> One story I would like to share concerns the interaction between us Marines and the Movie Crew, and between the Movie Crew and Jack Webb. From the beginning, the Marines answered everyone who moved with "Yes, sir." In the second week it became increasingly common to hear "Yes Sir" from all directions. On the stage, someone called for something to do with the lights, and out of nowhere on a catwalk above the set came the answer "Yes Sir." At all our informal meetings, Jack Webb said. "If I had known that I got so much respect from this crew, I would have brought you here years ago." A lieutenant from San Diego had grown up taking on the role of DI from the other train and fighting Jack Webb, but during a shootout he could claim number 32, and Webb was still trying to work him through as he did wanted to have done and showed no lack of patience with him. The next day they used the Paris Island Advisor, a DI Sgt. Of Paris Island, and he worked well. <br /> <br /> At that time I was a kind of camera fanatic and met Still Camera Man to get a pointer from him, and as it turned out he gave me some still pictures and a part of the 35mm film of the daily shots that should not be used. I cut these filmstrips and made slides out of them. After being released in VHS cassette (The DI, 11706 B & W / 106 min.), My children and their big kids have a great time trying to see who's most likely to find me on the screen.
