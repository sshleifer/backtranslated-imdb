Another great achievement from Kiefer Sutherland. I love his films because he always plays his role very well. For a low budget movie this was done very well and kept me on the edge all the time. I love this kind of movies, and I was glad that I caught them. I will surely buy the DVD or the tape. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
