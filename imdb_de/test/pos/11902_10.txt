I was fortunate enough to see a test screening of 'El Padrino' in Santa Monica a few months ago. I was blown away. You do not see films like this anymore. Inspired by Scosese, Chapa cleverly tells the tragic story of Kilo as he maneuvers the rough streets of LA to rise above the ranks to become a drug ruler of Escobarianism. The characters are complex and contradictory. The emotions are real. The action is fast and furious. The stunts are extensive. And Tilly is hot. She did not look so good since she was 'bound'. I would recommend it to everyone. It's a fantastic tribute to the epic action movies of the late '80s and early' 90s. And to all the naysayers out there? look at it again; They had apparently closed their eyes the first time. Congratulations to everyone involved in the movie. I count the days until the release of the sequel. Does anyone have an appointment for this?
