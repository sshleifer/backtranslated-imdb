The efforts of a new group of young talents, backed by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, two gifted actors, make for an exciting and enthralling evening of entertainment. And I want to add that Hal Holbrook shines as a senator. This movie deserves five stars. I give a ten on your scale. And the end is perfect. I am always amazed at the ability of British actors to dominate our American accents. I was convinced that all the actors were born in Louisiana. And what a finer area for a mystery than New Orleans! The Big Easy, also known as Crescent City, pervades every scene. Sebastian Gutierrez deserves great praise as a writer and director.
