It is a thoroughly successful example of a biopic of the 50s. It has the robust and pretty young hero - well, not so young on the canvas; great, albeit improbable, director: Billy Wilder; a rousing, fully orchestrated score with uplifting scales and, if necessary, celestial strings by Franz Waxman; strong supportive players; a gripping story; stunning photography by Hitchcock Favorites Robert Burks; and a narrative about a unique historical event. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Jimmy Stewart as Charles Lindbergh, who wanted to fall asleep in a Long Island hotel from New York to Paris before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic. And he can not sleep. <br /> <br /> The flight itself is full of flashbacks to Lindbergh's personal history and the purchase and construction of his iconic high-decker, the Spirit of St. Louis. St. Louis, Missouri, is the home of the partnership that sponsored the flight. (Even in 1927, money was being talked about.) Anyway, the movie had to have several flashbacks and Stewart's story. What is the alternative? Observation of the units? Watching thirty-three hours as Jimmy Stewart silently sits at the controls of his noisy plane as days and nights come and go? I found the script and direction impressive for their time. Of course, unpleasant things are left out so as not to introduce more ambiguity than the contemporary public could create. <br /> <br /> My bet is that the howling mob surrounding Lindbergh in Le Bourget tore up the plane for souvenirs. And of course, nothing about the relief tube of the pilot, although this would have created more opportunities for humor. Some of today's viewers will find some incidents crazy when they think too much about it. At the top, Stewart chats with a friendly pickup fly that wakes him in his alarming manner by landing on his cheek at a critical moment. Later, St. Christopher's medal, given by Father Hussman, gently knocks on the glass crystal of one of the instruments just as Stewart desperately tries to land. The atheist Stewart is saved twice - once by a fly and once by God. <br /> <br /> But no matter. It is an impressive movie. The landing in Le Bourget, with a tired stewart behind the joystick, confused by headlights, sweaty with fear and collapsing with exhaustion, is really convincing. "I'm going to rip this plane to pieces," he says to himself and we can believe him. <br/> <br /> Flying a light plane is not like driving at all. There is no smoothly curved highway that tells you where to go, no lanes to guide you. You are busy every second. You need to watch the instruments, check each wing tip to see that they are touching the horizon, touching the nose of the plane, and constantly watching up, down, and sideways for the other traffic, though that would not have been a problem for Lindbergh. He was alone on the ocean. Why? In a folkloric moment of the film, Stewart and Murray Hamilton, two gypsy mutes of the 1920s, lounged near their planes in a field in the Midwest. Why do we love flying so much? "Asks Hamilton. (No answer.) Later, his backers try to keep him from flying. Five other airmen have already died in the attempt. "But do not you understand, it MUST be done," says a passionate Stewart. <br /> <br /> Well, that's not a big answer. Why does it have to be done now and why from Lindbergh? Why NOT wait ten years and in the meantime not waste any more lives? The answer, dear Socrates, lies partly in our glands. Pilots are a calm and self-confident post who is given occasional excitement. Your main problem could be a dependency on an adrenaline rush. Was just a joke. Some of my best friends are pilots. Nevertheless, Lindbergh was a pretty typical guy. He deserves to be treated as a hero. Not only because of the flight itself, but because of his later behavior - calm, modest, a family man. We can easily forget his admiration for Hitler, as he has more than made up for it by testing corsair fighters in the Pacific and advising the Navy on how to optimize the aircraft and get the best performance out of it. <br /> <br /> See it if you have the chance. Last but not least, it's a history lesson with visual splendor.
