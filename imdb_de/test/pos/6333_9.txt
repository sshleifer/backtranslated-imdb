I saw the movie years ago and was disappointed with its wasted potential. When I heard that it was a television series, I absolutely refused it. My best friend immediately became a rabid fan, and when I knew my love of horror movies, I could not believe I would not see a single episode. I told him that the movie had drawn me to life as far as BUFFY was concerned, and he told me to forget that the movie existed. He insisted that I try two episodes: "Once More With Feeling" and this one. <br /> <br /> Both are the reason why I am a BUFFY fan today. He was right - I was addicted right away. I have never seen a show with the courage to try an episode that has virtually no dialogue, and nothing else could have done it with the dizziness and pure creativity of BUFFY. I think X FILES might have got away with it if they had thought about it first, but I'm glad that BUFFY did it instead. <br /> <br /> It is a merit for all concerned that you are riveted for the entire hour and sometimes hang on the edge of your seat. And when it was over, I wanted to know more about each character. So I went out and bought the first set of the first season. And the rest is history ... <br /> <br /> I guarantee you that if you've never seen them before, you'll want to see more if you make this episode your first. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I do not give 10 out of 10 points is because I reserve this score for "Once More ...".
