This movie is completely underestimated. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that resembles Will Keenan and Patrick Hasson's Waiting, as well as Adrien Brody's Restaurant and the classic movie Breaking Away, which is about young adults who are stuck and know you're stuck have no chance to break free. <br /> <br /> Death By Pizza (Delivered) is an intelligent, permissive, artistic young adult (Will, played by David Strictland) who is stuck and waiting bitterly over the hypocrisy of the world and bitter about his own lack of orientation and desire. Will meets his nemesis, Reed (Ron Eldard), another intelligent young adult so bitter that he has chosen the path of crime. Both help each other to free themselves from their bitterness, allowing them to break away. <br /> <br /> For these young adults, letting go or liberating can mean that they both drive life forward and dive into death. <br /> <br /> Will's life is filled with the hallmarks of a young "stuck" adult: a mental, sweaty, underpaid job, rude customer, an ex-girlfriend who left him because he was unmotivated, a partial college education without a degree, a house of self-made art and, of course, the new friend whose godless decisions help him to save himself.
