Interesting twist of the vampire yarn - fast, loud and moody. Despite my initial fears, Kris K performs reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade offers a considerable physical presence. A lot of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies provide a pleasant change. If you like the black look of The Matrix, Blade will appeal to you, Blade even has a 'Dodge the Bullets' sequence.
