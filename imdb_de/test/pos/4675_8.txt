I enjoyed this movie. More than I expected. It has enough action, intrigue and places to make it worthwhile. Although I can not quite see Mark Wahlberg as a leader, he is good enough to be a credible manager and that's fine. <br /> <br /> The movie's superhero is the Mini Cooper. It has shown that it has the speed, the skill and the muscle to do any job. And deal with a crazy driver like Charlize Therons character.
