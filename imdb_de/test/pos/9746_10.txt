Flash Gordon was a first-class series. I know there were a few mistakes, but I did not see it because of the mistakes. Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not a trained actor, but he did a very good and convincing performance. Jean Rogers is pretty and around 20 years old. Old has done a pretty good job in my opinion. Charles Middleton as Emperor Ming is outstanding. He was in many other films, quite versatile, he was able to sing and dance. His portrayal of "Ming The Merciless" in all 3 Flash Gordon series was first-rate. The rest of the cast has also done a great job. Well, boys and girls, get popcorn, sit back and enjoy. John R.
