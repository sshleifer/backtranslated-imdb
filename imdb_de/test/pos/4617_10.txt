I must confess that I was in the cynical trap of believing that the Australians could not make a drama if it did not mean much crying and I'm an Australian. Sorry, right? Although this film includes crying, its not dramatic crying, but its honest emotion shines through. <br /> <br /> Again, this movie is an absolute idiot. I knew what the end result would be when I started to look at it, so I tried to guess who it would be. I missed me by a mile. <br /> <br /> I was stunned when I found out the director, Murali Thulluri was only around 21 when he made this movie. I would like to shake his hand. He can do a movie. I hope he has more. <br /> <br /> All the characters we meet before the main title (about 12 minutes) are an anti-hero. They are all worried in their own way, and all as selfish as the next. Even if they are sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The saddest scene in the movie, and there are some that are hard to see. The final scene in which we meet the true protagonist and we are told by her nephew. This scene made me cry. <br /> <br /> My belief in the Australian drama has been restored. We are masters in the comedy, but I got bored with the comedy. <br /> <br /> Murali, if you look at this, you have touched my soul and for that I can only thank you.
