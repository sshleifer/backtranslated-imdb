This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is really original. Same parts of porn, fairy tales and musical comedy - this movie is definitely a curious piece of adult movie history. Alice is a sexually naive librarian who follows the hare in Wonderland. where she can meet all sorts of "seasoned" crazies like Mad-Hatter (who likes to pull out his dong), Humpty Dumpty (who broke his Viennese with his shell), Tweedledee and Tweedledum (a sex) -crazed duo) and the bisexual Queen - among others. <br /> <br /> This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is actually quite tame by the standards of the time - a time when much porn was common. spirited and angry (as noted in the sub-genre "roughie") - this is actually quite funny and strangely appealing. It's the kind of things you would show your kids - if graphic sex were not. A little slow to the "good stuff" ... but really entertaining. Oh - and some of the musical numbers are very funny. If you're a drinker, have a few, if you're a smoker, roll a couple and give them a chance. 8.10
