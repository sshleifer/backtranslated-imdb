Swift's writing has more in common with Kafka and Orwell than with fantasy adventure writers, so it's strange that Gulliver's travels were considered a children's novel. Happy children! <br /> <br /> The same goes for this movie. There have been some really terrible versions of this story, which is why people are reluctant to look at this version. I mean, it's a TV movie by Muppetteer Jim Henson, so how could we expect anything but cuteness? <br /> <br /> Look again - beauty appears in the strangest places. Children love this movie enough to go through every three hours, but it also takes time to get Swift's dark vision right. I hate special effects, but here they are used to bring the story forward instead of just dazzling us. Please note that the producers have gone to the trouble of recruiting classic actors like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, who perform their eccentric roles with perfection. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the romance between Gulliver and Glumdalclitch becomes touching and moving. as well as funny (she is a little girl but twenty times her size). The frame story has a theme about absent fathers, to which many children refer. And the part about Gulliver in the asylum introduces an element of horror that deals with the abuse of authority (which apparently stems from Val Lewton's "Bedlam" [1946], another forgotten masterpiece). The VHS is always spinning pennies in the trade, which is an insult to the many great artists who put this thing together. I encourage the audience to recognize something good by getting this movie and inspiring others to look at it. Although it has a lot to offer kids, adults will find it fits well with classics like Aguirre, Brazil, 1984 and other serious fantastic works.
