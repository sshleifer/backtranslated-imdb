I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (I'm not sure why - I'm sure some shrink could make something out of it!) I spent a night in jail over 20 years ago, and I knew it then I would never go back - I got the individual version of "fear"! (I was locked up in an isolation cell in Alcatraz for a few hours, compliments from a park attendant, but that's another story!) Anyway, the genre really interests me. The soundtrack, specifically "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones, was the perfect backdrop for the film. To this day, every time I hear the song, I think of "The Jericho Mile."
