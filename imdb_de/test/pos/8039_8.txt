Christian Duguay led this tidy little spy thriller early in his career. It's quite regular on TV, albeit with some great scenes of violence and sex that are unfortunately trimmed. I finally came to see the theatrical version on a $ 3 band from the local video library. Naval officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to incarnate the infamous Carlos the Jackal, and he's a bit too involved in the role. Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley plays the supervisors of Quinn, with Sutherland being a real zealot and Kingsley the prudier. The first half of this funny streak shows how Quinn is trained and indoctrinated. The second half has him in the field, making love to the Jackal's wife and shooting them out with various enemies. The idea is to make the Jackal look like a mantle to the Russians, and take care of the world's most famous killer. Things are not going as planned. Sometimes I had almost expected the actors to laugh at some annoying dialogues, but everyone plays it very clearly. In the end, this is a terrific little thriller that deserves your attention. The former mistress of the Jackal taught the inquisitive and very married Quinn to roast her, to lick blood from her face and then to go down on her, alone is worth the price of admission.
