This is a kind of hidden gem. It has little to no advertising, no fanfare, no classic status and it deserves all that! One of the great directors of the cinema, Fritz Lang, has created a real gem in this excellent Western. A fine cast, led by Randolph Scott (in one of his probably biggest appearances), the ever-sturdy Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly accomplished buddy and many veteran performers: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and others an exciting one Zane Gray's story about the laying of the Western Union cable across the country. It has a tense drama, a few splashes of humor and great effects. It reminds of DeMille in a certain way and yet Fritz Lang leaves his own mark. At least this is a damn good Western!
