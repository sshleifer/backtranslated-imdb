The Violent Men is a good western. Perhaps this is not an original ranch owner who focuses on tearing small competitors out of a valley he needs for his growing cattle - but the film contains many ingredients that increase his level and make it worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The cast is a highlight. There is the faithful Glenn Ford (John Parrish) as a former army officer and now one of the small ranchers trying to stay out of trouble until he's pushed too hard. Edward Robinson (Lew Wilkinson) is almost always the crippled big man, and Barbara Stanwyck (Martha) plays his treacherous wife in one of her usual nasty female roles she easily deals with (others were in "Double Indemnity" and " Blowing Wild ") Brian Keith (Cole) does it perfectly as Robinson's armed brother, an ambitious man trying to take over his brother's big ranch no matter what. The usual villain of the 50s, Richard Jaeckel (Wade Mattlock), is also there and ends as usual (no surprise) there). Dianne Foster (Judith Wilkinson) plays Robinson's daughter, who does not approve of her father's, her mother's and her uncle's dealings with their neighbors. Rudolph Mate comes in a standard but acceptable direction, maybe helped by beautiful and wide open landscapes, and a good and fitting score also helps. <br /> <br /> The inevitable final showdown between Ford and Keith is one of the best in Western movies. Each man in his own dueling style (note Ford's shooting with his s traight arm and aim at military targets) will forever dispute their differences. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of Glenn Ford's best western appearances, second only to the classic "3:10 to Yuma," he made two years later. It's probably the cast that rates the movie as the "A" rate and, like me, is included in the top 10 list of the genre.
