I'm a big fan of Gone With the Wind, and I read "Scarlett" before it was a miniseries and it thrilled. This is a kind of sequel. As if you did not expect it with this "Honestly, I do not make a damned end". Timothy Dalton was great as Rhett, though nobody will ever replace Clark Gable. Joann Whaley-Kilmer, on the other hand, could get Vivien Leigh for her money (though I almost feel guilty for that). Her attitude and presence in the film fits the character, so you love her and hate her at the same time, so do most of them about Mrs. Leigh's presentation. The film moves slowly, mostly because it follows the book so closely and was not released as a feature film. Excellent selection by the manufacturer. I think this movie deserves credit for the great action, the revival of characters who have disappeared for almost 50 years, and for even Margaret Mitchell herself to have been proud.
