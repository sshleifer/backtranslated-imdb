John Carpenter shows how much he loves the original from 1951 by giving him the utmost respect he could possibly win. The only difference is that Carpenter decides to stick to the paranoid core of John W. Campbell Jr.'s short story. The secret to the success of this version lies in the unbearable tension that arises when the group of men feels suspicious. The tension that literally waits to be taken over takes a frightened hold. Carpenter manages to deliver the damper and puzzle to get the film in the right direction. Be it a terrible scene or "What's in the Shadow", the film is a perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi for me. The dialogue is perfect for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress, and Carpenter's score is a wonderful, eerie pulse that further enhances the sense of decline and paranoia that permeates the film. The cast is awesome, a solid collection of actors led by Carpenter favorite Kurt Russell, while the effects used produce the right effect. But most of all it's the end that's the culmination, an end that does not conform to the norm and is incredibly appropriate for what happened before. Let's wait and see what happens, 10/10.
