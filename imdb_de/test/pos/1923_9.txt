If extreme activities (and I do not mean the Hollywood activities like UFC & X-Games) and the people who pursue them interest you, then look for this document. <br /> <br /> This is one of those truth stories about Donald Crowhurts' stranger-than-fiction story of proving himself against great odds. These opportunities were stacked up by Mother Nature, the media, and his own mind. It is also a time that has been lost to us - even though it was only 40 years ago. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have done a great job in bringing together a variety of materials to tell their story and the story of the film, a great race that consumed it. <br /> <br /> I could not help but think of Timothy Treadwell and the Apollo astronauts in the two big dossiers, GRIZZLY MAN and THE SHADOW OF THE MOON, as you experience this - you do not just watch - - this story. <br /> <br /> If you live in a big city, buy it or rent it. It is worth the effort. I had to travel 100 miles to Los Angeles to buy it, and I'm glad I did.
