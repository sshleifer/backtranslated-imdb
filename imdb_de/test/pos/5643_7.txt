The title refers to the destruction of the remnants of a crop, such as rice hulls, by farmers who burn them and create fires in the plains. This is a grim story about the destruction of the Japanese soldier. <br /> <br /> History plays in the last days of the Philippines campaign as a TB soldier returning from a hospital because he can walk because they can walk I have no room for him. His superior officers do not want him because he is really too ill to work or fight. Abused by his officer, he is sent back to the hospital with the order to be arrested or to kill himself. They still do not take him with them, and he can soon wander through the war-torn landscape to seek help, a place to stay, or even to eat. It is a gloomy journey with no hope in sight and only death and inhumanity of man for man on every corner. <br /> <br /> As a cruel journey into the dark human heart and into the war, this is also a very funny movie. This is not to say, it is not terrible, it is sometimes, but it is also weird. How could it not be? Here's a movie in which madness and insanity get out of hand, people are constantly trying to force tobacco leaves for food, trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes, and trying to stay a Japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by constantly trying march, but never come everywhere and you can not help laughing. To be sure that things are getting darker, it becomes clear that cannibalism is literally and figuratively the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something unpleasantly funny about human comedy. <br /> <br /> Hailed as a great anti-war movie. His strong photographic style reveals the madness of the war, while captivating our eye with its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies, including the soldier and the civilian. In the midst of fields, woods, and trees that would otherwise be pretty, and to a degree still, pretty. It's a shattering feeling. <br /> <br /> What's interesting is that I read that this is based on a novel about the redemptive power of Christianity. The director removed all religious allusions to hope and salvation and instead used it to show that life stinks, the war stinks worse, and that ultimately there is no hope. <br /> <br /> Intellectually I admire the movie emotionally I do not. Part of that is a severe downbeat score that over-emphasizes for me what we see on screen. It's almost a gilding of the lily, because the imagery is so strong that it's not really necessary that the music forces you to feel in one way or another. <br /> <br /> If it's a great movie, you decide. It's certainly unlike any other war movie, bloody, horrible, and real, as big budgeted movies actually claim, but never are. This is not suitable for those who are detrimental to blood and blood because they are here in godparents. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look.
