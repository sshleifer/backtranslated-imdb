This is one of the best action movies I have ever seen. Geena's presentation of hard nails "Charly" / gentle mother "Sam" was great and Samuel L. Jackson gets you through and through with his classic one-liners. Sure, there were a few holes in the story itself, but this fast movement keeps you right to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> I thought Geena was the perfect choice for Sam's role / Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident in her role as a mother in the recently released movie 'Stuart Little'. Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, cute little Yvonne Zima and new arrivals, sexy Craig Bierko and Melina Kanakaredes. This film highlights the growing tendency of a strong female character and the distraction of traditional male / female stereotypes as Sam / Charly (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) race from one catastrophe to the next While I and many others loved this movie, it's fair to say that there will always be people who do not and that's fine - everyone for themselves. I can recommend this movie only because of the funny scenes and the fast action action fans.
