This movie should not be funny, but it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> He is not meant to be sad, but my heart felt heavy with some vignettes. <br /> <br /> It's not written as an action adventure, but my pulse raced more than once. <br /> <br /> Just like life, this movie does not manipulate your emotions and tells you how to feel. It's easy and you react. <br /> <br /> If you do not find it funny or sad or moving, I suppose that says more about you than the movie. <br /> <br /> It is amazing and refreshing to see a director wholeheartedly celebrating, that we are all human, and that we are all included here and doing this "life", over and over again, for so long we must. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow is another day.
