When the movie started, I thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow start and some of the soap opera antiques, I started liking it. The plot was different than anything I had ever seen. Was it a horror? Not really. It should not have been classified as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the film to make the movie scary. So the creatures were only there for a short time. I can only assume that this was for financial reasons. <br /> <br /> The good side was that the movie was very entertaining. It caught my interest (after the start) and I was surprised about creatures from another dimension. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this was a first movie for the director, but there were some highlights. In the end, I was addicted. Too bad that Hollywood did not spend more money behind it.
