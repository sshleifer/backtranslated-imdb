Usually I'm a typical "scary-crawling girl", but after watching this movie (of course on YouTube), I have different perspectives. And I also did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer's - made another movie about insect community, whose garden shed in the city is threatened by humans (lit cigars and cigarette butts, steps, etc.), and like a young, cheerful grasshopper named Hoppity means save the day and win the heart of Honey the Bee; I love the beautiful woman Honey. You know, after seeing the movie, the mistakes reminded me of the "jitter mistakes" of Don Bulth Thumbelina. And of the songs in the movie I love "We are a couple in the castle"; When I sing that song, I almost cried. <br /> <br /> This wonderful movie was the second (and last) movie that came out of Butcher's Studio. The movie was originally due to be released in November 1941, but since Fleisher's rival, Disney, released Dumbo a few weeks ago, Paramount changed the date to December of the same year, but unfortunately Mr. Bug fell into an unrealized trap of terrible timing. After he had to open the disaster two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mr. Bug was a financial disaster and led to Max and Dave Fleischer were expelled from the studio founded in 1919 and reorganized the company as Famous Studios. Another big factor in her departure was the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer did not talk anymore because of disputes (how sad that was). Overall, I love both Fleischer Bros. movies - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.
