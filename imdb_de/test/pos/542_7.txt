But there is nothing new everywhere, but the outstanding performances of the two leading actresses pay off. Sarandon and Portman are both mother and daughter, moving from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills, California, in search of a better life. The main conflict stems from the fact that Natalie preferred to stay with her friends and family in Wisconsin and that she was forced to go to California with her arrogant mother. <br /> <br /> (spoiler) While it's true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable, Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give performances that are so good that they make the material seem almost new. Everywhere, but here is not new territory, but it has the rare property of taking over-used content and making it quite interesting again. This film also features the most heartbreaking facial expression in years, seen on Natalie Portman's face, when her mother turns her off at the roadside and watches the car disappear into the distance. Of particular note is the ironic subplot about Natalie's mother, who urges her to become an actress, and a very compelling performance by Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalie's close relatives from home. His death is a tragic clich√© that is almost always seen in films like this one, but the rest of the film makes up for many of his weaknesses. Not great, but everywhere, but definitely worth a look.
