What can I say? The curse of Monkey Island is fantastic. The story is good and solid, but reasonably stupid, the jokes are great, the puzzles are puzzling ... in an adventure game you could not ask for more. The bit "you do not need to see my identification" is in itself worth buying, not to mention Murray, who has become the hottest topic among many of my friends (only some of them played the game). You will love this game. And if not, too bad!
