This is a great show despite many negative reviews. The goal of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Easy. The fun of this show is to watch the two men try to reach their goal. <br /> <br /> Some seem to hate the show for a variety of reasons, but I think they understand this as an "educational" show on how to record chicks. Well, it's not a comedy show, and it's about making you laugh, not teaching you anything. If you did not like the show because it does not teach you, do not look at it. If you do not like the whole clubbing thing, do not look at it. If you do not like socializing, do not look. This show is a funny show. Watching other girls pick you up will not make you laugh. If you are so disappointed after watching this show that you are unable to "pick up" girls, there is no reason to hate the show.
