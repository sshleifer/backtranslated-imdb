I have to admit that I know some of those involved, I was the precursor of The Planet, Evil Unleased, but this was the case more than 10 years ago and I had lost touch with them. I just saw BBC Scotland News and a play about Scottish cinema, mentioned and showed clips from The Planet and comments from director Mark Stirton. This prompted me to order a copy of the film on DVD. <br /> <br Well, to the movie, the level of acting, writing, directing and the Sfx is close to some of the best, OK, it's not Star Wars, but I've seen many Hollywood products, which are far inferior. It's very strange to see a movie spoken in my local accent in northeastern Scotland, but it soon passed. <br /> <br /> ^ Mild Spoiler ^ <br /> <br /> The Planet relies on several sci-fi classics; Star Wars, Alien, Pitch Black, Forbidden Planet, and Predator, a handful of the space shuttle trading crew, survive as their ship is attacked and destroyed by unknown ships. They flee to an abandoned desert planet, one after the other From invisible invaders, to the ships that are only passengers, a mysterious prisoner manages to reach the planet, and a battle ensues in which the crew struggles to survive. The planet is a brilliant science fiction movie that creates that, it certainly hides a limited budget, well done for Mark, Mike and everyone involved, I'm looking forward to your next work.
