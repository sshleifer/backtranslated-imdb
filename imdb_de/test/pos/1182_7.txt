A competent comedy that makes fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau laugh. I suppose this movie was made for those who enjoyed the two GRUMPY OLD MEN films, because it seemed like a bunch of those pals team-ups would spotlight the weird duo in their twilight years. The idea is a sure thing: Matthau, a limping player with thousands of dollars in debt, tempts his unsuspecting friend Lemmon to take a free cruise where he can meet rich old ladies; The catch is, they have been registered as Dance Hosts and Matthau can not dance. OUT TO SEA is a fun movie, and not all giggles are courtesy of Lemmon and to find Matthau. I found Brent Spiner (best known as Data from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION) to be very funny as a Snobby Ball busting dance coordinator. As the snappy boss of the two aging actors, he manages to get them together in the salmon department. Although the movie does not really need it, there are also one or two love stories here that deal with Dyan Cannon (who looks pretty good for her years).
