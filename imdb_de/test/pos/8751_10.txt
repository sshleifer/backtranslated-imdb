Contains spoilers that I recorded on PBS a while ago, but I've never had a chance to watch it (presumably because of prejudice, having to sit at the Masterpiece Theater for 5-6 hours, making the BBC for TV production (no Music, settings all in one room, no outside scenes with a flat TV look ...)) But after seeing the movie traffic (which I thought was pretty good at the time), I could not help digging the Trafficking Band, to see what else they could have gotten used to with the extra 2 1/2 hrs. <br /> <br /> Boy, my prejudices were wrong with regards to this TV series. It's so much more than traffic. The characters are better crafted so their actions are more credible. The entire parcel, which includes Pakistan, completes the entire viewpoint of everyone in the supply chain, from farmer to final consumer. In traffic, the Pakistani story was rewritten and reduced to a good cop compared to a bad cop. <br /> <br /> There have been many more meaningful discussions and debates about alcohol and other forms of drugs, whereas in traffic they were mostly passing on references without meaning. The same applies to social topics that were realistically conveyed without preaching in Traffik. While in Traffic the characters looked just as an explanation as they do in the TV movies "Edition of the Week" movies. <br /> <br /> There was no evil guy against a good guy Traffik, even the dealer, is portrayed as a junkie, who is sold to support his habit, rather than the person who "nobody with me" in Traffic behaves. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that I did not watch traffic Before I looked at it, it was difficult to compare scene after scene, and although the scenes were not the same, I knew what that was Result would be already. Thank God for the Pakistani story, which is so different that I could enjoy it without thinking about which scene it is comparable to. Although I had lost the thought that the drugs were fused with the pottery of the statues Helen had brought back to Germany (as in the history of Traffic.) Thankfully, traffic was not that hokey and far-fetched.
