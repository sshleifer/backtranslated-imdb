I really enjoyed this movie. It is rare to find a star who will bring out the physical aspects of any sports / dance movie convincingly and perform a first-class acting job. In this movie you will find two stars that take this opportunity. Both women offer warm, touching and sometimes humorous services. The film also touched on a range of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. And yet the rapprochement was not cumbersome. The production values ​​were also first-rate for a small budget film. I saw that at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and saw it a second time. It was a real crowd pleaser. Everyone I spoke with seemed to enjoy this movie.
