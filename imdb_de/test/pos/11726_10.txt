Dirty Harry goes to Atlanta as Burt calls this fantastic, first-class detective thriller borrowing part of his storyline from the venerable Dana Andrews movie "Laura". Not only does Burt Reynolds play a starring role in this great saga, he has also directed it, and he does not make a single mistake either in staging the action or casting characters. Not a bad performance in the movie and Reynolds does an excellent job of directing. Henry Silva is an ice-cold hero. <br /> <br /> Detective Tom Sharky (Burt Reynolds) is in a stun in subterranean Atlanta when things go wrong. He ends up chasing a suspect and shooting him with the shooter in a bus. During close combat an innocent bystander dies. John Woo's "The Killer" replicates this scene. Anyway, the Atlanta Police Department turns Burt over to Vice, and he takes orders from a new boss, Frisco (Charles Durning of "Oh, Brother, Where are you?") In the basement. Sharky meanders into a real sewer. Sharky and his detectives Arch (Bernie Casey) and dad (Brian Keith) oversee a high-priced call girl Dominoe (Rachel Ward of "After Dark, My Sweet"), who has a luxurious apartment she shares with another girl Dominoe sees a local politician Hotchkins (Earl Holliman of Police Woman) on the side, who works for the governor, but the chief villain Victor (Vittorio Gassman of "The Dirty Game"), he wants the End affair. Hotchkins is reluctant to host Victor. Victor sniffs Billy Score (Henry Silva from "Wipeout") and finishes Dominoe. Billy blows a hole the size of a 12-inch pizza into the door of Dominoes Apartment and kills her. Sharky did the unthinkable. During the surveillance, he loved Dominoe so much that he was hopelessly in love with her. Sharky's mission now is to break Victor, but he learns that Victor has an informant in Atlanta police. The action gets really hotter as Sharky later discovers that Billy shot the wrong girl and Dominoe is still alive! Sharky puts her in protective custody and things get even more complicated. He compiles his "machine" of the title to deal with Victor and his hoods. William Fraker's widescreen objective of the action is impeccable. Unfortunately, this highly underrated classic is only available as a full-frame movie. Fraker definitely adds to the atmosphere of the picture, especially during the mutilation scene on the boat when the villain cut off one of Sharky's fingers. This is a pretty cruel scene. <br /> <br /> Burt never made a movie that surpassed Sharky's Machine.
