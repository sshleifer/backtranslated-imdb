Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur" (1942) (not to be confused with another 1936 Hitchcock film "Sabotage", which has a completely different plot) is not Suspense's greatest movie. It has neither the depth of "Vertigo" (1958) nor the brooding atmosphere of "Rebbeca" (1940) and it certainly does not have the emotional impact and theatrical talent found in "Notorious" (1946), but what There are thrills, adventures and a climax biting your nails. Although the two hints are quite weak. It is easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the role of Robert Cummings and Barbara Stanwyck for the role assumed by Priscilla Lane. Also, the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (written by Dorothy Parker) are poorly dated, and the encounter with the circus troupe is bad (the bearded beard's beard is clearly wrong). The last half hour, however, is a contemplation of the seat edge, the highlight on the Statue of Liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of "North By Northwest" (1959). The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd, are very good and the starting fire in the aircraft factory is a great sequence. This is not the best movie Hitch has made, but it certainly is one of his most entertaining.
