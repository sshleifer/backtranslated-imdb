The first music video I ever saw, Thriller, my mother told me that she had taken me home from the hospital. When we arrived, my sister had played MTV on TV and thriller, my mom said that I was smiling. Stupid I know, but I loved Michael Jackson since that day, the music video thriller inspired me to dance, but I've learned the dance by heart to this day. I even performed it 3 times for an audience! Words can not describe the power of this song, which makes you sing and dance, but at the time Michael had to raise the bar by signing John Loyd's director at American Werewolf in London and directing the only thriller. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date, Ola Ray, are out of gas in a dark forest. They go into the woods and Michael asks her if she wants to go quiet. She accepts and he calls her. He warns her, however, that he is not like other guys, no, not like the other guys. A full moon appears and Michael begins to torment himself. Transformation into a terrible werewolf! His appointment screams and runs away, but the werewolf catches up, knocks her down, and starts pouncing on her with his claws. The scene runs away to a movie theater where Michael and his date actually watch this scene in a movie called Thriller. Michael smiles, but his date is scared and tells him she will leave. Michael gets her and says it's just a movie, but she does not like his jokes and she leaves. Michael and his date then walk down a foggy street and he teases them with the first verses of the thriller. They pass a cemetery where corpses suddenly rise from their graves as Vincent Price performs his rap. Michael and his date are surrounded by the zombies and suddenly Michael himself becomes a zombie. Michael and the Undead play a lavish song and a dance number together, followed by the thriller thriller. Thriller is probably the best music video ever. The funny thing is, when people argue about being with others, Michael Jackson videos, but what makes Thriller so special is the dance, the story, the effects. This was the most expensive music video of its time at the time. Michael of course rose again with his famous music video Scream and then with Ghosts again. But tell me what you want, Michael was the star of the eighties, there was no celebrity like him, he loved life, he lived it, breathed it and hugged it. Thriller is proof that he was ready to make the most of it, and that's what we got with the legend of Thriller. <br /> <br /> 10/10
