Did not have much of a claim for this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. Very well made film, very well cut, does not really reach the height that Human Traffic has reached, but it is a very good effort. Properly addressed, and I thought the lead actor did a great job! In fact, the only really bad performance of the movie was Tim Curry, which was supposed to be the name. Cool Film was surprised that it was no better than him. I had never heard of it until I saw it with friends. <br /> <br /> I'm not a razor, but I imagine people who really like this movie.
