I was traveling with my friends and saw this movie last weekend here in London. We did not know what to expect, the poster gave away some of that and I will not say more so as not to spoil the plot, but we found it to be an awesome movie with great acting, convincing action and frightening is hellish! After finding out about the making of the film, I have to hand it over to these guys, the filmmakers, actors, writers, and so on, to make such a movie with such limited resources. Postproduction also done very well. For all that I give them 10 out of 10, and I hope they will continue their good work. Keep it up, guys. You rock!
