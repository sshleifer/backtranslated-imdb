'Traffik', despite its title, is not really about drugs. In the best tradition of the Crusade against British TV drama, "Traffik" analyzes and moralizes its alleged theme, which is not a mythical plague, but a matrix or process with identifiable social, economic and historical roots, causes and effects. It is almost scientific that the film includes four groups of characters for spectacularly separate global and class backgrounds - a poppy forced into poverty by the Pakistani underworld and a cynical government; the English, former Olympic swimming woman of a drug baron, who was brought to justice for trafficking in human beings; two confusing German policemen whose determination to convict the latter results as much from class anger as any belief in the law; and a Tory junior minister whose Cambridge student daughter has become an addict. "Traffik" is nonapologetic didactic - from the early scenes of Jack Lithgow in Pakistan examining the government's success in eliminating drugs before further sanctions are taken British help, we are bombarded with facts about the problem. However, these "facts" come from different sources - from government officials. left-wing lawyers with an (ideological and domestic) interest in corruption; poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. <br /> <br /> Facts that usually support soothing markers on a map are obviously not enough - the more facts we get, the less controllable the situation seems. It is not until Jack, the moral center of the film, the man who connects all narrative strands, actually travels to the heart of drug darkness, learns to get rid of all his hypocrisy (to complain about drug use, but no serious money to invest in the fight of the problem and the conditions created by various free market initiatives in which drug trafficking flourishes, as the anti - heroes of the old Warner gangster films were indeed American capitalists, the traffickers they support are the ideal they support (Thatcher and Reagan) At least the reality of the problem can be recognized. <br /> <br /> As I say, trafficking is not really about drugs. As Jack finally realizes, after being released as a Tory minister, drugs are not really the problem. It is a society that has been dismantled by a woman who said that there is no such thing (as Jack's non-existent family life has proven) and the overwhelming majority of people are systematically deprived of hope and happiness, of which more and more people To take drugs. <br /> <br /> The most startling thing about 'Traffik' is not the graphic, stupefying depictions of drug abuse (whose technical details ironically reflect the portrayal of 'legitimate', verbal factual information), but the dystopia of a Great Britain vision of joy Deprived of beauty or community, a desolate desert landscape of rundown houses and a soulless modernity, a society of defeatists ready for the smugglers and barons of the threshers to pursue their trade. <br /> <br /> This is not just a contemporary British story - it documents the decline of a trade-based empire reduced to lawless drug trafficking. It is certainly important that the other locations of the program are Germany and Pakistan, which have significant influence on the decline of the empire. Here the old imperial amorality is haunted, the formerly enslaved victims whose bodies were abused by the power of their masters. They return to the imperial center of London, the seeds of their decline literally in their bodies and embody the fears of all these people of 19th century Gothic novels. <br /> <br /> 'Traffik' is one of the great achievements of British television and is in many ways superior to the recent Hollywood remake. The political focus is obviously sharper - Jack's decline is far more effective than Wakefield's because he's a big part of the problem as an agent of government policy and as a bad father, while the only real political mistake of the American is complacency. In almost every case, the characterization is stricter and much more plausible (compare Lindsay Duncan's steely Helen, already bitten by experience and failure, and her conspicuously superficial counterpart). <br /> <br /> Contrary to the dubious racial undercurrent of "Traffic" (Mexico is getting dark and others, the ultimate WASP horror being sex with a black guy), Pakistan's portrait is rich, tragic and drawn disturbing arguments Drug protection is interrupted by cruel acts of violence. The inseparable link between public and private is consistently experts. Visually, the film is remarkably imaginative, without ever being conspicuous or "cinematic" - especially in the final episode where the building and decor seem to be moving with the system closing. If "trafficking" like his remake has the need for riparian fragments, then the prevailing sense of waste and loss is far more damaging, Jack's speech desperately desperate.
