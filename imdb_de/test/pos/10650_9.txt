This film from 1925 tells the story of the mutiny aboard the battleship Potemkin in the port of Odessa. The film celebrated the 20th anniversary of the 1905 uprising, which was considered a direct precursor to the 1917 October Revolution. Following his montage theory, Eisenstein plays with scenes, their duration, and the way they emphasize his message, alongside him uses various camera-recording angles and revolutionary lighting techniques. The sequence "Odessa Steps" in Potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema. The stroller, which rolled down the stairs after the mother's shot, was later restored to Brian d'Palmas The Untouchables. It's clear that the movie is one of the best ever made, depending on his time and how innovative he was, although you need a little patience and a real movie lover to get through his 70 minutes.
