I can not understand why so many people did not like this movie. Robert De Niro was at the top of the game, delivering his lines with such abundance that you have to believe that this is his everyday attitude. Granted, the movie seemed to accept many buddy-film conventions while trying to make fun of the concept, it goes without saying that this movie was really funny. From the police dog to the fact that Eddie Murphy has not upset me, this movie is a true guardian. Rene Russo has also perfectly balanced the rest of the cast and set her role so as not to disturb the burgeoning relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
