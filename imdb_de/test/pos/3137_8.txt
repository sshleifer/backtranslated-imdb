In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagoners to lead their caravan to the San Juan River. On the journey they first meet the broken car without water of the quack doctor. A. Locksley Hall and the prostitutes Denver and Fleuretty Phyffe. Then, the sadistic Outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol headed by the Sheriff of Crystal City, who is following them. When the Navajos cross their path, they are invited to visit their hamlet for a dance party. When the wagon train is near the target, the Clegg guys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to take a stance. <br/> <br /> "Wagon Master" is another great Western from John Ford. The sequences with the train that crosses the desert and the hills are impressive. The adventures of the Mormon group are fun and entertaining, and the songs fit well despite the date. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Caravana dos Bravos" ("Caravan of the Braves")
