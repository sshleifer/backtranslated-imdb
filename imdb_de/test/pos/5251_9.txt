For some other comments, I have to agree that some (very few) flaws in this brilliant documentary were found on any of the twentieth-century divas (up there with Billie Holliday, Bessie Smith, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland, and Mercedes de Sosa)) are authorised. Because this was initially a 6-hour TV documentary about her career ("ESTRANHA FORMA DE VIDA" (V) 1995/1999). Far more comprehensive and with more insight into Am√°la's inner world. As for the subtitling of their songs, I am in favor! Although the music, the voice and the performance may be - are! - universally, there is so much poetry in the words that only beg to be translated. I think that was a deliberate decision of the producers. They target the 200 million Portuguese speakers in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, Timor Leste, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Canada, USA, South Africa, St. Tome and Principe, Goa, Daman, Diu, Venezuela, Luxembourg, Germany and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora worldwide. The Lady herself had not seen this shortened DVD version of the documentary live, but she got a preview of "Estranha Forma de Vida". And it seems she liked it. Very much so.
