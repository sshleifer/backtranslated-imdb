I do not watch a lot of horror movies, but one night I got together with my cousins. We're teenagers and we tend to make fun of many things, but honestly, acting was not very good here, especially at the beginning. One line that stood out was when Scarlett said to Jill and Tiffany, "This is so ... high school!" while the next scene shows Jill walking past a sign with her high school name ... Many parts at the beginning reminded me of a hackneyed, poorly written Lizzie McGuire episode. However, as the story progressed and the cast went to Jill most of the time, I appreciated the movie more. Camilla Belle did a great job in this movie, and I think the other actors and actresses ruined the film for her. And I have to admit, that was one of the scariest films I've ever seen. Well, no, there were no big monsters and white faces that showed up in dark corners and possessed dolls, but what made this movie more frightening than those that contained such things was that it really could happen. And this movie really reminded me of what's really scary ... We all know that we're not likely to come across the living dead in our lives at all times. The only flaw in this movie is that it's one of those the most clich√©d movies I've ever seen. It has everything in it, what a horror movie ever had - turning the keys and the car drives on, shadows in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with excitement, turning around and seeing a corpse moving fast with a deadly scene Awakening ended In the exciting scenes that was very predictable, but overall I would rate it at 7/10. It is definitely worth a visit. By the way, this is my first review, so I do not know if any of these things were spoilers .. But just to be sure ...
