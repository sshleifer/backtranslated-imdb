Over the years, there are a few films you can barely get past. <br /> <br /> Choose Conner is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> This little gem that was played at some festivals and played for two weeks in a small theater in West Hollywood that made it all in about $ 5500. <br /> <br /> It is now on DVD, I hope many more will see that now. <br /> <br /> It's a strange drama of a sly, boyish politician who affects a very light-colored man 15 years old. This politician also has a handsome nephew (about 17 years old) who befriends the 15 year old guy. & that's what i appreciated, we do NOT get all the facts. Much is left to our own thinking. You will hear dialogues that make this logical. Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician, his role is somewhat vague, this is another point the public should think about. <br /> <br /> Alex D.Linz is our 15 year old. He was about 17 years old when he made this film but can easily fit in with younger ones. He was active in film and television at an early age. He is a very good actor and convinced. Escher Holloway is the older teenager. This role is his first major and he is excellent. <br /> <br /> Now I save the best for last, the author / director. <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For a first try a big thumbs up. I hope he and our two guys have a long career. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (from 4) 86 points (from 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
