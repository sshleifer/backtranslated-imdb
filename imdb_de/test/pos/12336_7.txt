I did not know anything about this movie before I saw it. It seems to be a lesser-known 1980s teen horror. What impressed me most was the way it was different from many other films of that time. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me was how slow this movie is developing. It is not the typical set-up to show characters one by one who are being murdered. It takes time to build the backstory, leaving a little mystery about what might happen. I almost began to believe that nobody would really hurt themselves in this movie. But everything leads to the climatic sequence in the last 15 minutes, and then it gets pretty graphic (this was a bad time to stop for a snack - I almost could not finish my pizza as soon as it started). The characters also seem a bit more three dimensional than many of the cheap teen scare flicks. The conversations were, for the most part, refreshingly prudent, in contrast to the exaggerated stereotypes you would expect. For example, the girl, who is the popular, snobby, queen bee of the clique, does not constantly insult, but can have doubts and take care of others. <br /> <br /> Well, in conclusion, I felt that this film was a bit more original and a little better compared to what I expected. It attracted me, kept me interested and then let me have it. Like I said, it's pretty bloody during the final, but most of the time it's almost family friendly. I do not have to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it.
