This is a funny movie. The feeling of the Bob & Eddie show could lead to a sequel, but I doubt that will make enough money. <br /> <br /> Deniro proves he can be a great straight man again with some funny and spontaneous moments. Eddie enjoyed working with humans instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo, she's just kidding anyway, and she played her role very well. That was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and in the end got a lot of them and the great out-takes. DO NOT LEAVE at the beginning of the credits! <br /> <br /> At least a 7.
