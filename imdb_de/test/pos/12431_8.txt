A beautiful woman, a backwoodsman, an inbred monster-man, a super sweet monster truck, a zombie-brother, and two roadside friends ... one of the anal, a hypersensitive nerd, and the other a disgusting, youthful slut. Throw them all together with a dash of Jeepers Creepers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Road Trip and you have Monster Man. A funny horror / comedy trip that should never "say something". It's a simple, straightforward laugh celebration. Unpretentious and well done, this horror / comedy at heart is a buddy. This movie offered some hilarious and disgusting set pieces. I recommend it to fans who want to be entertaining.
