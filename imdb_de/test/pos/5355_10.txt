I really refused to watch this movie. I refused to go to school and I refused to go with my parents. Alone at the sight of the trailer, it looked stupid anyway. One of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and offered me two choices: "The Dukes Of Hazzard" or "Wallace And Gromit: The Curse Of The Were Rabbit." It took me 17 minutes to decide. The time was running out. I had to choose. It appeared on the screen "Little" as left over in a few tickets. When we had to queue to get our ticket, only one of us could go inside. I really wanted Nicholas to go in to see it. But he forced me. I crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that I wanted to see this childishness. I went in, sat down on the only free seat and prepared for the movie! I have to say, I was very surprised that I sat through this MASTERPIECE! It was wonderful. I do not know what I complained about. The clay animation was by far the best I've ever seen in my life. The story was great. About a hare that disturbs a carnival planned for over 500 years and crashes. Basically, Anti Pest Control protects the people who participate in the vegetable competition. Anti-Pesto, known as Wallace And Gromit (who is responsible for this business), tries to keep all rabbits away from the vegetable carnival. I will not say it anymore. It's just too good to say. I admit that the whole idea of ​​a Were Rabbit is unbelievable and childish, but Nick Park adds substance to the fabric that makes everyone love it. I mean, there will not be a 10-foot rabbit in the loose seat, and there will definitely be no 8-foot werewolves, as stated in "Dog Soldiers". On the other hand, Were-Rabbits and WereWolves were not real creatures. But in any case, it worked very well. <br /> <br /> The jokes were also grown-up. The kids do not get jokes. It goes far beyond their heads. There were many British jokes there. If you love British humor, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I also loved the cast and the voices. Everything about the movie is so incredibly well done. The direction and the pace were absolutely ... FANTASTIC! I recommend that to the fans of the old Wallace And Gromit Shorts (and no, I have not seen them yet), and I recommend fans who love "Shrek" and "Shrek 2" love Clay Animation, good movie! 10/10
