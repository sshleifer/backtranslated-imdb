Bloody Birthday plays with the supposed innocence of children and depicts them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne, Billy Jacoby) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) were all born the same day during a solar eclipse. Besides the birthday, they also share the love of murder (and they are not picky who they kill). The young Billy, Elizabeth and Andy play the games of these emotionless monsters pretty well, but they also know when to put the spell on. But they can not fool everyone further. This is an overall good horror movie, it's not too unrealistic, there are some good moments of excitement and the kids have played the roles well (though the adults are pretty hammy). I would say it is worth seeing (I own a copy myself).
