Shame is a high point in the career of a master. Ingmar Bergman's pervasive, existential study of a pair on the island of Gotland that deals with the survival of a long war. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give scrupulously detailed performances in this brief drama. The intensity of the films is based on Bergman focusing on the tiny, intimate relationships of his two characters - both experienced musicians - who are trapped in a landscape they no longer understand. We see how the external pressure of war complicates and corrodes their relationship. Both characters are forced by the material circumstances of the war to betray their own ethical sense. In one of the most powerful episodes, Bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the cinematic medium by showing us a filmed interview with Ullman's character, reworked from one side of the conflict and distorted and used for political reasons other side as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene. <br /> <br />
