Cassie (Sandra Bullock) is a very serious police officer. When a former friend once tried to kill her, and in fact left her badly wounded, she is determined to bring those who harm others to justice. As a result of her near-death experience, Cassie prefers One-Night-Stands and does not trust anyone. One day, a woman is found dead in the woods near Cassie's community. She was abominably murdered, badly beaten and left alone. Of course, Cassie will stop at nothing to find the killers. Commissioned to help her is an officer, Sam (Ben Chaplin). Soon he discovers Cassie's ruthless attitude and all consuming instinct when she asks him to pick up a sample of the vomit that was left to be analyzed at the crime scene. The path soon leads them to two high school students, Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Could these teenagers really be responsible for planning and executing the perfect "Freudestötung"? This is a fascinating film, but viewers should be warned that the topic is really grim. Killing for "sports" is rarely the subject of films that are of "all sweetness and light," and this is no different. That means the cast is great. With no hint of her talent for comedy, Bullock is as grand as the cop whose own past forces her to imprison the evil peoples of the world. Chaplin is also very nice as a detective who is both attracted and repelled by the violent Cassie. In terms of Gosling, he does a remarkable job as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. The production values ​​for the film are also good, with appropriately fine costumes, attitudes and photography. If you are a Bullock fan and are looking for a laugh, this is not for you. However, if you love secrets, even those with the worst actions, you will find this story fascinating.
