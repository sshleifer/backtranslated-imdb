This is a must for everyone, but especially for African Americans. It is time that there is a film that expresses and shows the concerns in relations between African Americans. Other cultures can see in a fictitious, humorous way how positive the relationships between African Americans and their outcomes are, rather than the unwanted stereotype that plagues the African American community. I love this movie a must !!
