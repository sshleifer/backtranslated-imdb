"It all depends on how you look at it, we're either half way to heaven or halfway to hell," says Rev. Harlan in Northfork. The Polish Brothers' movie is an ambitious film that will make every intelligent viewer sit up, provided he has patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The layers of entertainment offered by the film bring a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery, which is obviously a less obvious socio-political and theological commentary that should provoke a laid-back American to reflect on current social values. The surreality of the film (coffins that emerge from the depths of artificial lakes to float and disturb the living homesteaders who almost "crucify" their feet on the wooden floor of their home), angels who need multiple glasses to read, etc .) and absurd images (of half-animals, half-toys, doorbells, the musical notes of a harp, a blind angel who writes illegible trails, etc.) can make a viewer who does not trust the surreal and the surreal is absurdist traditions in literature and art wondering what the movie spools out as entertainment. Although European cinema has better credentials in this area, Hollywood has indeed made such films in the past. In "Cat Ballou" Lee Marvin and his horse leaned against the wall a few decades ago to take a nap. "Northfork," in a scene in which citizens left the city in cars, seemed to pay homage to the series of cars in "Citizen Kane" that Kane and his wife took out for a picnic from Xanadu. <br /> <br /> The film is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient filmgoer - the most interesting epilogue (one of the most beautiful I can remember) is heard as a voice towards the end of the credits. The directors seem to leave the best moments to those who can stay with film to the end. If you have the patience, will you enjoy the layers of the movie? If you swallow or swallow what the Polish rolls have to offer, you will miss the many flavors. <br /> <br /> What is the movie about? ? At the most obvious level, a city is evacuated to make way for a dam and hydropower project. Even cemeteries are being excavated so that the mortal remains of the dead can be relocated to higher burial grounds. Real estate promoters are negotiating the land on the lake for 6 people who can drive out the inhabitants of the city. Only one of the 6 seems to have a conscience and is therefore able to order chicken soup while others can not get anything. <br /> <br /> On the next shift you have Christianity and its interaction the city dwellers. Most are devout Christians, but in many cases the instinct lurks at the expense of true Christian principles, as the priest shows. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions. On the next shift, you have the world of angels interacting with nearby angelic humans and each other. They realize that the world of the Unknown Angel, who keeps a comic book about Hercules and dreams of a mother, can be found in an androgynous angel called "Flower Hercules". While the filmmaker points out that Flower is an extension of the imaginative imagination of the young angel, Flower's subsequent actions believe this option. You are indeed in the world of the angels - not gods, but pure minds and therefore not in the world of the living. The softer focus of the camera is reflected in these shots. <br /> <br /> On another level, Irwin's toy plane becomes a real plane that takes him and his angels to heaven, which is 1000 miles from Norfolk. <br /> <br /> The last shift is the social comment? "The country is divided into two types of people: Ford's people and Chevy people." Is there a difference? They think they are different, but both are consumers. <br /> <br /> Religious are told in the film "Pray and you shall receive" (words of Fr. Harlan, quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). For the consumer, the film says, "It's what we do with our wings that separate us" (each of the six evictors also has wings - a duck / goose feathered in the hat bands, but their actions are often different from the angels, as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car). <br /> <br /> The film is certainly not the best American movie, but it's definitely a groundbreaking work - great visuals, eye-catching performances (especially Nick Nolte) and a loaded script with multiple levels of entertainment for the elderly.
