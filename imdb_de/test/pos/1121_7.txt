Another of Kickboxer's Fight to the Death biscuit cutters to entertain Wealthy Scumbags 'films, of which there were so many in the' 90s ... you know, those who were created by the words "death" "Blood" and "Steel" and the words "Ring", "Fight", "Match" and "Cage" and paste them into a random generator! However, Death Match is a pretty good entry into the overpriced genre due to its exciting fight scenes and the surprisingly good acting style of its kickboxing line-up. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends - ex- kickboxing world champion John Larson (played by the pug-stoked kickboxing champion Ian Jacklin, probably formerly known for his terrible performance as the main villain in Ring of Fire 2) and Nick Wallace (Nick Hill, a likeable guy who is probably best known) role of street fighter Sergio in Bloodsport 2), who works the LA docks loading boxes onto ships. A discovery of a box full of rifles and a short fight later, our two heroes are unemployed and support a bar in LA. Reasonable John Larson decides to go north and look for a job. the wayward Nick Wallace has heard of a guy paying good money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches. "Why should things change?" says John, "If you need me, I'll be there." Predictably enough, it does not take long for Nick to disappear and his good friend fights in the deadly "Ring of Death" to find a trail for his missing buddy. <br /> <br /> Sure enough, there are no prizes for originality here, but as I said, the strength of this film lies in its action, its cast of real fighters, and the pretty good performances it gives them succeed. Ian Jacklin in particular surprised me. Previously, I had seen him as the evil in Ring of Fire 2 and in trippy parts like The Steel Ring, and I've always been quite amused at how bad an actor is (good fighter!). But in Death Match he is pretty good! With a decent script and a haircut he proves to be the charismatic leader! And his friendship with Nick is very well represented. Jacklin and Hill have a nice chemistry and you really believe these two characters are taking care of each other. Enough for one of them to lose a job, travel halfway across the country and risk death to save the other one - I wish I had such a friend! <br /> <br /> It was also nice to see Matthias Hues as a malicious henchman with a bit more depth than we are used to from his many "evil stooge rolls". But do not think he's the star just because he's on the video cover (his head seems to be on the body of Michael Bernardo from the cover of Shootfighter) - he's good when he's on the screen but he is not busy. <br /> <br /> Negatively, the movie is pretty slow when there are no fights, with lots of unnecessary scenes (what about gangster Jimmie Fiorello's pointless story about his grandfather?). ) and the final fight is disappointingly short, but on the whole I liked it! Many fights, most good. Is not that all we really need martial arts? And of course a feast for the eyes, here in the beautiful form of the very pretty Renee Ammann. All in all a pretty entertaining kickboxing movie.
