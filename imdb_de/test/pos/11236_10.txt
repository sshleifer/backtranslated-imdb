Keys to the VIP, an original series by the Canadian Comedy Network (comedynetwork.ca), achieved a great performance with this entertaining but inspiring game show. This show is hosted by four witty, handsome boys who judge others about their "play" (the ability to pick up women). In each episode, there are two guys competing in different pick-up games. There are three distinct areas, and the winner will receive one night as a VIP at an exclusive nightclub in Toronto. <br /> <br /> As a guy, I find this show funny. We all know that it is difficult to confront women, and when you observe how these boys naturally become curious, it awakens the men's curiosity. The guys who attend this show can even give you a few pointers - if you're careful.
