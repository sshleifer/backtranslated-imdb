Bobby and Mikey are two little boys who travel around the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. Soon after the family settles, her mother marries "The King," who ends up being an abusive stepfather, especially for Bobby. So Bobby decides that he will "fly away" from the abuse in his birthday present. <br /> <br /> This film was hard to see, especially the abuse scenes. It was hard to see an innocent, playful little boy being abused, turning into a sullen fear and a retired young man. The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> I cried in the last half of the movie. There were also some funny scenes, like the Monster Brew and the dog who finds the pop bottles. It was a movie that was painful to look at and yet it really flew away.
