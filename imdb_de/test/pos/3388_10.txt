This is a great movie, all 3 were. The last one was not as good as the first 2, but it was later made and pulled on straws. But you want to see it because it tells the end of the story. Just not as we might think it should end. <br /> <br /> These films made me tend to be in all the distress, love, tears and laughter that people throw in this movie. It's one of the few movies that is good every time you see it, no matter how many times it is. <br /> <br /> There are some parts in the movie that the little kids do not understand and the older ones may not be old enough to see. But it's a great movie that spans more than 20 years.
