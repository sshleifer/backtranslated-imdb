Norma had spent most of the 1920's playing beautiful Ingenues, but her first talk made her a brass-like showgirl in "The Process of Mary Dugan" and she went through with flying colors. From then on, her lovable and lovable ideas were thrown aside, and she sizzled in parts that exposed her as a sophisticated woman of the world or social girl for the thrill. "Let Us Be Gay" was released earlier, but released after "The Divorcée". It was an unusual twist in the crust of the upper crust that made Shearer her own Brown, whose prime purpose in life is to serve her very unattractive husband Bob (Rod La Rocque). She hurries to bring him to his golf game - but in reality he will see his lover. When Helen, the mistress, comes to a showdown in the house, Kitty faces politeness, but behind closed doors, she is a lot of emotions and Bob goes final. Three years later Mrs. Courtland returns Brown (Kitty) comes as a guest of the eccentric woman Bouccicoult ("Bouccy") (Marie Dressler). Kitty is now a knockout and Bouccy has a job for her. She wants Kitty to spoil a houseguest who in turn loves his granddaughter Diane (beautiful Sally Eilers). Shock!! Scary !! - The man is none other than Bob, her ex-husband !!! Kitty executes the meeting with refinement and witty response - "This man seems to be something strangely familiar" !!! - and nobody is the smartest. <br /> <br /> The film then settles in one of those early, very "talkie", boring "drawing room" comedies. Kitty pulls all the men under her spell and Bob wants to start all over again. The women all have strong roles in this film - men are just puppets. Raymond Hackett seems to be an additional butler in the movie - "Give me a pillow", "Get me something to drink", "Move this chair" instead of Diane's molested fiancé. Normally, Norma Shearer is the whole show, Marie Dressler adds "Bouccy" to her list of eccentric performances, and Sally Eilers is a real eye-catcher as the beautiful Diane.
