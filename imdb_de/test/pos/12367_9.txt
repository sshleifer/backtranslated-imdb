On a dark, gloomy New Year's Eve, a sick nurse whose life is slowly dying demands that David Holm be presented to her right away. We do not yet know who David Holm is or why this sister wants to see him, but her only wish is to talk to him only once. On the other side of the city, nestled comfortably between the tombstones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sjöström, who was also a director) and two of his drunken employees cheerfully await the coming New Year. "Here we can say exactly when we should drink the New Year," shouts Holm and reaches for the big bell tower, which rises through the darkness. He does not know that he will not be alive to greet him. To pass the time, Holm happily recites a ghost story. He once had a friend named George, "a happy guy," who was "smarter than we all". On a New Year's Eve a few years ago, George has broken a potentially catastrophic brawl, fearing that the last man to catch his last breath before midnight will be sentenced to drive the phantom car for the next year, the death of death to do and to gather the souls of the deceased. "And gentlemen, George died last night on New Year's Eve!" Holm concludes happily, without trying to stem his mocking skepticism about the man's faith. <br /> <br /> As fate says, an unexpected violent encounter leads Holm to death shortly after midnight. As the transparent spirit of the man slowly rises from his earthly body, he testifies to his horror the distant approach of a phantom coach. The driver, a frail, veiled figure with a sickle in his hand, steps down from the car and approaches. We are amazed to learn that the driver is none other than the decrepit George, who is preparing to pass on his cruel duty to this year's successor. <br /> <br /> Considering the era in which "Körkarlen" is made, the special effects in this film are absolutely outstanding. Cinematographer Julius Jaenzon used double-exposure shots to create the eerie, ghostly silhouette of the coach and its damned driver. The end result is still very effective today. In a particularly impressive scene, the phantom car travels to the bottom of the sea to fetch the soul of a drowned man. In another scene, eerily reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Holm breaks the kitchen door with an ax to reach his fleeing wife and children. Really ominous and troubling in its execution, Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen" is an outstanding cinema that successfully represents Holm's steady alcoholic decline, its inevitable Judgment Day, and a final hopeful chance of salvation.
