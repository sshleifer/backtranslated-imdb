Imagine the scene: a bored student with an empty day in front of him, a video library with a special offer of 5 videos for a week. This ex-student has, for arbitrary reasons, usually put together just a bunch of dubious videos (The Turning anybody?). Occasionally the strange undiscovered gemstone made it into his video recorder - this is the case with this film. Everything about the movie is good, but much more than that, all parts are interlinked to offer something all too rare - a cracking good movie. Why this never got a movie release in the UK is a mystery to me, especially considering the crap that we have to endure in the Multiplex Week Week. Although I like to accept that this is not an Oscar material (but not a saturated Titanic - pouty colling tones), it's an extremely entertaining film. I tried to describe a way to best appreciate / accept this movie. The perfect movie to watch as you connect with your dad after you come home for the holidays and after a big Sunday lunch.
