I had no expectations (I have never seen previews for "Marigold") and enjoyed the characters, the contemporary music and the sharp dance in this carefree movie. Although the dialogue is 98% English (great for me), I wish the DVD had subtitles to help with the fast moments when the character's accent is hard to understand. I would not judge this movie in comparison to Bollywood movies, but only because of its own merit as entertaining entertainment (a musical people movie) the bonus material indicates that she is a nice person). I've seen this movie several times since then (getting better every time).
