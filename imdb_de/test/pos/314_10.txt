I've lost the count of how many times I saw this movie. I never got tired, because this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. They just do not make movies like this anymore. <br /> <br /> After watching the fascinating documentary about the making of this movie recently (Hearts of Darkness: a journey of filmmakers to madness), I am even more surprised that this movie was even completed, and yet so great has been. <br /> <br /> The fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Philippines is the movie's biggest asset. You actually feel like you are in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> All the actors are fantastic. My favorites are still Robert Duvall ("I love the smell of napalm in the morning !!"), Martin Sheen, and the Great Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> Many people complain that the movie ends up as dark, strange and cerebral. Well, remember what Coppolla said about this movie: "This movie is not about Vietnam, it's about Vietnam!" he means that this film is MADNESS and not the war. <br /> <br /> This film is based on the short story "Heart of darkness" by Joseph Conrad and is directed against the Vietnam War instead of civil war war like in the book. I think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect, challenging movie that is dark, violent and sometimes humorous and well done in every possible way. <br /> <br /> a true classic <br /> <br /> rating: 10
