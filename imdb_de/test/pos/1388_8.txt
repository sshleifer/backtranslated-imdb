A caption informs us that it is "Caribbean Sea, May 1891". A small rescue boat drifts aimlessly at sea with six prisoners from a shipwrecked prison ship and the ship's doctor a Lt. Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). It is night, a strange current brings the boat to a strange, nameless and unknown island. The boat hits stones and is torn apart. One of the prisoners is killed by a seemingly mutant fishman creature. The next morning Claude wakes up and sees himself washed on a beach. He finds a pond with white bubbling water and one of the prisoners next to it. Claude warns another surviving prisoner, Jose (Franco Iavarone), not to drink the water as it would kill him. Both eventually meet with the other surviving inmates, Peter (Roberto Posse), Francois (Francesco Mazzeri) and Skip (Giuseppe Castellano). Francois sets out to catch an animal to catch, finding and killing a large water bird. Conversely, he is killed by one of the fishmen. Claude, Jose, Peter and Skip continue exploring the island as they lead Francois death to an animal attack. Skip is killed soon after death as he is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit. Now only Claude, Jose and Peter are left. They stumble across a cemetery with many empty tombs and signs of recent black magic rituals. Claude discovers a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly a shot is heard and the head of the snake explodes. A woman on horseback named Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach) is considered Claudes rescuer. She asks her to leave the island immediately because she is in the possession of Edmund Rackham (Richard Johnson) and he does not like visitors. Claude, Jose and Peter decide to keep going anyway and eventually find Rackham's big house where they are invited to stay. That night Peter goes after Amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp. Peter quickly becomes the food for the fishmen. And a voodoo priest named Shakira (Beryl Cunningham), who lives at Rackham, performs a black magic ritual that slashes a chicken's throat in the graveyard. The next day, Claude and Jose decide to leave because they feel uncomfortable with Rackham and believe he is lying to them. Jose rides on horseback and is lost. Claude is rescued by Amanda from one of the fishmen and has to leave. Claude wants to face Rackham again. Rackham reveals that he has a scientist, and Amanda's father, named Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotten), whom he must keep alive. Rackham says the longer Ernest stays alive, the better the chances of survival. Rackham tells Claude about his plan. Rackham has found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of over 2,000 feet. He uses the fishmen as a means to get at the lost treasures of Atlantis, and needs Amanda and her father to control them. He claims that the fishmen are descendants of the natives of Atlantis. Rackham offers Claude a portion of the treasure if he helps him keep Ernest alive. Later, Claude recalls the name Ernest Marvin as a scientist convicted for experiments transplanting animal organs into humans. When he found Ernest's secret laboratory, he discovers that Rackham lied to him, and the fishmen are not descendants. Their truly genetically modified humans became serious amphibious creatures through serious grotesque experiments! Rackham has finally had enough of Claude and decides to end his interference by putting him in a large tank and slowly filling him with water as the volcanoes erupt and lava flies everywhere. Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures, and Amanda. Will Claude escape safe death to rescue Amanda and leave the island before the erupting volcano rips her? Directed by Sergio Martino I really liked this movie, which mixes different genres. The script by Sergio Donati is fast, interesting and entertaining. The plot is revealed bit by bit, which has always interested me to look it all the way. I have to say at this point that I have seen the original version and not the one with scenes added by Roger Corman for the US release. Barbara Bach makes a very attractive lead actress, but I hated how she was introduced to the head with the launch of a snake. I thought it was more than a little uncomfortable. Richard Johnson makes a great villain and Claudio Cassinelli a sympathetic hero. The fishmen themselves look a bit fake if the camera stays on them too long, but they look cool and I've seen worse. Some of the miniature effects look a bit poor, but overall I have seen much worse again. There is no real gore, violence or nudity, but that did not really bother me. The photograph by Giancarlo Ferrando and the production design by Massimo Antonello Geleng make a very nice film. Historical costumes, props and sets like Rackham's house and Ernest's lab with his old scientific equipment. The lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendor. I really liked this movie a lot and was entertained throughout the run. I'm not sure who I would recommend it because it mixes different genres. I think, someone who may imagine something different and generally well done. If you can find a copy, give it a try. I am glad that I did it.
