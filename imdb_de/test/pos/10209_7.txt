Hard to believe that this was led by Fritz Lang, as he directed mainly thrillers and mysteries. This film has a cast that includes Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. Scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang to save Jagger. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans telegrams to the west. Jagger hires many men to make sure it's done because they have to worry about Indian attacks and bandits. Scott is responsible for the men and Young is a telegraph expert who can not shoot a gun but can ride. Scott meets his old gang who wants to stop her, but Scott can not tell anyone. It's a pretty good Western and Lang should be routed by Western.
