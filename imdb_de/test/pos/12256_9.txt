... there was "Broadcast News" and what a good thing that was. This piece simply gets up and sounds barbaric in a way that resonates two decades later. <br /> <br /> There are moments - especially in relation to the Cutesy music - when this film turns a little over eighty or a bit too "sleepless in Seattle". Fortunately, there are only a few. <br /> <br /> One-third social satire, one-third romantic comedy, one-third drama, with three flawed but loveable people at the core, it's clever and moving almost impossible-funny. Especially Holly Hunter might never have been more fun in a comedic role. (And yes, I add "Raising Arizona", her other star from that time, to this assessment.) <br /> <br /> A legitimate classic.
