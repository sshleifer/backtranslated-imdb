Ingenious enough to be plausible and still have fun, this is a pure piece of the 70s (even the cops are in desperate need of haircuts!). Filmed in and around London, the conspiracy of American ex-con trying to go straight but being sent to a bank in Mayfair as an electrician. Then he attracted the crime of criminal lord David Niven and puts the crime before the century is well handled. <br /> <br /> I liked the simplicity and even the innocence. It's reminiscent of a time when caper films were filmed where capsule and violence were not part of the deal. All in all, you could do a lot worse than looking at this: It has enough twists and turns Twists to make a splash and a cast that was obviously fun. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and observable.
