James Cagney (The Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) has just started his career and has appeared as a gangster and social worker for a corrupt politician-run Boys Reform School. The reform students are underprivileged minors from the streets of New York, such as the East Side Kids, who were poor and without reason during the Great Depression. In the final scenes, there is a reform of the reform school boys with burning torches and a barn set on fire, and a big jump by the corrupt overseer. I noticed that they first let the horses out of the stable. This movie is not shown often and I can really understand WHY!
