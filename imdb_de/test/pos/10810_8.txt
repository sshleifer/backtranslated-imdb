Danton was a hero and one of the founders of the French Revolution of 1789. This film is shot five years later and the revolution has turned into something ugly. While the revolution initially promised freedom, the small committee that governs the country is extremely repressive and dictatorship at the time. Danton and his friends were furious that the country did not fare better in 1794 than before they got rid of their king, and they begin to criticize the government. The film begins when the printer, who makes critical pamphlets regarding the government, is beaten and his business is destroyed. So much for "freedom, equality and brotherhood"! As a result of this silence, Danton and others publicly criticized the government. Finally, Robespierre (the chairman of the committee) and his cronies bring the charges, run a show trial and get rid of the dissent. Some have mentioned that the Polish director Wajda also intended to refer to this as a criticism of his own nation, which was at that time dominated by the Soviet Union and was also very repressive. This is useful if you keep the film in mind - especially if the government destroys all dissent "in the name of the people". <br /> <br /> The drama is fine, history compelling and I have no major criticism of the movie. However, I really wish that the end would have been handled differently. Most of all, with the exception of history lovers and French, there is little doubt that this execution has helped to end the government. After this purge of Danton in April 1794 Robespierre himself was executed in July 1794 because the country had just had enough. Moreover, the surviving French knew that sooner or later they too would face the guillotine, if that sick system existed. A sort of epilogue would have been nice - for example, how the soldiers come to Robespierre. He responded by trying to kill himself first, but only managed to blow off part of his face - still alive, he was guillotined shortly thereafter. This would have been a dandy little epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes. However, there is no link between Danton's death and the overthrow of the government.
