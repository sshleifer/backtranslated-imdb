Although I've seen this film at an early age, I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd, who had escaped from Newgate Prison. Apart from the freedom that was taken in the end, the film follows more or less true to the true story. The temptation to bend the facts that are the trademark of many so-called historical films opposes this film and the filmmakers must be praised for their performance and Tommy Steele is ideally cast. Stanley Baker is also good as Thief-Taker and Alan Badel is good as always. <br /> <br /> Because the film adheres to the facts, it is apt to be seen by the whole family.
