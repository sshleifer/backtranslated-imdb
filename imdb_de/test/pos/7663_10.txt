I can never understand why people take time to watch movies they do not fully understand. I know that the people on these pages of this movie will be reading scathing reviews, and it will keep them from looking for copies of this rather forgotten, late 20s, 1932 movie, which should probably be called the "Indecent" name on the main titles. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy, known as a comic actress in countless posh roles, shows up in all as a miscast. She was a real dramatic actress, something I did not know before watching this movie, which was all her famous roles older. She is exciting and moving here, two things she never met before the graceful and refined William Powell. I'm still pretty shocked by how good she was. <br /> <br /> Becky Sharp (1935), Technicolor's first three-stripe feature, is more familiar, but this one is artistically much better and an adaptation. It is also very poignant as an expression of a film style that was about to die. You can not take my word for it, you have to see it.
