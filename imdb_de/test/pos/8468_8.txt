This is a pretty interesting experiment. It is the first, still existing attempt to combine sight with sound. It shows two men dancing to a violinist (possibly William KL Dickson himself) standing beside an Edison recording cylinder that captures the sound. <br /> <br /> The sound and the images were not linked together, nor one. And only recently have sound and image been technically combined. It's probably why people are reluctant to call this movie the first soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The film was made by William K.L. Dickson, an assistant to Thomas Edison himself, who ordered him to find a way to combine images and sound. The answer he gave was the kinetophone, a kinetoscope (basically a big wooden box with a peephole so people could watch the moving pictures) with a cylinder phonograph in it. This is the first we know and survive surviving film experiments with this technique. All later movies using the same technique were recorded as silent movies and the sound effects were later recorded separately. The Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images, but rather the attempt to provide images with sound. In some cases, people could even choose from three sound cylinders that accompanied three different orchestral performances. Only 45 kinetophones were made, so you could hardly call the kinephone a success. Also after this experiment, the focus was on other cinematographic techniques, mainly in relation to film projectors. The experiment itself obviously did not succeed, as it took more than 30 years before the first films were shot with clay made and commercially released. They still could not technically synchronize and assemble the sound and images at that time, and even if they had and techniques were available, it would have been a very costly job. So, it's not really the most influential or historically important film in film history, but it's very interesting to see people constantly trying to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> 8/10
