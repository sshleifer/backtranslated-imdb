Before this movie there were Heist movies, and indeed it was the fans of Rififi who had an obvious influence on him - but The Red Circle is more than just another entry in a crowded genre, and director Jean-Pierre Melville has created something with this film Both of which inspires the surface and gives the audience something to think about. Being cool is as important a part of modern crime thrillers as guns and gangsters, and Melville delivers in droves with this film. The sound of the film is also very relaxed and Melville lets the bulk of the movie bubble under the cool exterior. The story has several angles, but the central character is Corey - a thief who is released from prison. His release coincides with the flight of the infamous killer Vogel, who slips under the nose of police commissioner Mattei during a train ride. The first thing Corey does after his release is to steal something from his former boss Rico, and the second thing he does is to recruit Bird and a sniper to help him steal a jewel robbery. But Rico and the police are hot on the claw ... <br /> <br /> The film is screwed together by four outstanding central performances. Alain Delon is calm and calculating like the film's anti-hero, while Gian Maria Volontè is impressive in his role as an escaped murderer. François Périer is also good as a dubious club owner, while André Bourvil performs outstandingly in his role as police commissioner. The movie lasts almost two and a half hours and is not exactly an exciting ride. The director, however, remains interesting by focusing the action on the important elements. The film shows crime films such as shootings, but they are kept to a minimum. The first two-thirds of the movie are really just built at the end of the exciting robbery scene. Above all, Rififi was famous for its heist sequence - a lavishly designed scene in which nobody speaks a word. The raid in this movie is similar in that it is also wordless, and I have to say that I preferred the scene in Rififi; But Melville's skill in the direction and the calm and serene way she plays make it good. The film is at an exciting climax that completes everything nicely. Overall, this may not appeal to all crime movie fans as the action is more than a bit slow; The Red Circle, however, is an excellent movie and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.
