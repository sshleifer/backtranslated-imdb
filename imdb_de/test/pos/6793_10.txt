This is the best movie if you are inspired to follow your heart and never give up your dream. Elizabeth Taylor is Velvet and in her best years (at least from her childhood) Mickey Rooney is a cynical friend who eventually becomes her coach, and they go with her beloved horse "the Pi" to the Grand National Steeplechase. Pirate "- just so that Velvet becomes a jockey and has a chance of victory - to those of you who have not seen it yet, I will not reveal the end, but you should see it and as soon as you do, you will love it a very young Angela Lansbury as Velvet's oldest sister.
