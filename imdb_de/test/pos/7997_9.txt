What is 'Batman Returns' anyway? <br /> <br /> It was commercialized as an action movie, and many people who saw it seem to think they saw an action movie - but really, there's not much action, and Tim Burton hardly seems To be interested in it. <br /> <br /> People often associate it with the "grottest" superhero comics of the late eighties, but frankly, if you have "The Dark Knight Returns," which seems a bit absurd, Burton's exaggerated ideas more to do with the television series Dayglo Sixties (the penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck, for heaven's sake). Burton's style is often referred to as gothic, closer to what we see on screen; The penguin - deformed, vicious, with a tangled history and a subterranean cave - is a gothic threat, dressed in rather handsome Dickensian clothing - Udolfo disguised as Uriah Heep. <br /> <br /> But what about Catwoman? "She may have been raised from the dead, but this PVC catsuit is decidedly twentieth-century, and her alter ego, Selina Kyle's world, consists of boardrooms and apartments - reminiscent of a romantic comedy from the 19th century Remember 30s. <br /> <br /> And then it clicks. The smart but run-down secretary written by a lonely millionaire? The resulting complications of deception and disguise? "Batman Returns" is a romantic Hollywood-style comedy filtered through Burton's S & M dungeon sensibility. It has more to do with "The Hudsucker Proxy" (including expressionist sets) than with other superhero films. <br /> <br /> How many romantic comedies is all about revising the heroine; Not from the ugly duckling to the swan, but from the doormat to the dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her (often notable) career; She is iconically sexy as Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never had a prayer), playful and vengeful, memorable, because she knows how she deals with her whole body. Looking back, it is her scenes as Selina that impress; Almost every one of them is a little comic gemstone, especially the look we get from their lonely home. It's a finely balanced, tragicomic performance that really brings the movie to life. Nothing moves me so much as Selina and Bruce Wayne who dance under the mistletoe to Siouxsie and the Banshees, a weapon between them, simultaneously empowered and captured by their alter egos condemned to conflict. Forget about the slight sentimentality of "Big Fish" or the lush emotions of "Edward Scissorhands" - this is the most sincere scene in any of Burton's films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-hatred and no joke, all in a few lines and absolutely nailed by the actors - especially Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost meets her and finds the injured dignity buried beneath those truly repugnant long-boobs. The villain of the comics' top crust is nothing more than a deception; Burton's Penguin is a wild creature that has been subjected to his own outdated character in the style of Eliza Doolittle (almost literally "ugly duckling"). It's Burton's most radical and funniest reinvention. Max Schreck by Christopher Walken completes a perfect triptych of villains, slides with casual ease between casual charm and empty eyes (and is it just me or his company logo reminiscent of Mickey Mouse? Maybe we should ask former Disney animator Burton) < br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" - a real action movie - was praised as the first film to do Batman justice; I admire Nolan's film, but it would be a shame to dwarf this idiosyncratic gem.
