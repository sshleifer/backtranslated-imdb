I only saw this movie because I did not want to leave my 9-year-old and her friend alone in the theater. Frankly, I assumed that I would take a good nap - but I was intrigued by the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who asks! Roy's mother was on TV one of my favorite shows years ago, playing a mermaid (Maximum Bob). She was really cute in this movie. The three main characters were all outstanding young actors. Also enjoyed seeing and listening to Jimmy Buffet. The movie itself was pretty nice - some of what Florida does so well. I am glad that I went to this movie. And to think, I was disappointed that I could not take her to see "Stick It" - I think that was MUCH better!
