When I watch a short film like Boy-Next-Door, I have a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I observe something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand, I complain about the level of the generally produced comedy. Television and movies are so consistently filled with light, condescending crap that we judge excellence within a mediocre scale. Then you see someone like Davis without the "benefit" of studio notes or substantial budget; can make a really cool little comic gem. Producers and network suits need to turn to Travis Davis for material and refuse to award deals to people just because their CV or agent demands it. Hopefully, Boy-Next-Door has attracted the attention of the right people to make more Davis work possible. It's really fun and very well done!
