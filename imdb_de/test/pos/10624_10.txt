If sado-masochism is a two-sided coin containing the whole in a variety of expressions of its opposites, then the cinematic portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality. Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism and longs to seek the same for themselves. Her outward expression projects her desire. Therefore, she can hurt without guilt or regret. <br /> <br /> The talented, charming and handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), who is attracted to her because of her passion and intensity. He wants to become her disciple to be near her. She turns him out of control, but because of his talent, the Vienna Conservatory chooses him. He falls in love with her. Again she pushes him away, but he will not answer no and begins to plunge himself into ruin and the loss of self-esteem. <br /> <br /> The question that the viewer asks at this point is: Who is in control? The sadist or the masochist? Who is the sadist and who the masochist? It's difficult to say. Is it the person who has just been severely abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying in grotesque triumph and fulfillment on the ground, or is it the person who rushes out of the door, fed up and instructed that no one is to know what happened. <br /> <br /> But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. She is an extreme sex freak. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while preserving the facade of respectability. That's not really true. She says she does not care what others think. She does not care if she comes in and sees her bleeding on the floor because she's in love. Love, she calls it. Because sex and love are one and the same. At one point, Walter tells her that love is not everything. How ironic is she such an abundance. How uncommented the comment. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully edited and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke, who uses expert camerawork and carefully designed sets to make the story that depicts the essence of the action not just in a clear but exemplary way (as in the bathroom) when Walter drives high over the hall to find Erika). He also uses fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be, with timed intersections from one angle to another. This is especially important in the scene where Erika lies like a blood-dried corpse in brilliant white and black light under her lover, stiff as stone. Here we usually see only her face and the strict outline of her neck with its pulsating artery. We do not have to see anymore. <br /> <br /> The role of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert, who is not afraid of extremes. in fact, it is characterized by them. I have seen her in a number of films, and what she does better than almost anyone is the body and soul of the character. Like the woman she plays in this movie, she is not afraid of what others think, and does not care much about her appearance in a decorative sense. What is important to them is the performance and the challenge. No part is too demanding. No character too spoiled. It is as if Huppert wants to experience the whole of humanity and wants us to observe it. She is always fascinating and almost flawless. It is not only a leading light of French cinema. She is one of the great actresses of our time, who has put together an amazingly varied work. <br /> <br /> I think it is very instructive and gives us a wonderful and remarkable contrast to compare her performance here with her appearance at The Lacemaker (La Dentellière) from 1977, when she was 22 years old. There she was, sweet as an apple in her red hair and freckles, her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser. Her character was shy about sex and humble - just an ordinary French girl who one day hoped to become a beautician. Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and totally corrupted. <br /> <br /> Huppert is fortunate enough to be an actress in France, where there are parts for women older than asterisks. (Hollywood could never make a film like this.) In American cinema, only a handful of the best and hardest working actresses can hope for a career after about thirty years. Huppert's reputation is greatly enhanced by her abilities and scope, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles here and also in La Cérémonie (1995), where she plays a vile, malicious killer. <br /> <br /> See this for Isabelle Huppert. They will not forget her or the character she brings to life.
