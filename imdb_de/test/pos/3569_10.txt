Hallelujah !!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border (s) and shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage, tired of seeing Colombia so perverse and ignorant of Hollywood and others. <br /> <br /> How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted US democracy in the world (after the US), or that there is a vibrant film and television industry (- nothing about Ugly Betty) say) Bogota (9 million inhabitants) is the "World Capital of the Book" This beautiful city hosts the LARGEST International Theater Festival. I hope that Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (-Mr. & Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemeckis and Diane Thomas (Romancing the Stone) will one day visit Bogotá to see how wonderful it really is, and Bogotá's cultural vitality and diversity focus. Instead of delivering films like Maria Full of Grace, which greatly benefited Joshua Marston (for this great movie) without ever worrying about the ontological damage, his film would help perpetuate Colombia's "unjustified clouded image" <br /> - In any case, you'll really enjoy Bluff! -Oh, and thank you IMDb for your priceless / great work !!!
