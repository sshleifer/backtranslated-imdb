I have not seen this movie since it came out in a theatrical performance, and I've been looking for it ever since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and now I miss the end. It was the young love that occupied me most, not to mention John's singing and Taupin's lyrics. The story hit my psyche in my time. I'm a lover of sentimental films, and that still hangs in my head after 35 years - that's so good. Position yourself in adolescence and let your fantasies run. If this film did not arouse your curiosity, you were just too old. I'm looking forward to seeing it again (even at my age)! If nostalgia is at your venue, I'm sure this is an interesting movie. The innocence is just amazing and the simplicity is so easy and enjoyable.
