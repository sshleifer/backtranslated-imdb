As much as I refuse to disagree with the original poster, I found Asterix and the Vikings pretty good and a HUGE step before the previous attempts to animate the favorite galleries of all series would be hard to follow the series, but for those of us who who know, it is a pleasure to see them. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the animation is far superior to previous comic adaptations. You realize that they took the time and effort to really re-capture the look and feel of the comics this time around. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the movie and I can see how fans these titles were maybe a bit confused or disappointed, but I was so fascinated when I actually made one of my favorite comics from childhood who was faithfully portrayed on the canvas. All the concerns I had were comparatively insignificant. Smaller spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> Asterix and his loyal friend Obelix travel north to rescue the nephew of their village chief, who was captured by the Vikings. The Vikings believe that the boy who caused them fear can fly thanks to some ill-worded advice from their village druid. The boy meets the daughter of the Viking Chief, Abba, and they fall in love, etc., etc. ... If my explanation sounds complicated, do not worry. The plot is easy to follow! Definitely a good buy. You can purchase this DVD through Amazon France, but be forewarned. Your DVD player will probably not play it. I had to change the region setting on my computer to display it.
