After watching the trailer, it was an easy decision not to watch this movie. I mean, I'm not interested in stupid "stoner comedies". I'm sure it was an easy choice for many people to meet, smoke a bowl and watch this movie with The Simpsons man and a guy named Billy Bob. Should have been a good time, but the movie is just not so funny - too bad that someone had to go to reach its peak. Unfortunately I noticed that the trailer was misleading after he had already left the theater, so I had to wait for the video. I really enjoyed it. Beautiful locations, high quality production and excellent services from the entire cast. Looking back, the plot changes were not entirely unexpected, but I did not find it awkward because the premise was so appealing. <br /> <br /> Why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy? Has anything happened to the producer, and the associated manufacturers have left marketing alone?
