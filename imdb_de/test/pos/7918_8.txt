It is important to know that Eisenstein was a committed Marxist filmmaker who had some very specific and specific theories about what the film could achieve and how. It is simply idle to negatively compare Alexander Nevsky with anything a similar time in the US; This film is from the oldest film school in the world, from another continent, from a completely different approach to cinema. <br /> <br /> To appreciate this film a bit more, you should get to know the montages of Pudovkin and Kuleshov, for example, or read the Wikipedia entry on Marxist film theory. If you really feel brave, you can even explore the triadic forms of Hegelian dialectics. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie without understanding Eisenstein's ideas and ideals, you probably will not get it. In Alexander Nevsky, the main characters do not play themselves, but are distillations of the character of their nation. Nevsky and his generals are purposely presented larger than life because they represent stylized, heroic aspects of the entire Russian people. <br /> <br /> The acting is not made of wood, but should be reckless. It's a completely different school than the more naturalistic narrative style that Hollywood quickly adopted. Eisenstein's films are specifically * not * designed to be realistic. If something seems "obvious," whether it's lighting or speech, or a pose cast by an actor, that's what it means. Eisenstein was one of the first advocates of the film as an art form, not just as entertainment. <br /> <br /> If the cut sometimes seems to be a collision of images, that's the idea. Photographs are to contrast with each other, contain Eisenstein's films and embody elements of a political-philosophical argument, namely the Marxist dialectic. So sit back and call Hurray for Russia and her folk heroes defenders, boo at the cowardly nobles and Germanic invaders, and enjoy the difference.
