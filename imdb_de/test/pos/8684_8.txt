I recently saw a test demo of Blurred, and I'm surprised to say that it was actually pretty good! It's a movie about different groups of kids, your hillbillies, your rich snobs, your typical teenage couple, and two geeky boys and a post-hippie baby. Together, but as separate storylines, each group travels to the Gold Coast for Schoolies Week. Australia has never had trouble writing comedies, and Australia is never too short or actors who can play comedy with subtle ways and just the thing about scurrility. The cast is full of outstanding Australian actors with tremendous talent and a large screen presence. Keep your eyes on Craig Horner, a young graduate who loses optimism for a weeklong party in his Shenanigans of his friends. Travis Cotten and Mark Priestly, who successfully tackled some tricky physical comedies as two stormed the wagons, and Jessica Gower as a sweetie, but a confused teenager who was worried about love. Veronika Sywak makes her film debut, as all adolescent boys are a girl and can compete with a number of much more experienced performers. Look for Matthew Newton, who is a dodgy limousine driver.
