I was surprised how great Black Snake Moan was. Since I was a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson, I tried once. Well, by the time this was over, I was just amazed at how awesome this movie really was. I mean, everything was absolutely great and very accurate. This movie shows how great director and writer Craig Brewer (who made Hustle & Flow another great movie) can just take anything that is even ludacras and turn it into something. Well, I like it just a good time, like a movie that just makes it good. I also like that it does not show a large steroid type of the South and how it is portrayed in things as being the most disgusting place, but not this movie makes it very accurate and therefore very re-imageable. The fact was just phenomenal, especially from Christina Ricci (who deserves an Oscar for this role), the ever-great Samuel L. Jackson and even Justin Timberlake also did a great job. It's all great, and although it's not for everyone, It is definitely worth a visit for anyone who enjoys a good time. Three cheers for Black Snake Moan 9.3 out of 10 stars
