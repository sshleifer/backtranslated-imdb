Great movie about an American G.I. who leaves the army to marry a German girl who saved his life in the last days of the war. She accepts, but does she do it because she really likes him or because he can support her with easier access to food and so on? Meanwhile, her brother and an old friend form an anti-American terrorist group called Werewolves, whose purpose is to expel the inhabitants (you may remember the same group that starred in Lars von Trier's film Europa (Zentropa)). James Best, who became known for his role as Roscoe P. Coltrane in the television series The Dukes of Hazzard in the 1980s, is shockingly outstanding as an American. He should have become a big movie star? At this age, he reminds me a lot of Warren Beatty. The other main players are good too. Fuller's direction is pretty good, lots of long takes are used again (though they're not nearly as complex as Park Row, the long process is mostly long-dialogue scenes, the only problems are in the script, as in all others It's not too bad, but it would have needed to be expanded, highlighting important characters and parts of the script, Helga's wife making a big change, but completely out of the screen. That's why the emotional center is right on the back of Best Fuller should have killed the sick mother early in the movie, I hope that does not sound too hard, she just does not do anything in the movie except to lie in bed, she has so few But Fuller keeps pulling her up while the movie continues, I would have made her death solidify the relationship between David and Helga herself, and the film is ending rupt and he lacks profit. These are not really the biggest flaws in the world (as I've described, they sound bigger than they are). 10.9.
