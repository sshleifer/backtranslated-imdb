Good show, really good acting, and the director takes us through his plot in an interesting, unpredictable way, especially since it's essentially two people in a room. It does not rush like many modern films, but does not pull either. Bohl is fun enough to believe her character's "now," who is still involved and does not use her career choices. So it is believable without her having to give us a deep self-examination of her soul ... Brundage has the delicate balance of weight, innocence, gentleness and class to convey 'Buddy' very well. A bit grainy in film quality, but it fits the tone of the story. Could use a little polishing on the hair and make-up of things, but definitely worth a look.
