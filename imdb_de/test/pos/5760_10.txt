Why did I vote 10/10 for this movie, which is totally excited *? Quite simply, because if you just make fun of it, you can just laugh until you choke. Some people will find that it goes too far, there is certainly not something for everyone, but whenever I'm down and just need something really stupid to laugh about, chew on Bottom or GHP and I can do all mine Problems are forgotten and transported into a magical dark and strange world. <br /> <br /> * "Completely detrimental" is an Australian expression, it has no literal translation.
