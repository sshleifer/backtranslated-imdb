If you like the excitement of a good submarine drama and the fun of a good comedy, this movie is highly recommended. Kelsey Grammer offers an excellent performance here. <br /> <br /> The film also gives you some ideas when a serious sub-movie asks for "Silent Running" the next time ... <br /> <br />
