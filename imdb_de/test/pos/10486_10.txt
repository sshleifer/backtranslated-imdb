In Babette's Feast, healing is for me: to improve the schism between mind and body in Orthodox Christianity. This Puritan community in far-off Denmark lacks a proper appreciation of all the gifts of God in creation. They have the dualism of St. Paul made extreme and emphasize the life of the "spirit", not the life of the "flesh". Both older sisters, in their youth, were afraid of the lure of love and the temptations of living outside their simple village. She and her parishioners cling to the close Biblical interpretation of their former leader and the father of the sisters. The aging community has become restive and the sisters do not know what to do. Enter Babette, a French stranger, and someone to whom they can show kindness. They do not know that they will eventually return their friendliness and give fertile ground to their dry, dusty theology. Babette will give everything she has, and she will be able to change the lives of the sisters and their flock of grace, sacrifice, and sensual experience (as in the Bread and Wine of the Eucharist) and why true art moves teach us so deep If they can forgive themselves and themselves, they can concentrate on the love of God, which unfolds in front of them concretely in front of them. As a minister and artist I can not recommend a film higher. True art and true grace !!
