This short film (and the poem behind it) is one of the greatest metaphors I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The poem is beautiful! It describes exactly the feeling of a person who hunts a dream and can not realize it? but it also says how to do it! I see the "Cat and Moon History" as a beautiful metaphor for human relationships, passion and love. <br /> <br /> Technically, it is also a good job. The animation in black and white gives the film and its message, but also the tenderness and nostalgia, though it is very simple, an allegory. <br /> <br /> In addiction, the music also contributes to this poetic feeling. <br /> <br /> "Nothing else is important! I'll wait, she'll come if she can or when she wants!"
