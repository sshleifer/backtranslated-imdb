It starts with a look at Earth and Jupiter. <br /> <br /> Where are we from and where are we going? <br /> <br /> The story begins with "the dawn of man". a documentary look at the prehistoric grass eater monkey whose extinction was threatening because he had no physical abilities to hunt him and the lack of grass and water in Australian Africa. The monkeys would not have survived if there had not been the "godlike" intervention of an alien artifact that somehow transformed the monkeys that touched it and gave them the ability to use tools that were first used as allowed weapons. They kill pigs to eat for super and kill other monkeys in water battles. This monkey was human. a mysterious start to a mysterious movie. After the fast-forward, which is currently leaving the film, we see a great dance of the spaceships at the sound of Strauss. The rest of the film is about how tools had control over man. The strange artifact seems to evolve man to his final stage: the star child. At 1968, the year this movie was released, only astronauts had an idea of ​​what was in space. That has changed after this movie. Futurism took 7 years to be explored. The special effects are incredible. They are still completely realistic today. <br /> <br /> The directing together with excellent taste in music, good acting and the fantastic filmography make it an epic. <br /> <br /> The storyline, with its vision of the year 2001 and the development of tools for humans, with an AI Psycokiller, with the psycotropical hypnotizing finish, it becomes the journey of our lives. If you have never seen this movie, you will see it. Do not be afraid of the lack of dialogue, sit back and enjoy. It is a symphony of evolution. it is great.
