This is an amazing movie and is very skilled in dealing with the few actors and sets. It is also very shocking - the physical and psychological torture (both explicit and implied) is mixed with quiet and even humorous steps. The horror is always unexpected and brutal. I'm not soft, but that should be the most shocking movie I've ever seen. The message of this movie is definitely delivered with a sledgehammer. For this movie I will always remember both actors.
