I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 6 years old - my grandma thought it would be a nice children's movie to entertain me and keep me busy ... but every time I saw it, I had in it Nightmares. Yes, he masquerades as a children's movie, but even now I find it very dark, especially the haunting music that is played every time the guardian angel appears on the screen, and her more hypnotic eyes and voice. The actual "villains" of the movie, ie the sharks, Mr. Grimes, etc. did not scare me, I found the whole movie just scary and dark. This is obviously something I can appreciate now since I was 21 years old, but from experience I can not show it to my kids!
