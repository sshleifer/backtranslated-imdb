Hey, what do you expect from a very low budget movie? Although I have not yet seen "Dahmer" (2002), I can say that according to the media on Jeff, this is a fairly accurate representation. I studied the case of Jeffrey Dahmer and learned everything about this man. This is a low budget movie, but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can get past Gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind is. I loved this movie! Just set yourself on a low budget and do not run out of blood. It is a story from the eyes of a murderer and his actions and thoughts from childhood to his arrest. My favorite line is, "If they bothered to look in the back seat, it might have saved many lives."
