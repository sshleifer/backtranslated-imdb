A thought-provoking, humble account of the human tragedies of war. A small but altruistic view of the interactions of a family with the enemy during the civil war in Kentucky. This film reduces the "glamor" of the war. This not only shows the soldier, but also the whole family unit. <br /> <br /> Many of today's films show war as an opportunity to highlight the "heroes" and other glamorous features of the war, but few attempts show the true effect of war on a community. This film attempts to do so by retelling a person's memories of those days. It is alleged that this film is a loose translation of an actual event, although in reality this film is probably an actual reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands of "actual events" during the Civil War. I warmly recommend that anyone interested in our Civil War watch this movie.
