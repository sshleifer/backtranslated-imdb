The creature of the early 80s refers to a long abandoned gold mine, which some intrepid miners want to check out. Of course, they do not find gold down there, but a very hungry monster, moving in search of prey. <br /> <br /> Although I have to be honest and admit, I found it boring at first (personally I prefer the thematically similar.) "The Boogens"), it actually grew with me. Now the characters are not too interesting, as are the actors. The most interesting character is Morgan, played by Keith Hurt. In any case, the female lead Terri Berland looks pretty good and Rolf Theison makes his domineering jerk easy to hate. The writer, who is played by the effect man Mark Sawicki, takes off quickly. <br /> <br /> It begins in a predictably predictable way with a nocturnal set-piece that claims two victims that things could lead to an acceptable start. The monster itself is intriguing to its design (as you can imagine it will be uncovered until late in the game) and to the product of stop-motion animation when this process was not used very often. Director Melanie Anne Phillips (directed by the pseudonym David Michael Hillman) and the crew deserve recognition for creating atmosphere. They manage to make the movie look pretty claustrophobic and gloomy, and their lighting works well. The film is very focused on a pretty good ending. Suffice to say, they do the best they can with their low budget. <br /> <br /> An obscure little item that's worth looking for hardcore horror buffs. <br /> <br /> 7/10
