I've watched this movie 4 times in 5 months and never get tired just because it's perfect. And it also has the best film music of all time and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean, you have to love Robert Duval, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie, but especially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer Vs. Kramer won an Oscar instead of this amazing war movie. This is my conclusion, if you take the director of the biggest movie in the world (The Godfather) and the best Hollywood actors you can only follow. All I have to do now is write something to get this preview. So read this line only in the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
