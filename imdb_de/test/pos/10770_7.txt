Mas Oyama was the most successful karate master of the late 20th century. He declined the "training" of the karate clubs of that time and focused on an intensive no-hold training. He eventually built his system into a huge business empire with hundreds of schools around the world, without compromising his teachings. The tests in the Kyokushin schools are still some of the most physically demanding tests a martial arts school requires. A non-physical hardship Oyama faced was biased by his Korean descent, and he spent time proving his loyalty to Japan and Japanese karate. This film series was part of this effort, although anyone who met Oyama (I did) would never question his affiliation with Japan. In this series, the most famous student of Oyama, Sonny Chiba, is invited to portray his master. Oyama comes from the country where he trained alone. He challenges the established karate schools he meets and makes short-time work. Angered by the state of karate, Oyama returns to his solitary training. He eventually picks up a student, falls in love, and gets in the way of gangsters allied with the established karate schools. In the middle is the legendary bullfighting with a crazy bull. How much of the film is correct is questionable. <br /> <br /> That Oyama could kill a bull with his bare hands is true. He was asked to repeat this feat several times. There are filmed cases of Oyama that actually do this, although sometimes the bulls were tethered when Oyama developed for years. Sonny Chiba portrays his master with conviction and the karate is pretty good. Chiba may not have been the best karate practitioner, but by then he was certainly above average. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is good, much better than most martial arts films in the drama department. I've always wondered why it's not known anymore. Maybe the very realistic representations of martial arts. People get tired and hurt, as opposed to 99% of the action movie, where the hero is an endless source of energy and every stroke kills an opponent immediately. Chiba seems so exhausted at one point that it hurts to watch. Maybe the audience does not reflect reality so well. <br /> <br /> Recommended especially for martial artists.
