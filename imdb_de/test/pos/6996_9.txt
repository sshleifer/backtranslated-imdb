As a fan of sci-fi movies, I also like alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. It goes well with the Alien series. But it's not an alien, it's something else. OK, enough comparisons. But I think this film is why people are afraid of the dark. You can not run away before dark. It is impossible. You have to be confronted with the darkness and with it, which is dark. In this movie I also liked that the Vin Diesel character Richard B. Riddick was not a typical good boy. He had secrets and has done bad things in the past. For the other people, he is a hero who tries to save them all. Above all, he wants to leave the planet himself. There are also other metaphors in this story. Every big sci-fi fan should see this picture.
