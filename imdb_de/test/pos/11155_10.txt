Although I agree that this was a sitcom of the fifties, I do not feel it was "typical". First, Donna Reed was a strong woman, unlike the normal sitcom mothers of the 50s. She campaigned for women's values ​​and equal rights (remember the episode in which the announcer says "just a housewife") and Donna advocates for all women representing her, especially those who do not work outside the home? And if the women rebelled against something in the series, that was not trivial ... There was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men. Keep in mind that Donna Reed was married to the producer of the show, so she had much more influence in making her own character stronger. <br /> <br /> The kids were smart, but not precocious. They were normal kids. And they could ACT. <br /> <br /> Another thing that stood out about Donna Reed Show was not just that the kids looked like their parents, but you could feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real situation that came out in the characters. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson have often written and noted that they were treated like the children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz and that the adults violently protected the children actors and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had some sexual chemistry that was not on the other family shows. And the characters could be flawed and larger and still be accepted for mistakes and mistakes. These were not super-parents who did not do anything wrong and had no emotional ups and downs. They were normal people who behave like normal people. Women's rights, drug abuse, child abuse, single fathers, poverty, children who need good health care but can not afford it ... everything was shown on this show. Pretty groundbreaking for the era. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed's show lasted eight years with no reason. And it could possibly have endured if Tony Owens and Donna Reed did not get divorced. <br /> <br /> This show is heavily undervalued and should be shown for other generations to appreciate quality. <br /> <br In summary, I agree with the original poster that is obviously interested in the show, but I think the Donna Reed show has SO much more to offer than occasional entertainment.
