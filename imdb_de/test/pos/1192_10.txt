I do not say anything about music, because this subject can be so deep that it can become a big separate review, so let's focus on a movie that is brilliant ... Undoubtedly one of Forman's best works. <Br /> <br /> The simple story of love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh yes, the ideals for which even pacifists are ready to go to war ... <br /> <br / > There is not a single wrong word, single wrong character, single wrong feeling in the story because love, freedom and friendship are not complicated for the characters of the movie. These things are not something that "everyone can look at from different angles". These are not things that need thinking. Her love is simple, her friendship is simple, her ideals are as simple as the word "simple". and that's why these characters are so deep. Berger, the leader of a hippie played by Treat Williams, is a guy who lives and that's the luckiest thing for him ... he has his ass - (as he sings in one of the scenes in the movie) and that is enough to make him happy with his property ... Berger never accepts that something can not be done ... and his right ... when he returns to the banquet of a rich man with his dirty old clothes and his long, long hair If he wants to go to another state, just to see his friend, he will do it ... he never thinks twice ... he just does it. <br /> <br /> How? Why is he so powerful? The answer is simple: Because it is FREE. <br /> <br /> Just watch the wind make the hair waving in this movie, and you'll understand everything, maybe you'll even free yourself.
