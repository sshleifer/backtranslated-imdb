At first glance, a movie like Northfork, a city to be flooded in 1955, and a group of 6 characters sent to evacuate the remaining inhabitants of the city could be a common movie. When we soon meet a remaining priest who cares for a sick child, a greedy landowner, we could expect a simple story that we could all easily digest. But when you first introduce the film, you notice the astounding, wide-open cinematography and a scene that lacks a church space with a missing wall that opens to the pastures and picturesque mountains of the cattle grazing mountains. It quickly becomes clear that after this scene and some inhabitants of the cities, the population is not an ordinary movie and not an ordinary story, but something very special and unique. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it's not so clear, but the cinematography and scenery that the viewer sees is awesome, and the characters who live in this small, dying area are just unbelievable , It's either what brings you closer to this Qwerky movie, or you're bored sitting there waiting for something to happen. <br /> <br /> The films are deeply spiritual and have dreamy qualities, they give a slow and methodical approach I am sure that some viewers will be bored, but if you are patient and see the big picture, the movie is great to experience. <br /> <br /> Rating 8 out of 10
