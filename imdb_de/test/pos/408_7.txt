There are three of these films, all of which are similar in style and extremely amusing. Red plays radio madness Wally Benton, aka The Fox, who gets involved in real life crime with his fianc√©, played by her typical war-girl neighbor Ann Rutherford. Many of the singles and gags are stupid and were probably in the 1940s, which I expected. But just as many have actually made me laugh, which was at least unexpected. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence, surprisingly I say, because I grew up with a much older version of the man whose charm really did not play well in my impressive years. However, I must give preference to these films if you are in the mood for this kind of nostalgic fare. I almost threw with a light heart, but in truth people are wasted and beaten up and dare, I say it, the tension is sometimes well above average. As with most of the films of that time, she will get a PI rating (politically wrong) for reasons you can imagine. War is funny that way, I think, and then it's those movies again. Look at one, look at each other.
