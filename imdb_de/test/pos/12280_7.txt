The copy of this movie that I saw is not very good. It is grainy and has almost no color in some places. It switches between English and French, often in the middle of a sentence and sometimes even in the middle of a word! To make matters worse, there are no English subtitles in the French-speaking parts that I think make up at least a quarter of the movie. But amazingly, the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable in that state, and I think that says a lot about how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> This is a first class Western Spaghetti Great Drama, an interesting storyline and an excellent music score. It also has a cool protagonist, a beautiful dark-haired girl, some weird characters and events and a general sense of melancholy. This movie is titled "Euro". <br /> <br /> I hope there is an undeniable negative or imprint of this movie out there because it deserves a quality DVD release, and if it comes out, I'll do it. Be one of the first in the Row to get it!
