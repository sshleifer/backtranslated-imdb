Just beautiful. It's long. No high point Do not wait until something happens. Great for a rainy day. About a man in a midlife crisis who leads his family to a remote area of ​​the Greek islands. I saw this in my youth and I still love it 20 years later. But I could not find it in video stores. Molly Ringwald is a cute average teen who basically wants to go home and get involved somehow. There are no telephones, no television, no boredom, boring and then reflecting upon the human situation in such silence. And that's what every character does. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with John Cassavetes's character, but he can not, well, you know. Gina Rowlands is the woman who loves him but is about to give up her marriage. He is demanding and frustrating for everyone. There's another character in the movie, a Greek who talks inappropriately about sex with Molly Ringwald, but things she's curious about. But he is irritating and horny and I did not like this character. The locale of the movie makes this movie so good. It would not work if filmed elsewhere. I recommend this movie and give a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
