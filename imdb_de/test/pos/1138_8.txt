Ten years before "The Matrix" and hot on "The Live" came this brilliant piece of inexpensive science fiction movies. If you like bizarre, unconventional and intellectual challenges, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style and you will love "Split". There are moments of true genius in imaging and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence of wine glasses in an opening party and then a scene with cue cards. The plot involves a man named Starker, who lives outside of society and wants to wake us from the dream. Similar to "They Live," "1984," and "The Matrix," it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by Big Brother-type government officials who know everything about us and have invisible robotic probes that are constantly in the city patrol. That's all revealed pretty early in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Strong has invented a drug that, when put into the water supply, will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality. In addition to the cinematography and the ingenious way the director gets along with his low budget, the monologues are the film. I urge everyone not to turn back, memorizing and quoting the classic quotes from this film for the next few years.
