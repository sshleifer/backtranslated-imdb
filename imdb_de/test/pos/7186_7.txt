The French are not known as big movie producers. <br /> <br /> Although her Amelie scores high points at the Oscars. Asterix et Obelix is ​​a very different film of what I'm used to from France. It's a great movie, especially for kids. The only thing that condemned me was that it was spoken in French and subtitled language. Normally I do not have to read the subtitles for the English-language films (here in the Netherlands). But with the French language you just have to read to understand. The story itself is just great with Obelix, who does not remember fat, but there are also nice details, especially in names like brucewillix and malcomix. They all know the story from the comic books and this movie shows the most slide-to-slide instructions. Everything is in there, from the Sfinx nose that brakes until red beards of pirates lose three more ships. I would say, a great movie for the weekend with the kids.
