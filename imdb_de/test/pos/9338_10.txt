Without a doubt, this is the big mum of all music videos !!! In contrast to most music videos where either "dance videos" are poorly narrated and / or poorly phrased texts, this has been done correctly. Jackson was co-author and heavily choreographed by evidence from VH1 and directed this masterpiece. You could say thriller is scarier than most horror movies with the last sparkling eye. For me, this music video is what you judge all other music videos. One can easily see the sinister influence that M. J. had on the early break dance with the zombie march. Because of the dancing, the comedy, the storyline and the yes-horror. I give him 5 out of 5.
