Red Skelton (in his first lead role) stars Wally Benton, who plays "The Fox" on a radio program. He writes the murder secrets and solves them as "The Fox". Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) tries to figure out how to do the perfect murder of someone. He abducts Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another friend (Virginia Gray). He tells Benton to write down the perfect murder ... or his girlfriends get him ... <br /> <br /> Very funny and entertaining movie. Fast moving (only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really do that. Skelton is very good in his first leading role - very funny, fast, good looking and intelligent. Veidt is awarded as a bad Jones. Rutherford and Gray are a lot of fun as Skelton's girlfriends. All three play each other perfectly - their verbal sparring is the highlight of this picture. It's also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role. <br /> <br /> Worth your time.
