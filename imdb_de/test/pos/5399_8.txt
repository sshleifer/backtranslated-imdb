Imaginary Heroes, the notable work of then-24-year-old Dan Harris, is tagged with "People are never what they seem". Perhaps this is wisely chosen as a marketing strategy; Nevertheless, I rented this movie despite the Sloglines rather than because. And I am glad that I did it. I found the movement an illuminating investigation of the tragedy. Personally, I found it a film about how to deal with dreams, especially those that are lost. For a son, "loss" requires an in-depth study of what he had and did not have in his life. Although the central tragedy of the film raises tantalizing questions, it is, above all, the background against which various coping styles are relieved. I think the film asks for an important question: how do we deal with our dreams, especially when heroes become imaginary?
