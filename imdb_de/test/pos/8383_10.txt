I have to admit, when I saw the preview for "Inglorious Basterds", which I had great expectations for. This movie was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie with such high expectations, I rarely meet or exceed those expectations. This movie has that and much more. More often, I clap at the end of a movie, I've done that and everyone else in the theater. <br /> <br /> I have to say, I'm a bit biased towards Quentin, I grew up with "Pulp Fiction". "I looked at it when I was 12, and it's still my favorite and most influential movie. <br /> <br /> However, Quentin has not lived up to his billing since then, and his style has become somewhat predictable honestly, the quality was not there (I never saw Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse.) That's until "Inglorious Basterds." What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a Western one Spaghetti atmosphere that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but since Leone is dead, Tarantino is the self-styled guy on this masterpiece /> So let's take a look at the movie I'm not going to reveal. a nice transition between the use of not just one but four different languages ​​in this film, not to mention that this movie was built in the classic Tarantino form, great scenes with rich , meaningful dialogues and sudden, shocking actions. <br /> <br /> The acting was great !! Christopher Waltz earns an Oscar seriously. I do not say that often, but honestly, the guy should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie and delivered with such amazing touch and attitude. He stole the show in a movie, all of which were amazingly impressive. <br /> <br /> I have no problem setting up this movie because this movie is the best movie I have seen all year, and probably the whole next year. To be honest, I think this movie can crack my best movies ever and is Quentin's best movie since "Pulp Fiction". Take it from me, watch this movie. I loved that it does not give enough justice to this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw it yesterday and I'm still excited. Thank you, Quentin, wholeheartedly for making this film. You're back up, buddy. I can not say enough for "Inglorious Basterds!" Say.
