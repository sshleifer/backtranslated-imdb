A stolen shipment of Vigoroso, the Mexican Viagra; a beautiful girl trying to rebuild her life and leave her husband, a chief of the Italian mafia; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old treasure. This is the plot of "The Shipment," a land comedy in the small town of Paradise, Arizona. Despite its simple and classic history, the film (directed by Alex Wright) has its funny moments: when Elizabeth Berkley (as Candy Porter), staring at a green pill from Vigoroso, says, "What's that?" A mint sweet? "Or when the girl enters the sheriff's house and finds him completely naked, or when the delivery of Vigoroso lands in that lake in the final sequence ... The cast offers some beautiful performances: by Matthew Modine as sheriff of the Paradise Valley, the his old girlfriend still loves, and Elizabeth Berkley, who still loves her old friend ... The minor cast, including Nicholas Turturro, Paul Rodriguez (as Mexican Jos√®) and G. Michael Gray (what kind of teeth ...) , make a pleasant impression work too, not an Oscar material, but not so bad.A funny comedy without pretension.
