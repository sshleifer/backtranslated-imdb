I accidentally ordered a new version of Robin Hood from the BBC. Very disappointing compared to RoS. Terrible costumes and backgrounds. While I enjoyed the sheriff who was inspired by Nick Grace, the rest of the cast left much to be desired. As an "example," Marion's costume looked suspiciously like Walmart. And Sir Guy, well, he looked like a character from a space movie! RoS probably stole the spotlight forever in the narrative of this story. Clannad's cast, costumes, storylines, scenes, film footage and soundtracks are all outstanding, as evidenced by the continuing response after 26 years. RoS is a timeless classic. Many thanks to all who made the series.
