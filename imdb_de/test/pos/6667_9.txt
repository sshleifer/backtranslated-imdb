I really enjoyed this movie. I had read the book over ten years ago and was fascinated by how it would be translated into film. <br /> <br /> The script is very much in line with the book that fascinated me - that's a rarity today. The characterizations were solid and believable, and the stuttering changed my perceptions, though I already knew the ending from the book. <br /> <br /> An intelligent and well-made film.
