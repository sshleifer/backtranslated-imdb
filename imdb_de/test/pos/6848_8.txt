Thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for luck. This one was a totally unexpected gem. Normally, I'm not even a suspense / thriller fan. These satisfying 100 minutes have more twists than a promenade pretzel. It has an erotic romance that is reminiscent of "body heat" in several ways. it has cops and crimes; political intrigue and just a pinch of soap during the day. It has just the right track of violent violence that every professional crime job done by the numbers must use. Emma Thompson (FBI AIC) shows off her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for a fake southern accent by a limey. Alan Rickman (local policeman), who always seems to steal the show, is excellent, but not overbearing. They work well as a couple. Many plot errors that never get out of control and reconnected at the end of the film. And who is this amazing woman, Carla Gugino? I want her to give birth to my children. Carla, when you're out there, let's have lunch
