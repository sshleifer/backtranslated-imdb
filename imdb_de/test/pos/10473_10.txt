I can not imagine a film that better grasps the concept of grace in the theological sense. The well-meaning religiosity of a small church that went wrong after the death of its leader robs them of what they preach: grace. The costly gift of a humbled culinary Parisian genius makes them love each other and humiliates an aging general who is worried that he has wasted his life. ELECTIONS is both a central theme and grace. At the same time, artistic talent is given a powerful, transcendent role in everyday life and future life. Can not be improved or ignored. This is a life changing film for those who hear his message.
