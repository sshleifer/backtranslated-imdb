This is the last film by Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors of cinematic history. He wanted to retire after this film, in a way it is his artistic testament. He died a few years after he made the film, and although it is said he wanted to direct, Destiny decided that this was indeed his last. And what a movie! <br /> <br /> 'Rouge', the last film in the tri-color French trilogy, is actually a very Swiss film. In Geneva, one of the two main characters plays a retired Swiss judge. Durenmatt is immediately involved. In the cool atmosphere, in the lack of communication of the characters, in the courtesy that surrounds the cruelty of life, there is more Switzerland. Several characters who start with little relationship will eventually come together in a moving and human finale that only a great artist could have staged. Little else can be said, which was not said and written times. Yes, the movie starts slowly and fans of American-style action movies or melodramas are first discouraged and lost as spectators. They earn it. The film is gaining in quality as it progresses, and one of the not-so-hidden messages is that real life and real people are more interesting than the Hollywood cartoon and the plastic action and characters. The cinema quality is very original, the picture is a "study in red", as the title shows. Acting is fantastic, with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - later in probably the best role of his age. <br /> <br /> A great movie. Goodbye probably adds that, and I'm glad I recorded it on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.
