A D.B. Sweeney fan, I've been watching this movie for a long time. I recently rented the video and found it very enjoyable. There were some really funny scenes. The disturbed life of some characters has been disturbing, but I think the film has also shown that it is possible to keep your life on track or to get it back on track in the event it's derailed.
