I love this movie. It was ONLY made before the LA punk scene worsened. It keeps the mood and attitude of this time and place perfect. I am really happy that I joined four of the bands in the Fleetwood that evening. The only part that does not fit so well are the sections with Catholic discipline and their social commentary. I have not seen too many people who ever wanted that. The rest of the film shows attitudes that I have often experienced; People who have to deal with hard lives or make a dash in the music industry and / or lousy hippies. I do not think I have seen a documentary that captures the subject so authentically and personally.
