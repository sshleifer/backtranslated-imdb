The history of TV-to-film adaptations is littered with aberrations that prove almost conclusively that tradition should never have begun. However, there are a few examples that can do it. Rising Damp first appeared to be the last sitcom suitable for large screen treatment, as this hilarious series was located within the confines of a northern dorm. Even the writer Eric Chappell was not paid enough to create a completely original script. He took a series of TV episodes and sewed them to form the movie body. This did not necessarily mean that the script failed. David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same with their screenplay for Dad's Army and it worked very well. Although the episodes of the early father's army, with their quiet pace and lavish conspiracy, were much better suited for adapting films. However, the Rising Damp episodes were energetic from the first scene to the breathless climax. When one story is completed and another is started, the scenes within the movie become incoherent. Another trap for the movie version of a television series are the inevitable comparisons. In this respect, the film pale in comparison to Rising Damps brilliant series. Despite all this, Rising Damp the Movie manages to be entertaining and at times rebellious. It is perhaps not surprising that the most beautiful moments occur in sequences written especially for the film. This includes a rugby match in which Rossiter makes a brilliantly contemporary game. While all the actors master their roles perfectly (as a substitute for the deceased and really great Beckinsale), Leonard Rossiter is the best as Rigsby. In fact, Rising Damp should have been filmed as a movie, just so Rossiter was eligible for an Oscar, so great is his acting talent. He was not even nominated criminally. In the end, the movie can not keep up with the dizzying heights of the TV series, claiming to be a comedy with some beautifully played moments.
