To my eternal shame I have never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies "Nosferatu". However, if they show only half of the creativity and enjoyment of Buster Keaton's effort, I'll probably try to see a few more. This is really funny and an impressive introduction to the world of silent comedies. The premise, as it is, focuses on an unfortunate case of false identity, as Keaton is held for the well-known villain Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair). This leads to a series of chases and escapes as the authorities approach the increasingly desperate Keaton. <br /> <br /> You will be amazed and entertained alike. Keaton is a natural comedian, but also an accomplished stuntman. He judges how he jumps and jumps on speed like Jackie Chan. And the comedy also has an exceptionally high standard - My Better Half had to interrupt a phone conversation with her parents because she laughed too much! If you have never experienced such a silent film, this is a real revelation - it certainly blew away all the ideas I had about silent movies. Of course it's not as polished as today's movies - acting is pretty awful to tell the truth, but that does not matter because you enjoy the movie anyway. Anyone who is temporarily interested in movies should take the trouble to look at it, as it will not disappoint. Brilliant!
