This is a story of a long and awkward love. The daily life of a woman of 50 years and some people around her is shown. Her everyday life is so commonplace and routine that I doubted who the real protagonist was in the beginning. Then the audience knows that the woman and a man who was her classmate had a very tiny connection. The woman did the same job - a milk woman and a supermarket cashier - for so long. There are so many slopes that it is very difficult to deliver milk bottles. The man had married another woman who is now dying of cancer. He works in the town hall and cares passionately at home. They neither look straight nor talk to each other, but they never forget each other. <br /> <br /> The Japanese original title means "Sometimes you read books". But when the man said, "Now I want to do what I always wanted to do," it was to hug and love her. She writes to a radio disc jockey: "If God gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day." Dreaming of this day, she has increased the desire in hard work and reading books. Personally, I know a woman who has loved a man for many years, even after he married another woman and was killed in an accident. Therefore, the story setting is not special. Rather, this film also shows unspoken romances in many ordinary men and women. In this movie you will remember your long-lost romance. This is a movie with a lasting impact.
