Have you ever seen a movie or a documentary and heard screaming things like "No, do not do it!" Have to hold off? No? Well, it's time for you to do it. And no doubt, DEEP WATER is the starting point for you. <br /> <br /> The story is based on that of Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the first worldwide yacht race undertaken in 1968 by individuals. This word "individuals" is important as the men who have set off for this almost suicidal escapade break up alone. <br /> <br /> Most men are known to launch in the maritime communities of England (where they live), but one of them is the "unknown dark horse" and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Crowhurst fights financially and asks for a supporter who can take everything from him if he fails to survive at least a large part of the race. He could take his home, his belongings and everything. Crowhurst is now between a rock and ... well ... deep water: either try to run with an unproven ship and an undisclosed captain. or lose everything you own (which has been significant since Crowhurst had a wife and several children). It also mentions the term "unproven captain". He was not only unproven, he had never been out in the open! Did I mention suicidal? Deep Water is moved between archival pre-run and post-race footage and those of Crowhurst's friends, family, and acquaintances of today. The film was initially considered a poor juice that came in over his head. It gradually shows you the limited possibilities that Crowhurst had after months and months on the water. His ship licks. Equipment breaks off. The psyche stretched to the breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in an inner struggle, without a successful way out. It is also interesting to see the psychological fractures that other racers have when they spend their solitary aboard aboard their respective boats. <br /> <br /> The wave-like emotions you will feel as you look at it This amazing documentation can make you a little bit sick (much like trying to get your sea-legs). And you'll probably be frustrated when making decisions. maybe as frustrated as poor Mr. Crowhurst. <br /> <br /> The end is also amazing in that we see the actual ship that Crowhurst has sailed and sits on a Caribbean beach and rots ... not unlike things at the end of this ill-considered race left and rotted felt. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable.
