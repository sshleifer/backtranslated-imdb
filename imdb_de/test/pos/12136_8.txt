<br /> <br /> Very good movie from the 1970s about mob operations in New Jersey. If a maverick gangster sooner or later does not play by the rules of the neighborhood, it's time for elimination. <br /> <br /> Joe Pesci was true to his character - smooth and witty. He only gets better with age. His face and today's fame should not have been used on the DVD cover to sell this class B movie, since he was only the third billed star music makes for distraction. Nice to see the big cars of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is good though. <br /> <br /> Nudity by Anne Johns was not needed to get this mob story going. And she does not appear in the database because she acts again in any movie other than this one. Pity; she did a good job! <br /> <br /> Moral of the story: Do not get upset with your "Don". <br /> <br /> If you want to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night, then watch this DVD. It was part of a DVD special featuring three films for $ 5.88 at the discount store. <br /> <br />
