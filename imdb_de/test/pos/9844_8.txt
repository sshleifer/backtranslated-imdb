James Cagney, a thug and police chief, becomes Deputy Commissioner of Corrections and attends a reform school for boys. The catch is that Cagney is not there for the refinement, he really wants to change the lives of the kids there, because he comes from a similar environment like them. <br /> <br /> The villain of the play is Dudley Digges is a grafting tool and a hypocritical hypocrite. One of the subtexts of The Mayor of Hell's conspiracy is that these children are mainly immigrants, and those who judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here for a few generations. In the show hall scene, pay attention to how Digges offers a prayer of thanks for the food they will receive. Digges eats well, but the kids get quality you would not give your pet. <br /> <br /> Cagney has some problems with some of his followers in town, and he has to take it on the lamb. This means that Digges is responsible for the climax again. <br /> <br /> The mayor of hell was a typical product of the working class workshop. And because it was pre-code, it sometimes gets pretty cruel. A later version of it, Crime School, with Humphrey Bogart and the Dead End Kids, was a gentler remake. <br /> <br /> Although Cagney is fine in the lead role, Madge Evans is the school nurse, the actress honors Dudley Digges. Hard to believe that the same man could represent the drunken, but one-legged ship's doctor in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is a good player and a pleasure to watch in every movie he's in. <br /> <br /> This film is not often shown because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it depicts. Many minorities would be offended today. Still, it's a good movie. Interestingly, the movie Sleepers came out a few years ago and some of the same issues were raised. I think movies about reform schools are not changing at any time.
