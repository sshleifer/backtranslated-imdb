Kevin Spacey once again wins a winner with K-PAX, an enchanting film that expresses deep revelations about human existence through the naive, yet unquestionably, true point of view of the Prot figure. <br /> <br /> It's fun to try and find out if it's him or not, if the plot expands and the character of Robert Porter is pronounced. For some, however, the end may be a little unsatisfactory, but in reality it could not be otherwise. <br /> <br /> My few problems with the film are about the more cartoony and simplified presentation of mental patients. I was surprised because the filming shows a lot of intelligence and I do not think that she would have lost anything if she had been more honest with the behavior of people with mental health problems. <br /> <br /> That is, I realize this was a movie and not a documentary, and the movie itself is exquisitely shot and the story is unpacked at a gratifying pace. <br /> <br /> Bridges is awesome and Spacey delivers a lazy and relaxed performance that's more like a stand-up than an alien. <br /> <br /> A good movie that will get you talking to your friends.
