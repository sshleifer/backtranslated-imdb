A nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by Doctor Stephens. She is upset when she learns that the doctor has died, and has his assistant Doctor Masters in charge. The black man Sam.She needs all the friends she can get when people die around her. "Do not Look Down The Basement" is my first horror film by SF Brownrigg. Despite his low budget, he manages to offer plenty of chills plus a lot of cheap gore, including a particularly disagreeable scene with a table spindle through an eyeball. The culmination of inmates taking control of the lunatic asylum is an intense mix of wild camera work, gore, and piercing screams.
