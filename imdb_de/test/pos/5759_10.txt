I have been a fan of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmednson ever since I can remember whether it is the young or the deepest weather. and all I have to say is that in my life I've never laughed so much !!! Guesthouse Paradiso is damn brilliant! I know it will not be for everyone (with vomiting, slapstick comedy, violence and bad language). It's not that nobody knows what sick and twisted things Rik and Ade deal with when working together !! I think it's unfair that this movie has been so hostile to critics, and I do not think I'm the only one who means that. :)
