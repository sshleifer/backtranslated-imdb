SPOILER ALERT! Do not read on, unless you are prepared for some spoilers. <br /> <br /> I think this movie had a lot under its skin. Besides the obvious links to "Oldboy" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relationship in the movie really disturbed me, as did the subtle erotic theme that surrounded all the vampiric physical activity. > The main character Kang-ho Song is great in the role of the priest Sang-hyeon - by chance, "singing" in some languages ​​means "blood" - the Tae-ju played by OK-am Kim really loved. Her relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in Badlands, where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger. <br/> <br /> Your relationship is one thing, but the girl mother is very different. As she moves, she is stiff, one-dimensional and tense, but paralyzed, she says, while she is not moving, or by winking. Park-wook has really mastered his cinematography, really, this movie and owes much to Stanley Kubrick; There are a number of beautiful shots throughout the movie, some for simple effects and some that require multiple glances and possibly repeated views to fully capture them. <br /> <br /> The music is pretty tasty, with mostly strings used being the main reaction of the thespian; It's a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is. While he does very little and loses it, he seems instead to be a person who thinks a lot. While his love interest says and does a lot, her actions show little thought behind it. IMHO. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disconcerting movie that is not intended to act and is not even in the same dimension as most things that deal with vampires these days. It's great and at the same time repellent.
