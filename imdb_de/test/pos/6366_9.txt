I agree with the comments the previous evaluator had already posted on this website. <br /> <br /> I did not come across this movie until the 1980s, when I was working in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, many of the barbs aimed at the psychiatric profession beat home. I especially liked the end when the psychiatrist spoke through the door to the hospitalized Grodin. Trust me, it's pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> Of course, most psychiatric clinics do not lock the doors, and nowadays straitjackets are often used, and every hospital MUST have a "padded room" license br /> <br /> But a wonderfully underrated one Movie and certainly one that is pretty amusing. <br /> <br /> Jeff
