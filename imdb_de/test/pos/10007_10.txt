This movie is amazing, because the fact that real people portray themselves and their life experiences and do a good job like that is almost like reliving the past. Jia Hongsheng plays himself as an actor who gives up everything except music and drugs that struggle with depression and seek the meaning of life while being angry at everyone, especially the people who interest him most. There are moments in the movie that will make you cry because the family, especially the dad, did such a good job. However, this movie is not for everyone. Many people who suffer from depression will understand Hongsheng's problem and understand why he does the things he does in a dark room, for example, or walks or bike rides alone. Others may find the movie boring because it is so real that it looks almost like a documentary. Overall, this movie is great and Hongsheng earned an Oscar for the film, as did his father.
