Australian audiences and the Australian film industry often complain that there are not enough great Aussie films or that they are all equal to other Australian films. It is unique - it will make you laugh, it will make you cry and you will feel really good. <br /> <br /> The casting of this film is excellent and acting is secondary to none. The script and the photography (color / light etc) is wonderful. But more importantly, this is a great movie. I do not want to talk about the plot because I think it's always best to watch a movie that knows as little as possible about it. Suffice to say that this film will appeal to a wide audience. Take your girlfriend, take your mother with you, take your friends with you - for a nice evening. <br /> <br /> 10/10 !!!!
