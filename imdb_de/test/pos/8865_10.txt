I'm ashamed to say it, but I have to admit that I saw the movie for the first time about a year ago. After I saw it, I immediately rushed off and bought the DVD collector's edition and have watched it several times since then. <br /> <br /> The movie is terrific on many levels. It works as a straight monster or action movie, as a horror / sci-fi and as a fascinating insight into the human psyche. The unbelievable sense of paranoia, mistrust, and anxiety lent not only to Carpenter's direction (which is astonishing), but also to the unbelievable spectacle of the cast in general. Kurt Russell is (obviously) spectacularly impenetrable in the lead role of MacReady, and as a direct result, he "feels" "like a real person" rather than an "all-American hero" in Hollywood. The other performers all carry their roles in style, and the end result is an extremely believable atmosphere and a truly fantastic movie.
