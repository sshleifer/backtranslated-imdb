This movie makes the ass, no. Bam and his cruel have done with this movie. Since I got the DVD (4 days ago), I've watched it three times and it gets better everytime I see it. I can not wait for Grind to go to the cinemas. If it's something like Haggard, it's worth it to wait. <br /> <br /> Thank you, JTcellphone
