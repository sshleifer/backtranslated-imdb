By the time this film was made, most housewives knew exactly who Barbara Stanwick was parodying. Today, probably only a few women over 50 remember Gladys Taber, whose column "Butternut Wisdom" ran in Family Circle Magazine from World War II to the 1970s She lived on the Stillmeadow Farm in Conecticut, and her columns were in a series of books like Stillmeadow Seasons, Stillmeadow Daybook etc. collected. The lines Barbara Stanwick writes for her column are typical of the typical Gladys Taber column. Apart from cooking and country life, she sometimes became quite nostalgic and philosophical. She talked a lot about her favorite dogs, mostly Cocker Spaniels. One could say that Martha Stewart is today's Gladys Tabor. <br /> <br Christmas is Connecticut may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's pleasant, carefree conversation, soothing to the stressed mind, and that's good enough
