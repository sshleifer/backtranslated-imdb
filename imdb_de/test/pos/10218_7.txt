Hellraiser Fame's Clive Barker has written and produced a fantasy horror movie that's both funny and exciting. <br /> <br /> The makeup of Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic. It took a fantasy to find these mutants who lived in the underground. It was really a pleasure to see the quality of the work. <br /> <br /> It was not terrible, since the worst creature was actually a human serial killer. <br /> <br /> I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he has also done a good job in this movie. Nothing spectacular, but fair. This was just the third movie by Anne Bobby, and she was good too. <br /> <br /> The end was spectacular and the rednecks got their desserts, as did David Cronenberg. Ha!
