Impressive! My mother bought this movie for me because it was really cheap in a shop in my city and she knows that I love creepy movies. First, I looked at the cover and sighed. I thought it was an ordinary B-movie trying to be scary. I was so wrong! I made the big mistake when I saw it alone, my parents and brother slept and it was really late. After watching the movie, I was so scared that I was shaking. I did not even dare to take the videotape out of the VCR. I slept with the light ... <br /> <br /> The main story of this film is about teenagers who drive off the streets and spend the night in the woods to tell terrifying stories ... The first story is really scary, and it really makes you hard to embrace a pillow when you look at it alone. The second story is also scary, but not in the same way as the first one. The third story (my favorite) is really scary. That scared me the most. It's about a man driving a motorcycle through the countryside. One night, when it storms outside, he goes to the next house and knocks on the door. A girl opens and she is dumb. I do not want to tell you anymore, but you'll get chills when you watch it (I could add that my heart beats were really abnormal when I watched it). The story of "Campfire Tales" has a really interesting and surprising ending. I know some people said it was crap, but me, my friend, and my friends loved it, and it was a long time since we were so scared. Rating: 10/10, oh by the way, it's NOT like Urban Legend Everything is so much scarier.
