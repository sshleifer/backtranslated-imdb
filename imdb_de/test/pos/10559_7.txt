I saw this series after Tipping the Velvet, for which I gave 10/10. I had read the user comments on that and expected an equally good series or, if possible, even a better one. At this point, I must emphasize that this series is good and has fascinated me in any case and therefore worth a look. However, I did not enjoy it as much as Tipping the Velvet for the following reasons: 1. Less passion, love and allied sexual content. There was surprisingly little accent in these elements that I included for a love story. Fingersmith felt like a watered down version of Tipping the Velvet. <br /> <br /> 2. Similar to Tipping the Velvet, the story was made up of three parts: the beginning, a shocking second part and the end. The second part should have been the high point of the story (as in Tipping the Velvet), but instead it was almost completely left out, possibly due to the inability to produce shocking but credible asylum content. The series should consist of three parts and contain two cliffhanger, with the second part was much more in focus. <br /> <br /> 3. Almost did not pay attention to what Fingersmiths were and how it affected their personality. I found it rather annoying that the series did not address this central issue properly. <br /> <br /> 4. The end was much more premature than Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith has left some interesting action lines open. Despite these shortcomings, Fingersmith is a good series and worth 7/10. However, it is not a classic like Tipping the Velvet.
