I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a festival last year, half expecting there would be a release. The fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has certainly hampered its success, but as I understand it, the filmmaker was never used to making it look like a movie in the first place, it was more about the characters' story and their relationships Is not that what movies are about ?! But it has a quality in the texture of its visual appearance, suggesting that May Thomas is something to watch out for. Independent filmmakers and producers who have the talent and lack the money and motivation can learn a lot from watching this movie. Technically, everything, the use of light, music, etc., has by far the most of anybody. I've seen other digital movies I've ever seen, so it's worth a lot of praise. The performances of the actors are credible to a certain extent, although not too little was played. I felt there was more in it, more depth, especially from the male lead John Paul Clarke. But what really bothers me as a filmmaker is that the film in black and white needs to cover up a lot of sins, as if it were color. Do we have more to learn in the advancement of digital technology? Or is this the future of wonderful, affordable filmmaking?
