The first Disney animated film without the strong involvement of Disney itself. This film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (this is, I think, the only animated Disney movie since the 1940s) that NOT based on an earlier book or other work, but is more of an original story). As already mentioned, the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in Lady and the Tramp and the story of the abduction / travel home of the 101 Dalmatians. <br /> <br /> But to overcome this mistake, the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the Disney animated films of the last 10 to 15 years: Phil Harris (from the Jungle Book), who pronounces one of the main characters , follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous film with another one here with Scatman Crothers. The high-quality visual look of this film is practically taken over by "Dalmatians" (with a few nice allusions to French Impressionism, it seems), and the bad guy here (the butler) is reminiscent of the henchmen in this movie. (This is probably one of Disney's least memorable villains.) The main story goes back and forth between the cats and the butler's continuing difficulties with two rural hounds (with great vocal work by Pat Buttram and George "Goober" Lindsey ") Animal figures are similarly familiar to those who have seen "Tramp" and "Dalmatian." Although the cat owner has a striking visual resemblance to the evil stepmother in Sleeping Beauty sleep, he does not wear the unpleasant features of this character very warm and generous. <br /> <br /> The film's real strength lies in the voice work: After first introducing himself to the most well-known actors in the jungle book, the tactics are here with the Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway of The Jungle Book and Eva Gabor (the later Movie The Rescuers would play a very similar role) as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp. Everyone here is excellent, especially Harris and Gabor in the main role ation is as outstanding as you would imagine and shows a variety of emotions. <br /> <br /> Smaller children may be annoyed by a few brief episodes (escape from the path of a raging train, almost drowning) of one of the children), but these are not particularly frightening or darkly portrayed and are over very quickly. Overall, there are hardly any scary scenes that can be found in many other Disney classics. <br /> <br /> A little weirdness is the way some visual aspects of the 1960s culture are portrayed among the jazz cats in supposedly 1910 Paris; It is not surprising why history has not been solidly set in the present, apart from the great price which Paris had greatly changed in the meantime. That would have made more sense. <br /> <br /> The songs are pleasant and sometimes very enjoyable, but not very memorable. Nonetheless, the overall energy used here, the excellent language work and the good animation contribute to overcoming the relatively few and minor weaknesses. Far from the size of classic "10's", like Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not quite the "9's" that you could give Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, this is probably a marginal 8 out of 10; maybe a 7.
