I'm glad I'm not the only one who likes this show very well. This is the best series for young ladies! I have a funny taste for comedy and it's so hard for me to enjoy my intelligence, and I'm so happy that their humor is exactly what I need. Love the gang of actors! If anyone knows a series or just a movie that resembles this, I say, please write back because I miss the series. <br /> <br /> And ask the writers and producers to CONTINUE, even though the actors are all grown up now, I guess! <br /> <br /> I wish you a nice morning / day / evening / night! (because I do not know exactly when you will read this post)
