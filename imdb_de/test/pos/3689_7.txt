"Unconditional love" starts with great promise. Directed by P. J. Hogan, the film works great until the last third of the movie and falls flat on his face. The screenplay, written by Mr. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse, showed a variety of possibilities that hiss in the end. It seems that the artistic team behind the film had high hopes to play differently. The reality is that this is a film that looks in different directions, how it can achieve a resolution that ultimately fails. Do not get me wrong, the movie is hugely appealing and will connect with many viewers. <br /> <br /> Due to the strong cast, we decided to take a look. The hugely talented Kathy Bates is the perfect choice to play Grace Beasley, the woman who realizes at the beginning of the movie that everything is not good in her marriage. Ms. Bates is an excellent actress who has earned much better, although her character is not helped by what the writers do in the movie. Rupert Everett is always reliable. His role as lover of the late Victor Fox is well written, that is, until Dirk is lured to Chicago to find Victor's killer. It is bizarre and contradicts all rules of logic. Dirk does not seem to be able to hurt a fly, let alone hunt down a killer with the help of Grace and her daughter-in-law, the incredibly funny Maudey. <br /> <br /> As played by Meredith Eaton. This little woman, Maudey, is one of the best things in the movie. She is naughty and says so when she sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best actors working in films these days, has nothing to do with the picture; he is totally wasted. Dan Aykroyd has nothing to do either. We see him at the beginning and at the end of the film and his Max does not make sense. He seems to want changes in his life and marriage, only to explain without explanation, forgiving everything. <br /> <br /> The English actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better chance than the hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is heard throughout the movie as a ghost singing lukeier songs. Julie Andrews adds a funny post in some invaluable scenes. <br /> <br /> Finally, the TV show hosted by Sally Jesse Raphael is off and does not add anything to the movie. The best part is listening to Kathy Bates sing. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact, Mrs. Bates is the best excuse to stay until the end.
