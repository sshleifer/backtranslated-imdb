I love movies that bring you into her. A movie that makes you feel really weak when it's over, and this kind of movie is rare. <br /> <br /> Damian is as talented and versatile in as many ways as he writes and portrays different characters on screen. This movie is up to date. A mainstream for such a low budget. Why is it that a man with so much talent and charisma (not to mention that sex appeal goes beyond most other actors) can do so with so little money to work with it ????? These actors really believe in his screenplay and raw talent as a director, screenwriter and actor. I am so pleased to know that such a modern genius is out there today. It is passion for art to let it drive and to take us as an audience. Damian, I have heard of you from so many different circles and do not let the jealous people of this world come to you. Martin gets that, Fellini has it and you will always get it. The fire and the passion in you we like to see on the screen. Thank you for being different and having the courage to write as you do. You are a unique director, do not listen to the empty vessels.
