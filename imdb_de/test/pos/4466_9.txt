I get curious when I hear about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he is classified as a non-talented filmmaker just to shock and disgust the entire audience with images of pure blood. Although his films contain more explicit dirt and disease than your average American mainstream production, his films are always very diverse and the actions are cruelly pathological. Do not torture a duckling is another story! This movie is a pure jewel of Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this movie a masterpiece. It's an old-fashioned giallo that contains all the genius aspects of real horror. The film shows the search for an inhumane serial killer in a small Italian mountain town. The bodies of 3 boys are found terribly mutilated. There are quite a few pseudo-crazed people in the city, but every path leads to nothing. Among the suspects are a greedy bum and a sinister woman obsessed with witchcraft and voodoo. Like a true mastermind, Fulci knows that he finds the right scary sound for his movie. He portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and unmissable backdrop of macabre events, supported by a dizzying soundtrack. Here Fulci also develops as a genius storyteller. The script is always one step ahead of you, and the complex plot leads you more than once astray. In other words, this is a unique giallo (horror slash thriller). The Gore is not as grotesquely and explicitly portrayed as in the later milestones of Lucio (including the legendary Zombie 2, The Beyond and the New York Ripper), although still some hideous and hard-to-observe shock sequences are shown. <br /> <br /> Do not torture a duckling. This is the most compelling and effective achievement Lucio Fulci has ever produced, and it is one of the biggest Italian horror films ever made. Right next to the masterpieces of Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The film is fascinating from beginning to end, some action aspects are terrifyingly realistic and the tension is always adrenaline rush! A must for horror fans and absolute priority for Italian shock lovers!
