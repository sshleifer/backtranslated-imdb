My taste in movies still amazes me and definitely upsets readers who read my reviews, and I have a flaw for crazy horror, slasher movies and See No Evil. I think the biggest mistake of the producers and filmmakers of this movie is that they are hype as a WWE movie and play "KANE" with the lead roles. WWE may have a large fan base, but it's a very, very specific group that follows the unbelievably cheesy and (sorry people) nature of the trailer "sport" and those who do not love it, HAATTTE IT !! By doing so, they would elude an otherwise typical bloody Slasher movie that people would come out in droves to see. See no one malicious breaks through any new horror floor, it's just that for any typical horror with some exaggerated, horrible bloody scenes that truly make your screen crawl. They really drive it home and expose themselves to unauthorized violence. There is no psychological aspect, although it is hunted by this monster that it has some anxiety elements. KANE (The Wrestler), also known as Glen Jacobs, plays the religiously and physically tortured man Jacob Goodnight. He is the ultimate cross between Leatherface and Jason Voorhees. He is not an original killer, and even his kills do not really focus on the unique or original, except that a girl is suffocated by being forced to swallow her phone ... yeeeeah !! He does a good job and the man is legit. He is 7 meters tall and without any special effects is outrageous !! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal and Rachael Taylor all play the typical group "I think they are invincible" and celebrate the teens who involuntarily become victims of the serial killer. The story goes that in return for one month of imprisonment for minor crimes ranging from theft to possession of drugs, they are sent to an old hotel to perform "community service" by regulating it. It turns out that a serial killer lives upstairs and he removes the eyes of his victims to rid them of their sins. Luke Pegler is a scumbag who eventually turns into a hero and even saves his ex-girlfriend, whom he used to beat up with. The rest of them are all pretty good at their perspective, but it's not a great acting ability. Sad porn director ... yes PORN ... Gregory Dark, good work together makes the modern Slasherfilm. He even goes down in history with the killer, and while his background story is not unique, it's actually a bit old-fashioned, but interesting enough. And in the few shots in which the film visitor actually sees through the eyes of the murderer, it is interesting to hear the voices and see distorted things. He throws in the obligatory softcore nude shot and the grotesque, blood-soaked scenes and turns it all on. It fits well and entertaining for a horror fan like me. Kanes serial killer is terrible and he pursues her with brutal intelligence and a silent horror. The movie gets scrapped and crappy, and I do not blame anyone for being shitty, but is not that the point? It's a horror movie and I thought it was exactly what it should be. I had to jump, it made me jump, I even had to turn away in several places ... impressive for any standard. It's entertaining, with a decent storyline and a lot of settings to serialize See No Evil until the 15th installment if they wanted and I say bring it up !! It's true, the movie is full of storylines and ridiculous details, but the deadly hustle and bustle overruns everything. It all depends on you love horror movies? Really love her? If so, then you will think that this is a terrific slasher ... if not, then you will hate it ... plain and simple. 8.5 / 10
