In my opinion, the film is an excellent example of the realities of the war and a tribute to the soldiers of all nations who have fought Gallipoli and bled to the ground. The lack of violence in no way affected the size of the present story. It is honest, true and courageous, just like the men who fought at the Hellespont and died. The absence of brutal violence is justified. These men had enough for freedom, freedom and the right to self-determination in a free and better world. They never wanted to see such scenes again. This is the legacy of the Gallipoli event. It is best to suffer the scene of unpaid pyrotechnics and blood and blood to uphold respect for the fighters of this nation's melting pot. This film stands in the glory of the men who fight for them, living with honor, courage, dignity and irrepressible spirit and humor in the face of dire adversities. This movie is not interested in making a show for fools. The brutal results of these personal struggles of these men are nothing the survivors ever wanted to see on a screen for entertainment. They saw enough of it back then and would rather have never seen it at the beginning and never wanted to watch such scenes again on a screen in the name of "entertainment". The brutal horrors of the timeliness of the vicious struggle that took place in Gallipoli were scenes that chased their waking and sleeping hours for the rest of their natural days. It was the painful inner scars that carried them, the men of all nations who fought, into their graves. They all fought, and many died in the face of it, and somehow they managed to make these powerful men laugh in constant fear because they would not offend their comrades because they were not ready to die beside them. This is Australasian for brave, the game is it, but that was more or less true for all fighters, but the boy's statement was that Johhny Turk was a game as brave as you would want it to be for a soldier , <br /> <br /> ANZACs and Turks struggled to establish their place on the world stage, and by 4/25/15, their respective claims to equality in the nation became known and indisputable to this world. The director has created a masterpiece that truly honors the spirit and memory of these soldiers and reminds them of future generations of all ages, because children can be attacked without fear of fright for fear of visual "horror" and their morbid senseless calling. Children should take part in this film to find out what happened on this sacred shore before their birth. So that they can remember. For it is the nature of the people they soon forget.
