As with all Haneke films, make your own decision. Do not let yourself be influenced by what you read. If you are interested in someone who uses the medium of film for their own unique purposes, you will see it for themselves. Isabelle Huppert is stunning in this film - together with Haneke, these two never go out. Haneke captivates us with the lure of golden boy Benoit Magimel, but this is an anti-romance effect as Funny Games was an anti-thriller. You have to force yourself to see a lot of it, and the catharsis is much more in the area of ​​lingering anxiety than any kind of emotional release, but it's incredibly nervous and thought-provoking. Haneke continues to present a mirror of what desensitized western civilization is or is. People may turn up their noses, but what Solondz did in luck just takes a few steps. Much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be considered as an emotional metaphor. I do not recommend it, but I would not stop you ... it definitely separates people, but given the fact that it's mostly about oppression, that's no surprise.
