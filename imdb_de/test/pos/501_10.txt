This movie is great! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with sheer class. He kicks his ass so fluidly and violently that Bruce Lee would be proud of it. The movie is a fast paced action and great stunts. The first and last action scene is superb and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he walks around wiping away all the fools. The script is pretty good and there is also a sharp dialogue. Wesley should have done more action movies than he has, I know he's a very good actor. In that he is less stretched than in his more comic or drama roles, but as far as action stars are concerned, he is the best actor of all of them, coming close only to Bruce Willis, Stallone, and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star). Just as Wesley quality is, Steven Dorff is also very good as a villain. It was an unexpected surprise that a low-ranking person should be threatening to Snipes, but he does. Overall, the film is sharp, stylish and I hope the sequal will be made at the same pace.
