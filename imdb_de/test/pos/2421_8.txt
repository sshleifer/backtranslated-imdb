Growing up as a child of the film, one of the trilogies I will not forget so quickly is the Karate Kid. You can lose Ralph / Daniel as often as you want, but it's the message behind the films that is important, that it's important to have respect for all creatures big and small, but to stand up for yourself when there's time is. Back to the movie, it's pretty funny because I saw Boys Do not Cry and was really impressed with the performance of Hillary Swank. The other day, as I was leafing through the ocean of canals, I came across the screening of this film and I did not realize on my first visit to the movie that she was there. The story revolves around Julie, as does Daniel. They do not know where to place them, or if they want to fit at all, and the Master Teacher is brought in to help them set them up and guide them. I really liked this addition to the series because it gave the story a good female side and yes, even some outfits in which Hillary was, stopped me, we should say, excitedly
