It's always nice to see a movie that teaches us about African history because it's definitely not enough. However, the film shows Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist ... I felt it was hard to sympathize with this kind of leadership, but the film is a kind of homage to the man. There was too little content to explain how the man could even be resurrected and the whole context of Belgium "who let her go". It's certainly worth a visit, as acting and photography are excellent, especially Mobutu itself. I would have wished for a better political analysis.
