Also, I found "Oppenheimer" as a brilliant series and one of the best deals ever recorded in the American PBS. David Suchet was as effective as Edward Teller, as I recall, and the overall concept was spectacularly good. The only reason the series does not achieve a full 10/10 result is due to low production levels in some areas. The actual content is absolutely top notch in my memory. <br /> <br /> The Oppenheimer Miniserie will be released in the UK on the 31st of July! It will be a Region 2 / PAL set, but it seems that a Region 1 / NTSC set should be available shortly. <br /> <br /> If you have a universal player in the US, you can order the series now from Amazon UK. <br /> <br /> http://tinyurl.com/znyyq <br /> <br /> Huzzah !!
