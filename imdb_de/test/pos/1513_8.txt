"Un Gatto nel Cervello" / "Cat in the Brain" is one of the hottest horror movies ever made. There is plenty of blood and blood, including butchery with chainsaws, bloody stings and numerous decapitations. The film is also interesting as a "self" parody of Fulci, but the Gore and the violence is the key element in it.Some of the Gore FX were from their own Fulci films "Quando Alice Ruppe lo Specchio" and "I Fantasmi di Sodoma" (both 1988) plus Gore FX taken from Fulci-supervised "The Snake House", also known as "Bloody Psycho" by Leandro Lucchetti, "Massacre" by Andrea Bianchi, "Paura Della Zia Marta" by Mario Bianchi, "Non Si Sevizia i Bambini "by Giovanni Simonelli and" Luna di Sangue "aka" Fuga dalla Morte "by Enzo Milioni (all 1989) The scene in which Brett Halsey beats the woman face to face comes from" Quando Alice Ruppe lo Specchio ", a film that Fulci filmed for Italian TV in 1988. Chainsawing of the female corpse in the beginning comes from the same movie, as well as the head in the microwave and the type It is kept going, highly recommended, especially if you like extreme cinema!
