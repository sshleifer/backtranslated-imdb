Forget the plot of this movie. Forget the fact that it is played wonderfully by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget the fact that it's one of the few films starring Jennifer Lopez. Although the story is impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems to have been made, the only important thing to consider when watching this film is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing images ever shown in the film. It's as if Salvador Dali had decided to do a drama. A must for anyone who is genuinely interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a canvas to showcase true works of fine art. I would have to give this movie a 9/10 as it is an amazing visual ad.
