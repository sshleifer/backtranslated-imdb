When I saw this movie when I was a kid, I did not understand the premise of the Hitchcock movies and the dark comedy. Well, since I'm in my mid-20s, that makes a lot more sense. <br /> <br /> I think the reason why I like this movie so much is that the comedy duo Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito is an interesting comedy both slapstick (the pan and car scenes) and verbal (the Arguments / talks about murder and writing). <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Larry Donner (Crystal), a struggling writer who stole his masterpiece from him by his wife Margaret (played by a surprisingly bright Kate Mulgrew, aka Capt. Janeway of Star Trek : Voyager). <br /> <br /> As he switches between writer's block and creative writing lessons, he encounters Owen Lifts (DeVito), an up-and-coming writer and overgrown mother-son who still sadly behaves like a child. He has toy train tracks, do I have to say more? Think of failure, only Matt McConaughey is short, fat and bald. Owen sits in his own life and has a demanding bad mother (Anne Ramsey) whom he does not like. He's looking for Larry's advice on how to get out of it, and when he says he's supposed to watch a movie by Hitchcock, Owen gets the wrong idea that if he kills Larry's wife, he'll return the favor and kill his mother for him. Hilarity arises as the two try to deal with the other's problem. Owen goes to extremes to kill Margaret, while Larry, who does not agree to do his "part of the plan," goes crazy with Owen's mother. Throughout the film, Larry and Owen are slowly but surely establishing a friendly bond that is rare in the dark comedy these days. Part of the movie I really loved was the place where Owen Larry shows his coin collection, and he says it's more of a sentimental collection than anything else. <br /> <br /> Apart from the two main stars, the late Anne Ramsey is so funny mom and deadly with her stick. She is much verbally and physically funny in this regard, as opposed to her role as Mama Fratelli of The Goonies. So she curses like a sailor and revolts her son at every turn, but that makes her character so alive. She makes her character a person you hate the most. <br /> <br /> Another treat in this film is the music of the great jazz Brandford Marsalis, who plays Larry's neighbor and friend Lester. There is a great moment in the movie in which he plays jazz for Larry, who is depressed and needs some good melodies to relieve the pain. Jazz can do that. <br /> <br /> Finally, I wish Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito were going to do a good movie together, but their age is getting too old for the game, I'm sorry to say. This is one of those rare movies in which both stars shine in their subtle way. DeVito's childish comedy and Crystal's sharp joke made this movie for me. 5 stars comedy.
