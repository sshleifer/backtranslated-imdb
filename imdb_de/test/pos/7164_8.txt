I originally saw this movie as a blockbuster VHS rental. That was a long time ago, but I still remembered it. Blockbuster does not have it anymore. Netflix did not have it and there were not many copies on the web - just a few costly VHS copies. Recently, I finally found it in DVD form on eBay for a reasonable price (in PAL format, but our DVD player plays PAL discs on our NTSC TV). <br /> <br /> Wife and I both enjoyed it a lot. The style of the film is a bit strong, and many, if not most, parts are pretty heavily dubbed as though amateurs (especially the kids) would do it, but that's not annoying. The opposites of the companies are accentuated by the overplay. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of political preaching about the statement that young people in Russia should not try to escape their not so big life, but should do so at least try to make it better first. That is not dominant. It's pretty funny most of the time. <br /> <br /> Some downplaying of the West commented on by others is not that at all, IMO, I take it as a comment on the expectations of the Russian characters. At least from my Western point of view. Maybe it's a downplay of the West from the Russian point of view (which is literally said by the characters). <br /> <br /> I can not say how literally the English subtitles are for the movie, but I can say that the subtitles were very well done, full of English idioms like those of a native English speaker - complete with "colorful "Language.
