Aunt Cora had always been tactless, and her well-bred family ignored the remark she made after the funeral of her brother Richard: "He was murdered, right?" They remembered it the next day, when Cora was brutally found with a hatchet ... <br /> <br /> For some reason, the POIROT films were anything but original this year. I was disappointed with the changes in CARDS ON THE TABLE - my favorite Poirot book. AFTER THE FUNERAL is my 2nd favorite book by Poirot, and I was afraid the story would be destroyed. It was not The film was almost true to the page, according to the motive of the murderer! All the actors were wonderful, but my favorite must be Monica Dolan, who performs excellently as Miss Gilchrist, the companion of the late Aunt Cora. Without a doubt the best Poirot movie of all time!
