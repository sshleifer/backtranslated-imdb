I think it's great one of my favorite movies as a kid, and they said their songs were memorable. They were mint. I still remember her. WORD FOR WORD The film remains a favorite with my family, and my younger cousins ​​are now addicted to it. You even know that the movie is great and a fun movie for kids. He has a moral lesson. So do not say that this is not good, because it shows that lying does not leave you sick anywhere with a farewell commentary: This movie is unbelievable, love me xxx Ps I want the soundtrack, but I can not and the animation is good. The jokes are funny and the action never stops. This film will go down in childrens movie history and, in my opinion, one of the few still safe films showing children.
